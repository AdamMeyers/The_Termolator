INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to make clear the biological relationships
between the shrews of the Sorex vagrans-obscurus "species
group." This group as defined by H. H. T. Jackson (1928:101)
included the species Sorex vagrans, S. obscurus, S. pacificus, S.
yaquinae, and S. durangae. The last mentioned species has been
shown (Findley, 1955:617) to belong to another species group.
Sorex milleri, also assigned to this group by Jackson (1947:131),
seems to have its affinities with the cinereus group as will be explained
beyond. The position of the vagrans group in relationship
to other members of the genus will be discussed.

Of this group, the species that was named first was Sorex vagrans
Baird, 1858. Subsequently many other names were based on members
of the group and these names were excellently organized by
Jackson in his 1928 revision of the genus. Subsequent students of
western mammals, nevertheless, have been puzzled by such problems
as the relationship of (1) Sorex vagrans monticola to Sorex
obscurus obscurus in the Rocky Mountains, (2) Sorex pacificus, S.
yaquinae, and S. obscurus to one another on the Pacific Coast, and
(3) S. o. obscurus to S. v. amoenus in California. Few studies have
been made of these relationships. Clothier (1950) studied S. v.
monticola and S. o. obscurus in western Montana and concluded that
the two supposed kinds actually were not separable in that area.
Durrant (1952:33) was able to separate the two kinds in Utah as
was Hall (1946:119, 122) in Nevada. Other mammalogists who
worked within the range of the vagrans-obscurus groups have
avoided the problems in one way or another. Recently Rudd (1953)
has examined the relationships of S. vagrans to S. ornatus.




MATERIALS METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Approximately 3,465 museum study skins and skulls were studied. Most
of these were assembled at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History,
but some were examined in other institutions.

Specimens were grouped by geographic origin, age, and sex. Studies of
the role of age and sex in variation were made. Because it was discovered
that secondary sexual variation was negligible, both males and females, if of
like age and pelage, were used in comparisons designed to reveal geographic
variation.

External measurements used were total length, length of tail, and length of
hind foot. After studying a number of cranial dimensions I chose those listed
below as the most useful in showing differences in size and proportions of the
skull. Figures 1 and 2 show the points between which those measurements
were taken.

[Pg 5]
Condylobasal length.       From anteriormost projection of the premaxillae to posteriormost
projection of the occipital condyles (a to a      ).

Maxillary tooth-row.       From posteriormost extension of M3 to anteriormost extension
of first unicuspid (b to b      ).

Palatal length.       From anteriormost projection of premaxillae to posteriormost
part of bony palate (c to c      ).

Cranial breadth.       Greatest lateral diameter of braincase (d to d      ).

Least interorbital breadth.       Distance between medialmost superior edges of
orbital fossae, measured between points immediately above and behind
posterior openings of infraorbital foramina (e to e      ).

Maxillary breadth.       Distance between lateral tips of maxillary processes
(f to f      ).

  measurements were taken.        3      . (Based on

In descriptions of color, capitalized terms refer to those in Ridgway (1912).
In addition the numerical and alphabetical designations of these terms are given
since a knowledge of the arrangements of these designations enables one quickly
to evaluate differences between stated colors. Color terms which are not
capitalized do not refer to any precise standard of color nomenclature.

In the accounts of subspecies, descriptions, unless otherwise noted, are of
first year animals as herein defined. Descriptions of color are based on fresh
pelages.

In nature, the subspecies of Sorex vagrans form a cline and are distributed
geographically in a chain which is bent back upon itself. The subspecies in
the following accounts are listed in order from the southwestern end of the
chain clockwise back to the zone of overlap.

The synonymy of each subspecies includes the earliest available name and
other names in chronological order. These include the first usage of the name
combination employed by me and other name combinations that have been
applied to the subspecies concerned.

In the lists of specimens examined, localities are arranged first by state or
province. These are listed in tiers from north to south and in any given tier
from west to east. Within a given state, localities are grouped by counties,
which are listed in the same geographic sequence as were the states and
provinces (N to S and W to E). Within a given county, localities are arranged
from north to south. If two or more localities are at the same latitude the
westernmost is listed first. Marginal localities are listed in a separate paragraph
at the end of each account. The northernmost marginal locality is listed first
and the rest follow in clockwise order. Those records followed by a citation to
an authority are of specimens which I have not personally examined. Marginal
records are shown by dots on the range maps. Marginal records which cannot
be shown on the maps because of undue crowding are listed in Italic type.

To persons in charge of the collections listed above I am deeply indebted.
Without their generous cooperation in allowing me to examine specimens in
their care this study would not have been possible. Appreciated suggestions
in the course of the work have been received from Professors Rollin H. Baker,
A. Byron Leonard, R. C. Moore, Robert W. Wilson, and H. B. Tordoff, and
many of my fellow students. Mr. Victor Hogg gave helpful suggestions on the
preparation of the illustrations. My wife, Muriel Findley, devoted many hours
[Pg 7]
to secretarial work and typing of manuscript. Finally I am grateful to Professor
E. Raymond Hall for guidance in the study and for assistance in preparing the
manuscript. During the course of the study I received support from the
University of Kansas Endowment Association, from the Office of Naval Research,
and from the National Science Foundation.




NON-GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION

Non-geographic variation, that is to say, variation within a single
population of shrews, consists of variation owing to age and normal
individual variation. In Sorex I have detected no significant secondary
sexual differences between males and females; accordingly
the two sexes are here considered together.

Variation with age must be considered in order to assemble
comparable samples of these shrews. Increased age results in wear
on all teeth and in particularly striking changes in the size and shape
of the first incisors. Skulls of older shrews develop sagittal and
lambdoidal ridges, and further differ from skulls of young animals
in being slightly broader and shorter, and in developing thicker
bone, particularly on the rostrum which thus seems to be, but is
not always in fact, more robust. Pruitt has recently (1954) noted
these same cranial differences in specimens of Sorex cinereus of
different ages.

Several students of American shrews, notably Pearson (1945)
on Blarina, Hamilton (1940) on Sorex fumeus, and Conaway (1952)
on Sorex palustris, have shown that young are born in spring and
summer, usually reach sexual maturity the following spring, and
rarely survive through, or even to, a second winter. The result is
that collections made, as most of them are, in spring and summer,
contain two age classes, first year and second year animals. These
two age classes are readily separable on the basis of differences in
the skull as well as on the decreased pubescence of the tail and the
increased weight of second year animals. My own examination of
hundreds of museum specimens confirms this for the Sorex vagrans
group. Separation of the two age classes in an August-taken series
of Sorex vagrans from coastal Washington is shown in figure 3, in
which two tooth-measurements that are dependent upon wear are
plotted against one another.

First year animals are more abundant in collections than are
second year animals. Within the first year, that is to say from spring
to late fall, animals vary but little. Dental characters are best
studied in first year shews. For this reason I have used them as the
basis for the study of geographic variation, and descriptions are
based on first year animals unless otherwise noted.



[Pg 8]


CHARACTERS OF TAXONOMIC WORTH

Within the Sorex vagrans complex, the only characters of taxonomic
significance that I have detected are in size and color. It is
true that cranial proportions, such as relative size of rostrum, may
change from population to population, but these proportions seem
to me to be dependent upon actual size of the individual shrew as
I shall elsewhere point out. Of the cranial measurements here
employed, palatal length and least interorbital breadth are the most
significant and useful. Color in the S. vagrans group seems to be
in Orange and Cadmium Yellow, colors 15 and 17 of Ridgway
(1912). No specimens actually possess these pure colors, but most
colors in these shrews are seen to be derived from the two mentioned
by admixture of black and/or neutral gray. In color designations
an increase in neutral gray is indicated by an increased number of
prime signs (                  ), whereas increase in black is indicated by progressive
characters of the Roman alphabet (i, k, m). Thus, 17            k is grayer
than 17      k and 17            m is blacker than 17            k. In subspecific diagnoses in
this report, color and size, and sometimes relative size, are the
characters usually mentioned.

  year individuals of Sorex vagrans vagrans, all taken in August at
  Willapa Bay, Washington, are completely separated. Open circles represent
  teeth of second year shrews; solid circles represent teeth of first year
  shrews.



[Pg 9]


PELAGE CHANGE

In general, winter pelage is darker than summer pelage in these
shrews. Winter pelage comes in first on the rump and spreads
caudad and ventrad. The growth line of incoming hair is easily
detected on the fur side of the skin. Throughout the winter the
color of the pelage changes, often becoming somewhat browner,
although no actual molt takes place. This was noted by Dalquest
(1944) who assumed that the color change resulted from molt
although he was unable to detect actual replacement of hairs.
Summer pelage usually comes in first on the back or head and moves
posteriorly and laterally. Time of molt depends on latitude and
altitude. Summer pelage may appear fairly late in the season and
may account for the anomalous midsummer molt noted by Dalquest.
Fresh pelages of summer and winter are best seen in first year
animals and are less variable than are worn pelages and hence are
used as the basis of color descriptions.




GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION



Pacific Coastal Section

The largest shrews of the vagrans group (large in all dimensions)
occur in the coastal forests of northern California and of Oregon.
Those shrews are reddish, large-skulled, large-toothed, and have
rostra that are large in proportion to the size of the skull as a whole.
The very largest of these shrews live along the coast of northwestern
California. To the southward they are somewhat smaller, and at successively
more northern localities, to as far as southwestern British
Columbia, they are likewise progressively smaller and also somewhat
less reddish. The relative size of the rostrum decreases with
the decrease in size of the skull; consequently smaller shrews have
relatively smaller rostra (see fig. 4). In addition the zygomatic
ridge of the squamosal decreases in relative size with decrease in
actual size of the skull. Thus, these features change in a clinal
fashion as one proceeds from, say, Humboldt County, California,
northward to Astoria, Oregon.

Turning our attention now farther inland to the Cascade Mountains
of northern Oregon, the shrews there also are smaller and less
reddish (more brownish) than in northwestern California, and the
trend to smaller and darker shrews culminates in the northern
Cascades of Washington. Shrews from there, and from the southwestern
coast of British Columbia, compared with those from
northwestern California, are much smaller and have so great a suffusion
of black that they appear brown rather than red. At places
[Pg 10]
along the coast successively farther north of southwestern British
Columbia the shrews become larger again, the largest individuals
being those from near Wrangell, Alaska. From that place northwesterly
along the coast of Alaska, size decreases again.





  Fig. 4. Condylobasal length (in millimeters)
  plotted against palatal index (palatal length/condylobasal length        100)
  in several subspecies of Sorex vagrans to show relative increase
  in size of rostrum with actual increase in size of skull.



The shrews so far discussed inhabit forests in a region of high
rainfall and a minimum of seasonal fluctuation in temperature. Such
a habitat seems to be the optimum for shrews of the vagrans group
since the largest individuals are found there. In addition, shrews
seem to be as common, or commoner, in this coastal belt, than they
are in other places.

The large shrews of the vagrans group on the Pacific coast were
divided into three species by H. H. T. Jackson in his revision of the
North American Sorex in 1928. The large reddish shrews of the
coast of California and southern Oregon were called S. pacificus.
The somewhat smaller ones from the coast of central Oregon were
called S. yaquinae. Still smaller shrews from northwestern Oregon
and from the rest of the Pacific coast north into Alaska were called
S. obscurus. I find these kinds to intergrade continuously one with
the next in the manner described and conclude that all are of a
single species.

[Pg 11]

Inland Montane Section

Inland from the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska the size
of the vagrans shrew decreases rapidly. Specimens from western
Alaska, central Alaska, and the interior of British Columbia are
uniformly smaller than coastal specimens. In addition the red of
the hair is masked more by neutral gray than by black with the
result that the pelage is grayish rather than brownish or reddish.
Shrews of this general appearance are found southward through the
Rocky Mountain chain to Colorado and New Mexico. On the more
or less isolated mountain ranges of Montana east of the continental
divide the vagrans shrew is somewhat smaller still. On the Sacramento
Mountains of southeastern New Mexico the shrew is somewhat
larger and slightly darker. Southwestward from the Colorado
Rockies this shrew becomes smaller and slightly more reddish (less
grayish).

All of these montane populations of the vagrans shrew are commonest
in hydrosere communities, that is to say, streamsides and
marshy areas where the predominant vegetation is grass, sedges,
willows, and alders. Since these animals are less common within
the montane forests, hydrosere communities, rather than the actual
forest, seem to be the positive feature important for the shrews.

The shrews of the montane region just described were regarded
by Jackson as belonging to two species: Sorex obscurus, occupying
all the Rocky Mountains south to, and including, the Sacramento
Mountains; S. vagrans, made up of small individuals from various
places in Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado, and all the shrews of
western New Mexico and all of Arizona. My study of these animals
has led me to conclude that the smaller shrews of Arizona and New
Mexico intergrade in a clinal fashion with the shrews of Colorado
and in fact represent but one species. Since some individuals from
Colorado are as small as larger individuals from this southwestern
population of small animals, I conclude that such specimens are
the basis for reports of S. vagrans from Colorado. The shrews of
the Sacramento Mountains resemble those of the Colorado Rockies
more than they do the smaller shrews of western New Mexico and
Arizona, possibly because the climate is similar in the Sacramento
Mountains and the higher Colorado Rockies. There is less precipitation
in the more western mountain ranges in New Mexico and in
Arizona in April, May, and June than in the Colorado Rockies.
These months are critical for the reproduction and growth of shrews.

[Pg 12]
As mentioned above, the shrews from east of the continental divide
in Montana are smaller than those of the other mountains of the
state, and it is upon such small animals that the name Sorex vagrans
has been based in this area. It is clear, however, that these smaller
animals intergrade with the larger shrews of the more western
mountains. The small size might be an adaptation to the lesser
precipitation and harsher continental climate east of the continental
divide in Montana.


Great Basin and Columbia Plateau Section

The vagrant shrews of the Great Basin and adjoining Columbia
Plateau and Snake River Plains are smaller than their relatives in
the Rocky Mountains and, by virtue of less gray in their pelage,
are reddish in summer and blackish rather than grayish in winter.
There is little significant geographic variation in shrews throughout
this region, although owing to their restriction to the vicinity of
water, the populations of shrews are more or less isolated from one
another and each is somewhat different from the next. Those from
nearest the Rockies are sometimes slightly larger and those from
some places in Nevada are slightly paler than the average. This small
reddish shrew is found all the way to the Pacific coast of California,
Oregon, and Washington. In these coastal areas it is somewhat
darker and sometimes a trifle larger than elsewhere. It intergrades
with a somewhat larger, grayer shrew in the Sierra Nevada of
California. Along the Wasatch front in Utah, this Great Basin shrew
intergrades with the larger, grayer shrew of the Rockies. Owing
to the abrupt change in elevation, the zone of intergradation is
rather narrow horizontally. In the latitude of Salt Lake City,
populations of intergrades occur at between 8,700 and 9,000 feet
elevation. The lowland shrew occurs in the eastern part of the Snake
River Plains, and along the valleys of the Bear and Salt rivers into
Wyoming. Along the northern edge of the Snake River Plains and
on the western edge of the mountains of central Idaho the transition
from lowland to montane habitats is abrupt and in consequence the
zone of contact between small and large shrews is narrow. In
northern Idaho and northwestern Montana the transition from lowland
to highland is more gradual. Tributaries of the Columbia
River system, especially the Clark Fork, provide a path for movement
of lowland forms into intermontane basins of western Montana.
In addition, the vegetational zones are found at lower elevations,
and there are boreal forests in the lowlands rather than only in
[Pg 13]
the mountains as is the case in Utah and Colorado. In this area,
therefore, the zone of intergradation between the smaller lowland
shrew and the larger montane shrew is more gradual and gradually
intergrading populations are found over a relatively large area.
This has been well demonstrated for northwestern Montana by
Clothier (1950). In southern British Columbia and northern Washington
this shrew in the mountains is large and in the intermontane
valleys is small. There is extensive interdigitation of valleys and
mountain ranges, and, consequently, of life-zones in this region.
In a few places, recognizably distinct populations of the vagrant
shrew occur within a few miles of one another, but in other places
there are populations of intergrades. West of the Cascades no
evidence of intergradation has been found and the two kinds occur
almost side by side and maintain their distinctness.

These Great Basin shrews dwell in hydrosere communities as do
their Rocky Mountain counterparts. In this arid region such a
habitat obviously is the only one habitable for a shrew of the vagrans
group. These shrews often maintain their predilection for such
habitats when they reach the Pacific coast, and are commonly found
in such places as coastal marshes, marshy meadows, and streamsides,
while the woodlands are inhabited by other species.

These small shrews of the Great Basin and the small vagrant
shrews of the Pacific Coast were called Sorex vagrans by Jackson.


Summary of Geographic Variation

Large reddish shrews of the coast of California and southwestern
Oregon become smaller and darker to the north. From southwestern
British Columbia they again become larger as one proceeds
northward along the coast to Wrangell, Alaska, and north of that
they again become smaller. Moving inland from the coast the
shrews become markedly smaller in Alaska and British Columbia.
The smaller inland and montane form occurs south through the
Rocky Mountains, becoming slightly smaller in central Montana,
slightly larger in southeastern New Mexico, and slightly smaller in
western New Mexico and in Arizona. This montane form intergrades
with a smaller more reddish Great Basin shrew, the zone of
intergradation roughly following the western slope of the Rocky
Mountains. The Great Basin shrew occurs westward to the Pacific
Coast; there the Great Basin shrew occurs with, although in part it
is ecologically separated from, the large reddish coastal shrews.

There seems to be an intergrading chain of subspecies of one
[Pg 14]
species, the end members of which (the small Great Basin form
and the large coastal form) are so different in size and ecological
niche that they are able to coexist without interbreeding. In southern
British Columbia the morphological differences are not so
marked as farther south along the Pacific Coast. There, in British
Columbia, reproductive isolation is not complete and occasional
populations of intergrades occur. In Montana extensive intergradation
occurs in a broad zone of transitional habitat. Along the western
edge of the Rockies from Idaho south to Utah the zone of
transition from montane to basin habitat is sharp and the zone of
intergradation, although present, is fairly narrow, perhaps because
there is little intermediate habitat which logically might be expected
to be most suitable for intergrading populations.

The oldest name applied to a shrew of the group under consideration
is Sorex vagrans Baird, 1858, the type locality of which is
Willapa Bay, Pacific County, Washington. The name applies to
the small vagrant shrew of this area, rather than to the larger forest
dweller which has been known as Sorex obscurus. The name S.
vagrans, in the specific sense, must therefore apply to all the shrews
discussed which have heretofore been known by the names S. pacificus,
S. yaquinae, S. obscurus, and S. vagrans.

A situation such as the one here described where well differentiated
end members of a chain of subspecies overlap over an extensive
geographic range throughout the year without interbreeding       thus
reacting toward one another as do full species       so far as I know
has not previously been found to exist in mammals. The overlapping
end-members of the chain of subspecies of Sorex vagrans
really do coexist; specimens of the overlapping subspecies have
been taken together at the same localities from California to British
Columbia. I have taken a specimen of S. v. vagrans and several of
S. v. setosus in the same woodlot at Fort Lewis, Pierce County,
Washington. Two subspecies of deer, Odocoileus hemionus, in the
Sierra Nevada of California, occur together over a sizeable area but
for only a part of each year that does not include the breeding
season (Cowan, 1936:156-157). In the deer mouse, Peromyscus
maniculatus, the geographic ranges of several pairs of subspecies
meet at certain places without intergradation of the two kinds. In
these instances well marked ecological differences exist between the
subspecies involved. In western Washington, for example, the
geographic range of the lowland subspecies, P. m. austerus, interdigitates
to the east and west with the range of the montane and
coniferous forest-inhabiting subspecies, P. m. oreas, and the two
kinds have not been shown to intergrade. Peromyscus maniculatus
artemesiae and P. m. osgoodi come together without interbreeding
in Glacier National Park, Montana. P. m. artemesiae is almost entirely
a forest-dwelling subspecies, whereas osgoodi is an inhabitant
of open country. The two kinds do not actually occur together
ecologically although they occur together in buildings at the edge
of the woods (A. Murie, 1933:4-5).

[Pg 16]

Cases of sympatric existence of two subspecies of one species are
known in birds and in reptiles. Notable examples are in the gull,
Larus argentatus (Mayr, 1940), in the Old World warbler, Phylloscopus
trochiloides (Ticehurst, 1938), and in the great titmouse,
Parus major (Rensch, 1933), of the Old World. In the first species
the two end-members, the herring gull and the lesser black-backed
gull, occur together over an extensive region from northern Europe
and the British Isles throughout Fennoscandia. Fitch (1940) described
a rassenkreis with overlapping subspecies in the garter
snake Thamnophis ordinoides.

The geographic distribution of the species Sorex vagrans is shown
in figure 5. The geographic range of the Great Basin subspecies
is shown by a different pattern of lines than the other subspecies of
S. vagrans. In the region in which the geographic range of the
Great Basin subspecies overlaps those of the subspecies of the
Pacific Coast, the pattern of shading for the Great Basin subspecies
is superimposed on the patterns for the other subspecies.




ORIGIN OF THE SOREX VAGRANS RASSENKREIS

The distribution of the species Sorex vagrans and that of its immediate
ancestors obviously has not always been the same; during
glacial ages much of the present range of the species in Canada and
in some of the higher mountains of the United States was covered
with ice and not available to the shrew. Furthermore, large areas
that are now too hot and dry to permit the existence of S. vagrans
were at one time habitable. If we are to speculate on the manner
in which the Sorex vagrans rassenkreis originated we must inquire
into the nature and extent of these climatic changes.

The most recent epoch of geological time, the Pleistocene, is
known to have been divided into a series of alternating glacial and
interglacial ages. During the glacial ages continental and montane
glaciers are judged to have covered much of Canada and the northern
United States. Concurrently the major storm tracks of the west
probably were shifted southward; in any event much of the now
arid intermontane west was much better watered than it is today.
[Pg 17]
The increased precipitation, and probably glacial meltwater, formed
large lakes in the closed basins of the Great Basin. There were
boreal forests at lower elevations than there are today in comparable
latitudes and continuous boreal habitat probably connected many
of the isolated mountain ranges of the southwest. That probability
is supported by the presence of boreal animals and plants on many
[Pg 18]
of these isolated ranges today. A boreal tree squirrel, such as
Tamiasciurus, could hardly be suspected of crossing a treeless, intermontane
desert valley, miles wide.

Interglacial ages were characterized by warmth and aridity as
compared to the glacial ages. Glaciers retreated or disappeared,
boreal forests became montane in much of the United States, and
the lakes in the Great Basin were reduced or disappeared. One can
envision that during such times boreal mammals were isolated,
their geographic ranges were restricted, and Sonoran mammals expanded
their ranges.

Evidence is more extensive concerning the number and extent of
glacial ages in the eastern than in the western part of North America.
This evidence suggests a division of the Pleistocene into four glacial
ages and four interglacial ages, the fourth interglacial age corresponding
to the present time. More information is available about
the Wisconsinan, or last, glacial age, than about the earlier ones,
because the last glaciation in many montane areas destroyed evidence
of earlier glaciations. The names of currently recognized
glacial and interglacial ages of the Pleistocene are listed below. The
names of interglacial ages are in Italic type.


Wisconsinan
Sangamonian
Illinoian
Yarmouthian
Kansan
Aftonian
Nebraskan


We may think of these ages as an alternating series of cool moist
and warm dry periods during which boreal mammals, and other
organisms, alternately moved southward (disappearing in the glaciated
regions) and northward into previously glaciated areas (while
disappearing from southern areas except on isolated mountain
ranges). Sorex vagrans probably followed this pattern of movement
and now is restricted to forested or well-watered places.

One possible series of events culminating in the formation of the
Sorex vagrans rassenkreis may be thought of as having begun during
the Illinoian age. With much of Canada, and perhaps also many
areas in the Rockies, Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada covered with
glacial ice, the shrew-stock ancestral to Sorex vagrans may well have
occupied a more or less continuous range over the Colorado Plateau,
the Columbian Plateau, the Great Basin, and in the forests of the
Pacific Coast (as well as over part of eastern United States, as will
[Pg 19]
be explained beyond; see fig. 7). At that time the species probably
was a continuously interbreeding unit.





  Fig. 7. Possible distribution in Illinoian
  (inset) and Sangamonian times of the ancestor of the Sorex
  vagrans-ornatus-longirostris-veraepacis complex. Approximate
  southern boundary of Illinoian glaciation marked by heavy line.



In the ensuing Sangamonian interglacial age all glaciers retreated
or disappeared thereby opening up extensive areas in the north and
in the higher mountains which were occupied by a boreal fauna,
including S. vagrans. Concurrently the Great Basin, and probably
also much of the Columbian Plateau, became dry, and desert conditions
developed, perhaps much as they are today. Increasing
aridity eliminated shrew habitat in most places between the Rocky
Mountains and the Sierra Nevada-Cascade mountain chain with the
result that the geographic range of the species resembled an inverted
"U", one arm lying along the Rocky Mountains and the other along
the Cascade-Sierra Nevada axis; the connection between the two
arms was in British Columbia (see fig. 7). At present Sorex vagrans
[Pg 20]
does occur in isolated places in the Great Basin, but its existence
there is tenuous and seemingly dependent upon the occurrence of
permanent water such as Ruby Lake and Reese River. With such
an arrangement as this it can readily be seen that gene flow between
the eastern and western arms of the "U" would be greatly reduced
by distance; consequently differentiation between the two might
be expected.





  Fig. 8. Possible distribution of Sorex
  vagrans at two different times in the Wisconsinan Age. Left, early
  Wisconsinan; right, mid-Wisconsinan.



Wisconsinan glaciation again rendered Canada uninhabitable,
and it is quite possible that extensive areas in the Rocky Mountains,
the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada were heavily glaciated. With
the elimination of the northern part of the "U", the eastern and
[Pg 21]
western arms became isolated, if not by the width of the Columbian
Plateau at least by the glaciated Cascade Mountains. At the same
time extensive areas on the Colorado Plateau and much of the area
south to the Mexican highlands were again occupied by the species.
Finally the Great Basin, again being well-watered, provided suitable
habitat for, and was reoccupied by, Sorex vagrans (see fig. 8).
This reoccupation of the Great Basin took place probably from
the Colorado Plateau and mountains of Arizona and Utah, since the
present day shrews of the species S. vagrans in the Great Basin
closely resemble Rocky Mountain shrews but differ markedly from
the large endemic subspecies of the Pacific Coast.

Finally, with the waning of Wisconsinan ice, the species again
was able to occupy northern and montane areas as it had during
Sangamonian times. Again dessication of the Great Basin caused
drastic restriction of shrew habitat. The small, marsh-dwelling kind
of wandering shrew which had developed there around the lakes
of Wisconsinan time occupied suitable habitat all the way to the
Pacific coast where its range came into contact with that of the western
arm of the Sangamonian "U."-pattern of shrew distribution (see
fig. 9). The animals of this western segment and the new arrivals
from the east were by this time so different from one another that
the two kinds lived in the same areas without interbreeding. The
descendants of the original western arm now are known as Sorex
vagrans sonomae, S. v. pacificus, S. v. yaquinae, and S. v. bairdi. The
newcomers from the east are known as S. v. vagrans, S. v. halicoetes,
S. v. paludivagus and S. v. vancouverensis.

In addition to occupying the Pacific Coast from San Francisco
Bay north to the Fraser Delta, the Great Basin subspecies populated
the Columbia Plateau and the western foothills of the central and
northern Rockies. By so doing that subspecies came into secondary
contact with its own parent stock with which it was still in reproductive
continuity in Utah. In some places in British Columbia differentiation
between the two kinds had proceeded to such an extent
that some reproductive isolation was effected, but in many other
places the two interbred. The Rocky Mountain form spread north
and west and occupied the Cascades and coastal lowlands in southwestern
British Columbia and in Washington. Here the differentiation
between the Rocky Mountain subspecies and the Great Basin
subspecies was great enough to cause complete reproductive isolation.

[Pg 22]





  Fig. 9. Probable changes in the distribution
  of Sorex vagrans concurrent with and following the dissipation
  of Wisconsinan ice. Dark arrows in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and
  California, shows S. v. vagrans.


[Pg 23]

Deglaciation of the Sierra Nevada opened it up for reoccupation
from the east by Sorex vagranss of the Great Basin. In response to
the montane environment the subspecies obscuroides, resembling
the subspecies obscurus of the Rockies, developed.

Desiccation of the intermontane parts of New Mexico, Arizona,
and Chihuahua, left "marooned" populations of Sorex vagrans on
suitable mountain ranges. In this way Sorex vagrans orizabae may
have been isolated in southern Mexico. The isolated populations
of Arizona and New Mexico differentiated in situ into the subspecies
monticola and neomexicanus.

Western Canada and Alaska were populated by shrews which
originated in the habitable parts of the Rocky Mountains and
Colorado Plateau during Wisconsinan time (as opposed to shrews
originating, as subspecies, in the Great Basin or on the Pacific
Coast). These shrews differentiated into the currently recognized
subspecies of the west coast and coastal islands of British Columbia
and Alaska in response to the different environments in these places,
many of which were isolated; the subspecies isolatus, mixtus, setosus,
longicauda, elassodon, prevostensis, malitiosus, and alaskensis are
thought to have originated in this fashion after the areas now occupied
by them were freed of Wisconsinan ice.

This group of shrews from the Rocky Mountains probably came
into contact with the Pacific coastal segment of the species somewhere
in northwestern Oregon. The clinal decrease in size from
S. v. pacificus to S. v. setosus seems steepest in this area. Upon the
establishment of this contact reproductive continuity was resumed,
probably because the temporal separation of the two stocks involved
was not so great as, say, that between S. v. vagrans and S. v.
pacificus, and in addition the morphological differentiation was not
so great.

On the eastern side of the Rockies the montane stock moved
northeastward, occupying suitable territory opened up by the dissolution
of the Laurentide ice sheet. Still later changes in the
character of the northern plains owing to desiccation divided the
range of the species and isolated S. v. soperi in Manitoba and central
Saskatchewan and a population of S. v. obscurus, in the Cypress
Hills. A number of semi-isolated stocks in central Montana became
differentiated as a recognizable subspecies there.

A number of other boreal mammals have geographic ranges
which resemble that of Sorex vagrans, except that the geographic
ranges of subspecies do not overlap. Because of the general similarities
[Pg 24]
of these geographic ranges, it is pertinent to examine the
reasons suggested by students to account for the present geographic
distributions of some of these other boreal species.

The red squirrel genus, Tamiasciurus, has a Rocky Mountain (and
northern coniferous forest) species, T. hudsonicus, that occurs all
along the Rocky Mountain chain and northward into Alaska. In the
Cascade Mountains of Washington and British Columbia this
species meets the range of a well marked western species, T. douglasii,
with no evidence of intergradation. Dalquest (1948:86)
attributes the divergence of the two species to separation in a
glacial age but feels that the degree of difference between the two
is too great to have all taken place during the Wisconsinan. Perhaps
he has overemphasized the importance of the differences between
the two, but, be that as it may, it seems that the two kinds differentiated
during a glacial age when they were isolated, perhaps by ice
on the Cascades into a coastal population and an inland population.
One difference between the distribution of the red squirrels and
vagrant shrew is that the squirrel of the Sierra Nevada is the species
of the Pacific Coast, whereas the vagrant shrew of the Sierra Nevada
was derived from the Great Basin population, which in turn was
derived from the Rocky Mountain kind. Red squirrels do not occur
on any of the boreal montane "islands" of Nevada. During the
pluvial periods when hydrosere-loving shrews populated the Great
Basin, that region may have been a treeless grassland. Vagrant
shrews, then as now, probably depended on hydrosere communities,
while red squirrels required trees. Therefore the shrews were able
to traverse the Great Basin, while the Sierran red squirrels were of
necessity derived from the coastal population.

The ecological requirements of jumping mice, genus Zapus, and
the subspecies of Sorex vagrans that dwell in hydroseres are essentially
similar. The species Zapus princeps lives in the Rocky
Mountains, the Great Basin, the Sierra Nevada, and north to Yukon
(Krutzsch, 1954:395). Its geographic range is similar to that of
the montane and basin segments of S. vagrans. The species Z. trinotatus
occurs along the Pacific coast and in the Cascades north to
southwestern British Columbia. Its distribution thus coincides in
general with that of the large red coastal subspecies of S. vagrans.
Krutzsch (1954:368-369) thought that these two kinds of jumping
mice were first separated by the formation of the Cascade Mountains
and the Sierra Nevada and finally by Pleistocene glaciation.
The Sierran jumping mouse (Zapus princeps), as is the Sierran
vagrant shrew, is more closely related to the jumping mouse of the
[Pg 25]
Great Basin and of the Rocky Mountains than it is to the jumping
mouse (Z. trinotatus) of the Pacific Coast, just as the Sierran vagrant
shrew is related to the shrew of the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains.
The jumping mouse also is limited in its distribution by
hydrosere communities, not by forests.

In western North America there are two species of water or marsh
shrews: Sorex palustris and S. bendiri. They have been placed in
separate subgenera, but, as pointed out beyond, are closely related
and here are placed in the same subgenus. The species palustris
is found throughout the Rocky Mountains, north into Alaska, across
the Great Basin into the Sierra Nevada, and west to the Pacific
coast in Washington. The species bendiri is found from northwestern
California north along the Pacific coast to southwestern British
Columbia and east to the Cascades. Where the ranges of the two
species overlap in western Washington they do not interbreed so far
as is known, and are somewhat different in their ecology, bendiri
being a lowland, and palustris being a montane, species. The two
species probably were separated in a glacial period as seems to have
been the case with the wandering shrews. Also, the water shrew of
the Sierra Nevada is derived from that of the Great Basin and Rocky
Mountains. Sorex palustris is tied closely in its distribution to hydrosere
communities and is not dependent upon the presence of forests.

Red-backed mice, genus Clethrionomys, occur throughout the
Rocky Mountains and west to the Cascades in Washington as the
species C. gapperi. The species C. californicus is found along the
Pacific Coast from California north to the Olympic Peninsula. Where
the ranges of the two species meet in Washington they seem not to
intergrade. In some glacial interval these two species may have
evolved in the same manner as has been described for the species of
Zapus and those of Tamiasciurus. No Clethrionomys are found in
the Sierra Nevada, nor are red-backed mice found in the boreal
islands of the Great Basin. It is not known why Clethrionomys
californicus does not occur in the Sierra Nevada. Some boreal birds
have distributional patterns similar to those of the mammalian
examples cited above. One kind of sapsucker, Sphyrapicus varius
nuchalis, occurs in the Rocky Mountains north into British Columbia
and west to the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. A related kind, S.
varius ruber, occurs along the Pacific Coast from California north
into British Columbia. Recently Howell (1952) has shown that
some intergradation takes place between ruber and nuchalis in
Washington and British Columbia, although they do not intergrade
[Pg 26]
freely. Previously the two kinds were thought not to intergrade
and were regarded as two species. The two kinds intergrade also
in northeastern California, although in that state S. v. daggeti, rather
than S. v. ruber, is involved in the intergradation. Howell considered
the two kinds to be conspecific with one another as well as with the
eastern S. varius. He attributed a measure of the distinctness of
nuchalis and ruber to their separation during a glacial period, but
felt that the separation was much older than Wisconsinan. Whatever
the time of separation, the pattern seems clear: nuchalis and
ruber (as well as varius) were separated into montane, coastal, and
eastern segments respectively, probably by glaciation (it seems to
me in the Pleistocene), and have since re-established contact with
one another.

The grouse genus Dendrogapus is divided into a Great Basin
species, D. obscurus, which extends northward into British Columbia,
and a Rocky Mountain species, D. fuliginosus, that is found
in the Sierra Nevada and northward along the coast and Cascades
into British Columbia. Although the two kinds have at times been
considered conspecific, they differ in voice, hooting mechanism,
and characters of the downy young, and so far no actual
intergradation between the two has been shown (Grinnell and
Miller, 1944:113). These grouse thus seem to offer additional evidence
for a Pleistocene, possibly Wisconsinan, separation of the
boreal fauna into a Rocky Mountain and a Pacific coastal segment.

A notable sidelight on these data is the frequency with which
species in the Sierra Nevada have their closest relatives in the Rocky
Mountains, rather than in the geographically nearer Cascades or
coastal areas. This similarity in fauna of the Sierra Nevada and the
Rockies was noted long ago by Merriam (1899:86).




RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER SPECIES

During the Sangamonian interval, isolated segments of the once
widespread ancestral Sorex vagrans quite possibly persisted in such
places as the Sierra Nevada, coastal southern California, the mountains
of Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Mexico, and in the
Black Hills (see fig. 6). One might expect that by Wisconsinan
time these populations would have become reproductively isolated
from their parent stock. They would therefore have remained
specifically distinct when Wisconsinan Sorex vagrans, reoccupied
these outlying areas, and may still be found isolated in places
peripheral to the range of the ancestral species.

[Pg 27]





  Fig. 10. Probable distribution of S.
  veraepacis, S. longirostris, and the S. ornatus group
  (stipple) and of their Wisconsinan ancestors (lines). Heavy line
  indicates limits of Wisconsinan glaciation.



In fact, we do find species closely related to Sorex vagrans in just
such places today (fig. 10). Probably Sorex ornatus, including
members of the ornatus group such as S. trigonirostris, S. sinuosus,
S. willeti, S. tenellus, and S. nanus, and also S. veraepacis, arose by
separation from the ancestral vagrans stock in Sangamonian time.
Probably the eastern S. longirostris arose in a like manner. The
ancestor of S. ornatus may have been isolated in southwestern California
during Sangamonian time, spread north and south during the
Wisconsinan age, and afterward given rise to S. trigonirostris and
the modern S. ornatus complex of California and Baja California.
In at least one place reproductive isolation between ornatus and the
invading S. vagrans has broken down (Rudd, 1953); the place is a
salt marsh along San Pablo Bay, where a hybrid population between
S. vagrans and S. sinuosus, an ornatus derivative, has formed. Sorex
tenellus may have been isolated in the Sierra Nevada in the Sangamonian
[Pg 28]
interval, moved into the valleys east of the mountains during
the Wisconsinan age, and become restricted to its present range
since the retreat of the last ice. Sorex nanus may have occurred in
the Black Hills and isolated mountains of Arizona and New Mexico
during the Sangamonian interval and remained in these general
areas during the Wisconsinan age. Its present range is peripheral
to the main body of the Rockies and the Colorado Plateau.

The eastern species Sorex longirostris has many similarities with
shrews of the ornatus-vagrans stock. S. l. longirostris is close in
many ways to S. nanus. Indeed, the differences between the species
S. nanus, S. ornatus, and S. longirostris seem to me to be of the
same magnitude and indicate a similar period of differentiation from
a common ancestor. The ancestor of S. longirostris may have gained
access to the eastern United States in the Illinoian Age via the northern
Great Plains south of the glacial boundary (fig. 7). The ancestor
of Sorex veraepacis of southern Mexico probably reached that
area in Illinoian time as part of the ancestral vagrans stock and probably
attained its differentiation during the Sangamonian interval.

All the kinds of shrews so far discussed, including the S. vagrans
complex, might thus be thought of as having had a common ancestor
in the Illinoian Age. This entire group of shrews has the third unicuspid
smaller than the fourth, a pigmented ridge from the apex to
the cingulum of each upper unicuspid, and, in most individuals,
lacks a post-mandibular foramen in the lower jaw (Findley, 1953:636-637).
The pigment is not always prominent in S. longirostris.

Two other species of North American shrews, Sorex palustris, the
water shrew, and Sorex bendiri, the marsh shrew, show these three
characters to a greater or lesser degree, and it seems that these two
species and the vagrans-ornatus-veraepacis group had a common
ancestor, probably before Illinoian time for reasons stated beyond.
I judge, however, that far from being subgenerically distinct as they
have been considered to be, S. palustris and S. bendiri are actually
closely related species of the same subgenus and may have differentiated
from one another because of separation into eastern (palustris)
and western (bendiri) segments in the Sangamonian interval,
much as has been postulated concerning the eastern and western
stocks of Sorex vagrans. Indeed, Jackson (1928:192) has noted that
in the Pacific northwest the characters of the two kinds approach
one another and become differences of degree only.

The widespread species Sorex cinereus resembles all the foregoing
species in the ridges on the unicuspid teeth and in the lack of a
post-mandibular foramen, but differs from those other species in
[Pg 29]
having the third upper unicuspid larger than the fourth. The subspecies
S. cinereus ohionensis, however, often has the sizes of these teeth
reversed. With S. cinereus I include S. preblei (eastern Oregon) and
S. lyelli (Sierra Nevada), both obviously closely related to
cinereus as Jackson (1928:37) recognized when he included them in the
cinereus group. Sorex milleri (Coahuila and central western Nuevo
Leon) seems to me to resemble S. cinereus more than it does other
species of North American Sorex, and I judge that it also belongs to
the cinereus group. Sorex cinereus and its close relatives seem more
closely related to the species which have thus far been discussed than
they do to such other North American species as S. arcticus, S.
fumeus, S. trowbridgii, S. merriami, and the members of the S.
saussurei group; most of these five species last mentioned possess a
post-mandibular foramen, lack pigmented unicuspid ridges, and have the
third unicuspid larger than the fourth. Because of the morphological
resemblances mentioned above, it seems likely to me that S. cinereus
and the vagrans-ornatus-veraepacis-palustris complex had a common
ancestor in early Pleistocene time. Sorex cinereus has recently been
considered to be conspecific with the Old World S. caecutiens Laxmann
(Van den Brink, 1953) which name, being the older, would apply to the
circumpolar species.

Hibbard (1944:719) recovered S. cinereus and a species of
Neosorex (a name formerly applied to the water shrew) from the
Pleistocene (late Kansan) Cudahy Fauna. This indicates that the
ancestors of the modern S. cinereus and of the water shrew had
diverged from one another before that time. Brown (1908:172)
recorded S. cinereus and S. obscurus from the Conard Fissure in
Arkansas. These materials were deposited probably at a later
time than was the Cudahy Fauna. The S. obscurus from Conard
Fissure probably represents the ancestral S. vagrans stock which I
think reached eastern United States in Illinoian time and gave rise
to S. longirostris. The Conard Fissure material was deposited at a
time (Illinoian?) when northern faunas extended farther south than
they do today.

All of the species mentioned as having structural characters in
common with S. vagrans seem to have arisen from a common ancestor
which had already differentiated from the ancestor of such
species as S. arcticus, S. saussurei, and others. Consequently all
are here included in a single subgenus. The oldest generic name
applied to a shrew of this group, other than the name Sorex, is
Otisorex DeKay, 1842, type species Otisorex platyrhinus DeKay, a
[Pg 30]
synonym of Sorex cinereus. The subgenus can be characterized as
follows.

[Pg 31]

Other species of Sorex now occurring in North America differ from
Otisorex in having the 3rd unicuspid usually larger than 4th, in lacking
a pigmented ridge from the apices to the cingula of the upper
unicuspids, and in usually possessing a well-developed post-mandibular
foramen. Exceptions to the last mentioned character are
S. fumeus and S. dispar. The subgenus Sorex in North America
should include only the following species: S. jacksoni, S. tundrensis,
S. arcticus, S. gaspensis, S. dispar, S. fumeus, S. trowbridgii, S.
merriami, and all the members of the Mexican S. saussurei group.

The subgenera Otisorex and Sorex probably separated in early
Pleistocene or late Pliocene. Sorex is unknown in North America
earlier than the late Pliocene (Simpson, 1945:51).

In the genus Microsorex the characters of the subgenus Otisorex
are carried to an extreme; the unicuspid ridges are prominent and
end in distinct cusplets, and the 3rd unicuspid is not merely smaller
than the 4th, but is reduced almost to the vanishing point. In addition,
the post-mandibular foramen is absent. Although it is closer
structurally to Otisorex than to Sorex, the recognition of Microsorex
as a distinct genus seems warranted.

Figure 15 is intended to represent graphically some of the relationships
discussed above. It must be re-emphasized that much of
it is purely speculative, especially as regards actual time when
various separations took place. It will be noted that I have indicated
most separations as having taken place in interglacial ages.
They are generally regarded as periods of warmth and aridity and,
therefore, probably are times of segmentation of the ranges of boreal
mammals and hence times exceptionally favorable to the process of
speciation. Glacial ages, characterized by extensive and continuous
areas of boreal habitat, probably were times of relatively unrestricted
gene flow between many populations of boreal mammals
and hence not favorable to rapid speciation.

Sorex vagrans

Wandering Shrew

The size of the wandering shrew varies from small in the subspecies
monticola and vagrans to large in the subspecies pacificus. The tail
makes up from a little more than a third to almost half of the total
length. The color pattern ranges from tricolored through bicolored
to almost monocolored. Color ranges from reddish (Sayal or Snuff
Brown) to grayish in summer pelage and from black to light gray
in winter. Diagnostic dental characters include: 3rd upper unicuspid
smaller than 4th, and unicuspids, except 5th, with a pigmented ridge
extending from near apex of each tooth medially to cingulum and
sometimes ending as internal cusplet. S. vagrans differs from members
[Pg 32]
of the ornatus group in less flattened skull, and in more ventrally
situated foramen magnum that encroaches more on the basioccipital
and less on the supraoccipital. The wandering shrew differs
from S. trowbridgii and S. saussurei in the dental characters
mentioned above. These dental characters also serve to distinguish
S. vagrans readily from S. cinereus, S. merriami, and S. arcticus
which may occur with vagrans. The large marsh shrew and water
shrew, S. palustris and S. bendiri, can be distinguished at a glance
from S. vagrans by larger size and darker color.

Sorex vagrans yaquinae Jackson

Sorex yaquinae Jackson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 31:127, November
29, 1918.

Sorex pacificus yaquinae, V. Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 55:364, August 29,
1936.

Type.       Adult female, skin and skull; No. 73051 U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.,
obtained on July 18, 1895, by B. J. Bretherton, from Yaquina Bay, Lincoln Co.,
Oregon.

Diagnosis.       Size large for the species; average and extreme external measurements
[Pg 35]
of 11 specimens from Oakridge, Lane Co., Oregon, are: total length,
125.3 (11-136); tail, 55.1 (49-61); hind foot, 14.9 (14-16). Color reddish in
summer, browner or grayer in winter.

Comparisons.       See account of S. v. pacificus for comparison with that
subspecies. Larger and more reddish than S. v. bairdi with which it intergrades
to the north and east. Much larger and more reddish than the sympatric
S. v. vagrans.

Remarks.       The name yaquinae actually applies to a population of intergrades
between pacificus and bairdi. There is much variation over the range
of the subspecies, and individuals from the western and southern parts are
larger than those from the west slope of the Cascades. Specimens from Vida
and McKenzie Bridge are smaller than those from Mapleton, Mercer, and the
type locality but still seem closer to yaquinae than to topotypes of bairdi.
Between Marshfield and Umpqua on the one hand, and the Columbia River
and the Cascade Mountains on the other, the size of Sorex vagrans decreases
quite rapidly from the large pacificus to the smaller permiliensis. Size decreases
less rapidly northward along the coast than it does eastward toward the mountains;
consequently, at any given latitude, coastal shrews are larger than
mountain shrews. In this area of rapid change in size it is difficult to draw
subspecific boundaries between pacificus, yaquinae, and bairdi, and this must
be done somewhat arbitrarily.

Jackson (1928:141) remarked upon the possibility that intergradation
between pacificus and yaquinae took place. He noted also the close resemblance
between yaquinae and bairdi, and stated (loc. cit.) that specific affinity between
the two might be demonstrated with more specimens. He had a series
of eight specimens from Vida, Oregon, seven of which he assigned to S. o. bairdi
and one to yaquinae. I have examined these specimens and find no more
variation between the largest and the smallest than would be expected in any
normally variable series of shrews. Vernon Bailey (1936:364) arranged
yaquinae as a subspecies of pacificus without giving his reasons for so doing.

in summer, darker in winter, underparts buffy.

[Pg 36]
Comparisons.       For comparisons with yaquinae see account of that subspecies.
More reddish and larger than permiliensis with which bairdi intergrades to the

of 14 specimens from the type locality are: total length, 117.7 (110-124);
tail, 51.9 (45-58); hind foot, 14.0 (14-15). Pale reddish in summer, darker
and brownish in winter.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. bairdi see account of that subspecies.
Larger than S. v. setosus except tail relatively shorter. More reddish
in summer pelage than setosus.

Remarks.       S. v. bairdi is larger in the southern part of its range than elsewhere.
Specimens from McKenzie Bridge, herein referred to yaquinae, are
intermediate in character between yaquinae and bairdi or between yaquinae
and permiliensis. The transition between yaquinae and bairdi is much more
gradual than between yaquinae and permiliensis.

Sorex vagrans setosus Elliott

Sorex setosus Elliott, Field Columb. Mus. Publ. 32, zool. ser. 1:274, May
19, 1899.

Sorex obscurus setosus, Jackson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 31:127, November
29, 1918.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 6213/238, Chicago Nat. Hist. Mus.;
obtained on August 18, 1898, by D. G. Elliott from Happy Lake, Olympic
Mts., Clallam Co., Washington.

Range.       Washington from the Cascades west; southwestern British Columbia
west of 120       W Longitude north to Lund.

Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 20 specimens from the Olympic Mountains, Washington, are: total length,
[Pg 37]
117.3 (107-125); tail, 49.8 (41-54); hind foot, 13.4 (12-14). Color dark in
both summer and winter.

Comparisons.       For comparison with permiliensis see account of that subspecies.
Darker, longer-tailed, and somewhat larger cranially than S. v. obscurus
with which it intergrades in southwestern British Columbia. Smaller in
all dimensions, but much the same color as S. v. longicauda with which it
intergrades along the British Columbian coast north of Lund. Larger, darker,
less reddish, and longer-tailed than the sympatric S. v. vagrans.

Remarks.       S. v. setosus lives mostly in forests. According to Dalquest
(1948:139) it is commonest at high altitudes in western Washington. In the
Hudsonian Life-zone where shrew habitat is more restricted and marginal than
it is at lower altitudes in the humid part of Washington, setosus might be expected
to compete with S. v. vagrans and to supplant it. Records of occurrence
in the Olympic Mountains suggest a degree of such separation there.

total length, 113, 118; tail, 48, 49; hind foot, 14, 14. Dark in summer and
winter, underparts brownish.

Comparisons.       Smaller than S. v. setosus but color much the same; resembles
S. v. obscurus in size and cranial characters but darker in all pelages; similar
in color to S. v. vancouverensis with which isolatus is sympatric but with longer

S. v. mixtus see account of that subspecies.

Remarks.       S. v. isolatus and S. v. vancouverensis seemingly approach one
[Pg 39]
another morphologically more closely than do any other pair of sympatric subspecies

Type.       Adult female, skin and skull; No. 73539, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.;
obtained on July 10, 1895, by C. P. Streator from Yakutat, Alaska.

Range.       The coast of southern Alaska from the vicinity of Juneau west to
include eastern part of the Kenai Peninsula.

[Pg 42]
Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 9 specimens from 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N of Haines, Alaska, are: total
length, 110 (104-128); tail, 45.4 (41-52); hind foot, 14 (14-14). Color grayish
brown.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. longicauda and S. v. elassodon
see accounts of those subspecies. Resembles S. v. obscurus in color but differs
in larger skull, longer hind foot and in somewhat darker color. Larger and
darker than S. v. shumaginensis; the two intergrade near the base of the Kenai
Peninsula.

Remarks.       This subspecies is transitional between the large, usually dark
subspecies of the southeastern Alaskan and British Columbian coast and islands,
and the smaller, paler subspecies of western and interior Alaska. There seem
to be no sharp breaks between alascensis and shumaginesis. North of Haines,
Alaska, size of shrews decreases in a short distance across a narrow intergradational
zone between alascensis and obscurus. Throughout most of its range
S. v. alascensis occurs with Sorex cinereus.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 97993, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.; obtained
on July 17, 1899, by De Alton Saunders from Popof Island, Shumagin
Islands, Alaska. (Measured by C. Hart Merriam and numbered 2210 in A. K.
Fisher's catalog.)

Range.       Southwestern Alaska from Seward Peninsula southeasterly to western
part of Kenai Peninsula and southwesterly to the southwestern end of the
Alaskan Peninsula.

Diagnosis.       Size medium to small for the species; average and extreme
measurements of 6 specimens from King Cove, Alaska, are: total length, 112.7
(107-118); tail, 48.3 (45-52); hind foot, 13.8 (13-14). Tending toward the
development of a tricolor pattern, the back darkest, the sides buffy, and the
venter paler.

Comparisons.       Paler and more definitely tricolored than S. v. obscurus; also
with relatively shorter palate, narrower rostrum and smaller teeth. For comparison
with S. v. alascensis see account of that subspecies.

[Pg 43]
Remarks.       S. v. shumaginensis occurs together with Sorex cinereus over
much of southwestern Alaska. Part of the range of shumaginensis falls within
the tundra of the Arctic Life-zone. This may be a partial explanation of the
tricolored pattern of the animal. Sorex tundrensis, S. cinereus ugyunak, and
S. cinereus haydeni, shrews which dwell mostly in treeless areas, are markedly
tricolored, or bicolored. Sorex arcticus, however, although tricolored, is found
in forested areas.

name for Sorex vagrans similis Merriam.

Sorex obscurus obscurus, Miller, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 79:15, December
31, 1912.

Type.       Adult female, skin and skull; No. 23525/30943, U. S. Biol. Surv.
Coll.; obtained on August 26, 1890, by Vernon Bailey and B. H. Dutcher from
near Timber Creek, 8200 ft., Lemhi Mts., 10 mi. SSW Junction (now Leadore),
Lemhi Co., Idaho.

Range.       Mountainous interior of western North America from central Alaska
east across Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories to northeastern
Alberta, south in the mountains through north-central and western Washington,
Idaho, western Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, into northern New
Mexico.

Diagnosis.       Size medium to small for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 9 topotypes are: total length, 110.3 (105-117); tail, 46.4 (42-50);
hind foot, 13.1 (12.5-13.5). Color grayish or brownish gray in summer, light
grayish in winter.

Comparisons.       For comparisons with S. v. setosus, S. v. longicauda, S. v.
alascensis and S. v. shumaginensis see accounts of those subspecies. Paler and
slightly larger than S. v. soperi. Larger than the subspecies from central Montana
herein described as new. Smaller than S. v. neomexicanus. Averaging
larger in all dimensions than S. v. monticola with which obscurus intergrades in
northern New Mexico and northern Arizona. Larger than S. v. vagrans with
more grayish rather than reddish fresh summer pelage and light gray rather
than dark grayish-black fresh winter pelage.

[Pg 44]
Remarks.       Intergradation of S. v. obscurus with S. v. setosus, S. v.
longicauda, S. v. alascensis, and the new subspecies from Montana
takes place in the usual way with specimens from intermediate localities
being intermediate in size and color. However the relationship
of S. v. obscurus and S. v. vagrans (as the latter subspecies is
defined in this study) is rather complicated. In southern British
Columbia where the two subspecies come together a situation of
remarkable complexity prevails. Series from some localities seem
to represent intergrades between obscurus and vagrans; from other
localities some specimens seem to be referable to one and some to
the other subspecies; from other localities all specimens seem referable
to one subspecies. A similar situation is seen in specimens from
northeastern Washington, northern and central Idaho, and extreme
western Montana. The region mentioned is one of extensive interfingering
of life-zones. In southern British Columbia the main axes
of the rivers, valleys and mountain ranges are north and south.
Most of the valleys are in the Transition Life-zone; the forests are
rather dry and of pine with more or less isolated hydrosere communities
about streams and ponds. These hydrosere situations are
the habitat of Sorex vagrans. Shrews from these situations are
usually referable to vagrans. The high ridges and mountain ranges
are usually in the Canadian Life-zone or higher and most of the
shrews referable to obscurus come from such places. Marginal
localities with regard to life-zone produce most of the populations
which seem to represent intergrades between the two subspecies.
Isolated areas of Canadian Life-zone, even though surrounded
with Transition Life-zone, often harbor a population of obscurus,
whereas the streams in the nearby dry valleys harbor populations
of vagrans. Farther south in the Rocky Mountain chain, obscurus
seemingly intergrades regularly with vagrans. This intergradation
is seen in populations from several localities in Utah. There the
lower elevations west of the Wasatch and Uinta mountains are
inhabited by S. v. vagrans, the higher elevations by obscurus and
where the ranges of the two abut intergrading populations occur.
In these series of intergrades there are specimens which, using size
as a subspecific criterion, would unhesitatingly be assigned, as individuals,
to obscurus, and others would be assigned to vagrans, but
these individuals represent extremes of a normally variable population.
At Cuddy Mountain, Idaho, the two subspecies seemingly
abut without intergradation; anyhow the available specimens from
this locality are referable to one or the other subspecies and none
[Pg 45]
is intermediate. The situation just described understandably has
been the source of much anguish to students who sought to identify
shrews from the Rocky Mountains. The reason for the relationship
just described has been discussed at length in a previous section.

In the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado the subspecies
S. v. obscurus ranges almost uninterruptedly over relatively large
areas, but southward in New Mexico and southwestward into Utah
and Arizona, suitable boreal habitat becomes insular in nature and
obscurus there is confined to the higher mountains. With one exception,
once the shrew populations become 'insular' in this region
they become smaller and show intergradation with Sorex vagrans
monticola. The exception is the population in the Sacramento
Mountains of southeastern New Mexico which is larger than obscurus
and has been rightly recognized as a distinct subspecies,
neomexicanus.

Almost without exception the range of typical Sorex vagrans
obscurus is sympatric with that of Sorex cinereus, usually the subspecies
S. c. cinereus. So close is this correspondence that the presence
of S. cinereus comes near to being a useful aid in identifying
S. v. obscurus. In areas where individuals of obscurus show intergradation
with vagrans, Sorex cinereus is absent or rare. The implication
is that as the species S. vagrans approaches the size of the
species S. cinereus, competition between the two increases with
resultant displacement of cinereus.

Sorex vagrans soperi Anderson and Rand

Sorex obscurus soperi Anderson and Rand, Canadian Field-Nat., 59:47,
October 16, 1945.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 18249, Nat. Mus. Canada; obtained
on September 21, 1940, by J. Dewey Soper, from 2       mi. NW Lake Audy,
Riding Mtn. Nat'l Park, Manitoba.

Range.       Southwestern Manitoba to central Saskatchewan.

Diagnosis.       Size medium to small for the species; measurements of type and
two topotypes are: total length, 107, 108, 117; tail, 45, 45, 45; hind foot, 12.1,
12.3, 12.5. Color dark brownish or fuscous in summer pelage; winter pelage
unknown.

Comparison.       Resembles S. v. obscurus in size; darker than obscurus in
summer pelage; cranium slightly higher and top more nearly flat; larger and
darker in summer pelage than the new subspecies from central Montana.

Remarks.       In their description of this subspecies Anderson and Rand
pointed out that specimens from the type locality and from central Saskatchewan
represent the dark extreme in a color cline which begins in south-central British
Columbia with "pale, brownish-tinged animals." These authors referred shrews
from Cypress Hills, southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta to
S. o. soperi, although they noted that these specimens, taken by themselves, are
not strikingly different from S. o. obscurus from the Rocky Mountains. The
specimens from the Cypress Hills were included in soperi because the authors
felt that the subspecific boundary should be drawn "where specimens average
about half way between the extremes (of the cline) in characters."

It is true, as Anderson and Rand say, that the shrews from Cypress Hills
are hardly separable from those from, say, Waterton Lakes Park. The specimens
[Pg 49]
from the Cypress Hills are noticeably different from specimens from the
Okanagan area, but some of the latter, in my opinion may represent intergrades
between S. v. obscurus and the more reddish S. v. vagrans and are not, at any
rate, typical obscurus. In view of the similarity of shrews from Cypress Hills
to typical S. v. obscurus and since the Cypress Hills are much nearer to the
range of S. v. obscurus than to the record-stations of occurrence in central
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, I have chosen to restrict the name soperi to shrews
from these latter two localities. Seemingly S. vagrans is absent from the plains
separating the Cypress Hills from the Rocky Mountains and from Riding
Mountain National Park.

Specimens examined.       none.

Marginal records.       Saskatchewan: Prince Albert National Park, 1700 ft.

Sorex vagrans longiquus new subspecies

Type.       First year male, skin and skull; No. 87332, Univ. Michigan Mus.
Zool.; obtained on July 21, 1942, by Emmet T. Hooper from 25 mi. ESE Big
Sandy, Eagle Creek, Chouteau Co., Montana, original no. 2184.

Range.       Central Montana; marginal localities are: Bearpaw Mts., Zortman,
Big Snowy Mts., Buffalo, Little Belt Mts.

Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; measurements of three topotypes are:
total length, 101, 105, 108; tail, 39, 40, 42; hind foot, 11.5, 11.5, 12. Color
pale; summer pelage: back near (17                  k) Olive Brown but hairs of dorsum with
a pale, buffy band proximal from the tips which imparts a pale over-all appearance;
flanks near Wood Brown; underparts Pale Smoke Gray, usually not with
a buffy wash; color of underparts often extending along margin of upper lip.
Skull small for species; rostrum relatively broad and heavy; relatively broad
interorbitally.

Comparisons.       From S. v. obscurus, S. v. longiquus differs as follows: size
smaller; skull smaller in all dimensions although similar in proportion. From
S. v. soperi, S. v. longiquus differs in: size smaller; color paler in summer
pelage. From S. v. vagrans, S. v. longiquus differs in: color paler in summer
pelage, less brownish; color of venter extending higher on flanks; venter Pale
Smoke Gray, rarely tinged with buffy rather than usually tinged with buffy.
From S. v. monticola, S. v. longiquus differs in: summer pelage slightly paler,
venter Pale Smoke Gray rather than suffused with buffy.

Remarks.       The subspecies longiquus is obviously derived from the neighboring
S. v. obscurus and differs from it mainly in size. Some specimens of
obscurus from western Montana show evidences of intergradation with S. v.
vagrans in possessing a somewhat buffy belly and these are thus more strikingly
different from longiquus than are other specimens of obscurus. Many specimens
of obscurus from the eastern slope of the Lewis and Clark Range in Montana
show the tricolored pattern seen in many specimens of longiquus. The
smallest individuals of longiquus are found on the Big Snowy Mountains. Intergradation
with obscurus is seen in specimens here referred to S. v. obscurus
from the Big Belt Mountains.

Sorex vagrans neomexicanus Bailey

Sorex obscurus neomexicanus Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 26:133,
May 21, 1913.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 100440, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.;
obtained on May 29, 1900, by Vernon Bailey, from Cloudcroft, 9000 ft., Otero
Co., New Mexico.

Range.       Sacramento and Capitan Mountains of New Mexico.

Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 4 topotypes are: total length, 105.2 (103-107); tail, 41.0 (39-42); hind
foot, 13.1 (12.5-14). Color near Olive Brown in summer; winter pelage
unknown; skull large and relatively broad; teeth relatively large.

Comparisons.       Skull larger than that of S. v. obscurus and relatively somewhat
broader; much larger in all cranial dimensions than S. v. monticola.

Remarks.       S. v. neomexicanus is a well-marked subspecies seemingly limited
to the mountains of southeastern New Mexico. It is the only species of Sorex
thus far recorded from that area.

Sorex melanogenys Hall, Jour. Mamm., 13:260, August 9, 1932, type from
Marijilda Canyon, 8600 ft., Graham Mts. [= Pinaleno Mts.] Graham Co.,
Arizona.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 17599/24535, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.;
obtained on August 28, 1899, by C. Hart Merriam and Vernon Bailey from
San Francisco Mtn., 11,500 ft., Coconino Co., Arizona.

Range.       Mountains of western New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and the northern
Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico.

Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 12 specimens from the White Mountains, Arizona, are: total length, 104.3
(98-112); tail, 41.2 (37-45); hind foot, 12.0 (11-13). Summer pelage between
(15      m) Proutts Brown and (15            m) Bister, venter tinged with (15      f) Pale
Ochraceous Buff; winter pelage near (17                  k) Olive Brown; skull relatively
broad.

[Pg 51]
Comparisons.       For comparisons with S. v. obscurus and S. v. neomexicanus
see accounts of those subspecies. Skull slightly larger and relatively broader
than that of S. v. orizabae, and color slightly paler. Differs from S. v. vagrans
in: winter pelage grayish (near 17                  k Olive Brown) rather than blackish
(17                        k or 17                        m Chaetura Drab or Chaetura Black); summer pelage slightly
grayer; skull relatively slightly broader rostrally and interorbitally.

Remarks.       S. v. monticola intergrades gradually with S. v. obscurus to the
north and east; indeed the type locality is actually in this area of intergradation.
So far as I know, monticola is not in reproductive continuity with any
other subspecies of Sorex vagrans. Specimens from southeastern Arizona are
the smallest and seem to be the most "typical" in the sense that they are most
different from S. v. obscurus. Some specimens from the whole length of the
Rocky Mountain chain in the United States have for years been referred to
monticola. Some of these, as I have pointed out, belong to S. v. longiquus, and
others are intergrades between S. v. obscurus and S. v. vagrans. Since vagrans
and monticola resemble one another somewhat, and since topotypes of S. v.
monticola actually show the influence of intergradation with obscurus, it is
easy to understand how intergrades between obscurus and vagrans could have
been assigned to monticola.

Throughout most of its range, S. v. monticola is the only Sorex present. In
some places monticola may occur with S. nanus or S. merriami. S. v. monticola
occurs with the water shrew in southeastern Arizona.

Sorex vagrans orizabae, Jackson, N. Amer. Fauna, 51:113, July 24, 1928.

Type.       Adult female, skin and skull; No. 53633, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.;
obtained on April 24, 1893, by E. W. Nelson from W slope of Mt. Orizaba,
9,500 ft., Puebla.

Range.       Transverse volcanic belt of mountains at the southern end of the
Mexican Plateau.

[Pg 52]
Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; measurements of 3 specimens from
Volcan Toluca, Mexico, are: total length, 98, 100, 108; tail, 35, 39, 40; hind
foot, 13, 13, 14. Summer pelage Mummy Brown tending toward Olive Brown;
Fuscous to Fuscous-Black in winter; skull and teeth relatively narrow.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. monticola see account of that
subspecies.

Remarks.       The range of S. v. orizabae probably is not now in contact with
that of any other subspecies of S. vagrans, although judging by the slight degree
of difference between orizabae and monticola the separation
between the two has not been of great duration.

Sorex vagrans orizabae occurs with S. saussurei saussurei throughout the
transverse volcanic belt.

Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 8 topotypes are: total length, 104.1 (99-109); tail, 43.3 (42-45); hind foot,
12.9 (12-14). Summer pelage ranging from (15      k) Cinnamon Brown through

Fuscous Black to (17                        m) Chaetura Black.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. monticola see account of that
subspecies. Differs from S. v. halicoetes in relatively narrower and more attenuate
rostrum and in less brownish underparts in winter pelage; smaller and
more brownish (less grayish) than Sorex vagrans from the southern Sierra
Nevada.

Remarks.       Restriction of the range of S. v. monticola to Arizona
and New Mexico leaves shrews that were formerly assigned to this
subspecies from Utah, Idaho, Washington and southern British
Columbia unassigned. Several names are available for consideration.
The name Sorex vagrans dobsoni Merriam, 1891, type locality
Alturas Lake, Blaine Co., Idaho, was once applied to small shrews
from Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, but was considered by
Jackson to be synonymous with S. v. monticola. The name Sorex
vagrans amoenus Merriam, 1895, type locality near Mammoth, Mono
Co., California, has been applied to wandering shrews from western
Nevada, northeastern California and southern Oregon. Sorex vagrans
nevadensis Merriam, 1895, type locality Reese River on Nye-Lander
Co. line, Nevada was considered by Hall (1946:119) to be
synonymous with S. v. amoenus. Specimens of Sorex vagrans west
[Pg 54]
of the Cascade Mountains have long been referred to the nominate
subspecies which has its type locality at Willapa Bay, Pacific Co.,
Washington. Over so wide an area it is only to be expected that
some geographic variation is to be found. Thus specimens from
central Nevada average slightly paler in summer pelage than those
from the Pacific Coast or from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
In addition there are slight average differences in size from place
to place. Topotypes of S. v. vagrans, however, show a fair degree
of variability and some are nearly as pale as the paler Great Basin
stocks. Furthermore topotypical individuals of vagrans can be lost
in series of S. v. amoenus, although amoenus is shorter-tailed on the
average. Specimens from the western foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains
show an amazing series of relationships with the montane S. v.
obscurus. In Utah, as previously pointed out, complete intergradation
occurs. At 1 mi. N Heath, Washington Co., Idaho, the lowland
and the highland forms approach each other within a short distance
and still maintain a degree of distinctness, especially in size. In
northwestern Montana intergradation is extensive (Clothier, 1950).
In northeastern Washington distinctly separable populations occur
within a few miles of one another. In southern British Columbia
some populations are clearly intergrades while at 6 mi. S Yahk
intergradation seemingly has not taken place. Where some intergradation
has occurred the result often has been increased size of the
lowland shrews, although they usually retain the reddish summer
pelage rather than acquiring the more grayish pelage of obscurus.
The name dobsoni was based upon shrews from a place where lowland
and highland forms occur almost together with only a slight
amount of intergradation. Examples of "dobsoni" may not with
certainty be distinguished from typical vagrans except that they
are, as Merriam (1895:68-69) points out, somewhat larger. Merriam
(loc. cit.) further notes that dobsoni is "intermediate in size
and cranial characters between S. vagrans and obscurus;" a statement
which hits very close to the heart of the matter. I consider
the name dobsoni to apply to intergrades. To attempt to apply the
name to the highly variable populations of intergrades from British
Columbia to southern Idaho seems inadvisable. I have examined
the possibility of using the name amoenus for the animals from this
region. The characters which set amoenus apart from vagrans,
slightly shorter tail and slightly darker summer pelage, however,
are not universally found in shrews from the Columbian Plateau
and eastern Great Basin and furthermore these differences between
amoenus and vagrans do not seem to me to be of great enough
[Pg 55]
magnitude to warrant subspecific recognition of the former. Thus
the name S. v. vagrans may apply to shrews in the region under
consideration. The subspecies, as thus thought of, embraces several
incipient subspecies, namely (1) the populations on the isolated
mountain ranges of Nevada, (2) the coastal rain forest population
and possibly (3) the population on the Columbian Plateau.

In western British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon no evidences
of intergradation between S. v. vagrans and the races setosus,
permiliensis, bairdi, yaquinae, or pacificus are seen. In this region
S. v. vagrans occurs sympatrically with one or the other of these subspecies.
Different degrees of differentiation thus obtain between
the subspecies vagrans as here defined and the surrounding subspecies
of Sorex vagrans to wit: complete intergradation and
allopatry in Utah with S. v. obscurus; partial intergradation and
partial sympatry with S. v. obscurus in the foothill region from Idaho
to British Columbia; no intergradation and complete sympatry with
all the other races of Sorex vagrans from the Cascades to the coast
and south to San Francisco Bay. The relationship of S. v. vagrans to
the wandering shrews of the high Sierra is discussed on page 58.

Throughout most of the Great Basin and Columbian Plateau Sorex
vagrans is, with the exception of the rare S. merriami and S. preblei,
the only small shrew. In the Cascades and in the coastal lowlands
it is the only small shrew except for S. cinereus and S. trigonirostris,
both extremely rare and local in this region. S. vagrans seemingly
competes to a certain extent with the larger S. trowbridgii in western
Washington and seems to be partially dominant to trowbridgii, at
least in marshy habitats (Dalquest, 1941:171).

Sorex vagrans obscuroides new subspecies

Type.       First year female, skin and skull; No. 30064/42074, U. S. Biol. Surv.
Coll.; obtained on August 9, 1891, by Frank Stephens from Bishop Creek, 6600
ft., Inyo Co., California, original no. 811.

Range.       The Sierra Nevada of California, north at least to El Dorado
County, intergrading northerly with S. v. vagrans.

Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 5 topotypes are: total length, 107 (103-112); tail, 47 (45-50); hind foot,
12.8 (12-13.5). Skull relatively broad interorbitally; color of dorsum in summer
pelage nearest (17                  k) Olive Brown.

Comparisons.       Differs from S. v. vagrans, with which it intergrades to the
north, in: longer tail and total length; skull larger and relatively broader
interorbitally; color in summer grayer (less reddish), the lighter subterminal
color bands of the hair often showing through the darker tips and imparting
a grizzled appearance to the dorsum. Differs from S. v. parvidens to the south
in: skull relatively broader interorbitally and less flattened; teeth slightly larger.

Remarks.       S. v. obscuroides has long been called S. v. obscurus. In fact,
obscuroides is separated from the range of obscurus by the intervening, smaller
subspecies S. v. vagrans. S. v. obscuroides resembles S. v. obscurus in color
and size but the skull is smaller, although relatively slightly broader. The resemblance
in color is possibly due to the fact that obscuroides, like obscurus,
is a high mountain form. S. v. obscuroides intergrades with S. v. vagrans
along the crest of the Sierra between Yosemite National Park and Lassen Peak
and on the eastern slope of the Sierra from approximately Mammoth northward.
Specimens from Donner are intergrades but are closest to S. v. vagrans.
Although all specimens from Lassen Peak are referable to S. v. vagrans, some
show cranial characters of obscuroides.

Sorex vagrans parvidens Jackson

Sorex obscurus parvidens Jackson, Jour. Mamm., 2:161, August 19, 1921.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 56561, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.; obtained
on October 3, 1893, by J. E. McLellan from Thurmans Camp, Bluff Lake,
7500 ft., San Bernardino Mts., California.

Range.       Confined, so far as known, to the San Bernardino and San Gabriel
mountains, San Bernardino Co., California.

Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; measurements of two specimens
from the San Bernardino Mountains are: total length, 105, 106; tail, 41, 48;
hind foot, 12, 14. Upper parts in summer Olive-Brown to Buffy-Brown;
[Pg 59]
cranium flattened and relatively narrow; unicuspids and incisors relatively
small.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. obscuroides, the only adjacent
subspecies, see the account of that subspecies.

Remarks.       S. v. parvidens is seemingly an uncommon mammal. I have been
informed by Terry Vaughan that repeated attempts by him to obtain it in
suitable habitat in the San Gabriel Mountains failed. This shrew is probably
no longer in reproductive continuity with Sorex vagrans of the Sierra Nevada.

Specimens examined.       Total number, 4. California: San Bernardino Co.:
type locality, 4 BS.

Marginal records.       California: Camp Baldy, San Antonio Canyon (Jackson,

Sorex vagrans halicoetes Grinnell

Sorex halicoetes Grinnell, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 10:183, March 20,
1913.

Sorex vagrans halicoetes, Jackson, N. Amer. Fauna, 51:108, July 24, 1928.

Type.       Young adult male, skin and skull; No. 3638, Mus. Vert. Zool.; obtained
on May 6, 1908, by Joseph Dixon from salt marsh near Palo Alto, Santa
Clara Co., California.

Range.       Marshes in the southern part of San Francisco Bay, California.

Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; measurements of two topotypes are:
total length, 105, 106; tail, 39, 40; hind foot, 12, 13. Upper parts in winter
Chaetura Black or near Fuscous-Black; underparts brownish; upper parts in
summer near (17      m) Mummy Brown; underparts with a decided buffy wash,
near (15      d) Light Ochraceous Buff; rostrum relatively large; maxillary tooth-row
relatively long; teeth relatively large.

Comparisons.       Darker ventrally, both summer and winter, than S. v. vagrans;
slightly more reddish dorsally in summer pelage than S. v. vagrans, rostrum and
teeth relatively larger; smaller externally than S. v. paludivagus, paler; skull
longer, narrower cranially and broader rostrally.

Remarks.       This subspecies seems to be restricted to salt marshes where
it occurs with Sorex ornatus.

Sorex vagrans paludivagus von Bloeker

Sorex vagrans paludivagus von Bloeker, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 52:93,
June 5, 1939.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 5053, Los Angeles Museum of
History, Science and Art, obtained on November 3, 1938, by Jack C. von
Bloeker, Jr., from salt marsh at mouth of Elkhorn Slough, Moss Landing,
Monterey Co., California, original no. 9456.

Diagnosis.       Size medium for the species; average and extreme measurements
of 6 topotypes are: total length, 115 (113-118); tail, 46.5 (42-48); hind foot,
14.5 (14-15) (von Bloeker, 1939:94). In winter nearly black dorsally, deep
mouse gray ventrally; in summer nearly as dark dorsally as in winter, hairs of
[Pg 60]
venter tipped with Clove Brown; skull short, relatively broad cranially and
relatively narrow rostrally.

Comparisons.       For comparison with S. v. halicoetes see account of that
subspecies.

Remarks.       This subspecies, occurring at the limits of the range of the species,
is uncommon in most collections. Seven specimens were available for the
original description. The summer pelage is not completely described in the
original description, but is stated to be darker than the winter pelage of S. v.
vagrans, and must thus be considerably darker than the summer pelage of
S. v. halicoetes. Two specimens in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, from
San Gregario, referred by Jackson to S. v. halicoetes, were included in the
present subspecies by von Bloeker.

Specimens examined.       None.

Co.: San Gregario. Monterey Co.: Seaside; mouth of Salinas River; Moss
Landing.

Sorex vagrans vancouverensis Merriam

Sorex vancouverensis Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 10:70, December 31, 1895.

Sorex vagrans vancouverensis, Jackson, N. Amer. Fauna, 51:106, July, 1928.

Type.       Adult male, skin and skull; No. 71913, U. S. Biol. Surv. Coll.;
obtained on May 10, 1895, by Clark P. Streator, from Goldstream, Vancouver
Island, British Columbia.

Range.       Vancouver Island from Sayward south, and Bowen Island.

Diagnosis.       Size small for the species; average and extreme measurements of
6 specimens from Alberni Valley, Vancouver Island, are: total length, 106.5
(97-115); tail, 41.7 (40-43); hind foot, 12 (11-13) (Jackson, 1928:107).
Ventral parts brownish, winter pelage reddish brown rather than grayish.

Comparisons.       Differs from S. v. vagrans in more brownish ventral parts
and more brownish, rather than grayish, winter pelage; differs from the sympatric
S. v. isolatus in shorter tail, shorter hind foot, more narrow skull, and
smaller teeth.

Remarks.       This is a poorly differentiated subspecies which is closely related
to S. v. vagrans. The differences in color noted are average ones. Some individuals
of this shrew might be difficult to separate from S. v. isolatus. The
slight degree of morphological divergence is such that intergrades might be
expected to occur. Possibly some habitat separation occurs, but such has not
been reported.

Specimens examined.       Total number, 3. British Columbia: Vancouver Island:
Mt. Washington, 1 KU; Nanaimo, 1 BS; type locality, 1 BS.

Marginal records.       British Columbia: Sayward (Anderson, 1947:18);

CONCLUSIONS




  1.
  Sorex vagrans, S. obscurus, S. pacificus,
    and S. yaquinae are conspecific with one another. Each is
    a valid subspecies but all should bear the specific name Sorex
    vagrans Baird, 1858.


  2.[Pg 61]
  The subspecies of Sorex vagrans form a cline from large
    (pacificus) to small (vagrans). The cline is bent in
    such a manner that the terminal subspecies occur together. Where
    the two subspecies occur together, individuals of one subspecies do
    not crossbreed with individuals of the other subspecies and
    therefore react toward one another as do full species. Sorex
    vagrans vagrans occurs sympatrically with S. v. sonomae,
    S. v. pacificus, S. v. yaquinae, S. v. bairdi,
    S. v. permiliensis, and S. v. setosus. S. v.
    vancouverensis occurs sympatrically with S. v. isolatus.


  3.
  The sympatric existence of the terminal subspecies of the Sorex
    vagrans rassenkreis is made possible by marked differences
    between them in size and in ecological preference.


  4.
  The west-coast subspecies, sonomae, pacificus,
    yaquinae, bairdi, and permiliensis probably
    differentiated from the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain subspecies,
    vagrans, obscurus and monticola, during a
    separation caused first by aridity in the Great Basin, and secondly
    by glaciation of the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada,
    possibly in the Sangamonian and Wisconsinan ages respectively.


  5.
  Sorex v. vagrans originated in the Great Basin and arrived
    on the Pacific Coast after the last deglaciation of the Cascades
    and Sierra Nevada.


  6.
  In S. vagrans, heterogonic growth is illustrated; the
    larger the skull, the larger the rostrum in proportion to the skull
    as a whole.


  7.
  In the species S. vagrans, size and color vary geographically
    more than do other features.


  8.
  The S. ornatus group, S. longirostris, and S.
    veraepacis had a common ancestor with S. vagrans, possibly
    in the Illinoian Age.


  9.
  S. vagrans, the S. ornatus group, S. veraepacis,
    S. longirostris, S. palustris, S. bendiri, and
    the S. cinereus group, because of structural resemblances,
    should be placed in a single subgenus, Otisorex. S.
    trowbridgii, the S. arcticus group, the S. saussurei
    group, S. merriami, S. fumeus, and S. dispar,
    should be included in the subgenus Sorex.


  10.
  Sorex cinereus occurs with the medium-sized and large-sized
    S. vagrans in the Rocky Mountains and in Canada, but does not
    occur with the smaller subspecies of S. vagrans, probably
    because competition between two shrews of like size excludes
    S. cinereus.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
