      THE MOTHERS OF HONORÉ
    
    
      From "Mackinac And Lake Stories", 1899   By Mary Hartwell
      Catherwood
    
    
       
    
    
      The sun was shining again after squalls, and the strait showed violet,
      green, red, and bronze lines, melting and intermingling each changing
      second. Metallic lustres shone as if some volcanic fountain on the
      lake-bed were spraying the surface. Jules McCarty stood at his gate,
      noting this change in the weather with one eye. He was a small, old man,
      having the appearance of a mummied boy. His cheek-bones shone apple-red,
      and his partial blindness had merely the effect of a prolonged wink. Jules
      was keeping melancholy holiday in his best clothes, the well-preserved
      coat parting its jaunty tails a little below the middle of his back.
    
    
      Another old islander paused at the gate in passing, The two men shook
      their heads at each other.
    
    
      "I went to your wife's funeral this morning, Jules," said the passer,
      impressing on the widower's hearing an important fact which might have
      escaped his one eye.
    
    
      "You was at de funer'l? Did you see Thérèse?"
    
    
      "Yes, I saw her."
    
    
      "Ah, what a fat woman dat was! I make some of de peop' feel her arm. I
      feed her well."
    
    
      The other old man smiled, but he was bound to say,
    
    
      "I'm sorry for you, Jules."
    
    
      "Did you see me at de church?"
    
    
      "Yes, I went to the church."
    
    
      "You t'ink I feel bad&mdash;eh?"
    
    
      "I thought you felt pretty bad."
    
    
      "You go to de graveyard, too?"
    
    
      "No," admitted his sympathizer, reluctantly, "I didn't go to the
      graveyard."
    
    
      "But dat was de fines'. You ought see me at de graveyard. You t'ink I feel
      bad at de church&mdash;I raise hell at de graveyard."
    
    
      The friend shuffled his feet and coughed behind his hand.
    
    
      "Yes, I feel bad, me," ruminated the bereaved man. "You get used to some
      woman in de house and not know where to get anodder."
    
    
      "Haven't you had your share, Jules?" inquired his friend, relaxing gladly
      to banter.
    
    
      "I have one fine wife, maman to Honoré," enumerated Jules, "and de squaw,
      and Lavelotte's widow, and Thérèse. It is not much."
    
    
      "I've often wondered why you didn't take Me-linda Crée. You've no
      objection to Indians. She's next door to you, and she knows how to nurse
      in sickness, besides being a good washer and ironer. The summer folks say
      she makes the best fish pies on the island."
    
    
      "It is de trut'!" exclaimed Jules, a new light shining in his dim blue eye
      as he turned it towards the house of Melinda Crée. The weather-worn, low
      domicile was bowered in trees. There was a convenient stile two steps high
      in the separating fence, and it had long been made a thoroughfare by the
      families. On the top step sat Clethera, Melinda Crée's granddaughter.
      Clethera had been Honoré's playmate since infancy. She was a lithe, dark
      girl, with more of her French father in her than of her half-breed mother.
      Some needle-work busied her hands, but her ear caught every accent of the
      conference at the gate. She flattened her lips, and determined to tell
      Honoré as soon as he came in with the boat. Honoré was the favorite
      skipper of the summer visitors. He went out immediately after the funeral
      to earn money to apply on his last mother's burial expenses.
    
    
      When the old men parted, Clethera examined her grandmother with stealthy
      eyes in a kind of aboriginal reconnoitring. Melinda Cree's black hair and
      dark masses of wrinkles showed through a sashless shed window where she
      stood at her ironing-board. Her stoical eyelids were lowered, and she
      moved with the rhythmical motion of the smoothing-iron. Whether she had
      overheard the talk, or was meditating on her own matrimonial troubles, was
      impossible to gather from facial muscles rigid as carved wood. Melinda
      Crée was one of the few pure-blooded Indians on the island. If she was
      fond of anything in the world, her preference had not declared itself,
      though previous to receiving her orphaned granddaughter into her house she
      had consented to become the bride of a drunken youth in his teens. This
      incipient husband&mdash;before he got drowned in a squall off Detour,
      thereby saving his aged wife some outlay&mdash;visited her only when he
      needed funds, and she silently paid the levy if her toil had provided the
      means. He also inclined to offer delicate attentions to Clethera, who spat
      at him like a cat, and at sight of him ever afterwards took to the attic,
      locking the door.
    
    
      But while Melinda Crée submitted to the shackles of civilization, she did
      not entirely give up the ways of her own people. She kept a conical tent
      of poles and birch bark in her back yard, in which she slept during
      summer. And she was noted as wise and skilled in herbs, guarding their
      secrets so jealously that the knowledge was likely to die with her. Once
      she appeared at the bedside of a dying islander, and asked, as the doctor
      had withdrawn, to try her own remedies. Permission being given, she went
      to the kitchen, took some dried vegetable substance from her pocket, and
      made a tea of it. A little was poured down the sick man's throat. He
      revived. He drank more, and grew better. Melinda Cree's decoction cured
      him, and the chagrined doctor visited her to learn what wonderful remedy
      she had used.
    
    
      "It was nothing but some little bushes," responded the Indian woman.
    
    
      "If you tell me what they are, I will pay you fifty dollars," he pleaded.
    
    
      Melinda Crée shook her head. She continued to repeat, as he raised the bid
      higher, "It was nothing but some little bushes, doctor; it was nothing but
      some little bushes."
    
    
      Clethera felt the same kind of protecting tenderness for this
      self-restrained squaw that Honoré had for his undersized parent, whom he
      always called by the baptismal name. Melinda had been the wife of a great
      medicine-man, who wore a trailing blanket, and white gulls' wings bound
      around and spread behind his head. During his lifetime he was often seen
      stretched on his back invoking the sun. A stranger observing him declared
      he was using the signs of Freemasonry, and must know its secrets.
    
    
      With the readiness of custom, Honoré and Clethera met each other at the
      steps in the fence about dusk. She sat down on her side, and he sat down
      on his, the broad top of the stile separating them. Honoré was a stalwart
      Saxon-looking youth in his early twenties. Wind and weather had painted
      his large-featured countenance a rosy tan. By the employing class Honoré
      was considered one of the finest and most promising young quarter-breeds
      on the island.
    
    
      The fresh moist odor of the lake, with its incessant wash upon pebbles,
      came to them accompanied by piercing sweetness of wild roses. For the wind
      had turned to the west, raking fragrant thickets. Dusk was moving from
      eastern fastnesses to rock battlements still tinged with sunset. The fort,
      dismantled of its garrison, reared a whitewashed crown against the
      island's back of evergreens.
    
    
      Both Honoré and Clethera knew there was a Spanish war. As summer day
      followed summer day, the village seethed with it, as other spots then
      seethed. A military post, even when dismantled, always brings home to the
      community where it is situated the dignity and pomp of arms. Young men
      enlisted, and Honoré restlessly followed, with a friend from the North
      Shore, to look at the camp. His pulses beat with the drums. But he was
      carrying the burden of the family; to leave Jules and Jules's dependent
      wife would be deserting infants.
    
    
      Clethera gave little more thought to fleets sailing tropical seas than to
      La Salle's vanished Griffin on Northern waters. It was nothing to
      her, for she had never heard of it, that pioneers of her father's blood
      once trod that island, and lifted up the cross at St. Ignace, and planted
      outposts along the South Shore. Bareheaded, or with a crimson kerchief
      bound about her hair, she loved to help her grandmother spread the white
      clothes to bleach, or to be seen and respected as a prosperous laundress
      carrying her basket through the teeming streets. The island was her world.
      Its crowds in summer brought variety enough; and its virgin winter snows,
      the dog-sledges, the ice-boats, were month by month a procession of joys.
    
    
      Clethera wondered that Honoré persistently went where newspapers were read
      and discussed. He stuffed them in his pockets, and pored over them while
      waiting in his boat beside the wharf. People would fight out that war with
      Spain. What thrilled her was the boom of winter surf, piling iridescent
      frozen spume as high as a man's head, and rimming the island in a corona
      of shattered rainbows. And she had an eye for summer lightning infusing
      itself through sheets of water as if descending in the downpour,
      glorifying for one instant every distinct drop.
    
    
      The pair sitting with the broad top step betwixt them exchanged the
      smiling good-will of youth.
    
    
      "I take some more party out to-night for de light-moon sail," said Honoré,
      pleased to report his prosperity. "It is consider' gran' to sail in de
      light-moon."
    
    
      "Did you find de hot fish pie?" inquired Clethera, solicitous about man
      thrown on his own resources as cook.
    
    
      Honoré acknowledged with hearty gratitude the supper which Melinda Crée
      had baked and her granddaughter had carried into the bereaved house while
      its inmates were out.
    
    
      "They not get fish pie like that in de war. Jules, he say it is better
      than poor Thérèse could make," Honoré added, handsomely, with large
      unsuspicion.
    
    
      Clethera shook a finger in his face.
    
    
      "Honoré McCarty, you got watch dat Jules! I got to watch Melinda. Simon
      Leslie, he have come by and put it in Jules' head since de funer'l! I hear
      it, me."
    
    
      The young man's face changed through the dusk.
    
    
      He braced his back against the fence and breathed the deep sigh of tried
      patience.
    
    
      "Honoré, how many mothers is it you have already?"
    
    
      "I have not count'," said the young man, testily.
    
    
      "Count dem mothers," ordered Clethera.
    
    
      "Maman," he began the enumeration, reverently. His companion allowed him a
      minute's silence after the mention of that fine woman.
    
    
      "One," she tallied.
    
    
      "Nex'," proceeded Honoré, "poor Jules is involve' with de Chippewa woman."
    
    
      "Two," clinched Clethera.
    
    
      The Chippewa squaw was a sore theme. She had entered Jules's wigwam in
      good faith; but during one of his merry carouses, while both Honoré and
      the priest were absent, he traded her off to a North Shore man for a
      horse. Long after she tramped away across the frozen strait with her new
      possessor, and all trace of her was lost, Jules had the grace to be
      shamefaced about the scandal; but he got a good bargain in the horse.
    
    
      "Then there is Lavelotte's widow," continued Honoré.
    
    
      "Three," marked Clethera.
    
    
      Yes, there was Lavelotte's widow, the worst of all. She whipped little
      Jules unmercifully, and if Honoré had not taken his part and stood before
      him, she might have ended by being Jules's widow. She stripped him of his
      whole fortune, four hundred dollars, when he finally obtained a separation
      from her. But instead of curing him, this experience only whetted his zest
      for another wife.
    
    
      "And there is Thérèse." Honoré did not say, "Last, Thérèse." While Jules
      lived and his wives died, or were traded off or divorced, there would be
      no last.
    
    
      "It is four," declared Clethera; and the count was true. Honoré had taken
      Jules in hand like a father, after the adventure with Lavelotte's widow.
      He made his parent work hard at the boat, and in winter walked him to and
      from mass literally with hand on collar. He encouraged the little man,
      moreover, with a half interest in their house on the beach, which
      long-accumulated earnings of the boat paid for. But all this care was
      thrown away; though after Jules brought Thérèse home, and saw that Honoré
      was not appeased by a woman's cooking, he had qualms about the homestead,
      and secretly carried the deed back to the original owner.
    
    
      "I want you keep my part of de deed," he explained. "I not let some more
      women rob Honoré. My wife, if she get de deed in her han', she might sell
      de whole t'ing!"
    
    
      "Why, no, Jules, she couldn't sell your real estate!" the former owner
      declared. "She would only have a life interest in your share."
    
    
      "You say she couldn't sell it?"
    
    
      "No. She would have nothing but a life interest."
    
    
      "She have only life interest? By gar! I t'ink I pay somebody twenty dollar
      to kill her!"
    
    
      But lacking both twenty dollars and determination, he lived peaceably with
      Thérèse until she died a natural death, on that occasion proudly doing his
      whole duty as a man and a mourner.
    
    
      Remembering these affairs, which had not been kept secret from anybody on
      the island, Clethera spoke out under conviction.
    
    
      "Honoré, it a scandal' t'ing, to get marry."
    
    
      "Me, I t'ink so too," assented Honoré.
    
    
      "Jules McCarty have disgrace' his son!"
    
    
      "Melinda Crée," retorted Honoré, obliged to defend his own, "she take a
      little 'usban' honly nineteen."
    
    
      "She 'ave no chance like Jules; she is oblige' to wait and take what
      invite her."
    
    
      The voices of children from other quarter-breed cottages, playing along
      the beach, added cheer to the sweet darkness. Clethera and Honoré sat
      silently enjoying each other's company, unconscious that their aboriginal
      forefathers had courted in that manner, sitting under arbors of branches.
    
    
      "Why do peop' want to get marry?" propound ed Clethera.
    
    
      "I don't know," said Honoré.
    
    
      "Me, if some man hask me, I box his ear! I have know you all my life&mdash;but
      don' you never hask me to get marry!"
    
    
      "I not such a fool," heartily responded Honoré. "You and me, we have seen
      de folly. I not form de habit, like Jules."
    
    
      "But what we do, Honoré, to keep dat Jules and dat Melinda apart?"
    
    
      Though they discussed many plans, the sequel showed that nothing effectual
      could be done. All their traditions and instincts were against making
      themselves disagreeable or showing discourtesy to their elders. The young
      man's French and Irish and Chippewa blood, and the young girl's French and
      Crée blood exhausted all their inherited diplomacy. But as steadily as the
      waters set like a strong tide through the strait, in spite of wind which
      combed them to ridging foam, the rapid courtship of age went on.
    
    
      In carrying laundered clothing through the village street, Melinda Crée
      was carefully chaperoned by her granddaughter, and Honoré kept Jules under
      orders in the boat. But of early mornings and late twilights there was no
      restraining the twittering widower.
    
    
      "Melinda 'tend to her work and is behave if Jules let her alone," Clethera
      reported to Honoré. "But he slip around de garden and talk over de back
      fence, and he is by de ironing-board de minute my back is turn'! If he
      belong to me, I could 'mos' whip him!"
    
    
      "Jules McCarty," declared Honoré, with some bitterness, "when he fix his
      min' to marry some more, he is not turn' if he is hexcommunicate'!"
    
    
      Jules, indeed, became so bold that he crowded across the stile through the
      very conferences of the pair united to prevent him; and his loud voice
      could be heard beside Melinda's ironing-board, proclaiming in the manner
      of a callow young suitor.
    
    
      "Some peop' like separate us, Melinda, but we not let them."
    
    
      The conflict of Honoré and Clethera with Jules and Melinda ended one day
      in August. There had been no domestic clamor in this silent grapple of
      forces. The young man used no argument except maxims and morals and a
      tightening of authority; the young girl permitted neither neighboring
      maids nor the duties of religion to lure her off guard. It may be said of
      any French half-breed that he has all the instincts of gentility except an
      inclination to lying, and that arises from excessive politeness.
    
    
      Honoré came to the fence at noon and called Clethera. In his excitement he
      crossed the stile and stood on her premises.
    
    
      "It no use, Clethera. Jules have tell me this morning he have arrange' de
      marriage."
    
    
      Clethera glanced behind her at the house she called home, and threw
      herself in Honoré's arms, as she had often done in childish despairs.
      Neither misunderstood the action, and it relieved them to shed a few tears
      on each other's necks. This truly Latin outburst being over, they stood
      apart and wiped their eyes on their sleeves.
    
    
      "It no use," exclaimed Clethera, "to set a good examp' to your
      grandmother!"
    
    
      "I not wait any longer now," announced Honoré, giving rein to fierce
      eagerness. "I go to de war to-day."
    
    
      "But de camp is move'," objected Clethera.
    
    
      "I have pass' de examin', and I know de man to go to when I am ready; he
      promis' to get me into de war. Jules have de sails up now, ready to take
      me across to de train."
    
    
      "But who will have de boat when you are gone, Honoré?"
    
    
      "Jules. And he bring Melinda to de house."
    
    
      "She not come. She not leave her own house. She take her 'usban' in."
    
    
      "Then Jules must rent de house. You not detest poor Jules?"
    
    
      "I not detest him like de hudder one."
    
    
      "Au 'voir, Clethera."
    
    
      "Au 'voir, Honoré."
    
    
      They shook hands, the young man wringing him-self away with the animation
      of one who goes, the girl standing in the dull anxiety of one who stays.
      War, so remote that she had heard of it indifferently, rushed suddenly
      from the tropics over the island.
    
    
      "Are your clothes all mend' and ready, Honoré?"
    
    
      But what thought can a young man give to his clothes when about to wrap
      himself in glory? He is politely tapping at the shed window of the Indian
      woman, and touching his cap in farewell and gallant capitulation, and with
      long-limbed sweeping haste, unusual in a quarter-breed, he is gone to the
      docks, with a bundle under one arm, waving his hand as he passes. All the
      women and children along the street would turn out to see him go to the
      war if his intention were known, and even summer idlers about the bazars
      would look at him with new interest.
    
    
      Clethera could not imagine the moist and horrid heat of those southern
      latitudes into which Honoré departed to throw himself. Shifting mists on
      the lake rim were no vaguer than her conception of her country's mighty
      undertaking. But she could feel; and the life she had lived to that day
      was wrenched up by the roots, leaving her as with a bleeding socket.
    
    
      All afternoon she drenched herself with soapsuds in the ferocity of her
      washing. By the time Jules returned with the boat, the lake was black as
      ink under a storm cloud, with glints of steel; a dull bar stretched
      diagonally across the water. Beyond that a whitening of rain showed
      against the horizon. Points of cedars on the opposite island pricked a
      sullen sky.
    
    
      Clethera's tubs were under the trees. She paid no attention to what befell
      her, or to her grandmother, who called her out of the rain. It came like a
      powder of dust, and then a moving, blanched wall, pushing islands of
      flattened mist before it. Under a steady pour the waters turned dull
      green, and lightened shade by shade as if diluting an infusion of grass.
      Waves began to come in regular windrows. Though Clethera told herself
      savagely she not care for anything in de world, her Indian eye took joy of
      these sights. The shower-bath from the trees she endured without a shiver.
    
    
      Jules sat beside Melinda to be comforted He wept for Honoré, and praised
      his boy, gasconading with time-worn boasts.
    
    
      "I got de hang of him, and now I got to part! But de war will end, now
      Honoré have gone into it. His gran'fodder was such a fighter when de
      British come to take de island, he turn' de cannon and blow de British
      off. The gran'fodder of Honoré was a fine man. He always keep de bes'
      liquors and by wines on his sideboa'd."
    
    
      When Honoré had been gone twenty-four hours, and Jules was still idling
      like a boy undriven by his task-master, leaving the boat to rock under
      bare poles at anchor on the rise and fall of the water, Clethera went into
      their empty house. It contained three rooms, and she laid violent hands on
      male housekeeping. The service was almost religious, like preparing linen
      for an altar. It comforted her unacknowledged anguish, which increased
      rather than diminished, the unrest of which she resented with all her
      stoic Indian nature.
    
    
      Nets, sledge-harness, and Honoré's every-day clothes hung on his
      whitewashed wall. The most touching relic of any man is the hat he has
      worn. Honoré's cap crowned the post of his bed like a wraith. The room
      might have been a young hermit's cell in a cave, or a tunnel in the
      evergreens, it was so simple and bare of human appointments. Clethera
      stood with the broom in one hand, and tipped forward a piece of broken
      looking-glass on his shaving-shelf. A new, unforeseen Clethera, whom she
      had never been obliged to deal with before, gave her a desperate, stony
      stare out of a haggard face. She was young, her skin had not a line. But
      it was as if she had changed places with her wrinkled grandmother, to whom
      the expression of complacent maidenhood now belonged.
    
    
      As Clethera propped the glass again in place, she heard Jules come in. She
      resumed her sweeping with resolute strokes on the bare boards, which would
      explain to his ear the necessity of her presence. He appeared at the door,
      and it was Honoré!
    
    
      
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It was Honoré, shamefaced but laughing, back from the war within
      twenty-four hours! Clethera heard the broom-handle strike the floor as one
      hears the far-off fall of a spar on a ship in harbor. She put her palms
      together, without flying into his arms or even offering to shake hands.
    
    
      "You come back?" she cried out, her voice sharpened by joy.
    
    
      "The war is end'," said Honoré. "Peace is declare' yesterday!" He threw
      his bundle down and looked fondly around the rough walls. "All de peop'
      laugh at me because I go to war when de war is end'!"
    
    
      "They laugh because de war is end'! I laugh too?" said Clethera, relaxing
      to sobs. Tears and cries which had been shut up a day and a night were let
      loose with French abandon. Honoré opened his arms to comfort her in the
      old manner, and although she rushed into them, strange embarrassment went
      with her. The two could not look at each other.
    
    
      "It is de 'omesick," she explained. "When you go to war it make me
      'omesick."
    
    
      "Me, too," owned Honoré. "I never know what it is before. I not mind de
      fighting, but I am glad de war is end', account of de 'omesick!"
    
    
      He pushed the hair from her wet face. The fate of temperament and the deep
      tides of existence had them in merciless sweep.
    
    
      "Clethera," represented Honoré, "the rillation is not mix' bad with Jules
      and Melinda."
    
    
      Clethera let the assertion pass unchallenged.
    
    
      "And this house, it pretty good house. You like it well as de hudder?"
    
    
      "It have no loft," responded Clethera, faintly, "but de chimney not
      smoke."
    
    
      "We not want de 'omesick some more, Clethera&mdash;eh? You t'ink de fools
      is all marry yet?"
    
    
      Clethera laughed and raised her head from his arm, but not to look at him
      or box his ear. She looked through the open door at an oblong of little
      world, where the land was an amethyst strip betwixt lake and horizon.
      Across that beloved background she saw the future pass: hale, long years
      with Honoré; the piled up wood of winter fires; her own home; her children&mdash;the
      whole scheme of sweet and humble living.
    
    
      "You t'ink, after all de folly we have see' in de family, Clethera, you
      can go de lenk&mdash;to get marry?"
    
    
      "I go dat lenk for you, Honoré&mdash;but not for any huddur man."

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
