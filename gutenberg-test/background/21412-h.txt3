SOMEBODY IS EXPECTED


On May Day the feathered folk in Pleasant
Valley began to stop, look and listen.
They were expecting somebody.

"Have you seen him?" Rusty Wren
asked Jolly Robin.

Jolly Robin said that he hadn't; but he
added that he was on the lookout.

"Have you heard his song?" little Mr.
Chippy inquired eagerly of Mr. Blackbird.

p. 2
"No!" that dusky rascal replied. "Not
yet! Maybe he isn't coming here this
summer." Mr. Blackbird liked to tease
little Mr. Chippy. And generally when
he tried to, he succeeded.

"Oh! Don't say that!" Mr. Chippy exclaimed.
"If I couldn't hear his gay voice
I shouldn't care to spend a summer here
myself."

Over the meadow, beyond the stone wall
where Mr. Chippy made his home in a
wild grapevine, Mr. Meadowlark flew to
the swampy place where the rushes grew,
just to find a Red-winged Blackbird that
he knew, in order to learn whether he had
seen or heard the friend everybody was
watching for.

Perched upon a swaying last year's cattail,
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird shook his
head in reply. And he said that no doubt
it would be a week before the looked-for
arrival. "The season's a bit backward,"p. 3
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird remarked.
"So I don't expect to set eyes on him to-day       though
I have known him to get here
as early as May Day."

Mr. Meadowlark confessed that he was
disappointed.

"It would be a much gayer May Day,"
he said, "if his rollicking song rang over
the meadow."

"What's the matter with your own singing?"
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird asked
him       meaning that in his opinion Mr.
Meadowlark had no reason to be ashamed
of his own voice.

"My song is not like his," Mr. Meadowlark
answered. And he sighed as he
spoke. "To be sure, some people are kind
enough to say that my singing is unusually
sweet. But you know yourself that there
isn't a songster anywhere that can carol
so joyfully as Bobby Bobolink."


p. 4Mr. Red-winged Blackbird did not dispute
that statement. How could he, when
the birds were all waiting so eagerly to
hear Bobby Bobolink's voice?

"He has a way"       Mr. Meadowlark
went on       "a way of making almost any
summer's day a gay holiday. He is just
bubbling over with happiness; and he can't
seem to get his notes out fast enough."

"Yes!" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird
chimed in. "He's a cheerful, happy-go-lucky
chap. And he wears gay clothes,
too."

"What's the matter with your own
clothes?" Mr. Meadowlark inquired       meaning
that in his opinion Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird's black suit, with the
shoulders scarlet and buff, was about as
striking as anybody could want.

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird was pleased.
Anybody could see that. He bowed andp. 5
spread his wings and tail, and uttered his
well-known call, "Conk-err-ee!" before he
made any reply.

"People often compliment me on my
taste in colors," he said at last. "And for
year-round wear I do think my suit is
about as good as anybody could ask for.
But you know yourself that during the
first half of the summer Bobby Bobolink
makes a cheerful sight, when his black and
white and buff back flashes above the
meadow."

And Mr. Meadowlark couldn't deny it;
for he knew that it was true.

THE LATEST ARRIVAL


Bobby Bobolink did not reach Pleasant
Valley in time to spend May Day with his
old friends of the summer before. And
although everybody was disappointed not
to see him       and hear him       the feathered
folk tried to be cheerful and told one another
that Bobby ought to arrive almost
any day.

"He always finds it hard to leave the
rice fields in the South," Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird observed with a knowing wink
at old Mr. Crow, as the two stopped for
a chat on the morning after May Day.
"It's rice-planting time in the South,"p. 7
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird explained.
"Somewhat like corn-planting time here!"
And he winked once more.

Although Mr. Crow was in the habit of
scratching up Farmer Green's newly-planted
corn, just as Bobby Bobolink uncovered
the freshly-sown rice in the South,
Mr. Crow never cared to have any of his
neighbors even hint that he did such a
thing. And now he glared at Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird, who continued to wink
at him.

"Is there something in your eye?" Mr.
Crow inquired in his coldest manner.

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird had no wish
to make Mr. Crow angry. So he stopped
winking at once.

"When you see your friend Bobby
Bobolink you'd better tell him to leave
the corn strictly alone," Mr. Crow remarked.
"Farmer Green expects to bep. 8gin
planting in about three weeks. And
he counts on me to watch the field for him.
If I catch Bobby Bobolink there he'll wish
he had stayed in the rice fields, down
South."

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird smiled. And
he told old Mr. Crow not to worry.

"Bobby Bobolink won't touch the
corn," he said. "During the first half of
the summer he lives on such things as
caterpillars and grasshoppers, with a bit
of grass-seed now and then."

Old Mr. Crow replied that he was glad
to know that.

"He's wise to leave the corn alone," he
added. "If Farmer Green was on the
lookout for him       with a gun handy       Bobby
Bobolink wouldn't act so care-free
as he generally does. He wouldn't sing
such rollicking songs in the meadow. And
now that you've mentioned how he spendsp. 9
his springs in the South, I don't wonder
that he appears glad to get to Pleasant
Valley. For you may well believe that
folks are not so fond of him down there
where the rice grows. And unless I'm
much mistaken the planters actually order
him out of their fields."

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird told Mr.
Crow that he hadn't a doubt that everything
Mr. Crow said was so. And he was
just about to remark that he should think
Mr. Crow must lead a care-free, happy-go-lucky
life in winter, in the South, because
Farmer Green always stayed in
Pleasant Valley the whole year round.
But as he opened his bill to speak he heard
a sound over in the meadow that made him
forget what was on the tip of his tongue.

"Did you hear that song?" he cried.
"Hurrah!"

Old Mr. Crow cocked his head on onep. 10
side and listened. "Yes!" he agreed.
"There's no doubt about it. Bobby Bobolink
is here at last!"

GREETINGS


As fast as they could fly, old Mr. Crow and
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird hurried over to
the meadow, where they had heard Bobby
Bobolink's bubbling notes.

They found him enjoying himself with
a lively company of careless bachelors       all
distant cousins of Bobby Bobolink       who
had travelled with him in a roistering
flock all the way from the South.

They were all wonderful singers       those
happy Bobolinks. They could scarcely
have kept still if they had wanted to. But
somehow Bobby Bobolink seemed to be
just a bit the best singer of the lot.


p. 12Perched on a fence-post, Mr. Meadowlark
was drinking in Bobby's merry
songs. Jolly Robin had stolen away from
the orchard to greet the newcomer and
listen to his first concert. And even
Rusty Wren had forsaken the cherry tree
beside the farmhouse. Although Rusty
and his wife were in the midst of putting
their summer house to rights, he had not
been able to resist telling Mrs. Wren, who
did not like to have him away from home,
that he must make a short visit in the meadow,
"to see a friend."

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird called
"Conk-err-ee!" several times to Bobby
Bobolink, meaning that he was glad Bobby
was back in Pleasant Valley and that he
hoped he was in good health, and that
Bobby certainly hadn't forgotten how to
sing.

As for old Mr. Crow, he winked atp. 13
Bobby Bobolink and said in a hoarse
voice, "I hear they're planting rice down
South."

Bobby Bobolink was not like Mr. Crow,
who would have flown into a rage had any
one made such a remark to him.

"I stayed a while in the rice fields," he
answered. "And if I hadn't come away
when I did," he added with a laugh, "I'd
have been too fat to fly way up here to
Pleasant Valley."

Then a torrent of notes came tumbling
out of his throat as he darted right over
the head of old Mr. Crow (who stood on
a hillock) and swerved and zigzagged and
wheeled through the air, until Mr. Crow
almost tied his neck into a knot, just
watching him.

"By the way," Mr. Meadowlark said in
an undertone to Mr. Red-winged Blackbird,
"our friend Bobby has a differentp. 14
suit from the one he wore when I last saw
him."

"When was that?" Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird inquired.

"About the middle of last summer!"
Mr. Meadowlark explained.

"Ah! This is the second suit he has
had since then," said Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird. "If you had been with us in
the swamp last fall you'd have known that
Bobby had a new one then. And here he
is now with still another."

Mr. Meadowlark looked a bit
troubled.

"I liked the black one       the black one
with the white and buff trimmings," he remarked.
"It was very becoming to Bobby
Bobolink. I was hoping he'd wear one like
it this summer."

"Wait!" was Mr. Red-winged Blackbird's
mysterious answer. "Wait! Andp. 15
I promise you won't be disappointed."

"Anyhow, he sings as well as ever," Mr.
Meadowlark declared.

SINGING FOR SOME ONE

The first few days of early May had
passed and with them had flitted       somewhere       most
of the jolly company in
which Bobby Bobolink had journeyed
from the South. But a few of those merrymakers
had stayed       as Bobby did       in
Farmer Green's meadow. They had made
up their minds to spend the summer in
Pleasant Valley.

Even old Mr. Crow, who was no lover of
music, had to admit that he had never
heard such bursts of song during all the
summers he had spent in the neighborhood.
It seemed as if Bobby Bobolink andp. 17
his companions were trying their best to
out-sing one another, though nobody knew
why they should do that.

But at last somebody discovered the reason.
That rowdy of the woods, Jasper
Jay, spied upon the harum-scarum singers
one day, when they were all but bursting
themselves in a frenzy of song. And
he saw that they were giving what Jasper
called "a serenade."

They were singing not for themselves
but for a dull, yellowish-brown lady of
their own sort, who had not arrived from
the South until Bobby and his friends had
been frolicking about the meadow almost
a week.

She seemed a shy creature       this young
person       preferring to stay on the ground
during the serenade. But Bobby Bobolink
and his companions were bold as
brass. Often they alighted on the groundp. 18
near her, as if they thought she could not
hear their songs well enough when they
skimmed through the air over the grassy
meadow. Amid such a jingling and tinkling
of notes it was no wonder that the
little lady acted somewhat confused.

Jasper Jay, who was almost as great
a gossip as Mr. Crow, told everybody in
the neighborhood that he had never heard
such a hubbub. But then, like his cousin
Mr. Crow, Jasper was not a lover of
music. And it was true that sprightly
Bobby Bobolink and his dashing friends
made no attempt to sing together. To be
sure, they sang all at the same time; but
each one of them sang his own song in his
own way, just as if his was the only one
that was being sung.

They never tired of entertaining the
lady. And whether the yellowish-brown
person decided that Bobby Bobolink sangp. 19
louder than the others, or whether she
thought his singing was sweeter or gayer
than that of his friends, nobody ever found
out. Perhaps he managed to say something       in
his song       that especially
pleased her. Anyhow, it was only a short
time before Bobby Bobolink was making
such remarks as these to everybody in the
meadow:

"My wife says I have the quickest eye
for a caterpillar that she ever saw!" and
"Mrs. Bobolink and I expect to begin to
build a new house at once!"

Now, you might think that Bobby's
friends, after all their singing for the little
lady, would have felt quite glum. But
they were not in the least downcast. Of
course, Bobby Bobolink would not let them
serenade his wife. Indeed he promptly
chased them away as soon as he knew that
he had won her.


p. 20But they were so light-hearted that they
started right away to sing for another
lady in another part of the meadow.

She was as like the first one as two peas
in a pod. And Jasper Jay chuckled when
he found out what was going on.

He said he didn't believe they knew the
difference.

AN INVITATION


Mr. Meadowlark was a great admirer of
Bobby Bobolink. Much as he liked to sing
himself, he often remained silent when
Bobby's joyous music tinkled over the
grass-tops in Farmer Green's meadow.
And as Mr. Meadowlark was listening
to one of Bobby's best songs one day an
idea popped suddenly into his head. He
liked this notion so well that he flew
straight across the meadow to a thicket
on the edge of the woods. And there in
the undergrowth he found Buddy Brown
Thrasher, who was exactly the person he
was looking for.


p. 22"I've come over to tell you about an
idea of mine," Mr. Meadowlark announced.
"It's about Bobby Bobolink.
You know he has come back to spend the
summer here in Pleasant Valley. It seems
to me he's in better voice than ever. And
now that he is quite grown up       you know
he has a wife       it seems to me that we
couldn't do better than invite him to join
the Pleasant Valley Singing Society."

Mr. Meadowlark had explained all this
in a most eager manner. And he couldn't
help being a bit disappointed over the way
Buddy Brown Thrasher received it. He
did not seem at all excited. To tell the
truth, he was a suspicious chap. He never
fell in quickly with a new plan, no matter
what it might be. And more than once
he had made matters somewhat difficult
for the Pleasant Valley Singing Society.
He was hard to please. Being a very brilp. 23liant
singer himself, he was never what
you might call keen to take in a new member.

When Mr. Meadowlark had told him
about his idea Buddy Brown Thrasher
gave a sharp whistle, "Wheeu!" That
was the only remark he made.

"What's the matter?" Mr. Meadowlark
inquired. "Don't you like my
scheme?"

"Oh! It's worth looking into, no
doubt," Buddy told him. "But I can't
say offhand whether it's a good one or
not.... Of course Bobby Bobolink would
have to pass the test before we take him
into the Singing Society."

"If that's all that's troubling you, cheer
up!" Mr. Meadowlark cried. "For
Bobby Bobolink can pass the singing test
as easily as flying."

"I hope so," Buddy Brown Thrasherp. 24
retorted. "I promise you that I'll be
present when Bobby sings before the Society.
And if his singing isn't what it
ought to be, you can depend on me to know
it."

Well, Mr. Meadowlark couldn't object
to that. So he told Buddy Brown
Thrasher that his promise was fair
enough. And then Mr. Meadowlark hurried
away to call on other members of the
Pleasant Valley Singing Society and tell
them about his plan.

After he had seen and talked with every
one, Mr. Meadowlark took it upon himself
to go back to the meadow, where he found
Bobby Bobolink still singing merrily.
And for once Mr. Meadowlark couldn't
wait for him to finish. For there was no
knowing when Bobby would stop.

"You're invited," said Mr. Meadowlark,
"to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singp. 25ing
Society. And if you can pass the test
you'll become a member."

Bobby Bobolink was somewhat doubtful
as he listened to Mr. Meadowlark's
speech.

"I'm afraid it will be difficult," he said.

"Oh, no!" Mr. Meadowlark assured
him. "You can pass the test easily
enough."

But Bobby Bobolink told him that that
wasn't what he meant.

"I'm afraid," he explained, "my wife
may not consent!"




p. 26
VI

MRS. BOBOLINK CONSENTS


It had never occurred to Mr. Meadowlark
that Bobby Bobolink's wife might object
to her husband's joining the Singing Society.
But Bobby seemed doubtful.

"I'll have to ask her," he said. "You
see, we're just about to build ourselves a
house. And she may think I ought not
to belong to any societies at present."

Just then little, yellowish-brown Mrs.
Bobolink came skimming over the meadow
and dropped down beside them.

"Would you mind, my love, if I joined
the Pleasant Valley Singing Society?"
Bobby asked her.


p. 27"Perhaps you'd like to become a member
yourself," Mr. Meadowlark suggested
nervously.

But Mrs. Bobolink hastened to say that
she wasn't musical. "Of course I enjoy
hearing songs," she told him; "but I'm
not much of a singer myself."

"Your husband is one of the best," Mr.
Meadowlark told her hopefully.

"Yes!" she replied. "And sometimes
I think he spends almost too much of his
time practicing."

"Oh, I can sing and work at the same
time," Bobby Bobolink declared. "When
we begin work on our new house I shall
be singing most of the time."

"How often does your Society meet?"
Mrs. Bobolink asked Mr. Meadowlark.

"We have a little sing almost every fine
day," he informed her. "But your husband
needn't come to every meeting       ifp. 28
he's too busy. And if necessary he can
leave before our sings are finished       except
when he takes the test."

"The test!" Mrs. Bobolink echoed.
"What's that?"

Mr. Meadowlark explained that before
becoming a member everybody had
to sing before the Society. "Those that
don't sing well enough don't get in," he
added. "For instance, there's old Mr.
Crow. His voice is too hoarse. So he
doesn't belong to the Society."

Well, the moment she heard that, Mrs.
Bobolink made up her mind at once.

"My husband can pass any singing test
that you can give him!" she exclaimed.
"The idea of mentioning him and Mr.
Crow in the same breath!"

"Pardon me!" Mr. Meadowlark said
hastily. "I took several breaths just before
I spoke about Mr. Crow." He hopedp. 29
that he hadn't offended Bobby Bobolink's
wife.

She wasn't really angry. But she was
proud of her husband's voice. And she
wanted Mr. Meadowlark to know it.

"I wouldn't think of such a thing as
not letting Bobby join your Society," she
declared. "And as soon as we've finished
our new house he can go to every meeting
you have, and stay till the end, too."

All this time Bobby Bobolink had been
listening anxiously. And when he heard
his wife's last remark he was so overjoyed
that he sprang into the air and began to
sing the happiest song he knew, while he
darted back and forth above the heads
of his wife and their caller.

"Just listen to him!" Mrs. Bobolink
cried, with an air of pride. "Can you beat
that?"

Mr. Meadowlark made a modest reply.p. 30
He said that in his opinion Bobby Bobolink
was the finest singer that had ever
come to Pleasant Valley.

And Mrs. Bobolink was so pleased that
she confessed she hoped her husband could
take his test just as soon as possible.

"He shall take it to-morrow!" Mr.
Meadowlark promised.




p. 31
VII

PASSING THE TEST


The time had come for Bobby Bobolink
to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singing
Society. Mr. Meadowlark brought Bobby
to the meeting, along the rail fence between
the meadow and the pasture. And
he told everybody that there wasn't really
any need of such a test.

"He's by far the finest singer in all these
parts," Mr. Meadowlark declared.

There were a few who might have disputed
his statement, had not Bobby Bobolink
been present. They were too polite,
however, to do anything like that. But
Mr. Meadowlark himself had a voice ofp. 32
remarkable sweetness. And many thought
that it couldn't be equalled.

"Bobby Bobolink will have to sing for
us, just like anybody else, before we make
him a member of this Society," Buddy
Brown Thrasher cried, after he had given
a whistle, "Wheeu!" as if to say that he,
for one, doubted Mr. Meadowlark's words.
For Buddy Brown Thrasher liked his own
singing about as well as any he had ever
heard. In the morning, and again at
night, he was fond of perching himself on
the topmost twig of a tree, where nobody
could help seeing him, and singing a song
over and over again. It was his favorite
song       and the only one he knew. And
having practiced it all his life, how he
could sing it!

Well, after Buddy Brown Thrasher's
remarks there was only one thing to be
done. Bobby Bobolink must sing for thep. 33
Society. And Mr. Meadowlark turned to
him and told him that he might begin at
once.

So Bobby alighted on the end of a fence-rail
and such a torrent of song burst upon
the ears of his listeners as they had never
heard before. The notes came tumbling
so quickly one upon another that most of
the members of the Singing Society began
to look bewildered. Bobby Bobolink's
singing was almost too fast for even their
sharp ears.

He hadn't sung long before somebody
interrupted him. Somebody called in a
loud voice, "I object!"

It was Buddy Brown Thrasher that
spoke. Bobby Bobolink stopped short in
the middle of his song. And at once a great clamor arose, when all the other
members asked Buddy what he meant.

"I mean," said Buddy Brown Thrasher,p. 34
as soon as he could make himself heard,
"I mean that Bobby Bobolink is playing
a trick on us. He has about half a dozen
of his friends hidden in the pasture. And
they're helping him. They're singing with
him."

Everybody was astonished. And as for
Bobby Bobolink, he couldn't seem to say
a word for himself.

Luckily he didn't need to. For just
then his wife came bustling up and settled
herself right in the midst of the Singing
Society.

Proud as she was of her husband's
voice, she hadn't been able to stay
away from the meeting. So she had hovered
near-by, where she could hear everything
without being seen.

"Sir!" she said to Buddy Brown
Thrasher. "Kindly point out these hidden
friends of my husband!"


p. 35Buddy Brown Thrasher looked somewhat
uneasy.

"I       I haven't seen anybody in the
bushes," he stammered.

"Find them!" Mrs. Bobolink ordered.
Her manner was so stern that Buddy
Brown Thrasher did not dare disobey.
He searched high and low. But he
couldn't find a bird anywhere in the pasture.

"You see you were mistaken," Mrs.
Bobolink told him severely.

Everybody agreed with her. And then
and there they made Bobby Bobolink a
member of the Pleasant Valley Singing
Society. There was no doubt that
he had sung his song without a bit of
help.

"It was wonderful!" everybody exclaimed       everybody
but Buddy Brown
Thrasher. He muttered that it was nop. 36
wonder he made a mistake, for he didn't
know the song himself. And he said it
was much too fast for his taste.

THE HOUSE IN THE MEADOW


Bobby Bobolink and his wife had talked
a good deal about the home they were going
to have.

And unlike some people, who are forever
planning things but never begin the
actual doing of them, they soon set to work
to build their nest.

First, of course, they had to find a pleasant
place for it. So they looked the
ground over carefully. Bobby Bobolink
favored the exact center of the big meadow
building site, for he said that if
Johnnie Green ever came into the meadow
he was more likely to take a short cutp. 38
across a corner of it than he was to walk
straight through the middle.

"You may not know," he said to his
wife, "that Farmer Green doesn't care to
have the grass on the farm trampled
down."

But Mrs. Bobolink replied that there
were other things to think of. She said
that she liked to live in a rather moist
place       that such a spot was comfortable
in hot weather. And furthermore she
wanted to be near water. "If you need a
drink on a warm day it's not always convenient
to go far out of your way for it,"
she pointed out.

Well, Bobby Bobolink saw at once that
Mrs. Bobolink had made up her mind, and
there was no use trying to change it. Besides,
he wanted to please her.

"Then, my dear, where would you like
to have our house built?" he asked.


p. 39"I should prefer to settle in the lower
end of the meadow, near Cedar Swamp,"
she replied. "The ground thereabouts is
just damp enough to suit me. And there's
always plenty of water to drink in the
swamp.... Besides," she added, "it's
somewhat marshy in that part of the meadow.

"And you won't find Johnny Green
trespassing down there. He might get his
feet wet!"

Bobby Bobolink turned his head away
so that his wife wouldn't notice the smile
that flitted across his face. He saw that
Mrs. Bobolink didn't know Johnnie Green
very well.

In summer Johnnie almost always went
barefooted. And he never minded getting
his feet wet any more than Paddy Muskrat
did.

But if his wife wanted their nestp. 40
near the swamp, Bobby Bobolink was willing
to oblige her.

"Very well!" he said. "Let's go down
there now and look for the best place to
build."

So off they flew. And after a careful
search they discovered a snug little hollow
in the ground that entirely suited them
both.

Since the spot was somewhat moist,
early in the season as it was the grass grew
thick and high all around, making a fine
screen to prevent prying eyes from seeing
what was to be hidden there.

Having decided on their building site,
Bobby Bobolink and his wife began to
gather weed stems, leaves and coarse
grasses, all left over from the year before
and dried by the spring sunshine. Those
served for the outside of the nest. As
for the inside, they lined that with soft,p. 41
fine grasses, because they expected to keep
something precious in that nest before a
great while.

JOHNNIE GREEN INTRUDES


Bobby Bobolink and his wife had finished
their new nest.

"There!" Mrs. Bobolink exclaimed, as
she gave the lining of soft grasses a final
pat. "There's not another thing to be
done to it."

"It's perfect!" Bobby told her. "But
I think I can make one slight improvement,
for we mustn't forget Henry
Hawk." And while his wife looked on
somewhat anxiously he bent a few grass
stalks over so that they completely hid
the nest from anybody passing overhead.


p. 43"Henry Hawk will never spy our nest
now," Bobby remarked a few minutes
later, as he flew back and forth over the
spot and tried in vain to catch a glimpse
of their new home. "If I can't see it as
near as I am, Henry Hawk will never find
it as he sails high above the meadow, for
all his eyes are terribly sharp."

Mrs. Bobolink then told her husband
that his improvement was a fine one. And
Bobby was so well pleased that he sang a
song for his wife, while she rested from
her labors.

After that they flew off and told all their
friends that their new home was built. But
they didn't invite anybody to a house-warming,
for that was not their way.
They never so much as told people where
their house was hidden. They were afraid
that some gossip might drop a hint to old
Mr. Crow, or his noisy cousin, Jasper Jay,p. 44
or perhaps Mr. Blackbird. And later
there would be something in the nest that
would have made a dainty meal for any
one of those rascals. No! Mr. and Mrs.
Bobolink did not intend to have their nest
robbed of its treasure       not if they could
help it!

Now, it was only a short time later that
Bobby Bobolink and his wife shared a
wonderful secret. Five grayish-white
eggs, each quite pointed at one end, lay in
their nest. And nobody but themselves
was a bit the wiser.

To be sure, the neighbors remarked that
Bobby Bobolink was simply bursting with
song. He was more musical than ever.
But they never dreamed what it was that
could make him even happier than he had
always been.

At last there came a time when Bobby       though
he was just as happy       seemedp. 45
to have less leisure for singing. And then
it was easy for the neighbors to guess the
reason for that, because it was plain that
the Bobolink family was not gathering
great numbers of grasshoppers and caterpillars
merely for the fun of it.

Hidden as the little Bobolinks were in
the tall grass, no stranger found them.
Of course, Mrs. Bobolink went to some
trouble to keep the secret of her nest in
the family. Whenever she left her home
she moved along the ground a little way
before rising into view. And when she returned
she alighted some distance off and
scurried through the grass until she
reached home.

By taking such pains she kept others
from knowing exactly where her nest was.
And nothing had happened to alarm her
until one day she caught sight of Johnnie
Green. He had come into the meadow top. 46
hunt for strawberries. And to Mrs.
Bobolink's dismay he was headed straight
for her house.

FOOLING JOHNNIE GREEN


When Mrs. Bobolink saw Johnnie Green,
carrying a tin pail, come walking through
the meadow straight towards her house
she was terribly frightened. She was not
afraid for herself. Her only thought was
of her children, who were still too young
to leave the nest.

Somehow Mrs. Bobolink felt sure that
Johnnie was searching for her nest, for
he had his head bent toward the ground,
as if he were looking for something. And
that bright tin pail! Mrs. Bobolink viewed
it with alarm. She just knew that it was
meant to carry off her children!


p. 48Of course Johnnie Green was only looking
for strawberries. But Mrs. Bobolink
didn't know that. All at once she remembered
how she had objected to having her
nest in the very center of the meadow, although
her husband had told her that he
thought it the safest place. And it came
back to her, too, how she had said that
Johnnie Green would never come into the
lower end of the meadow, near Cedar
Swamp, for fear of getting his feet wet.

Poor Mrs. Bobolink choked as she
thought how foolish she had been. But
it was too late to move now. And she
didn't see what she was going to do. She
wished Bobby was at home, though she
had no idea how he could have headed off
Johnnie Green who was fast drawing
nearer.

As soon as she could speak she called
"Chenk, chenk!" at the top of her voice.p. 49
She could think of nothing else to say.

Luckily Bobby was not far away. And
hearing his wife's alarm call, he turned to
hurry home. But seeing Johnnie Green,
he swerved sharply aside and dropped
down upon a tuft of grass not too near the
nest.

And then Bobby Bobolink made a great
fuss. He cried "Chink, chink!" over and
over again, now fluttering into the grass,
now bobbing into sight again. Johnnie
Green couldn't help noticing him.

"There must be a nest there!" he exclaimed
under his breath. And he ran
quickly to the spot where Bobby was acting
so queerly. But when he got there
Johnnie found nothing.

Bobby Bobolink had fooled him. He
never knew how near he came to stumbling
upon the nest, before Bobby played that
trick on him.


p. 50Mrs. Bobolink was greatly relieved
when Johnnie Green left her end of the
meadow. And she told her husband that
she had never supposed Johnnie would
come where it was so damp, for fear of
getting his feet wet.

Bobby Bobolink did not tell her that he
had known all the time that a little water
never troubled Johnnie Green       so long as
he didn't have to wash his face in it.

BOBBY'S NAMES


Everybody       almost       liked Bobby Bobolink.
His neighbors in Farmer Green's
meadow enjoyed his singing. And they
thought him the merriest harum-scarum
they had ever known. He was even cheerful
to look at, too. For with every bright
day that passed, Bobby Bobolink's dress
took on a gayer hue. The truth was that
the yellowish tips of his feathers were
wearing away, leaving him a handsome
suit of black, set off by a generous patch
of creamy yellow on the back of his neck,
with enough white on his back and shoulders
to make a most jaunty costume.


p. 52Most of the field people enjoyed Bobby
Bobolink's company, for he was always in
high spirits. And many of them were
vain enough to like to be seen with him,
on account of his dashing appearance.
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird was especially
fond of Bobby's companionship. And he
was forever speaking of his old friend,
Bobby Bobolink, and acting as if he knew
Bobby a great deal better than anybody
else did.

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird never tired
of telling the neighbors about the good
times he and Bobby had together when
they were in the South. And he related
many things about Bobby that some of the
feathered folk hadn't heard of.

"There isn't anybody in the valley that
has more names than Bobby Bobolink,"
Mr. Red-winged Blackbird said to Mr.
Crow one day. "Some people call himp. 53
the Reed Bird. And down South they
scarcely know the name Bobolink. Down
there everybody calls him the Rice Bird.
And there's an island far off in the southern
seas where people speak of him as the
Butter Bird."

Now, if the truth must be known, old
Mr. Crow was a bit jealous of Bobby
Bobolink. It was said       by those that
ought to have known       that Mr. Crow
didn't like it because Bobby Bobolink was
not only a member of the Pleasant Valley
Singing Society, but its finest singer as
well. Unfortunately, Mr. Crow's husky
voice had always prevented his joining
the Society. And somehow       having heard
that Bobby was very fond of rice       Mr.
Crow could not get the notion out of his
head that he might be just as fond of corn.

If Mr. Crow thought anybody but himself
liked corn he was sure to be spiteful top. 54wards
him. You might have thought, from
the way Mr. Crow acted, that Farmer
Green didn't raise enough corn to go
around.

"How does it happen," Mr. Crow inquired
slyly of Mr. Red-winged Blackbird,
"that your friend Bobby Bobolink
has all these names? It can't be       can it       that
he is a rogue and is always changing
his name so people won't know who he
is?"

"Certainly not!" Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird snapped. "Only a stupid person
would ask such a question as that."

Just then Bobby Bobolink himself
flashed across the meadow and joined
them. And Mr. Red-winged Blackbird
began to talk about the weather.

He was afraid that Mr. Crow intended
to be disagreeable.




p. 55
XII

MR. CROW IS DISAGREEABLE


Although Mr. Red-winged Blackbird
talked about the weather as fast as he
could, his chatter did not prevent Mr.
Crow from interrupting him, because the
old gentleman was determined to be disagreeable
to Bobby Bobolink, and nothing
could stop him.

"Your friend here has been talking
about you," he told Bobby Bobolink with
a wise smile. "He says you have a good
many names."

"Yes!" Bobby told Mr. Crow. "That's
quite true."

Mr. Crow coughed; and he shot a sidep. 56long
look at Mr. Red-winged Blackbird.

"It must be pleasant to have so many
fine names," Mr. Crow then added, with
a smirk.

"Oh, very!" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird
answered for his friend.

Mr. Crow turned a snapping eye on him,
and croaked:

"There's at least one name you left out
among the lot you mentioned to me. You
said he was known as the Reed Bird, the
Rice Bird, and the Butter Bird. But
there's one more bird still to be added to
the list."

"Is there?"

"Yes!" Mr. Crow replied. "Maybe I
know more about your chum than you do.
Perhaps you weren't aware that in spite
of all the elegant names you've spoken of,
he's nothing but a Skunk Blackbird after
all!" And with a loud haw-haw Mr. Crowp. 57
rose upon the breeze and flapped into the
woods. That was a favorite trick of his.
After making some specially rude remark
he would hurry away before anybody had
time to think of a retort.

"The idea!" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird
exclaimed to Bobby Bobolink, gazing
after Mr. Crow with an injured air. "He
insulted you!"

To his great surprise Bobby laughed
heartily.

"Mr. Crow is a wise old bird," he said,
"He generally knows what he's talking
about."

"You don't mean to say that he was
telling the truth, do you?" Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird demanded.

"I do!" Bobby Bobolink admitted.

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird edged away
slightly. Skunks, he knew, would rather
eat a bird than not. And he couldn't helpp. 58
wondering whether a Skunk Blackbird
might be as dangerous.

"Then some people do call you that!"
he faltered.

"Yes! But I don't care," Bobby Bobolink
answered carelessly. "It's only because
of these clothes I'm wearing at
present       black, you know, with stripes of
white down each side and meeting on my
back."

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird stared at
him.

"Then," he asked, "that's the only way
you're like a Skunk?"

"Certainly!" said Bobby. And he
laughed so merrily that Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird had to believe him.

"I was scared, for a moment," he confessed.
"I was afraid you might take it
into your head to eat me."

Bobby Bobolink seemed to think thatp. 59
a huge joke. And he sang several humorous
songs before he turned to Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird and said:

"I can tell you one thing. I'd rather be
called a Skunk Blackbird than a Skunk
Crow, any day!"

MR. CATBIRD'S TRICK


In a clump of lilac bushes near Farmer
Green's garden Mr. Catbird made his
home. He was an odd fellow, very friendly
toward everybody in the farmhouse, except
the cat, whom he dearly loved to
tease. When she passed through the garden
on her way to the meadow to hunt for
mice, Mr. Catbird was quite likely to begin
mewing. It always made Miss Kitty
furious to be mocked. And sometimes she
crept into the bushes herself, hoping to
surprise Mr. Catbird and teach him a lesson.
But she never caught him.

Now, the cat was not the only one whosep. 61
calls Mr. Catbird imitated. Although he
liked almost all his bird neighbors and
was especially kind and helpful when they
were in trouble, nothing pleased him more
than to sing their songs. Knowing as they
did that he was always ready to feed any
nestlings that were left to fend for themselves,
and that he was quick to help any
of the small feathered folk to fight an
enemy, his neighbors did not care how
much Mr. Catbird mocked them. It was
only his way of having fun; so they didn't
mind.

Mr. Catbird was always prankish and
full of spirits. And feeling all ready for
a lark one morning and not knowing what
else to do, he decided to visit the meadow
and play a trick on Bobby Bobolink and
his wife.

So when the Bobolinks were away from
home on a short trip Mr. Catbird flew top. 62
their end of the meadow and hid in a bush
not far from the spot where they had
built their nest on the ground.

From his hiding place Mr. Catbird
watched closely. And soon he saw Mrs.
Bobolink, followed shortly by her husband,
come skimming across the meadow
and settle down in the grass.

Well, Mr. Catbird was so delighted with
the trick he was about to play on them
that first he spread his feathers, and then
he tucked them close about his slim body,
while he bobbed about on the branch where
he sat, giving his tail a flirt now and then
as if he were so amused that he simply
couldn't keep still.

After spending some minutes in that
fashion Mr. Catbird peeped out of his bush
again and began what he expected would
be a perfect imitation of one of Bobby
Bobolink's songs. But somehow therep. 63
seemed to be something wrong. They
were very strange notes that he uttered.
And the moment she heard them Mrs.
Bobolink said aloud to her husband,
"What in the world is that queer call?
I never heard anything like it in all my
days!"

Bobby Bobolink couldn't tell her. And
since they had no idea who was lurking
near their home nor exactly where he was,
they kept quite still, hidden as they were
by the tall grasses.

Mr. Catbird had heard what they said.
And he was slightly upset, for he had intended
that they should think there was a
strange Bobolink in the meadow.

"I'll have to try again," he said to himself.
"Next time I'll do better."




p. 64

FRIGHTENING MRS. BOBOLINK


Not knowing who gave the strange cry
near their home, Bobby Bobolink and his
wife held their breaths and waited. They
never dreamed that it was their good
friend, Mr. Catbird, hidden in a bush
near-by, who was trying to imitate one of
Bobby's songs.

Meanwhile that fun-loving fellow smiled
broadly to himself. And giving his tail
an upward toss he opened his mouth once
more, only to give voice to one of the oddest
sounds that was ever heard in Pleasant
Valley.

Mr. Catbird knew right away that hep. 65
hadn't caught the trick of mocking Bobby
Bobolink. So he stopped short.

"I wonder what's the matter with me,"
he murmured. "Can it be that I've
caught a cold and didn't know it?"

He cleared his throat and made ready
to attempt Bobby Bobolink's song once
more. But he waited a moment, for he
could hear Bobby talking to his wife.

"Don't be alarmed!" he was saying.
"It sounded to me as if somebody had a
frog in his throat."

"I hope you're not mistaken," was Mrs.
Bobolink's somewhat doubting answer.

"I thought I heard him choke a moment
ago," Bobby told her. "We'll keep still
until we know where the noise comes
from."

Mr. Catbird winced. He was not used
to hearing anybody speak of his singing
as "noise." And he made up his mindp. 66
that he would sing a song in Bobby Bobolink's
best manner. So again he opened
his mouth.

He hadn't sung half a dozen notes before
Bobby Bobolink's wife gave a shrill
scream.

"Oh, dear!" she cried. "That's a terrible
noise. It hurts my ears to hear it."

Mr. Catbird had stopped when Mrs.
Bobolink screamed. A puzzled look came
over his face.

"I don't see what's the matter with me
to-day," he said under his breath. "This
is the first time I ever tried to mock anybody
and made such a bungle of it....
Perhaps I'm trying to sing too fast," he
added. "So I'll sing slower next time."

But his slow notes were queerer still.
Though he tried to make them rollicking
and merry, he succeeded only in giving a
number of doleful whines.


p. 67"That won't do!" he exclaimed. "I declare,
I haven't caught the trick yet."
And to his great distress he heard Mrs.
Bobolink weeping.

Now, Mr. Catbird had only wanted to
have a jolly time with the Bobolink family.
He had intended to sing one of Bobby's
songs a few times, until they were
puzzled; and then he had expected to dash
out of the bush where he was hiding
and have a good laugh with Mr. and Mrs.
Bobolink. But somehow his plans were
turning out all wrong.

"What shall I do?" Mr. Catbird
groaned. "Here I've gone and frightened
Bobby Bobolink's wife! Something's the
matter with my voice. And I don't dare
to try another song for fear she'll fall into
a faint."

Then an idea flashed into his head. "If
she knows who's hiding in this bush Mrs.p. 68
Bobolink won't be frightened!" And
thereupon he mewed almost exactly like
Farmer Green's cat. But the sound was
just different enough for Bobby Bobolink
to know at once who made it.

"It's all right!" he told his wife merrily.
"Don't worry! Mr. Catbird is hiding
somewhere. He has been teasing us!"

Then Mr. Catbird came out of the bush
and apologized like the gentleman he was.

"I didn't mean to frighten Mrs. Bobolink,"
he explained. "I was only trying
to mock you. But there's something
wrong with my voice. I think I'll have to
go and see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the
herb doctor."

Bobby Bobolink only laughed harder
than ever.

"There's nothing the matter with you!"
he cried. "There isn't anybody that can
imitate my songs       unless it's one of thep. 69
Bobolink family. I sing too fast for you       that's
the trouble."

Well, Mr. Catbird looked vastly relieved.

"I'm glad to know that," he said. "And
I'll never try to mock you again."

"I should hope not!" Mrs. Bobolink
told him. "For I never heard such a
frightful noise in all my days."

HAYING TIME


By the time the Bobolink youngsters were
beginning to learn to fly Mrs. Bobolink
noticed something about her husband that
caused her some uneasiness. Bobby Bobolink
was unusually jolly. And since his
wife didn't know of anything to make him
feel happier than he had always been, she
couldn't help worrying for fear something
was troubling him. For Bobby Bobolink
almost never let anything dash his high
spirits. He often said that there was nothing
so uplifting as a rousing song       unless
it was a good pair of wings!

Mrs. Bobolink thought and thought.p. 71
But so far as she could see everything was
going smoothly. Already the children
gave promise of becoming fine fliers, taking
as naturally to the air as ducks to
water. And it was a great year for grasshoppers;
so Bobby Bobolink couldn't be
worrying about a scarcity of food.

Bobby's wife thought of this, that and
the other thing. But she could hit on nothing
that wasn't exactly as it should be.
So at last she decided to ask her husband
what it was that was troubling him and
making him so remarkably cheerful.

"I don't like to upset you, my dear," he
said in response to her question. "But
I may as well tell you that we ought to
move at the earliest possible moment."

"Move!" she cried. "Oh, no! I don't
want to move. I'm quite contented with
this house. It's in just the place I like."

"I'm sorry," said Bobby. "But wep. 72
shall have to move all the same. And
when I tell you why, I think you'll agree
with me that the sooner we move the better
it will be for us."

Little Mrs. Bobolink replied very firmly
that she would have to hear a good reason
before she would consent to move an inch.

So Bobby told her. "Haying time has
come!"

"What of that?" his wife inquired.
"Farmer Green doesn't expect us to help
him, does he?"

"Oh, no!" Bobby answered with a short
laugh. "But he'll cut the grass all over
the meadow. And even if our children
should escape with their lives, there's
still Henry Hawk to think of. He could
see them easily enough, with the grass all
gone from above the nest."

That was reason enough for Mrs.
Bobolink. She wanted to move rightp. 73
away. But there was something to prevent
that.

"We certainly can't leave here till the
children have learned to fly better than
they do now," she said. "But as soon
as they can handle themselves well enough
we'll go. We'll know       won't we       when
Farmer Green begins to mow?"

"Indeed we will!" Bobby cried. "The
mowing-machine makes a terrible clatter.
And we'll have to quit the neighborhood
in a hurry when we hear it, for it moves
fast, and cuts the grass down like fire."

Mrs. Bobolink was all a-flutter. And
she spent so much time teaching her children
to fly that they learned surprisingly
fast. By the time an odd clackety-clack
sounded across the meadow early one fine
morning the Bobolink family was all ready
to move.

Mrs. Bobolink was gathering her chilp. 74dren
hastily about her when Bobby came
hurrying back from a trip to the farm
buildings. He had seen       as well as heard       the
mowing-machine. And he knew
there was no time to waste.

"Are you ready?" he called as he fluttered
quickly down beside his family.

"Yes!" said Mrs. Bobolink.

"You haven't forgotten anything?"

She counted her children carefully before
answering.

"No!" she said. "There are five of
them here." And then, a look of dismay
came over her face.

"My goodness!" she exclaimed. "I've
forgotten to pick out a place to move to!"

MR. FROG IS AMUSED


With the clatter of the mowing-machine
growing louder every moment, Bobby
Bobolink didn't stop to ask his wife to
what place she would like to move.

"Follow me!" he cried. And rising
quickly he headed for Cedar Swamp, with
Mrs. Bobolink and their five children
trailing after him.

It was the quickest move you ever saw       if
you had only seen it! In a few minutes
they were settled in the swamp. And
to Bobby Bobolink's relief his wife declared
that she liked their new home, because
it was in a good damp place andp. 76
there was plenty of good water to drink.

After moving to Cedar Swamp Bobby
Bobolink often met a spry gentleman who
lived there. His name was Ferdinand
Frog. And being a tailor, he always took
special notice of everybody's clothes. For
himself Mr. Frog preferred a dark green
suit, somewhat spotted, and a white waistcoat.
And since he spent a great deal of
his time in the water, his white waistcoat
always looked very spick-and-span. Yes!
Ferdinand Frog was an elegant person.
And being somewhat shallow-brained, he
was rather vain of his appearance, and
was likely to snicker at other people if
their clothes seemed to him the least bit
odd.

Now, Bobby Bobolink had noticed from
the first that whenever he met Mr. Frog
he began to titter. But since Bobby was
always ready with a laugh himself, he supp. 77posed
that Mr. Ferdinand Frog was
merely bubbling over with good spirits.
So he used to pass the time of day with
the gay tailor and maybe sing a jolly song
for him.

And all the while Mr. Frog would grin
widely and giggle.

At last Bobby Bobolink noticed that
Mr. Frog's bulging eyes were always looking
him up and down, from head to feet.
And before long it dawned on Bobby
Bobolink that the tailor was not laughing
with him.

No! There was no doubt that Ferdinand
Frog was laughing at him. And
there is a great difference between these
two kinds of laughter.

All at once Bobby Bobolink began to
feel uncomfortable. And though he had
intended to sing another song for Mr.
Frog, he did not do it. Instead he said ap. 78
hasty good-day and hurried home to his
wife.

"My dear," Bobby said to Mrs. Bobolink
in an anxious voice, "do you see anything
queer about my appearance?"

She looked him over carefully.

"Why, no!" she answered at last.
"Why do you ask me such an odd question?"

"Well," said Bobby, "Mr. Frog, the
tailor, is always staring at me in the oddest
fashion and snickering as if he saw
something that amused him."

"Don't worry about that simpleton!"
Mrs. Bobolink cried. "You look a great
deal better than he does. And as for your
voices, there's really no comparison.
Yours is one of the finest in Pleasant Valley;
but Ferdinand Frog's is nothing but
a croak. It's even worse than old Mr.
Crow's!"


p. 79After that Bobby Bobolink felt better.
He knew that his wife was particular.
And if she said he looked all right then he
was sure he could have no cause to be uneasy.

"It must be only Mr. Frog's queer
eyes," he said to Mrs. Bobolink. "I've
been thinking that he saw something
strange about me. But I must be mistaken."

Nevertheless, the very next time Bobby
met Mr. Frog the tailor burst out laughing,
right in his face. And again his eyes
rolled from Bobby's head to his feet,
and back again, in a most unpleasant
leer.

"What on earth do you see to laugh
at?" Bobby Bobolink demanded.

"Tee-hee!" Mr. Frog giggled. "Don't
you know?"

"No, I don't!" Bobby snapped.
p. 80

"It's your clothes!" Mr. Frog told
him. "You've got them on upside
down!"




p. 81

TURNING THE TABLES


Mr. Frog had given Bobby Bobolink a
great surprise. He had said that Bobby
was wearing his clothes upside down.

After making that unpleasant remark
Mr. Frog burst into a gale of laughter.
And it was some time before he could say
anything more. While he held his sides
and laughed, Bobby Bobolink tried to look
at his own reflection in a pool of water.
But so far as he could see there was nothing
unusual about his suit. He was puzzled;
but there was no use asking Mr.
Frog any questions just then Bobby
knew that he would have to wait until thep. 82
silly tailor's fit of laughing had passed.

At last Mr. Frog grew calmer. He
drew forth a big handkerchief from his
sleeve and wiped his eyes.

"You're certainly the funniest sight
I've ever seen!" he exclaimed.

"I wish you'd explain about my suit being
upside down," Bobby said. "I've
worn it this way for almost two months.
And only yesterday my wife told me there
was nothing wrong with it."

"Ah!" Mr. Frog cried. "She doesn't
know about the styles. If she did, she'd
know what was the matter. Your waistcoat
is black; and you wear bright colors
on your back. Anybody that follows the
fashions as I do could tell you that your
coat should be black, and that the yellow
and white ought to be on your waistcoat.
That's one of the rules: Coat dark, waistcoat
bright and gay! Look at me!" Andp. 83
Mr. Frog drew himself up proudly and
leaned against a stump, with his feet
crossed, exactly as if he was having his picture
taken.

Bobby Bobolink looked at him. And
all at once he burst out laughing.

Now it was Mr. Frog's turn to feel uncomfortable.

"What's the matter?" he asked. "Isn't
my tie straight?"

"Oh, I dare say your tie's correct,"
Bobby Bobolink told him. "But there's
something queer about you. Maybe it's
because your feet are so big!" And he
laughed harder than ever; for Mr. Frog
certainly looked funny.

Now, Mr. Frog's feet were a great trial
to him. He had always wanted small ones.
But somehow he had never been able to
change them.

"They aren't really as big as theyp. 84
look," he remarked, gazing down at his
feet mournfully. "You see, trousers are
being worn very tight this summer. And
that always makes the feet seem bigger....
My feet can't look peculiar."

"Then," said Bobby Bobolink, "it must
be something else that amuses me. It must
be your mouth!"

"My mouth!" Mr. Frog repeated, as his
jaw dropped. "What's the matter with
that?"

"It's so big!" Bobby cried.

Now, Mr. Frog had always been terribly
sensitive about the size of his mouth.

"I'll tell you something about my
mouth," he said. "Once it was smaller
than yours. But I've smiled so much it
has stretched a bit, though I hoped nobody
had noticed that."

"Well," Bobby Bobolink told him, "I'm
better off than you are, Mr. Frog. For Ip. 85
expect to have a new suit this fall. But
how are you going to change your mouth       or
your feet, either?"

That was a question that Mr. Frog
couldn't answer. He made no attempt
to reply, but plunged into the water and
swam away.

And he never again laughed at anybody's
clothes all that summer.

TIMOTHY TURTLE'S COMPLAINT


It happened that the Bobolink family
moved to Cedar Swamp just when Timothy
Turtle had arrived there for a short
outing. It was Mr. Turtle's custom to
leave his home in Black Creek now and
than and spend a few days in some other
neighborhood. He said that after living
in the creek as many years as he had it did
him good to get a change once in a while.
About every forty years he paid a visit to
the Beaver Pond on the other side of Blue
Mountain. But he visited Cedar Swamp
oftener than that, because it was nearer
his home.


p. 87There was scarcely anybody that was
glad to see Mr. Turtle. He was a snappish,
surly old chap. And he was forever
finding fault with everybody and
everything. It seemed as if you couldn't
please him, no matter how much you tried.
He had spent less than a week in Cedar
Swamp before every one voted him a nuisance.
And he had invitations, daily, to
go back where he came from.

But Timothy Turtle announced in no
uncertain tones that he wouldn't go till
he was ready. He said that it was a waste
of breath to urge him to leave, and that
those that didn't care for his company
might move. He promised that he
wouldn't stop anybody       unless he happened
to get hold of him!

Naturally every one took pains to keep
out of Timothy Turtle's reach. It was
well known that when his powerful jawsp. 88
closed upon a person's leg, for instance,
its unlucky owner might as well not try
to get away till Timothy was ready to let
him go. And if it happened to be his head
that Timothy Turtle seized       well, then he
was unluckier still!

If Timothy Turtle was grumpy before
Bobby Bobolink moved to Cedar Swamp,
it would be hard to say what he was afterward.
For Bobby Bobolink's happy songs
drove Timothy Turtle almost crazy. He
said that if he had known he would have
to listen to such merry singing he would
have taken his outing in the Beaver Pond,
though he wasn't really due there for
thirty-nine years, because he had visited
the Beaver colony only the summer before.

When Timothy heard Bobby Bobolink's
song ringing through the swamp he hurried
as fast as he could toward the placep. 89
where it seemed to come from. Timothy
did that, not because he wanted to hear
the singing better, but because he had
something to say to the singer. He wanted
to tell him to keep still. And he had a
good many disagreeable remarks on the
tip of his tongue, all ready to fling at
Bobby Bobolink.

But somehow Mr. Turtle never succeeded
in finding Bobby. After Mr. Turtle
had swum in one direction he was sure
to hear the song in another. Sometimes
he would even leave the water and crawl
over the soggy, boggy turf; and that was
slow work for Timothy Turtle. You may
be sure it did not improve his temper to
find that his journeying had been all in
vain.

It happened that at last somebody told
Bobby Bobolink that Mr. Turtle wanted
to speak to him. And being most obligp. 90ing,
Bobby set out to find Timothy. "It's
a shame," he said, "to disappoint an old
gentleman."

Anybody could tell, from that remark,
that he didn't know Timothy Turtle.

BOBBY'S MISTAKE


After a good deal of searching Bobby
Bobolink discovered Timothy Turtle in a
pool in Cedar Swamp, sunning himself
on an old stump that was half under
water.

"Good morning, Mr. Turtle!" Bobby
cried. "Is it true that you have something
to say to me?"

And feeling quite happy and care-free,
Bobby began to sing one of his most
sprightly songs. For Mr. Turtle was a
slow old fellow. It took him some time to
answer a question, especially when he was
dozing.


p. 92But the moment Bobby Bobolink began
to sing old Mr. Timothy Turtle came to
life instantly. And he was so angry at
hearing that rollicking song that much as
he wanted to, he couldn't speak. Somehow
the words seemed to stick in his
throat.

And for a few moments Timothy was
afraid he was going to choke.

Now Bobby Bobolink was such a lively
person that he couldn't keep still long.
Especially when he was singing he liked
to be on the move. So when he saw that
Timothy Turtle wasn't going to speak immediately
Bobby leaped from the bush
where he was perched and began flying
joyously over the swamp.

All the time he sang with all his might,
making so much music that he could not
hear Timothy Turtle calling to him at
last.


p. 93Once in a while Bobby wheeled above
Mr. Turtle, so that the old fellow might
enjoy his best notes. He little knew that
Mr. Turtle was crying to him to stop, for
goodness' sake! And noticing that Timothy's
mouth was moving, Bobby Bobolink
said to himself:

"He looks terribly fierce; but of course
he's only commanding me not to stop singing."

It was no wonder that Bobby Bobolink
thought as he did, because his neighbors
were always begging him to sing something
for them.

"It must be that Mr. Turtle wanted to
see me so he could ask me to sing some
songs for him," Bobby thought. And
wishing to please Timothy Turtle, Bobby
Bobolink sang as he hadn't sung all summer
long.

At last Timothy Turtle felt that hep. 94
couldn't bear to hear another note. And
flopping off the stump, he splashed into
the water and sank to the bottom of the
swamp, where he buried his head in the
mud.

And there he stayed until he dared
hope that Bobby Bobolink had stopped
singing, or gone away to a distant part of
the country.

"Has anybody seen Timothy Turtle?"
Bobby Bobolink kept calling as soon as
he noticed that Mr. Turtle had vanished.
But no one knew where the old fellow was.
And at last Bobby gave up looking for
him. But he thought it strange that
Timothy hadn't waited to hear the rest
of his song.

"I hope he isn't ill," Bobby told his
friends.

But they only laughed.

"Timothy Turtle is altogether too oldp. 95
and tough to have much the matter with
him," they said. "If he's ill, it's nothing
but ill temper."




p. 96

A HERMIT'S ADVICE


There was another, besides Timothy Turtle,
who was not pleased when Bobby
Bobolink moved to Cedar Swamp at haying
time. But this was a very different
sort of person. It was Jolly Robin's
cousin, Mr. Hermit Thrush. Everybody
called him "the Hermit" for short, because
he was a quiet gentleman, who did
not like to attract attention, but preferred
to spend his time in a thicket on
the edge of the swamp. He had a beautiful,
sweet song, which he sang in a calm,
unruffled fashion when he thought nobody
was near.


p. 97The Hermit loathed noisy, boisterous
people. And he disliked loud clothes, too       no
matter who wore them. He had even
been known to speak in a slighting way
of his cousin, Jolly Robin, not only because
he was so sprightly and cheerful,
but because he always wore a red waistcoat.

The Hermit himself clung to more sober
colors. His coat was olive-brown, his tail
somewhat paler in hue, and his waistcoat
of quite a light shade, spotted with black.

As a rule he had little to say to his
neighbors. But soon after Bobby Bobolink
came to the swamp to live the Hermit
began to talk more freely. He began
to make complaints, saying that he had
chosen Cedar Swamp as a quiet place to
live and it was upsetting to him to have
any one as harum-scarum as Bobby Bobolink
settle in the neighborhood.


p. 98And one day the Hermit even spoke
to Bobby Bobolink himself and took him
to task, although nobody had introduced
Bobby to him. And generally the Hermit
wouldn't speak to anybody who hadn't
made his acquaintance like that.

"Young man!" said the Hermit solemnly,
when he chanced to meet the newcomer
near the thicket where the Hermit
lived, "I'm going to give you a bit of advice.
I'm going to warn you that if you
don't behave differently you'll come to
some bad end."

Now, Bobby Bobolink supposed that of
course the speaker was only joking. He
knew that some people could joke when
they wore a long face. So he laughed
heartily. And thinking what a jolly chap
the stranger in the spotted waistcoat was,
he began to sing.

"There you go!" the Hermit exclaimedp. 99
as a look of pain crossed his refined face.
"You can't even keep still long enough to
hear a little valuable advice. Do stop that
annoying noise of yours and listen to what
I have to say!"

Bobby Bobolink was so surprised to
hear anybody speak in such a way of his
singing that he broke right off in the middle
of a note, making a squeaky sound that
caused the Hermit to shudder.

"Now try to control yourself," said the
Hermit. "And if you can only learn to
stop making that jingling, jangling music
perhaps you'll be able to save yourself
from a sad fate."

Bobby Bobolink stared at the Hermit
as if he couldn't believe what his own ears
told him.

"What are you talking about?" he demanded.

With great care the Hermit flicked a bitp. 100
of moss off his waistcoat before answering.
And then he said, "Don't you know
that some day when you're in the midst of
a frenzy of song you're going to explode?
And then there'll be nothing left of you
except a cloud of feathers!"




p. 101

HOW TO TAKE BAD NEWS


For once Bobby Bobolink's heart seemed
to come right up into his mouth. Usually
he never let anything dash his high spirits.
If matters didn't go exactly as they
should with him he would laugh and say
that probably they would be different to-morrow.
And more likely than not he
would burst into the jolliest song he knew.
Singing like that always helped him amazingly,
when a good many people would
have moped and looked glum. But now
the gloomy warning of Jolly Robin's
mournful cousin, the Hermit Thrush,
threw a sudden dread into him.


p. 102"Why"       he asked the Hermit in a
quavering voice       "why do you think I'm
likely to explode some day when I'm singing?"

"I don't think that. I know it," the
Hermit corrected him. "No bird can
crowd one note upon another the way you
do without running a terrible risk. If you
don't do differently, some fine day your
wife is going to miss you. And when the
neighbors search for you, and find nothing
but a few feathers scattered on the
ground, they'll know what has happened
to you."

Bobby Bobolink actually began to tremble
as the Hermit described the terrible
end that awaited him. He was so alarmed
that all he could say was, "My goodness!"

"I thought I ought to tell you," the
Hermit went on. "I thought maybe you
didn't understand. And now that you'vep. 103
a wife and children, too, of course you
ought to take care of yourself. You won't
want any such accident to happen to you."

"No, indeed!" Bobby Bobolink assured
him. "And you must tell me how I can
sing fast       as I always do       and yet do it
safely."

"Ah!" the Hermit exclaimed. "That
can't be done. You must sing more slowly,
as I do. Take plenty of time for every
note. And above all, don't sing very often!"

"Oh! I never could sing that way!"
Bobby Bobolink cried. "I have to sing
joyful songs. And you know you always
sing that kind in quick time."

"Pardon me!" said the Hermit, who
was a most polite person. "I never sing
joyful songs. So you see you are mistaken."

"Well, if you sang the sort I do you'dp. 104
know that they have to be given in a lively
fashion," Bobby told him. "I don't see
how it would be possible to make a song
sound merry if it had to be sung slowly."

The Hermit pondered over that speech.

"There's only one thing for you to do,"
he said at last. "You must select only
mournful songs.... You know you sing
them in slow time."

"Pardon me!" Bobby Bobolink said,
for he was determined to be just as polite
as the Hermit. "I never sing mournful
songs. So you see you are mistaken."

Now, for some reason the Hermit
thought that a rude remark, though it was
quite like one that he had made himself
but a few moments before. He drew himself
up stiffly and said that he didn't care
to talk with Bobby Bobolink any further.
"You know," he added, "we haven't been
introduced."


p. 105Somehow that amused Bobby. Before
he knew what he was doing he had
laughed aloud. And the moment he
laughed he felt so happy once more that
he couldn't help singing. So he started
right in the middle of a song, where it
was the liveliest. And finding, when he
had finished, that he hadn't exploded, but
felt better for the effort, he never paid any
more heed to the Hermit's solemn warning.

As for the Hermit, he went straight off
to the other side of Cedar Swamp to live.
He claimed that he simply had to have
quiet. And there was no such thing, with
Bobby Bobolink around.




p. 106
XXII

A NOISY QUARREL


One odd thing marked Bobby Bobolink's
flights. He never flew in a straight course,
as old Mr. Crow did, but darted this way
and that, crossing and turning and wheeling,
until it seemed sometimes       to onlookers       that
he was sure to skid into a
tree and meet with an accident. And usually
Bobby Bobolink would sing with such
zest while he was frisking about in the air
that it was a marvel to many how he could
do two things like that, at the same time,
and yet put so much life into each.

Old Mr. Crow claimed that the reason
why Bobby Bobolink didn't fly straightp. 107
was because he had his mind too much on
his singing.

"He's nothing but a music-box with
wings," Mr. Crow often croaked. "As a
flier he couldn't even beat crazy Benjamin
Bat."

It was the general opinion that Benjamin
Bat could make a longer journey
between two points than anybody else in
Pleasant Valley. And there were some
that disputed Mr. Crow's statement. Jasper
Jay even went out of his way to tell
Mr. Crow that he had heard of his remark,
and that he was mistaken. And
they had such a wrangle that they annoyed
Mr. Hermit Thrush, way over on
the other side of Cedar Swamp. Old Mr.
Crow and Jasper Jay were cousins. And
everybody knows that there is nothing
worse than a cousinly quarrel.

In order to quiet them, the Hermit leftp. 108
his mossy retreat, in a dense thicket,
found the two cousins, and asked them,
"What are you two quarrelling about
now?"

Neither Jasper Jay nor Mr. Crow was
noted for his gentlemanly manners. They
both tried to explain at the same time.
And it made the Hermit wince to listen to
their loud, harsh voices. He was himself
a quiet bird; his voice was very sweet.

"There's only one way to settle your
dispute," the Hermit said when the two
cousins had succeeded in making their
trouble clear. "You must arrange a race
between this Bobolink person and Benjamin
Bat."

"Impossible! You don't know what
you're talking about!" Jasper Jay and
Mr. Crow both cried at the same time.

The Hermit shuddered. He was not accustomed
to such language. It hurt hisp. 109
gentle nature to be spoken to like that.
But he managed to stay there while the
cousins told him that such a race as he
had suggested couldn't be arranged, because
Benjamin Bat was always asleep
in the daytime, and Bobby Bobolink took
his rest at night. The two could never
meet.

"Perhaps," said the Hermit, "I could
persuade Benjamin Bat to change his
habits for once. Maybe he would be willing
to stay awake some day, just to oblige
me."

"Bobby Bobolink is an obliging fellow,"
Jasper Jay remarked. "Why don't you
ask him to stay awake some night?"

But the Hermit said that that wouldn't
suit him at all. "The Bobolink person
would be sure to sing his most boisterous
song," he said, "and it would wake me
up and spoil my night's sleep. Let mep. 110
speak to Benjamin Bat!" he urged the
two cousins.

And in the end they let him have his
way.




p. 111

SLEEPY BENJAMIN BAT


Leaving the two noisy cousins (Jasper
Jay and old Mr. Crow) Mr. Hermit
Thrush hurried back across Cedar Swamp
and went straight to an old hemlock tree,
where he knew he would find Benjamin
Bat asleep.

Hanging by his heels head downward
from a limb, Benjamin Bat did not hear
the Hermit speak to him until that soft-spoken
gentleman had called to him several
times.

But at last Benjamin Bat opened
his eyes and stared around in a bewildered
fashion. It was broad dayp. 112light.
And he couldn't see what had disturbed
him. He seemed somewhat alarmed
too, until the Hermit said, "Don't be
frightened! It's only I!"

Well, Benjamin Bat knew right away
that nobody but the Hermit would speak
in just that way. And he was much relieved
to know that it wasn't Solomon
Owl that had awakened him.

"I'm glad you roused me," he said,
"though generally I hate to have my sleep
broken. But just now I was having a
nightmare. I was dreaming that a monstrous
Katydid was chasing me. And if
you hadn't called to me I don't know what
would have happened.... I think," he
added, "I must have dined too heartily       on
Katydids       last night."

The Hermit couldn't help looking a bit
shocked. He had never approved of Benjamin
Bat, who prowled about at nightp. 113
when all respectable people were at home
and asleep. And as for over-eating, that
was something the Hermit wouldn't think
of doing. But if he must choose between
Benjamin Bat and Bobby Bobolink for a
neighbor, of the two the Hermit preferred
Benjamin Bat, because Benjamin was always
asleep in the daytime, while at
night he never disturbed the Hermit's
rest.

"I've come to ask a favor of you," Mr.
Hermit Thrush explained. "Perhaps you
don't know there's a noisy nuisance hereabouts
who calls himself Bobby Bobolink?"

"I do," Benjamin Bat admitted. "But
I've never seen him       nor even heard
him."

"Then you are a sound sleeper indeed,"
the Hermit observed. "He's always
a-jingling and a-jangling."

p. 114"That sounds as if he might be a bell,"
Benjamin Bat remarked.

"He's a bird," the Hermit explained.
And then he proceeded to tell Benjamin
Bat how Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay had
quarrelled because Mr. Crow said that
Bobby Bobolink couldn't beat Benjamin
Bat in a race, while Jasper Jay claimed
that he could. "What I'd like you to do
is to have a race with Bobby Bobolink to-morrow,"
the Hermit announced.

But Benjamin Bat shook his head.

"It doesn't interest me," he said. "Let
Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay quarrel all they
want to!"

And before the Hermit had time
to coax him to change his mind, Benjamin
Bat fell fast asleep. Nor could the
Hermit rouse him again.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
