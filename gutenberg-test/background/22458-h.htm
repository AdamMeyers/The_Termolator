<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="cap">NO name in history lies deeper in Swedish
hearts than the name Gustavus Vasa. Liberator
of Sweden from the yoke of Denmark, and
founder of one of the foremost dynasties of Europe,
his people during more than three centuries
have looked back fondly to the figure of their
great ruler, and cherished with tender reverence
every incident in his romantic history. This enthusiasm
for Gustavus Vasa is more than sentiment;
it belongs to him as leader in a vast political upheaval.
When Gustavus came upon the stage,
the Swedish people had long been groaning under
a foreign despotism. During more than a century
their political existence had been ignored,
their rights as freemen trampled in the dust.
They had at last been goaded into a spirit of
rebellion, and were already struggling to be free.
What they most needed was a leader with courage
to summon them to arms, and with perseverance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
to keep them in the field. Possessing these
traits beyond all others, Gustavus called his
people forth to war, and finally brought them
through the war to victory. This revolution
extended over a period of seven years,&mdash;from
the uprising of the Dalesmen in 1521 to the coronation
of Gustavus in 1528. It is a period that
should be of interest, not only to the student of
history, but also to the lover of romance. In
order to render the exact nature of the struggle
clear, I have begun the narrative at a time considerably
before the revolution, though I have
not entered deeply into details till the beginning
of the war in 1521. By the middle of the year
1523, when Gustavus was elected king, actual
warfare had nearly ceased, and the scenes of the
drama change from the battle-field to the legislative
chamber. In this period occurred the
crowning act of the revolution; namely, the
banishment of the Romish Church and clergy.</p>

<p>The history of the Swedish Revolution has
never before been written in the English language.
Even Gustavus Vasa is but little known
outside his native land. Doubtless this is due in
large measure to the difficulties which beset a
study of the period. It is not a period to which
the student of literature can turn with joy. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
who would know Gustavus well must traverse a
vast desert of dreary reading, and pore over
many volumes of verbose despatches before he
can find a drop of moisture to relieve the arid
soil. Sweden in the early part of the sixteenth
century was not fertile in literary men. Gustavus
himself, judged by any rational standard,
was an abominable writer. His despatches are
in number almost endless and in length appalling.
Page after page he runs on, seemingly with no
other object than to use up time. Often a document
covers four folios, which might easily have
been compressed into a single sentence. Such
was the habit of the age. A simple letter from a
man to his wife consisted mainly of a mass of
stereotyped expressions of respect. Language
was used apparently to conceal vacuity of mind.
Toward the close of the monarch's reign there
was a marked improvement in literary style, and
some few works of that period possess real worth.
These have recently been printed, and as a rule
have been edited with considerable care. The
king's despatches are also being systematically
printed by the authorities of the Royal Archives
at Stockholm, and the cloud of ignorance which
has hitherto hung over the head of Sweden's
early monarch is lifting fast. The tenth volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of the king's despatches, known as <i>Gustaf I.'s
registratur</i> has now been published, carrying this
contemporary transcript of the king's letters
down to the summer of 1535. The only documents
bearing on the Swedish Revolution and not
yet published, are the MSS. known as <i>Gustaf I.'s
r&aring;dslagar</i>, <i>Gustaf I.'s acta historica</i>, and <i>Gustaf I.'s
bref med bilagor</i>,&mdash;all to be found in the Royal
Archives at Stockholm,&mdash;and the MSS. known
as the <i>Palmski&ouml;ld samlingar</i> in the Upsala Library.
All these I have carefully examined. I have also
browsed during several months among the libraries
of Sweden, and have spared no pains to get
at everything, written or printed, contemporary
or subsequent, that might throw light upon the
subject. The most important of these materials
are mentioned in the bibliography inserted immediately
before the Index to this work. In
order to add vividness as well as accuracy to the
narrative, I have visited personally nearly all the
battle-fields and other spots connected with this
history. My descriptions of the leading contemporaries
of Gustavus are based on a careful study
of the portraits in the Gripsholm gallery, most of
which were painted from life.</p>

<p>Finally, a word of thanks is due to the libraries
and archives from which I have derived most aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Of these the chief are the British Museum, the
University Library at Upsala, and above all, the
Royal Library and the Royal Archives at Stockholm.
To the last two institutions I owe more
than I can express. They are the storehouses
of Swedish history, and their doors were thrown
open to me with a generosity and freedom beyond
all that I could hope. I wish here to thank my
many friends, the custodians of these treasures,
for the personal encouragement and assistance
they have lent me in the prosecution of this
work.</p>

<p class="cap">THE manor of Lindholm lies in the centre of a
smiling district about twenty miles north of the
capital of Sweden. Placed on a height between two
fairy lakes, it commands a wide and varied prospect
over the surrounding country. The summit of this
height was crowned, at the close of the fifteenth century,
by a celebrated mansion. Time and the ravages
of man have long since thrown this mansion to the
ground; but its foundation, overgrown with moss and
fast crumbling to decay, still marks the site of the
ancient structure, and from the midst of the ruins
rises a rough-hewn stone bearing the name Gustavus
Vasa. On this spot he was born, May 12, 1496.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
estate was then the property of his grandmother, Sigrid
Baner, with whom his mother was temporarily residing,
and there is no reason to think it continued long the
home of the young Gustavus.</p>

<p>The family from which Gustavus sprang had been,
during nearly a hundred years, one of the foremost
families of Sweden. Its coat-of-arms consisted of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
simple <i>vase</i>, or bundle of sticks; and the Vasa estate, at
one time the residence of his ancestors, lay only about
ten miles to the north of Lindholm.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The first Vasa of
whom anything is definitely known is Kristiern Nilsson,
the great-grandfather of Gustavus. This man became
noted in the early part of the fifteenth century as an
ardent monarchist, and under Erik held the post of
chancellor. After the fall of his master, in 1436, his
office was taken from him, but he continued to battle
for the cause of royalty until his death. Of the chancellor's
three sons, the two eldest followed zealously in
the footsteps of their father. The other, Johan Kristersson,
though in early life a stanch supporter of King
Christiern, and one of the members of his Cabinet, later
married a sister of Sten Sture, and eventually embraced
the Swedish cause. Birgitta, the wife of Johan Kristersson,
is said to have been descended from the ancient
Swedish kings.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The youngest son of Johan and Birgitta
was Erik Johansson, the father of Gustavus. Of
Erik's early history we know little more than that he
married Cecilia, daughter of Magnus Karlsson and
Sigrid Baner, and settled at Rydboholm, an estate which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he inherited from his father. To this place, beautifully
situated on an arm of the Baltic, about ten miles northeast
of the capital, Cecilia returned with her little boy
from Lindholm; and here Gustavus spent the first years
of his childhood.</p>

<p>Sweden at this period was in a state of anarchy. In
order to appreciate the exact condition of affairs, it
will be necessary to cast a glance at some political
developments that had gone before. Sweden was originally
a confederation of provinces united solely for
purposes of defence. Each province was divided into
several counties, which were constituted in the main
alike. Every inhabitant&mdash;if we except the class of
slaves, which was soon abolished&mdash;was either a landowner
or a tenant. The tenants were freemen who
owned no land of their own, and hence rented the land
of others. All landowners possessed the same rights,
though among them were certain men of high birth, who
through their large inheritances were much more influential
than the rest. Matters concerning the inhabitants
of one county only were regulated by the county assemblies,
to which all landowners in the county, and none
others, were admitted. These assemblies were called
and presided over by the county magistrate, elected by
general vote at some previous assembly. All law cases
arising in the county were tried before the assembly,
judgment being passed, with consent of the assembly,
by the county magistrate, who was expected to know
and expound the traditional law of his county. Questions
concerning the inhabitants of more than one
county were regulated by the provincial assemblies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
composed of all landowners in the province, and presided
over by the provincial magistrate, elected by all
the landowners in his province. The power of the provincial
magistrate in the province was similar to that
of the county magistrate in the county; and to his judgment,
with consent of the assembly, lay an appeal from
every decision of the county magistrates. Above all
the provinces was a king, elected originally by the provincial
assembly of Upland, though in order to gain
the allegiance of the other provinces he was bound to
appear before their individual assemblies and be confirmed
by them. His duty was expressed in the old
formula, "landom r&aring;da, rike styre, lag styrke, och frid
h&aring;lla," which meant nothing more than that he was to
protect the provinces from one another and from foreign
powers. In order to defray the expense of strengthening
the kingdom, he was entitled to certain definite
taxes from every landowner, and half as much from
every tenant, in the land. These taxes he collected
through his courtiers, who in the early days were men of
a very inferior class,&mdash;mere servants of the king. They
lived on the crown estates, which we find in the very
earliest times scattered through the land. Besides his
right to collect taxes, the king, as general peacemaker,
was chief-justice of the realm, and to him lay an appeal
from every decision rendered by a provincial magistrate.
Such, in brief, was the constitution of Sweden
when first known in history.</p>

<p>Christianity, first preached in Sweden about the year
830, brought with it a diminution of the people's rights.
When the episcopal dioceses were first marked out, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
people naturally kept in their own hands the right to
choose their spiritual rulers, who were designated <i>lydbiskopar</i>,
or the people's bishops. But in 1164 the Court of
Rome succeeded in establishing, under its own authority,
an archbishopric at Upsala; and by a papal bull of
1250 the choice of Swedish bishops was taken from the
people and confided to the cathedral chapters under the
supervision of the pope. As soon as the whole country
became converted, the piety of the people induced them
to submit to gross impositions at the hands of those
whom they were taught to regard as God's representatives
on earth. In 1152 the so-called "Peter's Penning"
was established, an annual tax of one penning
from every individual to the pope. Besides this, it became
the law, soon after, that all persons must pay a
tenth of their annual income to the Church, and in
addition there were special taxes to the various bishops,
deans, and pastors. A still more productive source of
revenue to the Church was death-bed piety, through
which means a vast amount of land passed from kings
or wealthy individuals to the Church. By a law of the
year 1200 the clergy were declared no longer subject to
be tried for crime in temporal courts; and by the end of
the thirteenth century the Church had practically ceased
to be liable for crown taxation. It requires but a moment's
thought to perceive how heavy a burden all these
changes threw on the body of the nation.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the spread of Christianity still
another power began to trample on the liberties of the
people. This was the power of the sword. In early
times, before civilization had advanced enough to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
everybody continuous employment, most people spent
their leisure moments in making war. Hence the Swedish
kings, whose duty it was to keep the peace, could
accomplish that result only by having a large retinue
of armed warriors at their command. The expense
which this entailed was great. Meantime the crown
estates had continually increased in number through
merger of private estates of different kings, through
crown succession to estates of foreigners dying without
descendants in the realm, and through other sources.
Some of the kings, therefore, devised the scheme of enlisting
the influential aristocracy in their service by
granting them fiefs in the crown estates, with right
to all the crown incomes from the fief. This plan was
eagerly caught at by the aristocrats, and before long
nearly all the influential people in the realm were in the
service of the king. Thus the position of royal courtier,
which had formerly been a mark of servitude, was now
counted an honor, the courtiers being now commonly
known as magnates. About the year 1200 castles were
first erected on some of the crown estates, and the
magnates who held these castles as fiefs were not slow
to take advantage of their power. Being already the
most influential men in their provinces, and generally
the county or provincial magistrates, they gradually
usurped the right to govern the surrounding territory,
not as magistrates of the people, but as grantees of the
crown estates. Since these fiefs were not hereditary,
the rights usurped by the holders of them passed, on
the death of the grantees, to the crown, and in 1276 we
find a king granting not only one of his royal castles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but also right of administration over the surrounding
land. Thus, by continual enlargement of the royal fiefs,
the authority of the provincial assemblies, and even of
the county assemblies, was practically destroyed. Still,
these assemblies continued to exist, and in them the poor
landowners claimed the same rights as the more influential
magnates. The magnates, as such, possessed no
privileges, and were only powerful because of their
wealth, which enabled them to become courtiers or warriors
of the king. In 1280, however, a law was passed
exempting all mounted courtiers from crown taxation.
This law was the foundation of the nobility of Sweden.
It divided the old landowners, formerly all equal, into
two distinct classes,&mdash;the knights, who were the mounted
warriors of the king; and the poorer landowners, on whom,
together with the class of tenants, was cast the whole
burden of taxation. With the progress of time, exemption
from crown taxation was extended to the sons of
knights unless, on reaching manhood, they failed to
serve the king with horse. The knights were thus a
privileged and hereditary class. Those of the old magnates
who did not become knights were known as armigers,
or armor-clad foot-soldiers. The armigers also
became an hereditary class, and before long they too
were exempted from crown taxation. In many cases
the armigers were raised to the rank of knights. Thus
the wealthy landowners increased in power, while the
poor, who constituted the great body of the nation, grew
ever poorer. Many, to escape the taxes shifted to their
shoulders from the shoulders of the magnates, sank into
the class of tenants, with whom, indeed, they now had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
much in common. The sword had raised the strong
into a privileged aristocracy, and degraded the weak
into a down-trodden peasantry.</p>

<p>The aristocracy and the Church,&mdash;these were the
thorns that sprang up to check the nation's growth.
Each had had the same source,&mdash;a power granted by the
people. But no sooner were they independent of their
benefactors, than they made common cause in oppressing
the peasantry who had given them birth. They
found their point of union in the Cabinet. This was
originally a body of men whom the king summoned
whenever he needed counsel or support. Naturally he
sought support among the chief men of his realm. As
the power of the Church and aristocracy increased, the
king was practically forced to summon the chief persons
in these classes to his Cabinet, and furthermore,
in most cases, to follow their advice; so that by the
close of the thirteenth century the Cabinet had become
a regular institution, whose members, known as Cabinet
lords, governed rather than advised the king. In
the early part of the fourteenth century this institution
succeeded in passing a law that each new king must
summon his Cabinet immediately after his election.
The same law provided that no foreigner could be a
member of the Cabinet; that the archbishop should be
<i>ex officio</i> a member; that twelve laymen should be summoned,
but no more; and that, in addition, the king
might summon as many of the bishops and clergy as
he wished. As a matter of fact this law was never followed.
The Cabinet lords practically formed themselves
into a close corporation, appointing their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
successors or compelling the king to appoint whom
they desired. Generally the members were succeeded
by their sons, and in very many instances we find
fathers and sons sitting in the Cabinet together. A
person once a Cabinet lord was such for life. The
law providing that the archbishop should have a seat
in the Cabinet was strictly followed, and in practice
the bishops were also always members. The other
clergy seem never to have been summoned except in
certain instances to aid their bishops or represent them
when they could not come. The provincial magistrates
were generally members, though not always. As to the
number of temporal lords, it was almost invariably
more than twelve, sometimes double as many. From the
very first, this self-appointed oligarchy saw that in unity
was strength; and while the different members of the
royal family were squabbling among themselves, the
Cabinet seized the opportunity to increase its power.
Though not entitled to a definite salary, it was regularly
understood that Cabinet lords were to be paid by
grants of the chief fiefs; and when these fiefs were extended
so as to embrace the whole, or nearly the whole,
of a province, the grant of such a fief ordinarily carried
with it the office of provincial magistrate. Thus the
Cabinet became the centre of administration for the kingdom.
From this it gradually usurped the right to legislate
for the whole realm, to lay new taxes on the people,
and to negotiate treaties with foreign powers. Lastly,
it robbed the people of their ancient right to nominate
and confirm their kings. These prerogatives, however,
were not exercised without strong opposition. Throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the peasantry
battled with vigor against the arrogant assumptions
of the Cabinet, never relinquishing their claim to be
governed as of yore. This struggle against the encroachments
of the oligarchy at last resulted in the
revolution under Gustavus Vasa. Hence we may with
profit trace the relation between the Cabinet and the
people from the start.</p>

<p>The first case in which the Cabinet distinctly asserted
an authority over the whole land occurred in 1319, when
the king, after a long and bitter struggle with different
members of the royal house, had finally been driven
from the throne. The Cabinet then resolved to place
the crown on the head of the former monarch's grandson,
a child but three years old. With this in view,
they called all the magnates in the realm and four peasants
from every county to a general diet, where the
chancellor of the Cabinet stepped forward with the
infant in his arms, and moved that this infant be
elected king. "Courtiers, peasantry, and all with one
accord responded, 'Amen.'" This was the first general
diet held in Sweden, and it showed a marked decline
in the people's rights. From beginning to end
the proceedings of this diet were regulated by the Cabinet,
and the people were practically forced to acquiesce.
Even had the people possessed a real voice in the election,
their influence would have been far less than formerly,
since here they had but four representatives from
each county against the entire class of magnates, whereas
originally every landowner, whether magnate or peasant,
had an equal vote. During the minority of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
king the power of the Cabinet made rapid strides. He
was forced to borrow from them enormous sums of
money, for which he mortgaged nearly all the royal
castles; so that when he came of age he was thoroughly
under the dominion of the Cabinet. He struggled
hard, however, to shake off his shackles, and with
some success. Among other things, he passed a law
which was intended to restore to the people at large
their ancient right to choose their kings. This law provided
that whenever a king was to be chosen, each
provincial magistrate, with the assent of all landowners
in his province, should select twelve men, who on a day
appointed were to meet in general diet with all the magistrates,
and choose the king. Unhappily this law was
never followed, though the king by whom it was enacted
struggled hard to maintain the people's rights.
In 1359, after a series of internal disorders, his Cabinet
compelled him to call a meeting of all the magnates
in the realm; but in addition to the magnates he summoned
also delegates from the peasantry and burghers,
evidently with a view to gain their aid in curbing the
insolence of the Cabinet. This was the second general
diet. From this time forth the king did all he
could to strengthen the people, until at last he banished
a number of his chief opponents. They thereupon, in
1363, offered the crown to Albert of Mecklenburg, who
by their aid succeeded in overthrowing the king and
getting possession of the throne. For a time now the
Cabinet had things nearly as they wished. In 1371
they forced the king to grant them all the royal estates
as fiefs, and to declare that on the death of any one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
them his successor should be chosen by the survivors.
This astounding grant the Cabinet owed chiefly to the
influence of their chancellor, Bo Jonsson, who had done
more than any other to set Albert on the throne; and to
him were granted as fiefs all the royal castles. In 1386
he died, leaving all his fiefs, by will, to the chief magnates
of the land. Against this Albert ventured to
protest. He called in a large number of his German
countrymen, and by their aid recovered a large portion
of his power. He then began distributing royal favors
among them with a lavish hand, to the detriment of the
Swedish magnates. These magnates therefore turned,
in 1388, to Margaret, regent of Denmark and Norway,
and offered her the regency of Sweden, promising to
recognize as king whomever she should choose. In 1389
she entered Sweden with her army, overthrew King Albert,
and got possession of the throne. In 1396 the Swedish
Cabinet, at her desire, elected her nephew, Erik of
Pomerania, already king of Denmark and Norway, to be
king of Sweden; and on the 17th of June, 1397, he was
crowned at Kalmar.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Thus began the celebrated Kalmar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Union, one of the greatest political blunders that a nation
ever made. It was the voluntary enslavement of a whole
people to suit the whims of a few disgruntled magnates.</p>

<p>The century following this catastrophe was marked
by violence and bloodshed. In all the setting up and
pulling down of kings which ended in the Kalmar Union,
the Swedish peasantry, now the body of the nation, had
had no part. They had long watched in silence the
overpowering growth of the magnates and of the Church;
they had seen their own rights gradually, but surely,
undermined; and they now beheld the whole nation
given into the hand of a foreign king. All this tyranny
was beginning to produce its natural effect. A spirit of
rebellion was spreading fast. However, open insurrection
was for the moment averted by the prudence of the
regent; so long as she lived the people were tolerably
content. She ruled the Cabinet with an iron hand, and
refused to appoint a chancellor, the officer who had
hitherto done much to bind the Cabinet together. After
her death Erik attempted to carry out a similar policy,
and introduced a number of foreigners into the Swedish
Cabinet. But his continual absence from the realm
weakened his administration, and gave great license<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to his officers, who by their cruelty won the hatred of
the people. At last, in 1433, the peasantry of Dalarne
rebelled against the tyranny of the steward whom their
Danish ruler had put over them, and in 1435, under the
leadership of a courageous warrior, Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson,
compelled the king to call a general diet, the
first since 1359, consisting of all the people in the realm
who cared to take part. This diet, under the enthusiasm
of the moment, elected Engelbrekt commander of the
kingdom. But the hopes of the peasantry were soon
blasted. In the next year Engelbrekt was murdered by
a Swedish magnate, and by a general diet Karl Knutsson,
another magnate, was chosen to fill his place. King
Erik was now tottering to his fall. He was no longer
king in anything but name. His fall, however, benefited
only the magnates of the realm. By a general diet of
1438, to which all people in the realm were called,
Knutsson was elected regent. But his reign came in
the next year to an untimely end. His fellow-magnates,
jealous of his power, forced him to lay it down; and in
1440 the Cabinet called Erik's nephew, Christopher of
Bavaria, already king of Denmark, to the Swedish
throne. Thus ended the first effort of the Swedish
peasantry to throw off the Danish yoke. It had begun
with high promises for the people, but had ended in the
restoration of the Cabinet to all its former power. From
this time forth the Cabinet was again practically the
governing body in the realm. But it was no longer at
unity with itself. One party, led by the great house of
Oxenstjerna, was for preserving the Union. The other
consisted of the adherents of Karl Knutsson, who hoped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to put the crown on his own head. In 1448 King
Christopher died, and, in the difference of feeling which
reigned, the Cabinet called a general diet of all the
magnates with representatives from the peasantry and
burghers, that the people at large might choose of the
two evils that which pleased them best. The result was
that Karl Knutsson was elected king. From this time
till his death, in 1470, he was in perpetual warfare with
the king of Denmark, with the Swedish priesthood, who
had now grown fat under Danish rule and wished to
continue so, and with the hostile party among the magnates.
Twice he was forced to lay down the crown
only to take it up again. Throughout his reign, though
in some regards a despot, he was, at all events, the
champion of the Swedish magnates as opposed to those
who favored the continuance of foreign rule. In 1470
he died, after having intrusted Stockholm Castle to his
nephew, Sten Sture. The dissension that now reigned
throughout the land was great. On one side were the
powerful Vasa and Oxenstjerna families, striving to put
Christiern I. of Denmark on the throne. On the other
side was Sten Sture, the Tott, Gyllenstjerna, Bonde,
Bjelke, and Natt och Dag families, supported by the
burgher element in Stockholm and the peasantry of
Dalarne. With such odds on their side the issue could
not long be doubtful. At a general diet held in 1471,
Sten Sture was chosen regent of the kingdom. It is
impossible to overrate the significance of this event.
This was the first time that the burgher element played
an important part in the election of Sweden's ruler.
The peasantry had once before been prominent, but so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
long as the oligarchy held firmly together, their actual
influence had been slight. Now the ranks of the oligarchy
were broken. One party looked for supporters
in Denmark and in the Church; the other, now gaining
the upper hand, was distinctly the party of the people.
The very name of regent, which was granted to Sten
Sture, bears witness to the popular character of the
movement. And this was destined to be the tendency
of the current during the next half-century. There
were many difficulties, however, with which the patriot
party had to contend. In the first place, the Swedish
party was in lack of funds. An enormous proportion of
the kingdom was exempt from taxes, being held by
magnates, who by this time claimed the right to inherit
their fathers' fiefs with all the ancient privileges, but
without the ancient duty to render military service. In
this juncture war broke out with Russia, at the same
time that the kingdom was continually harassed by
Christiern, king of Denmark. It was clear that some
new mode must be discovered for raising money. The
peasantry were already groaning under a heavier load
than they could bear. Sten therefore turned to some
of the magnates, and demanded of them that they should
give up a portion of their fiefs. They of course resisted,
and his whole reign was occupied with a struggle
to make them yield. In 1481 Christiern, king of Denmark,
died, and was succeeded by his son Hans. The
efforts of Sten Sture to curb the magnates had rendered
him so unpopular among them, that the Swedish Cabinet
now opened negotiations with the new king of Denmark.
These negotiations resulted in a meeting of the Cabinets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the three Northern kingdoms, held at Kalmar in
1483. This body promulgated a decree, known in history
as the Kalmar Recess, accepting Hans as king of
Sweden. To this decree Sten Sture reluctantly affixed
his seal. The main clauses of the decree were these:
No one in Sweden was to be held accountable for past
opposition to King Hans; the king was to live one year
alternately in each kingdom; the high posts as well as
the fiefs of Sweden should be granted to none but
Swedes; and the magnates should be free to fortify their
estates and refuse the king admittance. This decree, if
strictly followed, would have practically freed Sweden
from the yoke of Denmark. But as a matter of fact it
was several years before it was destined to go into operation
at all. The Swedish Cabinet were determined
that no step should be taken to put the decree into
effect until certain preliminary duties were discharged;
among them, the cession of the island of Gotland to
Sweden. These preliminaries Hans was in no hurry to
perform. Meantime Sten Sture continued to act as
regent. His path remained as rugged as before. Beset
on all sides by enemies, each struggling for his own
aggrandizement, Sten had all he could do to keep the
kingdom from going to pieces. In every measure to
increase the income of the crown he was hampered by
the overweening power of the Cabinet, who were reluctant
to give up a jot or tittle of their ill-acquired wealth.
Chief among his opponents was the archbishop, Jacob
Ulfsson,&mdash;a man of rare ability, but of high birth and
far too fond of self-advancement. Another enemy, who
ought to have been a friend, was Svante Sture, a young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
magnate of great talent, who first became imbittered
against his illustrious namesake because the latter, on
the death of Svante's father, in 1494, claimed that the
fiefs which he had held should be surrendered to the
crown. Of Erik Trolle, another opponent of Sten Sture,
we shall see more hereafter. His strongest supporter
was one Hemming Gad, a learned, eloquent, and dauntless
gentleman, who also was to play a leading r&ocirc;le
before many years were past. In 1493 war broke out
again with Russia, and Hans resolved to seize this
opportunity to make good his claims in Sweden. He
opened negotiations once more with the disaffected
members of the Cabinet, still hoping to make compromise
with Sture; they hesitated, they promised, and
then made new demands; and it was in the midst of
this elaborate trifling, while the regent was in Finland
conducting the Russian war, that Gustavus Vasa was
born at Lindholm.</p>

<p>Affairs in Sweden were now fast coming to a crisis.
The fitful struggle of a century had at last assumed a
definite and unmistakable direction. All Sweden was
now divided into two distinct and hostile camps, and to
the dullest intellect it was clear as day that Sweden was
soon to be the scene of open war. In the autumn of
1496 the Cabinet, seeing that Sture was thoroughly determined
to check their power, resolved to hesitate no
longer. They therefore despatched a messenger to Hans,
inviting him to a congress of the three realms to be held
at midsummer of the following year, when, as they gave
him reason to expect, the Kalmar Recess should be put
into effect. This news being brought to Sture in Finland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he set forth post-haste for Sweden, and called a
meeting of the Cabinet. The members failed to appear
on the day appointed, and when at last they came, they
were accompanied by a large body of armed retainers.
At a session held in Stockholm on the 7th of March,
the Cabinet declared Sture deposed, assigning as reasons,
first, that he had mismanaged the war with Russia, and,
secondly, that he had maltreated certain of the Swedish
magnates. The regent waited two days before making
a reply, and then informed the Cabinet that, as he had
been appointed to the regency by joint action of the
Cabinet and people, he felt bound to hold it till requested
by the same powers to lay it down. The Cabinet
had nothing for it but to acquiesce, and letters were
issued summoning a general diet. That diet, however,
was never held. On the very day when the Cabinet made
its armistice with Sture, Hans put forth a declaration of
war, and at once proceeded with his fleet to Kalmar. The
enemies of Sture now openly embraced the Danish cause;
and the regent was forced to go to Dalarne, to get together
a force with which to defend the kingdom. Here
he was received with enthusiasm by the people, who
saw in him the defender of their rights. At the head of
a detachment of Dalesmen, reinforced by his army now
recalled from Finland, he marched to Upsala, and laid
siege to the archbishop's palace. By the middle of
July it fell; and Sture advanced to St&auml;ket, a strongly
fortified castle of the archbishop, about thirty miles
south of Upsala. While beleaguering this place, he
learned that a portion of the Danish forces were advancing
on the capital. He therefore relinquished the siege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of St&auml;ket, and proceeded to Stockholm, where he held
himself in readiness to repel the enemy. On the 29th
of September, being led by a ruse outside the city, he
was surrounded by the Danes, and was able to recover
the castle only after heavy loss. This battle sealed his
fate. Finding himself far outnumbered, he deemed it
wise to yield; and on the 6th of October, 1497, Hans was
recognized by him as king.</p>

<p>The reign of Hans lasted about four years. At first
he appeared desirous to promote the welfare of Sweden
and to conform to the terms of the Kalmar Recess. But
before long even the Cabinet began to grow weary of
their king. The benefits conferred upon them were not
so great as they had hoped. As for Sture, at his renunciation
of the regency he had been granted extensive
fiefs both in Sweden and in Finland; but in 1499 the
king forced him to resign a large portion of these fiefs.
The other members of the Cabinet, now having less
cause of jealousy, became more friendly to Sten Sture.
His old enemy, Svante Sture, was at length reconciled to
him through the mediation of their common admirer,
Dr. Hemming Gad. Even with the clergy Sten Sture
was now on better terms; and at his solicitation, in January,
1501, the Chapter of Link&ouml;ping elected Gad to fill
their vacant see. The main ground of complaint against
Hans was that he disregarded the clause of the Recess
which forbade the granting of Swedish fiefs to Danes.
Matters reached a crisis in 1501, when Sten and Svante
Sture, Gad, and three others met in council and took oath
to resist the oppression of their foreign ruler. This step
was the signal for a general explosion. On every side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the people rose in arms. Hans was in despair. He
first took counsel with his warm supporter, the archbishop,
and then, on the 11th of August, 1501, set off
with his whole fleet for Denmark.</p>

<p>In the royal castle at Stockholm he left his wife
Christina, who, with Erik Trolle and a force of one
thousand men, was determined to resist. Gad, whose
election to the bishopric of Link&ouml;ping the pope refused
to ratify, undertook to besiege the castle. Meantime
Svante Sture laid siege to &Ouml;rebro, and Sten proceeded
to Dalarne and other parts to gather forces. On the
12th of November the Cabinet again called Sten Sture
to the regency. In February the Castle of &Ouml;rebro fell.
And still Christina with her brave followers held out.
Not till the 9th of May, after a bloody assault, could
the patriots force a passage. Then they found that, of
the one thousand who had formed the original garrison,
but seventy were alive. Christina was conveyed to
Vadstena, where she remained several months pending
negotiations. At the close of the year 1503 she was
accompanied to the frontier by the regent, who however
was taken ill on his return journey, and died at
J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping on the 13th of December, 1503. Sten Sture
had done much for Sweden. Though himself a magnate,
and ambitious to increase his power, he was zealous
for the welfare of his country, and did more than
any other of his time to awake Sweden to a sense of her
existence as a nation. It was on the foundation laid
by him that a still greater leader was soon to build a
mighty edifice.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January, 1504, at a general diet of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
magnates, with delegates from the burghers and peasantry
of Sweden, Svante Sture was elected regent. His
reign was even more warlike than that of his predecessor.
The Cabinet, it is true, had come to see the
benefits resulting from Sten Sture's rule, and the majority
of them were lukewarm adherents of the Swedish
party. But Hans was more determined than ever to
seize the crown, and not only harassed Svante throughout
his reign by a long series of invasions, but did all
he could to compromise him with other foreign powers.
Svante, however, succeeded in winning many friends.
In 1504 he concluded a truce of twenty years with Russia,
which was extended, by treaty of 1510, to 1564. In
1510 an alliance was also formed between Sweden and the
Vend cities. In 1506 the Dalesmen, at one of their assemblies,
issued a letter to the people of their provinces,
urging them to support Svante with life and limb. But
this burst of enthusiasm was short-lived. The war with
Hans hung on. New taxes had to be imposed, and several
fiefs to which different magnates laid claim were
appropriated to the crown. Discontent spread once
more, and at a Cabinet meeting held in September,
1511, Svante was declared deposed. He refused to yield
till heard by a general diet of the kingdom, and while
negotiations were pending, on the 2d of January, 1512,
he died.</p>

<p>Nothing could have given certain members of the
Cabinet greater pleasure. The clerical members especially,
being warmly attached to the Danish cause,
thought they now saw an opportunity to set Hans on the
throne. About the middle of January the Cabinet came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
together and, at the solicitation of Archbishop Ulfsson,
resolved to intrust the government for the time being
to Erik Trolle. This gentleman, of whom we have already
seen something, was of high birth as well as
talent, thoroughly versed in affairs, and allied to the
Danish party not only by family connection, but also by
reason of large estates in Denmark. He was, moreover,
a warm friend of the archbishop.</p>

<p>However, the hopes of Trolle were not destined to be
realized. At the death of Svante, the Castle of &Ouml;rebro
was in command of a daring and ambitious youth of
nineteen, known to history as Sten Sture the Younger.
He was Svante's son, and in the preceding year had
married Christina Gyllenstjerna, a great-granddaughter
of King Karl Knutsson. Immediately on hearing of his
father's death, he hastened to Vester&aring;s, took possession
of the castle, and despatched a messenger to convey the
news to Stockholm. On the 8th of January the steward
of Stockholm Castle declared his readiness to yield the
command to Sture, and within a day or two the castles
of Stegeborg and Kalmar were also given up. The energy
with which this chivalrous youth seized the helm
is all the more astounding when we reflect that he stood
almost alone against the Cabinet. He could not even
ask the advice of Gad, his father's trusty friend, for
that doughty patriot was at the moment outside the
realm. But his zeal won him numerous friends among
the younger magnates, and the peasantry throughout
the country were on his side. All winter long the battle
raged between the two factions, but meantime Sture
continually grew in favor. No general diet of the kingdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was summoned, but it was understood on every
hand that the matter would be submitted to the people
when they came together on St. Erik's day at Upsala.
On that day, May 18, the archbishop and his followers
addressed the people in the Grand Square at Upsala,
and announced that the Cabinet had resolved to raise
Erik Trolle to the regency. But they were met by
shouts from the crowd, who declared that they would
have no Danes. Meantime Sture had been holding a
mass-meeting on the so-called Royal Meadow outside
the town, and had been enthusiastically applauded by
the people. Even yet, however, the conflict did not
cease. The Cabinet still clamored for Erik Trolle, and
it was not till the 23d of July, when every hope was
gone, that they finally gave way and recognized Sture
as regent. Sture now set forth on a journey through
Sweden and Finland, receiving everywhere the allegiance
of the people. All at last seemed in his favor,
when suddenly, on the 20th of February, 1513, the
face of things was changed by the unexpected death of
Hans.</p>

<p>Before considering the effect of this catastrophe, let
us return to the little boy whom we last saw on his
father's estate at Rydboholm. Even he was not wholly
outside the conflict. His father, Erik, whom we find in
1488 subscribing his name as a knight,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> took an
active part in the commotions of his times, and early
won ill-favor with King Hans. The young Gustavus
in his fifth year, so runs the story, happened to be
playing in the hall of Stockholm Castle, when King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Hans espied him, and, attracted by his winning manners,
patted him on the head and said, "You'll be
a great man in your day, if you live." But when he
found out who the child was, he wanted to carry him off
to Denmark with him. To this the boy's great-uncle,
Sture, raised serious objections, and lest the king should
use some treachery, hurried Gustavus out of the way at
once.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In the very next year, 1501, occurred the rebellion
against Hans, which resulted in the election of
Sture to the regency. Erik was one of the supporters
of his uncle throughout this strife, and in 1502 we find
him signing a document as member of the Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
About the same time he was made commandant of
Kastelholm Castle.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This post, however, he held but a
short time, and then retired to his old estate at Rydboholm.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Among his children, besides Gustavus, were
one younger boy, Magnus, and several girls. Gustavus,
we are told, was a handsome, attractive little fellow,
and it is added that in his sports he was always recognized
as leader by his playmates.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In 1509, when
in his thirteenth year, he was sent by his parents to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Upsala, and placed in a preparatory school.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Soon
after, probably in the next year, Gustavus was admitted
to the University. This institution, which had been
founded in 1477, through the persistent efforts of Archbishop
Ulfsson, and of which the archbishop was chancellor,
was at this time in a semi-dormant state. Scarce
anything is known either about its professors or about
the number of its students. It is probable, however,
that Peder Galle, who was cantor of the Upsala Chapter
so early as 1504,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and whose powers as a theological
gladiator will become known to us further on, was one
of the professors. Another was Henrik Sledorn,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> whom
Gustavus later made his chancellor. Of the progress
made by Gustavus in his studies we know nothing. It
may well be surmised, however, that the politics of his
day engrossed a large share of his attention. Upsala
was not then the peaceful town that it now is, and
the chancellor of the University was in the very vortex
of the struggle. If Gustavus was still connected with
the University in 1512, we may suppose with reason
that he took his part in the great demonstration which
resulted in the election of the chivalric young Sture.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> With regard to the date of his birth our authorities are hopelessly
confused. Karl IX., whom we should expect to know something
about it, says, in his <i>Rim-chr&ouml;n.</i>, p. 2, that his father was
seventy-three at his death, whence we should conclude that he was
born in 1487. But Svart, who was nearer the king's age, and was
also the king's confessor and preacher to the court, says, in his
<i>Gust. I.'s kr&ouml;n.</i>, p. 1, that Gustavus was born in 1495, on Ascension
day; which in that year, he adds, fell on the 12th of May. Tegel,
<i>Then stoormecht.</i>, p. 1, agrees that he was born on Ascension day, and
also that he was born on the 12th of May, but gives, as the year, 1490.
Ludvigsson, <i>Collect.</i>, p. 83, agrees with Tegel about the year, but says
nothing about the day. Now, it is noteworthy that while the authorities
name three different years, all of them who mention the day agree
that it was Ascension day, which in the year of his birth fell on May
12. Here, then, we have a clew. In 1487 Ascension day fell on May
24, in 1490 on May 21, and in 1495 on May 29; but, singularly enough,
in 1485, in 1491, and in 1496 it fell on May 12. The years 1485 and
1491 must be discarded as too early; for the mother of Gustavus was
then not old enough to have a child, her parents not having married
till 1475. This is proved by the grant of dowry from her father to
her mother, which, according to the old law of Sweden, was made on
the day following the marriage. This grant, dated Jan. 16, 1475, with
the seals of Magnus Karlsson and witnesses attached, is still preserved
among the parchment MSS. in the Royal Archives at Stockholm. It
reads thus: "Jack Magens Karlsson i Ekae aff wapn g&ouml;r vitherligat
och oppenbare thet jack meth mynae frenders och neste wenners
godwilge oc samtyckae vpa rette hindersdagh haffwer wntt och giffwet ...
min elskelikae hustro Siggrid Eskelsdatter efter skrefne gotz
till heder och morgengaffwer.... Som giffwit ok giortt er pa Ekae
gard mandagen nest fore sancti Henrici Episcopi dagh anno domini
MCDLXXV." Hence the only possible date of the boy's birth is
May 12, 1496; and this, as we shall see further on, harmonizes better
than any other date with his later history.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Originally the Vasa arms were black, the bundle of sticks representing
one of the old fascines used in warfare to fill up ditches. Gustavus
changed the color of his arms to gold, and altered the old fascine
into a sheaf of grain.</p></div>

On this point our authorities agree. Tegel gives a table showing
Birgitta to have been a great-granddaughter of Karl Ulfsson, who, according
to the same table, was a great-grandson of King Erik X. As
the descent is traced through a line of females about whom history is
silent, we lack the means with which to disprove the assertion of our
chroniclers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Until recently, historians have asserted that Margaret, at the coronation
of her nephew, signed a document providing, among other things,
that the three kingdoms were thereafter to be governed by a single
sovereign, to be elected alternately, if his predecessor died childless,
by each kingdom; that, in case of war in one kingdom, both the others
were to come to the rescue; and that each kingdom was to be governed
strictly according to its own laws. As a matter of fact, Margaret
signed nothing of the kind. The document which gave rise to this
error is still to be seen in the Private Archives at Copenhagen. It is
dated at Kalmar, July 20, 1397, purports to be the work of sixteen of
the chief Swedish magnates, and declares that unless the terms which
it contains are drawn up in six copies, signed by the king, the regent,
the Cabinet, and others, there shall be no lawful union. These six
copies, so far as we know, were never drawn up or signed. But unhappily
the union had been already formed at the coronation a month
before, and, seven days before, these very magnates with fifty-one other
persons had attached their seals to an affidavit of allegiance to their new
king. This affidavit, dated at Kalmar, July 13, 1397, is also still preserved
in the Private Archives at Copenhagen. Both documents are
printed in full in O. S. Rydberg's <i>Sverges traktater med fr&auml;mmande
magter</i>, Stockh., 1877-1883, 2 vols. 8vo, vol. ii. pp. 560-585.</p></div>

Tegel makes this incident occur in the child's seventh year, in 1497.
Here we have another proof that Tegel places the birth of Gustavus
too early. If the child had been born in 1490, this incident could
not have taken place till still later than his seventh year, for Hans did
not become king till 1497.</p></div>

<p class="cap">THE old town of Stockholm was beyond all doubt
the most picturesque capital in Europe. Perched
on an isle of rock at the eastern extremity of Lake
M&auml;lar, it stood forth like a sentinel guarding the entrance
to the heart of Sweden. Around its base on
north and south dashed the foaming waters of the M&auml;lar,
seeking their outlet through a narrow winding channel
to the Baltic. Across this channel on the south, and
connected with the city by a bridge, the towering cliffs
of S&ouml;dermalm gazed calmly down upon the busy traffic
of the city's streets; and far away beyond the channel
on the north stretched an undulating plain, dotted with
little patches of green shrubbery and forest. On the
west the city commanded a wide view over an enchanting
lake studded with darkly wooded isles, above whose trees
peeped here and there some grim turret or lofty spire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Finally, in the east, the burgher standing on the city's
walls could trace for several miles the current of a
silver stream, glittering in the sunlight, and twisting in
and out among the islands along the coast until at last
it lost itself in the mighty waters of the Baltic.</p>

<p>The town itself was small. The main isle, on which
"the city," so called, was built, stretched scarce a quarter
of a mile from east to west and but little more from
north to south. Nestling under the shadow of the main
isle were two smaller isles, Riddarholm on the west and
Helgeandsholm on the north, both severed from the
city by a channel about fifty feet in width. Through
the centre of the main isle ran a huge backbone of rock,
beginning at the south and rising steadily till within
a few feet of the northern shore. The summit of this
ridge was crowned by the royal citadel, a massive edifice
of stone, the northern wall of which ran close along the
shore, so that the soldier on patrol could hear the ripple
of the water on the rocks below. From either side of
the citadel the town walls ran south at a distance of
perhaps a hundred feet from the shore, meeting at a
point about the same distance from the southern channel.
Within the triangle thus formed, not over twenty-five
acres all told, lived and moved five thousand human
beings. The streets, it need scarce be said, were narrow,
dark, and damp. The houses were lofty, generally with
high pitch-roofs to prevent the snow from gathering on
them. The doors and windows were high, but narrow
to keep out the cold, and were built in the sides of the
house, not in front, owing to the darkness and narrowness
of the streets. To economize space, most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
houses were built in blocks of five or six, wholly separated
from their neighbors and forming a sort of castle
by themselves. The only church inside the walls was
the so-called Great Church on the summit of the hill.
Adjoining this church on the south was the old town-hall.
As to public squares, there were but two,&mdash;the
Grand Square, on the summit of the hill immediately
south of the town-hall; and the so-called Iron Market, a
smaller square just inside the southern gate. These
squares, the largest not more than eighty yards in
length, served at once as the market, the promenade,
and the place of execution for the town. The town-walls
were fortified at several points by towers, and were
entered by gateways at the northwest corner and at the
southern point, as well as by several small gateways
along the sides. The city was connected with the mainland
north and south by turreted bridges, the north
bridge passing across the island of Helgeandsholm.
All around the main island, some fifty feet from the
shore, ran a long bridge on piles, built as a safeguard
against hostile ships. Protected thus by nature and by
art from foreign intrusion, the burghers of Stockholm
learned to rely on their own industry and skill for every
need. They formed themselves into various trades or
guilds, each under the surveillance of a master. To be
admitted to a guild it was necessary to pass a severe
examination in the particular trade. These guilds were
marked by an intense <i>esprit de corps</i>, each striving to
excel the others in display of wealth. Some guilds were
composed wholly of tradespeople, others wholly of artisans;
and there were still others formed for social or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
religious purposes, comprising members of various trades.
Of these latter guilds the most aristocratic and influential
was the Guild of the Sacred Body. Inside a
guild the members were bound together by the warmest
bonds of friendship. They ordinarily lived in the same
quarter of the town; they cared for their brothers in
sickness or poverty, and said Mass in common for the
souls of their deceased. Each guild held meetings at
stated intervals to vote on various matters concerning
its affairs. In case of war the different guilds enlisted
in separate companies. Over and above all the guilds
were a burgomaster and council elected by their fellow-townsmen,
their duties being to regulate the relations of
the various guilds to one another, and provide for the
general welfare of the city. Thus the inhabitants of
Stockholm formed a miniature republic by themselves.
They governed themselves in nearly all local matters.
They bought, sold, and exchanged according to their
own laws and regulations. They married and gave in
marriage after their own caprice. Industrious, skilful,
with little ambition, they bustled about their narrow
streets, jostling those at their elbow and uttering slander
against those out of hearing. In short, they led the
humdrum life incident to all small towns in time of
peace, and were ever eager to vary this monotony at the
first sound of war.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Into this community Gustavus was ushered in the
year 1514. He was then but eighteen, and was summoned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
by the regent to the royal court to complete his
education.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He found himself at once in clover. Three
years before, his mother's half-sister, Christina Gyllenstjerna,
had married the young regent; and the youth
on coming to Stockholm was received as one of the
family in the royal palace.</p>

<p>Among all the personages then at court, the most
interesting, by all odds, was the regent's wife, Christina.
This woman is one of the most puzzling characters in
Swedish history. On her father's side of royal lineage,
and on her mother's descended from one of the oldest
families in Sweden, she inherited at the same time a
burning desire for personal advancement and an enthusiasm
for the glory of her native land. Wedded to a
handsome, daring, impetuous youth of twenty-one, the
nation's favorite, she entered with her whole heart into
all his projects, and was among his most valuable counsellors
whether in peace or war. In force of character
and in personal bravery she was scarce inferior to her
heroic husband, and yet she lacked not discretion or
even shrewdness. She was the idol of the Swedish
people, and before many years were passed was to have
an opportunity to test their love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Another personage at court, with whom we have already
become acquainted, was Hemming Gad. Although
of humble birth, this man had received a careful education,
and during twenty years of his early life had held
the post of Swedish ambassador at the court of Rome.
On his return to Sweden he had been elected bishop of
the diocese of Link&ouml;ping, but had never entered on his
duties owing to the opposition of the pope. He was
not indeed a priest. Diplomacy was above all else the
field in which he shone. A warm supporter of the
Stures, he had more than once averted trouble by his
powers of conciliation, and was regarded as an indispensable
servant of the people's cause. Fearless, eloquent,
untiring, conciliatory, persuasive, perhaps not too
conscientious, he was the most influential person in the
Cabinet and one of the very foremost statesmen of his
time. It was to this man, then seventy-four years of
age, that the care of the young Gustavus was intrusted
when he came to court.</p>

<p>Affairs at this time were in a state of great confusion.
King Hans of Denmark had died a year before,
and after several months of hostile demonstration had
been succeeded by his son. This person, known as
Christiern II., was as vile a monster as ever occupied
a throne. Gifted by nature with a powerful frame,
tall, burly, with large head and short thick neck, broad
forehead and high cheek-bones, prominent nose, firmly
compressed lips, a plentiful supply of shaggy hair on
his head and face, heavy overhanging eyebrows, his
eyes small, deep-set, and fierce,&mdash;his appearance furnished
an excellent index to his character. Firm, courageous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
by no means wanting in intellect or executive
ability, he was sensual, gross, and cruel. Though often
full of hilarity and hearty animal spirits, there was ever
hanging over him a cloud of melancholy, which occasionally
settled on him with such weight as to rob him
wholly of his reason. At such times he seemed transformed
into some fierce monster with an insatiable
thirst for blood. When a mere boy in the royal palace
at Copenhagen, he is said to have amused himself by
midnight orgies about the city's streets.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He was well
educated, however, and early became a useful adjunct to
his father. At twenty-one he displayed much bravery
in an assault which Hans then made on Stockholm;
and a few years later he became his father's deputy
in the government of Norway. While there, his secretary
one day came to him and portrayed in glowing
terms the beauty of a maiden who had dazzled him in
Bergen. The sensitive heart of Christiern at once was
fired. He left his castle at Opslo without a moment's
waiting, and, crossing hill and vale without a murmur,
hastened to feast his eyes on the fair Dyveke. Being
of a romantic turn of mind, he resolved to see her first
amidst all the fashion of the town. A splendid ball
was therefore held, to which the aristocracy were bidden
with their daughters. Among the guests was the
renowned Dyveke, who outshone all in beauty. No
sooner did Christiern see her, than his whole soul
burned within him. He seized her hand, and led off
the dance in company with his fair enchanter. Rapture
filled his soul; and when the ball was over, Dyveke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was secretly detained and brought to Christiern's bed.
This incident had a far-reaching influence on Christiern's
later life. Though already betrothed to the sister of
Charles V., his passion for Dyveke did not pass away.
He erected a palace at Opslo, and lived there with his
mistress until recalled to Copenhagen, when he took
her with him. The most singular feature in this whole
intrigue is that the royal voluptuary was from the
outset under the absolute sway, not of the fair Dyveke,
but of her mother, Sigbrit, a low, cunning, intriguing
woman of Dutch origin, who followed the couple to the
royal palace at Opslo, and afterwards accompanied them
to Stockholm, the complete ruler of her daughter's
royal slave. On the accession of Christiern to the
throne, he resolved, at the instance of this woman, to
add the Swedish kingdom to his dominions. In order
to comprehend the measures which he adopted, it will
be necessary to trace events in Sweden since the death
of Hans.</p>

<p>The Danish party, in no way daunted by their futile
effort to secure the regency of Sweden, had kept up
continuous negotiations with their friends in Denmark,
with the object ultimately to place the king of Denmark
on the throne. Owing, however, to the manifest
and growing popularity of the young Sture, they deemed
it wise to wait for a more auspicious moment before
making open demonstration, and for the time being
yielded to the regent with the best grace they could
command. The thing which they most needed, in order
to counteract the influence of the chivalric young Sture,
was the infusion of new life among their ranks. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
archbishop and Erik Trolle both were old, and, though
in the full vigor of their intellectual ability, lacked the
energy and endurance required to carry on a policy of
active war. It was resolved, therefore, to throw the
burden of leadership on younger shoulders. There was
at this time in Rome a man who seemed to possess
more qualifications than any other for the post. This
was Gustaf Trolle. He was young, highly educated,
energetic, and above all a son of Erik Trolle, the powerful
leader of the Danish faction. He had seen much
of the world, and had lived on terms of familiarity with
some of the greatest men in Europe. But his whole
power of usefulness was lost through his inordinate
personal and family pride. Weighted down by the sense
of his own importance, with haughty overbearing manners,
and a dogged obstinacy in dealing with his inferiors,
he was the last man in the world to be successful
as a party leader. Yet it was on this man that the
Danish party fixed its hopes. The matter first took
shape on the 31st of August, 1514, when the archbishop
in conversation with Sture suggested that old age was
now coming on so fast that he desired to resign his
office, and asked whom Sture deemed most fit to serve
as his successor. To this the courteous regent answered
that he knew no one better fitted for the post
than the archbishop himself. With this the conversation
ended. On the 12th of October following, the crafty
archbishop, not averse to feathering his own nest,
formed a compact with Erik Trolle by which Ulfsson
was to commend the latter's son for the archbishopric,
and in return Erik promised to support Ulfsson to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
utmost of his power and to see that Gustaf Trolle did
not deprive Ulfsson of the archiepiscopal rents during
the latter's life.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This done, Erik Trolle went
to the regent and asked him to recommend Gustaf
Trolle for the post of archdeacon of Upsala. This
request was complied with. But when, soon after,
Erik appeared again before the regent with a letter
from the archbishop informing him that the Chapter
of Upsala had decided on Gustaf Trolle as the new
archbishop, Sture was so startled that he wrote to
Upsala to say that he had never consented to such
a proposition, but nevertheless if God wished it he
would raise no opposition. The pope having already
declared that no one should be appointed without the
regent's consent, no effort was spared to dispose Sture
well towards the new candidate, and with so good
result that when the archbishop's messengers went to
Rome to secure the confirmation, they carried with them
a letter from Sture to his legate in Rome, instructing
him to do all he could before the pope in favor of
Gustaf Trolle.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1515, the young man was consecrated archbishop
of Upsala by the pope,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and started in the
following summer for the North. Passing through
Lubeck, where he is rumored to have had an audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of Christiern,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he pursued his journey by water, and at
last cast anchor off the Swedish coast about twelve
miles from Stockholm. Here he was met by certain of
the Danish party, who urged him to give the cold shoulder
to the regent. Instead, therefore, of proceeding
to the capital, he drove direct to Upsala, and was installed
in his new office: all this in spite of the fact
that the old archbishop had assured the regent, before
he wrote to Rome, that he would not hand over Upsala
nor St&auml;ket to Trolle till the latter had sworn allegiance
to Sture.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The immediate effect of his investiture was
to augment the haughtiness of the young archbishop.
Scarcely had he become domiciled in Upsala, when he
wrote a letter to the regent warning him that he, the
archbishop, was about to visit with punishment all who
had wronged his father or grandfather, or his predecessor
in the archiepiscopal chair. To this the regent,
wishing if possible to avert trouble, answered that
if any persons had done the wrong complained of, he
would see to it that they should be punished. But
the archbishop was in no mood for compromise. The
breach now opened, he resolved to make it wider; and
he had no difficulty in finding pretext. The fief of
St&auml;ket had long been a bone of contention between
the Church and State. Though for many years in the
hands of the archbishops, it had never been clearly
settled whether they held it as a right or merely by
courtesy of the crown; and at the resignation of Archbishop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Ulfsson the fief was claimed by his successor,
Trolle, as well as by the regent. In order to put an
end to this vexed question, the regent wrote to Ulfsson
asking him to produce the title-deeds on which his
claim was based. After considerable correspondence,
in which, however, the deeds were not produced, Sture,
deeming it unwise to leave the fief any longer without
a steward, entered into possession, and applied the incomes
to the royal treasury, at the same time assuring
Ulfsson that if he or the Chapter at Upsala could prove
a title to the fief, they should enjoy it. This only added
fuel to the flame. Trolle, unable as it seems to prove
his title, assumed the posture of one who had been
wronged, and scorned the urgent invitation of the regent
to come to Stockholm and discuss the matter.
Indeed, there were rumors in the air to the effect that
Trolle was engaged in a conspiracy against the throne.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In this way matters continued till February of the
following year, 1516, when Sture resolved to attend
the annual Upsala fair and have a conference with
Trolle. The conference took place in presence of some
of the leading men of Sweden, in the sacristy of the
cathedral. But it led to no result. Trolle charged the
regent with unfair dealing, which the latter denied, at
the same time demanding proof. None was furnished;
and the regent withdrew, feeling more than ever convinced
that the conduct of the archbishop boded ill.
In this juncture he summoned a Cabinet meeting, to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
held at Telge in July following, to arrange the differences
between himself and Trolle, and to resolve on
the stand to be taken by Sweden in the congress of
the three realms to be held at Halmstad in the February
following. The archbishop, by virtue of his
office, was a member of the Cabinet; but when that
body met, it was discovered that Trolle was not present.
He was in Upsala, nursing his wrath to keep it warm.
The regent therefore wrote and begged him to appear.
"Whatever," he wrote, "the Cabinet here assembled
shall decide as right between us, I will do." But the
proud archbishop would not listen. He and his father
kept away, together with one or two of their adherents;
and the Cabinet parted, having accomplished little.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the archbishop was not idle. Shortly before
the Cabinet met, he with some of his adherents
had held a conference at St&auml;ket, where he had persuaded
them to renounce the regent and form an alliance
with the king of Denmark. While the Cabinet
was in session, he despatched a messenger to King
Christiern, urging him to break the truce with Sweden,
and informing him that the Castle of Nyk&ouml;ping, now in
the hands of one of the archbishop's satellites, should be
thrown open to him if he would draw thither with his
army. At the same time the archbishop began to
fortify himself in St&auml;ket. Learning this, the regent
saw that the hour for compromise was past. He dissolved
the Cabinet, and, advancing with all speed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Nyk&ouml;ping, stormed the castle. So rapid had been his
action, that he took the archbishop's officers all unprepared,
and at the first assault the garrison surrendered.
This was on the 15th of August. After taking
the officer in command of the garrison to Stockholm,
where he was consigned to prison, the energetic
young regent proceeded to Vester&aring;s, where, on the 8th
of September, in an address to the populace, he rendered
an account of his actions, and informed the people
that the archbishop and others were engaged in a plot
to yield the kingdom into the hands of Christiern.
Thence he proceeded to an island some six miles from
St&auml;ket, and remained there through the autumn, keeping
an eye on the archbishop's castle and preparing, if
necessary, to besiege it. The Danish party by this time
saw that they were dealing with a man of mettle, and
began to change their tactics. Hoping to gain time,
they gave out that they would be glad to have the burgomaster
and Council of Stockholm act as mediators in
the dispute; and on the 20th of October Ulfsson wrote
to Sture to appoint a time for conference. The regent,
however, was not so easily deceived. Trolle was
still adding to his strength in St&auml;ket, and looking forward
to aid from Denmark. The regent therefore replied
to Ulfsson that Trolle had brought on the dispute,
and he must answer for it. "As to a conference with
you," adds the regent, "my time is now so fully occupied
that I can appoint no day before the Cabinet meeting
to be held shortly at Arboga." About the same
time he wrote to the Chapter at Upsala, insisting on an
answer to a former letter, in which he had called on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
them to declare whether they proposed to side with him
or the archbishop. In this letter he informs them:
"As to your question whether I intend to obey the ordinances
of the Church, I answer that I shall defend
the Holy Church and respect the persons of the clergy
as becomes a Christian nobleman, provided you will
allow me so to do; and I have never purposed otherwise."
Still, however, the Chapter prevaricated, and
gave no answer; till finally the regent sent them his
ultimatum, closed, like all his letters, with the modest
signature, "Sten Sture, soldier."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>On New Year's day, 1517, the Cabinet met at Arboga,
where a general diet of the kingdom was gathering to
discuss the state of affairs concerning Denmark. At
this meeting, as at the one preceding, none of the archbishop's
followers were present. So soon as the Cabinet
had separated, the regent, in compliance with their
suggestion, sent envoys once more to Trolle, urging him
to renounce his allegiance to the Danish king and to
surrender St&auml;ket. To this the stubborn archbishop
answered that he would not yield St&auml;ket so long as his
heart beat within him. He then turned his guns upon
the regent's envoys, and fired on them as they withdrew.
A few days later the regent learned from one
of Trolle's officers whom he had taken prisoner that the
archbishop had received a letter from King Christiern
promising all who gave their aid in establishing him on
the throne a double recompense for any loss incurred in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the attempt. No time was, therefore, to be lost. Collecting
a force with all haste from different parts of
Sweden, the regent advanced on St&auml;ket to besiege the
castle. Immediately on their arrival, Trolle sent out
word that he desired a parley. This was granted, and
the archbishop came outside the walls to a spot before
the Swedish camp. In the course of the discussion,
Trolle, perhaps with a view to intimidate the regent,
declared that he had within the castle a letter from
King Christiern announcing that he would come to the
relief before the 1st of May. But the young regent was
not so easily to be intimidated. His terms were that
Trolle and his men might withdraw unharmed from
St&auml;ket, and that the archbishop might continue in possession
of the Cathedral of Upsala and all the privileges
of his office; but that the Castle of St&auml;ket, long a prolific
source of discord, should remain in the hands of
Sture till a tribunal composed of clergy as well as laity
could determine whether it should belong to Church or
State, or be demolished as a source of discord. These
terms were not accepted, and the siege continued. All
through the winter and spring the Swedish army bivouacked
outside the walls; and Trolle, ever looking for aid
from Denmark, refused to yield. At last, at midsummer,
having received tidings that rescue was near at hand,
his heart grew bold within him, and he resolved to make
a dupe of Sture. The latter not being at the time at
St&auml;ket, the archbishop sent a messenger to say that he
was ready for a parley. The regent, daily fearing the
approach of Christiern, received the messenger with joy.
He called together the burgomaster and Council of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Stockholm, and instructed them to select delegates to
act in behalf of Stockholm. With these delegates and a
few advisers on his own account he proceeded to St&auml;ket,
and after consultation as to the terms which they should
offer, signalled the guard on the castle walls that he was
ready to treat with Trolle. After standing some time
in the midst of a pouring rain, and without any prospect
of an answer, the regent grew impatient, and sent word
to Trolle that he could offer no other terms than those
already offered. The charlatan then threw off the mask.
He replied that he placed implicit confidence in Christiern,
and was in no hurry for a parley. Any time
within six weeks would do. At this announcement the
regent had nothing for it but to withdraw. Drenched
to the skin, and burning at the insult offered him, he
returned to Stockholm.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>He did so none too soon. The Danish forces, four
thousand strong, were already off the Swedish coast.
This was by no means the first proof of actual hostilities
on the part of Christiern. Six months before, while the
truce between the kingdoms was still in force, Christiern
had seized a Swedish vessel while lying in the
roads outside Lubeck, and at the general diet held at
New Year's in Arboga, it had been voted to resist the
tyrant till the dying breath. As a result, the congress
of the three realms which was to have been held in February
had never met. A broadside was issued by the
regent to all the men of Sweden, calling on them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
prepare for war. Throughout the spring and summer
the advent of the tyrant was expected, and the announcement
that his army had at length arrived was a
surprise to none.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It was early in the month of August, 1517, when the
Danish fleet was sighted off the coast twelve miles from
Stockholm. Sture proceeded at once to the point at
which it was expected they would land, and thus prevented
them. The fleet hovered about the coast for
several days, sending out pillaging parties in small
boats to the shore. One of these parties was intercepted;
and from a prisoner who was taken, Sture
learned definitely that the object of the expedition was
to go to the relief of St&auml;ket. On this news Sture sent
some members of the Cabinet to St&auml;ket to inform the
archbishop that the Danish force was now off Stockholm,
and to urge him in behalf of the town of Stockholm
to send word to the Danish force that it could
count on no aid from him, as he was resolved to remain
true to his native land. But this final appeal to the
archbishop's honor met with no response. The fleet
meantime had approached the capital, and was riding at
anchor about two miles down the stream. There the
whole force landed, intending to march direct to St&auml;ket.
But the young regent was again ahead of them. Scarce
had they set foot on shore when he fell upon them with
his army. The conflict was sharp and bitter, but at last
the regent came off victorious. The Danes were driven
headlong to their ships, leaving many of their number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
dead upon the shore, while others fell captives into the
hand of Sture. This was a red-letter day in the calendar
of the regent, and is specially memorable as being
the first occasion on which the young Gustavus drew
sword in behalf of his native land.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Elated by his victory, the regent now opened communications
once more with Trolle. With a view to
frighten him into submission, he sent some of the Danish
captives to St&auml;ket, that the archbishop might hear from
his own allies the story of their disaster. Even at this
the proud spirit of the archbishop was not humbled.
He still persisted in his determination not to yield,
and it was only when his own officers began to leave
him that he signified his willingness to withdraw from
St&auml;ket and retire to the duties of his cathedral. But
now it was Sture's turn to dictate. He answered curtly
that a murderer could no longer be archbishop, and
proceeded at once to summon a general diet of the
kingdom. This diet met at Stockholm in the last days
of November. It was a notable gathering. Among
those present were four of the six bishops,&mdash;all except
the bishops of Vexi&ouml; and Skara,&mdash;of laymen, Hemming
Gad and the father of young Gustavus, besides some ten
other knights and armigers, the burgomaster and Council
of Stockholm, and a large number of delegates from
the peasantry. Before this assembly the archbishop
appeared, under safe-conduct from the regent, to plead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
his cause. Among the witnesses produced in favor of
the crown was a Danish officer captured in the battle
outside Stockholm. This man testified, among other
things, that before the Danish fleet set forth, a messenger
from Trolle had appeared before King Christiern
to solicit aid for St&auml;ket. Indeed, the charge of conspiracy
was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt. The
whole house rose with one accord in denunciation of the
traitor. Without a dissenting voice it was decreed that
St&auml;ket, "the rebel stronghold," should be levelled to the
ground; that Trolle should nevermore be recognized as
archbishop; that, though by the terms of his safe-conduct
he might return to St&auml;ket, he should not come
forth therefrom till he had given pledge to do no further
injury to the kingdom; and, finally, that if Trolle or
any other in his behalf should solicit excommunication
on any of those present for this resolve or for besieging
or destroying St&auml;ket, or should otherwise molest them,
they all should stand firm by one another. This resolve,
before the diet parted, was put into writing, and to it
every member attached his seal.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The archbishop, as had been promised him, was permitted
to return to St&auml;ket, which was again put into a
state of siege. The siege, however, was of short duration.
Deserted by the largest portion of his officers,
and with no immediate prospect of further aid from
Denmark, the archbishop had nothing for it but to
yield. St&auml;ket thus fell into the hands of Sture; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
archbishop was placed in the monastery of Vester&aring;s,
to remain there captive till further disposition should be
made of his archbishopric.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The whole country was by this time overrun with
rebels. Particularly along the southern frontier the
Danish party, in close alliance with the king of Denmark,
kept the inhabitants in a state of terror; and
their hostile demonstrations became at last so marked
that the regent found it necessary, in the autumn of
1517, to despatch his army thither to repress them.
This news was brought to Christiern's ears, still tingling
with the report of the disaster of his fleet. The monarch,
having no stomach for a winter campaign among
the snows of Sweden, bethought him of a truce until the
coming spring. There chanced to be in Denmark at the
time a smooth-mouthed scoundrel with the unsavory
name of Arcimboldo. He was by trade a dealer in
indulgences, having been commissioned by Leo X. to
vend his wares throughout the northern parts of Europe.
He had already spent some time in Lubeck, where he
had reaped a splendid harvest; and had now been
carrying on his business about two years in Denmark.
On every church he had affixed a chest with notice that
all who would contribute to the sacred cause should
receive full absolution from their sins. It certainly was
a tempting offer, and one which the unwary believers in
the papal authority were not slow to seize. They poured
in their contributions with a lavish hand, and the legate
soon amassed a princely fortune. At last, however, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
goods began to be a drug upon the market, and he prepared
to transfer his headquarters to another land.
It was about this time, early in the winter of 1518, that
Christiern made up his mind to suggest a truce with
Sweden, and the grand idea occurred to him of enlisting
the papal legate in his service. He summoned the
pardon-monger without delay, and suggested that he
should mediate with Sture. To this suggestion Arcimboldo,
by no means averse to turning an honest penny,
gave his assent. He sat down at once and wrote a letter
to the regent, instructing him that the pope desired to
see peace made between the kingdoms. He therefore,
as ambassador from his Holiness, suggested that Sture
should observe a truce by land with Denmark till the
23d of April next, and in the mean time should send
delegates to the town of Lund with full power to make
a lasting peace between the kingdoms. To this proposal
the legate added that Christiern had given his consent.
This document was handed to the regent about the
middle of February. He sent back a despatch at once,
thanking the legate for his efforts in behalf of peace,
and expressing a wish to accede in general to the proposition.
It would not be possible, however, to send
delegates to a congress on so short a notice. Before
doing so it would be necessary to hold a general diet, so
that the people of Sweden might vote upon the matter;
and as some of the members would have to come from
Finland, the diet could not be held unless the truce was
extended so as to embrace the sea. But he should be
pleased if Arcimboldo would effect a lasting treaty between
the kingdoms, or even a truce by sea and land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to continue for the life of Christiern. He, on his part,
would summon a general diet as soon as possible, with
a view to bring about a lasting peace. Thus the peace
negotiations came to naught. Christiern had no intention
of consenting to a lasting peace, and Sture was not
to be inveigled into a truce which had no other object
than to give the king of Denmark an opportunity to
recruit.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>And thus the winter wore away, and spring came, and
both parties were gathering up their forces to renew the
war. In the little town of Stockholm a spirit of patriotism
was growing fast. It was felt on every hand that
the coming summer would forever settle the question of
slavery or freedom, and all were fixed in purpose to
resist the tyrant till their dying breath. Children, from
fifteen upwards, were in arms, momentarily expecting
the arrival of the Danish fleet. But the agony was prolonged
day after day till the sturdy patriots were eager
to have it close. Excitement had been wrought up to a
fever heat, when, in the month of June, the news was
shouted through the narrow streets that the enemy's
vessels were at hand. The report was true. There in
the stream below the town were visible the white sails
of the Danish squadron,&mdash;eighty ships in all,&mdash;slowly
forging their way against the current towards the town.
It was a sight to make even the stout heart of a Stockholm
burgher quail. The fleet approached within a
short distance, and the troops were landed on the southern
shore, separated from the city only by a narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
channel. The Danish king himself was in command.
His forces consisted of five thousand Germans, besides
a thousand light-armed soldiers chiefly Danes, a hundred
horse, and a vast multitude of laborers for building dikes
and trenches. Proceeding to the west, he took up his
position, June 29, on the hill opposite the city on the
north. But he soon discovered that this point was too
far from the town. He therefore crossed over to the
southern shore, and pitched his camp on the cliffs of
S&ouml;dermalm. From this point he began to bombard the
tower at the southern corner of the town. After battering
this tower near a month, he sent a force across
the bridge with orders to burst through the wall at the
point which his guns had shaken. The effort, however,
was of no avail. His force was driven back and compelled
to seek safety beyond the bridge. At this juncture
news arrived that a detachment of the Swedish
army was coming against him on the south. Fearing a
simultaneous attack on both sides, he hastily advanced
in the direction of the expected onslaught, and threw up
a fortification at Br&auml;nnkyrka, about three miles south
of Stockholm. On his right the land was boggy and overgrown
with brushwood, while on his left it was somewhat
higher and wooded. In these woods the Swedish army
gathered. It is reported that they were twelve thousand
strong, but they consisted chiefly of ill-trained and ill-armed
peasants. The regent had joined them, and was
leading them in person. The royal banners of the first
battalion were in charge of Gustavus Vasa. After a
few days' skirmishing, in which the patriots were twice
driven into the covert of their woods, the Danes made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a final charge upon them, and put them once more to
flight. This time, however, the Danish soldiers lost
their heads, and followed in hot haste through the forest.
In this way they lost all advantage from their superior
arms and training. The Swedes, nearly twice as numerous
as their opponents, surrounded them, and closed in
upon them on every side. The forest was soon red
with blood. The patriots fought with vigor and determination;
and at length, though sixteen hundred of
their companions were stretched upon the ground, the
day was theirs. Sture collected his men as quickly as
possible and returned to Stockholm, while Christiern
took up his quarters again in S&ouml;dermalm. A few days
later Christiern, his powder and provisions failing him,
ordered a retreat; but before his men were all embarked
the Swedes were on them, and killed or captured some
two hundred on the shore. After proceeding down the
stream about twelve miles, the fleet cast anchor near
the northern shore, and a foraging party was sent out
towards Upsala for provisions. Some of these were
captured, but the majority returned with a rich booty
to their ships. Nearly two months had now elapsed
since the arrival of the Danish fleet, and the cold
weather was approaching. Christiern, worsted at every
point, was eager to return to Denmark. But the equinoctial
storm would soon be coming, and he was afraid
to venture out in rough weather on short rations. His
men too, suffering for food and clamoring for their pay,
began to leave him. He therefore resolved to play upon
another string. On the 28th of August he despatched
envoys to the regent with the preposterous proposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that he should be received as king, or that in lieu thereof
he should receive from the regent and Cabinet of Sweden
a yearly stipend, and that the losses which he and
the Danish party in Sweden had suffered should be
repaid them. This ridiculous offer was of course rejected.
Christiern then came down from his high horse,
and proposed a cessation of hostilities till the difficulty
could be settled. After some bickering on both sides it
was agreed that a congress of the three realms should
meet on the 10th of the following July, to determine
Christiern's right to the crown of Sweden or to tribute;
and until that day there should be peace between the
realms. This agreement was put into writing and
signed and sealed by Christiern and the regent a few
days before September 8. The regent then ordered
provisions sent out to the Danish soldiers to relieve
their want. And still the fleet continued to hang about
the coast, waiting, so it was given out, for fair weather.
In reality, the Danish monarch was dallying with the
hope of putting into effect a diabolical scheme which he
had concocted. There being now a truce between the
kingdoms, he ventured to despatch a messenger to Sture
with hostages, to beg the regent to come out to the
fleet and hold a conference. After consultation with his
Cabinet, the regent answered that he could not accede
to this request, and the hostages were returned. Christiern
then sent again to say that he would gladly meet
him at an appointed spot on land, provided six persons
named&mdash;among them Hemming Gad and the regent's
nephew, Gustavus&mdash;should first be placed on board the
Danish fleet as hostages. A day was set and the hostages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
set forth. All unconscious, the rope was already
tightening around their necks. On the 25th of September,
as had been agreed, the regent rode to the
appointed place of meeting. But the Danish king was
nowhere to be seen. Two whole days the regent waited,
and on the third discovered that he had been entrapped.
The fleet was on its way to Denmark, and the Swedish
hostages were prisoners on board. Before putting out
to sea, the monarch touched land once more to despatch
a couple of letters,&mdash;one to the burghers of Stockholm,
the other to all the inhabitants of Sweden. These letters
are dated October 2. Their purpose was to make his
treachery seem less brutal. He declared that the regent
had violated the terms of the truce by ill-treating the
Danish prisoners in his hands, and not surrendering
them as had been stipulated in the treaty. "On this
ground," said the tyrant, some four days after seizing the
hostages, "I declare the treaty off."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Repairing with his captives to Copenhagen, the tyrant
placed them in confinement in different parts of Denmark.
Gustavus was placed in Kal&ouml; Castle, under the
charge of the commandant, who was a distant relative
of the young man's mother. The commandant was
under bonds for the safe-keeping of his prisoner; but
being a man of tender feelings, he imposed little restraint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
upon Gustavus, merely exacting from him a
promise that he would make no effort to escape. His
life therefore was, to outward appearance, not devoid
of pleasure. The castle was situated on a promontory
in Jutland, at the northern end of Kal&ouml; Bay. Its wall
ran close along the cliffs, a hundred feet above the sea.
At either end of the castle was a gray stone tower,
and from the windows in the towers was a charming
prospect on every side. The promontory was connected
with the mainland by a low and narrow strip of land,
and along the main shore ran a dense forest belonging
to the castle and plentifully stocked with game. All
these pleasures were at the free disposal of the captive.
But there was a canker ever gnawing at his heart. No
matter which way he turned, he heard only rumors of
fresh preparations to conquer Sweden. When guests
visited the castle, they talked from morn till night of
the splendid armaments of Christiern. On one occasion
he heard them declare that so soon as Sweden fell, her
aristocracy were to be put to the sword and their wives
and daughters parted out among the peasantry of Denmark.
The Swedish peasants, they said, would soon
learn to drive the plough with one arm and a wooden leg.
Such jests made the young prisoner burn with indignation.
He felt it necessary to conceal his passion,
and yet he longed perpetually for a chance to burst his
fetters and fly to the rescue of his native land.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Before tracing his adventures further, let us return
once more to Sweden. The dastardly escape of Christiern
with the Swedish hostages had stung the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
country to the quick. Even the Chapter of Upsala,
which had up to this time clung to the hope of
restoring Trolle to his post, began to yield to the
oft-repeated exhortations of the regent, and prepared
to nominate a new archbishop. The man whom
Sture urged for the position was the bishop of Strengn&auml;s,
one of those who had voted in favor of demolishing
St&auml;ket; and so early as the preceding February
the chapter had practically assented to this choice.
Nothing further, however, was done about it; and when,
in the autumn of 1518, the papal legate with his proclamations
of pardon appeared in Sweden, the chapter
began to look toward him for help. Arcimboldo was
not the man to let slip an opportunity to aggrandize
himself. He therefore was prepared to listen impartially
to the arguments on every side, and as papal
legate to use his authority in favor of the highest bidder.
Now, it required little sagacity to see that Trolle,
whose cause the king of Denmark had commissioned
him to urge, but who was at this time stripped of his
prerogatives and in prison, could offer small reward;
and from the king of Denmark he had already received
quite as much as he had reason to expect. Moreover,
it appeared from the experience of the last two years
that Christiern's hopes of Sweden were likely to result
in air. Sture was to all appearances the rising star,
and on him the crafty legate resolved to fix his hopes.
There seemed no valid reason, however, for deserting
Christiern. It would be better so to trim his sails as
to receive any emoluments that might be forthcoming
from either party. He therefore approached the regent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
under the guise of mediator. The regent received him
kindly, and covered him with honors and rewards. In
the winter of 1518-1519 a meeting was held at Arboga
at which the case of Trolle was laid before the legate.
The outcome of it was that Trolle formally resigned
his archbishopric and was restored to freedom. Shortly
after, on the 5th of February, we find the legate reappointing
the old archbishop, Ulfsson, to the post. Just
why this course was taken it is impossible to state with
certainty. But the reasons which led to it may easily
be surmised. Ulfsson was a man of wealth, with few
enemies and many friends. He was, next to Trolle, the
choice of the Upsala Chapter and of Christiern, and he
had already some time before been asked by Sture to
reassume the post. To one of Arcimboldo's compromising
temper it is not strange that Ulfsson should
have seemed a person whose favor it was desirable to
win.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the king of Denmark was not idle. He
still clung to the strange infatuation that the people
of Sweden might be persuaded to accept him as their
king, and almost while in the act of seizing the Swedish
hostages instructed Arcimboldo to beg the regent for a
friendly conference. This wild proposal Sture treated
with the contempt which it deserved. He wrote to
Christiern a straightforward letter in which he refused
to deal further with him, and demanded that the hostages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
be immediately returned. Christiern of course did
not comply. On the contrary, he continued his warlike
preparations, and throughout the whole of the next year,
1519, his fleet was busy in making incursions along the
Swedish coast. These incursions, though they caused
the regent great annoyance, had little permanent effect.
The king was still smarting under his recent defeat,
and did not venture at once to undertake another campaign
on an extensive scale.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>One thing the year 1519 did for Sweden. It ridded
her of that consummate scoundrel Arcimboldo. After
he had fleeced the regent and his people of every penny
that they had to give, he set forth with his ill-gotten
gains for Denmark. He soon learned, however, that he
had been serving too many masters. Christiern had got
wind of his ambassador's familiarity with the regent,
and had sent out spies to seize him on his return.
But the Italian proved more slippery than his royal
master had supposed. Scarce had he set foot on shore
when he perceived that Denmark was not the place for
him. He embarked once more for Sweden, whence he
soon crossed over to Germany on his way to more congenial
climes. The last thing we hear of him is that
the pope rewarded him with the Archbishopric of
Milan.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="cap">ONE morning, in the early autumn of 1519, a young
man, clad in the coarse garments of a drover,
made a hasty exit from the gate of Kal&ouml; Castle, and
turning into the forest proceeded along the western
shore of Kal&ouml; Bay. His step was firm and vigorous,
and indicated by its rapidity that the wayfarer was endeavoring
to elude pursuit. Though apparently not
over twenty-four, there was something about the traveller's
face and bearing that gave him the look of a
person prematurely old. Of large frame, tall and broad-shouldered,
with heavy massive face, high cheek-bones,
a careworn dark blue eye, large straight nose, and compressed
lips,&mdash;the under lip projecting slightly,&mdash;he
would have been pointed out anywhere as a man not
easily to be led. The face would not, perhaps, be regarded
as particularly intellectual; but determination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and energy were stamped on every feature, and every
movement of the body displayed strength and power
of endurance. It was pre-eminently the face and body
of one made to govern rather than to obey. Such, in
his twenty-fourth year, was Gustavus Vasa. He had
made his escape from Kal&ouml; Castle, and was fleeing
with all speed to Lubeck, the busy, enterprising head of
the Hanseatic League.</p>

<p>His way led him through some of the most picturesque
spots in Denmark. It was a lovely rolling country,
with fertile fields and meadows, relieved in places
by little clumps of forest, beneath which he could often
discern the time-worn front of some grim old mansion.
Sheep and cattle were grazing on the hillsides. Thatch-roofed
huts, with plastered walls, were all about him.
The fields, in those September days, were red with
buckwheat. Occasionally a broad meadow spread out
before him, and, to avoid the husbandmen gathering in
their crops, he was often forced to make a long circuit
through thick forests of beech and maple. Here and
there he came on mighty barrows raised over the bodies
of Danish warriors and kings. Well might it make his
blood boil within him to witness these honors heaped
upon the Danes for their deeds of blood and cruelty to
his fathers. Through such scenes, weary and footsore,
in constant dread of his pursuers, and with dark misgivings
as to the fate before him, he pressed on, until
at last, near the end of September, the gray walls of
Lubeck, to which he had looked forward as a refuge,
stood before him and he entered in.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>Lubeck, the capital of the Hanse Towns, and by
virtue of this position monarch of the northern seas,
had been for three centuries a bitter foe to Denmark.
At intervals the Danish kings had sought to check the
naval supremacy of Lubeck, and more than once the
two powers had been at open war. Of late, by reason
of dissensions among the Towns, Denmark had gradually
been gaining the upper hand. But Lubeck was
still very far from acknowledging the right of Denmark
to carry on an independent trade, and the growing
power of the Danish kings only added fuel to the
flame. Lubeck was, therefore, at this time a peculiarly
favorable asylum for one who was at enmity with Christiern.
Gustavus doubtless had reckoned on this advantage,
and had resolved to throw himself on the
mercy of the town. He went directly to the senate,
laid his case before them, and asked them boldly for
a ship and escort to take him back to Sweden. This
request apparently was more than they were prepared
to grant. They hesitated, and in the mean time the
commandant of Kal&ouml; Castle tracked his prisoner to
Lubeck, and appeared before the senate to demand that
he be surrendered. Many of the senators, unwilling to
incur the wrath of Christiern, were minded to give him
up. Others, however, were opposed to such a course.
As a result, all action in the matter was for the time
suspended. Eight weary months dragged on, Gustavus
throughout that period remaining in Lubeck. Finally,
in May, 1520, one of the burgomasters, whose friendship
the youth had won, espoused his cause, and he was allowed
to sail for Sweden. By good fortune he steered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
clear of the Danish fleet, and on the 31st of May set
foot again on his native soil, near Kalmar.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the Danish arms had not been idle. Soon
after the overthrow of Trolle and the destruction of his
castle, the king of Denmark had despatched a messenger
to Rome, to enlist the Holy Father in his cause.
Pope Leo, reluctant to take upon himself to decide a
matter of whose merits he could know so little, appointed
the archbishop of Lund, aided by a Danish
bishop, to investigate the question and report to him.
A tribunal so composed could scarcely be expected
to render other verdict than that which Christiern
wished. They reported adversely to the regent. Sture
and his adherents were therefore excommunicated by
the pope, and all church ministrations interdicted
throughout Sweden. To a pious people such a blow
was terrible in the extreme. All church bells were
for the moment hushed, the church doors barred,
and the souls of an entire nation doomed to eternal
death. But even in the face of this calamity the regent
persevered. He refused to restore Trolle to his
post, or even to make him amends for his losses. On
this news being brought to Rome, the pontiff made no
attempt to hide his wrath. He wrote at once to Christiern,
with instructions to enter Sweden and inflict punishment
on those who had thus set at naught the papal
power. Christiern was entranced. As champion of
the pope he felt certain of success. Without delay he
collected all the forces in the kingdom, horse and foot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and placed them under the command of a gallant young
officer, Otto Krumpen, with orders to invade Sweden
from the south. They landed in the early days of January,
1520, and proceeded northwards, ravaging the
country as they went. Sture at once issued a broadside
to the people, calling them to arms. He likewise sent
his messengers to Trolle, to beg him to use his influence
against the enemies of Sweden. The deposed archbishop,
now cringing before his victor, yielded his assent.
Sture, thus emboldened, moved forward with his army
to meet the Danes. Knowing that they were advancing
through the province of Vesterg&ouml;tland, and that their
line of march in the winter season would be across the
lakes, Sture took up his position in a narrow cove at
the northern end of Lake &Aring;sunden. In the centre of
this cove, through which the Danes must pass, he raised
a huge bulwark of felled trees, and within the bulwark
stationed his infantry, with provisions enough to last
two months. He then chopped up the ice about the
fort, and retired to the north with his cavalry to await
the onset. It was not long he had to wait. On the
18th of January the Danish army drew near, and seeing
the fortification began to storm it with their catapults.
As they approached, the Swedish cavalry, with
Sture at their head, dashed out along the shore to meet
them. The regent was mounted on a fiery charger, and
carried into the very thickest of the fight. But scarcely
had the first shot been fired when a missile glancing
along the ice struck Sture's horse from under him, and
in a moment horse and rider were sprawling on the ice.
So soon as Sture could be extricated, he was found to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
have received an ugly wound upon the thigh. His followers
bore him bleeding from the field, and hastened
with his lacerated body to the north. But the battle
was not yet over. Long and hot it raged about the
fortress on the ice. Twice the Danish troops made a
mad assault, and after heavy losses were repulsed. At
last, however, their heavy catapults began to tell. The
sides of the bulwark weakened, and the Danish army
by a vigorous onslaught burst open a passage, and put
the Swedish infantry to the sword. This victory was
followed by a night of riot, the Swedes thus gaining
time to collect the scattered remnants of their army.
With a single impulse, though without a leader, they
fled across the marshy meadows of Vesterg&ouml;tland to the
north. Their goal was Tiveden, a dreary jungle of
stunted pines and underbrush, through which it was
expected the enemy would have to pass. Here after two
days' march they gathered, and threw up a mighty barrier
of felled trees and brushwood, thinking in that way
to impede the passage of the Danes. All about them
the land, though not mountainous, was rough and rugged
in the extreme, huge bowlders and fragments of
rock lying about on every side. In spots the undergrowth
was wanting, but its place was generally filled
by little lakes and bogs, quite as difficult to traverse as
the forest. In this region the patriots collected, and
with undaunted spirit once more awaited the coming of
the Danes. Again they were not disappointed. The
Danish army, recovering from its night of revelry,
proceeded on the track of the fugitives, stormed their
barrier, and on the 1st of February put them once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
more to flight. This done, the invaders pressed forward,
burning, robbing, murdering, and affixing bans to
every church door, till they arrived at Vester&aring;s.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Let us turn for a moment to another scene. Sture,
who had been carried bleeding from the field of battle,
had been taken first to &Ouml;rebro. But the journey over
the ice and snow at the dead of winter so aggravated
his wound that it was clear to all he could take no
further part in carrying on the war. He gave orders
therefore to be removed to Stockholm, where he might
be under the tender care and sympathy of his wife. It
was God's will, however, that he should never see her
more. On the 2d of February, when almost within sight
of the castle walls, he died; and the loved one for whose
sympathy he had longed was given nothing but her husband's
lifeless corpse.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> They buried of him all that
earth could bury; but his undaunted spirit remained still
among his people, cheering them in their misfortunes,
and ever calling upon them to resist the hand of the
oppressor. Sten Sture's character is one which draws
forth a warmth of sentiment such as can be felt for no
other character of his time. Living in an age when
hypocrisy was looked upon with honor, and when falsehood
was deemed a vice only when unsuccessful, he
showed in all his dealings, whether with friends or foes,
a steadfast integrity of purpose with an utter ignorance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of the art of dissimulation. Not a stain can history fix
upon his memory. Highly gifted as a statesman, courageous
on the field of battle, ever courteous in diplomacy,
and warm and sympathetic in the bosom of his family,
his figure stands forth as one of the shining examples of
the height to which human character can attain. It is
with a sigh we leave him, and turn again to trace the
history of his people.</p>

<p>Grim ruin now stared the patriot army in the face.
Bereft of the only person who seemed competent to
guide them, beaten at every point, without arms or
provisions, and with a horde of trained and well-armed
soldiers at their heels, the fleeing patriots came
straggling into Strengn&auml;s on the M&auml;lar. Hubbub and
confusion reigned supreme. Many of the magnates
counselled immediate surrender. Others, somewhat
more loyal to their country, raised a timid voice in
favor of continuing the war, but no one ventured to
come forth and lead his fellow-countrymen against the
foe. Thus they frittered away the precious moments
while the Danes were getting ready for another onset.
All this time there was one brave heart still beating for
them in the capital. The regent's widow, nothing
daunted by her own calamity or by the disasters that
had come upon her husband's people, kept sending messengers
one after another to implore them to unite in
defence of their native land. At length it seemed as if
her supplications were destined to prevail. A firmer
purpose spread among them, and they girded up their
loins for another conflict. Their spark of courage,
however, proved abortive. No sooner did the enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
again appear than the patriots turned their backs and
fled in wild dismay. On coming once more together
after this bloodless battle, they resolved without further
ado to lay down arms. A letter was despatched to
Krumpen requesting parley. This was granted; and on
the 22d of February it was agreed that the two parties
should hold a conference in Upsala on the 3d of March,
for the purpose of making terms. The Swedish party
then urged Christina to attend the conference. She
however turned a deaf ear to their entreaties, and sent
off a despatch at once to Dantzic begging for aid against
King Christiern; so the conference began without her.
As a preliminary, Krumpen produced a document from
the king of Denmark empowering him to offer terms
of peace. This done, a proposition to declare allegiance
to King Christiern was at once brought forward; and at
the instance of Gustaf Trolle and the other Danish-minded
magnates present, the proposal was finally accepted,
though not until Krumpen had consented to
certain terms on which the patriots insisted. These
terms were that all past offences against the Danish
crown should be forgiven, that all fiefs hitherto granted
to their fellow-countrymen should be preserved, and
that Sweden should continue to be governed in accordance
with her ancient laws and customs. The document
reciting these terms was issued on the 6th of March, and
on the 31st it was confirmed by Christiern.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>The main body of the Swedish nation being thus again
in the hand of Denmark, it was expected that Christina
would no longer dare to offer resistance. It was therefore
resolved to approach her once more upon the subject.
An armed body of some three thousand men was
despatched forthwith to Stockholm, a couple of ambassadors
being sent ahead to invite Christina to a conference
outside the town. The reception which they
met was such as to convince them that the regent's
widow possessed, at any rate, a portion of her husband's
courage. No sooner did they near the capital than the
portcullis was raised and a volley fired upon them from
within the walls. Thus discomfited, the ambassadors
withdrew, and Krumpen, having insufficient forces to
undertake a siege, returned to Upsala, and the Swedish
forces that had joined him retired to their homes.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Christina was thus afforded a short respite in which
to gather strength. The bravery and determination
which she had displayed, even from the moment of her
husband's death, already began to inspire confidence
among the people. Most of the great men in the realm,
intimidated by the threats or allured by the promises of
Krumpen, had sworn allegiance to the king of Denmark.
But the chief castles were still held by the patriots, and
throughout the land there was a strong undercurrent of
feeling against the Danes. In most parts the people
were only waiting to see which way the wind was going
to blow, and for the time being it seemed likely to blow
in favor of the Swedes. The regent's widow used every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
effort to rouse the people from their lethargy, and with
increased success. All winter long the king of Denmark
was burning to send reinforcements, and dickering
with the Powers of Europe to obtain the necessary funds.
But his credit was bad, and it was only with great difficulty
that he at last despatched a body of some fifteen
hundred men. Christina, on the other hand, was being
reinforced by the Hanse Towns along the Baltic, and in
the early spring the current of sentiment had set so
strongly in her favor that a plot was formed to drive off
the Danish troops beleaguering the Castle of Vester&aring;s, on
the M&auml;lar. So soon as this plot reached the ears of the
Danish leader, he resolved to break the siege and hurry
off to join the forces of Krumpen at Upsala. He did
so; but he did so none too soon. He found his path
beset by the peasantry lying in ambush in the woods,
and before he succeeded in pushing through them, he
was led into a bloody battle from which the patriots
came off victorious, though their leader fell.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Emboldened by this success, Christina now sent a
messenger among the peasantry to collect a force with
which to attack the Danish army in Upsala. In a short
space of time he had gathered a strong band of peasantry
and miners, with whom, reinforced by a detachment
from Stockholm, he marched forward to Upsala.
As the patriots approached the town, a squad stationed
by Krumpen outside the walls descried them and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sounded the alarm. This was on Good Friday, April
6, 1520, and Krumpen was in the cathedral when the
news arrived. Without delay he hurried forth and gave
orders that every man, both horse and foot, should gird
on his armor and assemble in the square. As soon as
they had come together, he led them outside the town
and drew up his line of battle close beneath the walls.
In front of this line he formed a solid phalanx, with a
wing on either side composed of horse and foot. Still
farther ahead he placed his catapults, with the largest of
which he opened fire first, the sharpshooters at the same
time picking off the enemy. The sky was heavily overcast,
and at the very beginning of the battle a driving
storm with rain and sleet came beating down in the
faces of the Danes, thus blinding them. Their cavalry,
too, was almost useless; for the ground was covered with
melting snow, which formed in great cakes under the
horses' hoofs, and soon sent horses and riders sprawling
on the ground. The patriots, however, being without
cavalry or muskets, suffered little from the rain. They
were not slow to take advantage of the opportunity
thus afforded them, and pressed forward madly on the
left wing until finally it began to yield. The standard-bearer,
half frozen, was about to drop the standard,
when a Danish veteran rushed forward, seized it from
his hands, and fixed it in the nearest fence, at the
same time shouting: "Forward, my men! Remember
your own and your fathers' valor! Shall this standard
of your country fall unstained into the hands of the
enemy?" At these words the company rallied and,
hacking at the hands of the patriots who strove to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
pluck the standard from the fence, compelled them to
withdraw. This company then joined the others, and
a long and bitter conflict followed, the two armies
fighting face to face. At length, as soon as the snow
began to be well packed, the Danish cavalry came to
the front once more, and after a series of violent
charges, broke in two places through the enemy's ranks.
The patriots, now cut into three distinct bodies, fled
in wild despair. One body of them was surrounded
and massacred on the spot. Another fled to a brick-kiln
near at hand, hoping thus to be sheltered from the
fury of the Danes. But they were pursued, the whole
place was set on fire, and all who issued from it were put
to the sword. The third portion of the Swedes fled in
terror to the river, but many of them weighted down
by their arms were drowned. Thus ended a fearful
battle. The snow was literally drenched with blood.
Of the Swedes, who numbered 30,000, it is said two
thirds were killed; while the Danes, 8,000 strong, lost
half.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>After this fearful slaughter both parties were for the
nonce more cautious. Messengers were sent by each
throughout the land to gain recruits, but they were
careful to avoid a general conflict. Skirmishes and
trickery were the order of the day. The patriots were
frittering away their chances for lack of a leader, and
Krumpen was waiting for the arrival of King Christiern.
This was delayed only till the breaking of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
ice. Towards the close of April, 1520, Christiern set
sail with a large fleet for Sweden, having on board the
Archbishop of Lund and some other influential prelates,
to lend to his expedition the aspect of a religious
crusade. Proceeding first to Kalmar, he called upon
the castle to surrender, but in vain. Seeing that his only
mode of reducing the castle was by siege, he resolved for
the present to give it up, and after issuing a broadside
to the people of Vesterg&ouml;tland, summoning them to a
conference to be held a month later, on the 3d of June,
he advanced to Stockholm and dropped anchor just outside
the town. This was on the 27th of May, four days
before the landing of Gustavus Vasa on the Swedish
coast.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Gustavus Vasa marks an epoch in the
history of Sweden. It is the starting-point of one of
the most brilliant and successful revolutions that the
world has ever known. Other political upheavals have
worked quite as great results, and in less time. But rarely
if ever has a radical change in a nation's development
been so unmistakably the work of a single hand,&mdash;and
that, too, the hand of a mere youth of four-and-twenty.
The events immediately preceding the return of Gustavus
prove conclusively, if they prove anything, how impotent
are mere numbers without a leader. For years the
whole country had been almost continuously immersed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in blood. One moment the peasantry were all in arms,
burning to avenge their wrongs, and the next moment,
just on the eve of victory, they scattered, each satisfied
with promises that his wrongs would be redressed and
willing to let other persons redress their own. What was
needed above all else was a feeling of national unity and
strength; and it was this feeling that from the very
outset the young Gustavus sought to instil in the minds
of the Swedish people. As we now follow him in his
romantic wanderings through dreary forest and over
ice and snow and even down into the bowels of the
earth, we shall observe that the one idea which more
than any other filled his mind was the idea of a united
Swedish nation. At first we shall find this idea laughed
at as visionary, and its promoter driven to the far corners
of the land. But before three years are over, we
shall see a Swedish nation already rising from the dust,
until at last it takes a high place in the firmament of
European powers.</p>

<p>The memorable soil on which Gustavus disembarked
lay two miles south of Kalmar; and he hurried to the
town without delay. Kalmar was at this time, next to
Stockholm, the strongest town in Sweden. Lying on two
or three small islands, it was guarded from the mainland
by several narrow streams, while on the east it was
made secure through a stupendous castle from attack by
sea. This castle was at the time in charge of the widow
of the last commandant, and was strongly garrisoned,
as was also the town below, with mercenaries from
abroad. On entering the town Gustavus was received
with kindness by the burghers, and sought in every way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to rouse their drooping spirits. He even approached the
German soldiers with a view to inspire comfort in their
souls. But his words of courage fell on stony ground.
It is the nature of mercenaries to fight like madmen
when the prospect of reward is bright, but no sooner
does a cloud gather on the horizon, than they throw
down their arms and begin to clamor for their pay.
Such at that moment was the state of things in Kalmar.
Christiern, backed by the leading powers of Europe, and
upheld in his expedition by the authority of Rome, had
just arrived in Sweden with a powerful army, and was
now lying at anchor in the harbor of the capital. The
Swedish forces, broken in many places and without a
leader, were gradually scattering to their homes. The
cloud that had long been gathering over the head of
Sweden seemed about to burst. The future was already
black, and a listening ear could easily catch the mutterings
of the approaching storm. The Kalmar mercenaries
therefore were only irritated by the importunities of
the youthful refugee, and it was only through the intercession
of the burghers that he was saved from violence
and allowed to leave the town.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>To revisit the scenes of his boyhood and his father's
house was no longer possible. The brave Sten Sture,
from whose palace he had been stolen two years since,
was lying beneath the sod; and Stockholm, held by the
young man's aunt Christina, was in a state of siege.
All access to her or to the capital would have been at
the peril of his life. He therefore; renounced for the
time being his desire to see his family, and proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
stealthily to approach the capital by land. His way lay
first across the dreary moors and swamps of Sm&aring;land.
Here he went from house to house, inciting the peasantry
to rebel. Among others he sought out some of
his father's tenants, in the hope that they at least would
hear him. But he found them all sunk in lethargy,
cowering under the sword of Christiern. His voice was
truly the voice of one crying in the wilderness. The
golden hope of lifting his country out of her misery
seemed shattered at a blow. Instead of being received
with open arms as a deliverer, he was jeered at in every
town, and finally so bitter grew the public sentiment
against him that he was forced to flee. Hardly daring
to show his face lest he should be shot down by the
soldiers of the king, he betook himself to a farm owned
by his father on the south shore of the M&auml;lar. Here he
remained in secrecy through the summer, hoping for
better times,&mdash;an unwilling witness of the subjugation
of his land,&mdash;till finally he was driven from his refuge
by an act of Christiern so revolting in its villany that it
made the whole of Europe shudder.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Christiern, on the 27th of May, was riding at anchor
in the harbor of the capital. Among his men was Hemming
Gad, over the spirit of whose dream had come a
vast change since his capture some eighteen months
before. Just when this change began, or how it was
effected, is unknown. But already, in March of 1520, the
report had spread through Sweden that Gad had turned
traitor to his native land, and we find him writing to
the people of Stockholm to tell them that he and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
had done Christiern wrong, and begging them to reconcile
themselves to Christiern as he had done. Gad
was a statesman,&mdash;a word synonymous in those days
with charlatan,&mdash;and he did not hesitate to leave his
falling comrades in order to join the opposite party on
the road to power. Doubtless Christiern took care that
he lost nothing by his change of colors, and doubtless it
was with a view to aid himself that he brought Gad
back to Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>No sooner did Christiern arrive off Stockholm than
Krumpen came with Archbishop Trolle from Upsala, to
receive him. They held a council of war on board the
fleet, and resolved to lay siege once more to Stockholm.
The capital was by this time well supplied with food;
but the summer had only just begun, and Christiern
thought by using strict precautions to starve the town
ere winter. Pitching his camp along the shore both
north and south, and blockading the harbor on the east,
he sent messengers through the land to enlist the peasantry
in his cause. Many of them he propitiated by a
generous distribution of salt which he had brought with
him from Denmark. Things, however, were not entirely
to his taste. Christina too had ambassadors inciting
the people to revolt. On the 27th of June a large body
of the patriots laid siege to the palace of the bishop of
Link&ouml;ping. About the same time also the monastery
of Mariefred, inhabited by the old archbishop Ulfsson,
was threatened; and a throng of peasants marched to
Strengn&auml;s to burn and plunder. How crude the patriot
forces at this time were is apparent from a letter from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
a Danish officer to Krumpen, in which it is said that out
of a body of about three thousand only one hundred and
fifty were skilled soldiers. Christiern finally deemed it
best to send a force to Vester&aring;s to storm the castle.
This was done, the castle fell, and the officer in command
was taken prisoner. It was now August, and the
Stockholmers, no aid thus far having come to them from
abroad, were losing heart. In this state of things the
king sent Gad and others inside the walls to urge the
people to surrender. Christina and her sturdy burghers
received the messengers with scorn; but the magnates,
already more than half inclined to yield, vehemently
advocated the proposal. Soon the whole town was in an
uproar. A riot followed, and some blood was shed.
But at last Christina and her adherents yielded, and
delegates were sent outside the town to parley. After
several days of bickering it was agreed that Stockholm
should be surrendered on the 7th of September next,
but on the other hand that all hostility to Christiern
and to his fathers, as well as to Archbishop Trolle and
the other prelates, should be forgiven.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Two days later, on the 7th of September, the burgomasters
crossed over in a body to S&ouml;dermalm, and
delivered the keys of the city gates into the hands of
Christiern. Then, with bugles sounding and all the
pomp and ceremony of a triumph, he marched at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
head of his army through the city walls and up to the
Great Church, where he offered thanksgiving to Almighty
God. That over, he proceeded to the citadel and took
possession. The same day and the day following he obtained
two documents,&mdash;one from the Cabinet members
then in Stockholm, and the other from the burgomaster
and Council,&mdash;granting the castle to Christiern during
his life, and at his death to his son Hans, or, if he should
die before the king, then to the king's wife Elizabeth,
to revert, after the death of all three, to the Cabinet
of Sweden. Christiern then appointed his officers
throughout the country, after which he sailed away
for Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Not long, however, was Sweden freed from his contaminating
presence. Within a month he had returned,
breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
nation that he had vanquished. A general diet had
been summoned to meet at Stockholm on the first day of
November. As this diet was to be immediately followed
by the coronation of the king, special efforts had been
made to secure a large attendance of the Danish party.
The venerable Ulfsson, now tottering to the grave, had
recently written to Christiern that he would be present
at the triumphal entry into Stockholm, "even if," as he
says, "I have to crawl upon my knees;" and he was
present at the diet. When the appointed day arrived,
the delegates were summoned to a hill outside the
town, and were shut in on every side by the pikes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
rapiers of the royal soldiers. The proceedings were
cut and dried throughout. A pompous oration was delivered
by one of the king's satellites, declaring the
grounds on which his master claimed the throne of
Sweden, at the close of which the people were asked
whether they would have him for their king, and with
their tyrants' weapons brandished before their eyes they
answered yes. With this elaborate farce the ceremony
ended and the people scattered, being first ordered to
return on the following Sunday and share in the coronation
festivities of the king whom they had thus elected
against their will. The ostentatious mummery of these
mock ceremonies would cause a smile but for the frightful
tragedy with which they were to close. None but the
blindest partisans could have felt anything else than
aversion for this monster on whose head they were to
place the crown. Even his own friends hated him, and
despised the very ground on which he trod. But it was
the age of heaven-born rulers; so the masses bent their
knee and sang their p&aelig;ans to the demon whom fate had
made their king.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>It was on the 4th of November&mdash;a dreary Sunday&mdash;that
the tragedy began. On that day, with a great flourish
of trumpets and display of power, the monarch
proceeded to the Great Church to be crowned. The
huge edifice was filled to overflowing. From north and
south, from mountain and valley, all of note in the three
kingdoms had flocked thither on this day to behold the
imposing spectacle. Gustaf Trolle, now once more archbishop,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
stood at the high altar, lined on either side by
the six Swedish bishops and the Upsala Chapter. The
whole chancel was one blaze of gold and silver; and as
the king marched through the main aisle with his splendid
retinue, every eye was bent upon him and every
whisper hushed. Proceeding straight up to the high
altar, he bent his knee before the God whose name he
was now so soon to desecrate. Then the archbishop
raised from the altar a crown of gold glittering with
precious jewels, and placed it reverently upon the monarch's
brow. The sacred rite of consecration over, the
monarch rose and turning was met by a herald of
Charles V., who came from his master bringing a fleece
which he attached with chains of gold around the monarch's
neck, thus receiving him into the great Burgundian
League. After this, a throne was placed before the
altar, and Christiern conferred the order of knighthood
on Krumpen and some of his other officers. It was observed,
however, that all thus honored were of Danish
birth. With this the ceremony of consecration closed,
and the whole concourse poured forth once more from
the house of God.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>During three days the whole town now was given over
to mirth and merrymaking. These days seem like the
lull that goes before a storm. All strife was ended,
all past injuries forgotten. The future seemed full of
promise, and the Swedish peasants went hurrying back
to their firesides to tell their wives and children of the
peace and blessings promised them by Christiern. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
it was not yet. Scarce had the echo of warfare died
upon the wind when a frightful tragedy took place in
Stockholm which sent a thrill of horror to the heart of
Europe. At noon on the Wednesday following the coronation
all the Swedish magnates with the authorities of
Stockholm were summoned to the citadel and ushered
into the august presence of their king. As they ranged
themselves about the great hall, the nobles and their
wives, all wondering what this dismal summons meant,
they heard the castle gates grate upon their hinges, and
a cold shudder gradually spread among them, as the
thought now flashed upon them for the first time that
they were no longer free. They had been decoyed by the
fulsome promises of their ruler into the trap which he
had laid. The noose was already tightening around
their necks. Before them, on the throne hallowed by
memories of former rulers, sat their tyrant, grim and
lowering. Not a trace of mercy was visible in his features.
Through a long pause, awful in its uncertainty,
they waited, the cold sweat fast gathering on their
brows. At length the pause was ended. Archbishop
Trolle, chuckling at the near prospect of his revenge,
stepped forward and addressed the throne. He began
by portraying in ardent language the sufferings he had
undergone. He declared that the cathedral at Upsala
had been plundered while he was being besieged in
St&auml;ket. He dwelt at great length on the wrong which
had been done him in the destruction of his castle. He
drew attention to the conspiracy entered into against
him by certain of the magnates, and their united oath
never again to recognize him as archbishop. Finally, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
denounced the conspirators by name, and called upon
the king to visit them with the punishment which they
deserved. At this Christina was summoned before the
throne and asked for an explanation of her husband's
conduct. She was at first struck dumb with terror;
then, recovering herself, she pleaded that her husband
had been no more guilty than the other conspirators, as
would appear from the document which they all had
signed. Christiern, learning for the first time of this
document, demanded that it be produced. When this
was done, and the king had examined it to his heart's
content, he gave it to his clerk to copy, and called on
each of the signers in turn to answer for his act. Christiern
with his Cabinet then withdrew, leaving the patriot
leaders in the great hall guarded by a body of Danish
soldiers. At dusk two Danish officers entered with
lanterns, "like Judas Iscariot" says a contemporary,
and the doomed magnates were led out to the tower and
thrown into prison to await the morn. When day broke,
Christiern ordered the trumpets sounded and proclamation
made that no citizen should leave his house. About
noon the condemned patriots were led from their dungeons
to the Grand Square, and huddled together beneath
the platform on which they were to bleed. The
citizens had by this time been permitted to leave their
houses and had gathered around the foot of the scaffold,
from which they were addressed in soothing language
by several of the Danish Cabinet, whose words however
were interrupted by constant cries of the victims calling
on their fellow-countrymen to avenge them. At last the
agony of suspense was over. One after another the condemned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
mounted the scaffold and were decapitated with
all the refinement of cruelty that the bloodthirsty monarch
and his satellites could devise. Over seventy in all
were slaughtered, and their gory bodies piled up in one
promiscuous mass in the centre of the square. On the
following day the scene of carnage was renewed, several
suspected citizens being seized in their houses and
dragged to the place of blood. One poor wretch was
executed for no other reason than because he was discovered
weeping at the sight of his friends' death. Not
till the following Saturday was the carnage over and the
weltering mass conveyed outside the town. The body
of Sture, together with the body of one of his babes,
was dug up by Christiern's orders and burned, and the
property of all who were slaughtered was seized and
confiscated. Having thus effected his diabolical purpose
and ridded himself of the flower of the Swedish
patriots, the gory monarch set his officers at the head
of affairs, and taking Christina and her two boys with
him, marched through the land to Denmark, where he
threw Christina and her children into prison.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Through all that summer and autumn Gustavus Vasa
had been cooped up in his hiding-place on the M&auml;lar.
Once, in peril of his life, he had approached the venerable
Archbishop Ulfsson and solicited his advice. But
he found little comfort there. Ulfsson urged him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
go boldly to Christiern and beg for mercy. He even
offered to intercede for the young man, and encouraged
him with the assertion that he had been included among
those to whom the king had promised immunity at the
surrender of Christina. Gustavus, however, knew too
well what reliance he could place on Christiern's word.
With a downcast spirit he went back to his hiding-place,
resolved to await further developments before he ventured
forth. It was a time of harrowing suspense, the
iron entering into his very soul. Each day brought new
intelligence of the victories of Christiern and the gradual
dismemberment of the Swedish forces. His hopes
were already well-nigh shattered when the report was
wafted across the lake that his father, along with the
other patriot leaders, had been slaughtered in the capital.
Horror-stricken and overwhelmed with grief, he
sprang to his feet, resolved to brave death rather
than prolong this agony. Buckling on his sword, he
mounted one of his father's steeds, and set forth for the
north, filled with the dream of rescuing his native land.
It was near the 25th of November, and the scenery was
well in keeping with the dreary thoughts that flooded
the horseman's mind. The stern gnarled oaks along
the wayside, twisting their leafless boughs athwart the
sky, seemed as perverse as the Swedes whom he had
vainly sought to rouse. Even the frosty soil beneath
him, unyielding to his tread, recalled the apathy with
which his fellow-countrymen had listened to his cries.
Had he been fired solely by a love of Sweden, he would
very likely long ere this have renounced his hopeless
task. But a selfish purpose kept him in the path. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was a pariah, hunted down by his enemies, and driven
through sheer necessity to play the patriot. It was
liberty or death. And so he pushed on, resolved
to mingle among the hardy mountaineers of Dalarne,
and strive at all hazards to rouse the flagging pulses
of their hearts.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Crossing Lake M&auml;lar about four miles from his father's
house, Gustavus hurried through the forests north
of the lake with all the speed that a patriot's zeal could
lend. To one companioned by happier thoughts the
journey in those late autumn days must have been filled
with delight. Dalarne, through which his journey lay,
is the paradise of Sweden. As its name imports, it is
"the land of valleys." The whole province stands high
above the sea, rising higher as we travel farther north.
The hills which separate the valleys are mostly crowned
with pine and fir, and down their sides run broad and
gently sloping fields. Here and there the scenery is
varied by a little hamlet nestling along the hillside.
Little lakes, too, dot the surface of the land, and tiny
brooks go babbling across the fields. One stream, famous
in Swedish history, bisects the district from north
to south, passing through various lakes, and finally
pours its waters into the Baltic. This tortuous river,
called the Dalelf, is in some places broad and majestic,
while in others it is narrow and goes foaming like a cataract
over the rocks. Along the banks of this stream
Gustavus traced his steps, making first for a village on
Lake Runn, where an old Upsala schoolmate dwelt.
Here he arrived some five days after he left his father's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
house, and presenting himself in peasant's dress was
given refuge. However, he declared to no one who he
was, probably wishing first to learn how his host and
others were affected towards the king. While yet uncertain
what course he should pursue, one of the servants
noticed that he wore a gold-embroidered shirt, and
told her master; and this, coupled with his language
and general appearance, led to his discovery. He thereupon
appealed to his old schoolfellow to shield him
from his enemies, but in vain. The danger was too
great; and though full of sympathy for the young
refugee, he told him he must leave the place. Thus
once more an outcast, Gustavus hurriedly skirted the
south shore of the lake, and after a narrow escape by
breaking through the ice, reached the house of another
schoolmate, who offered him protection and then went
off to inform the Danish officers. From this catastrophe
Gustavus was rescued by a warning from his
betrayer's wife, and had fled ere the officers appeared.
His next asylum was some twenty miles farther north,
where he found protection at the hands of the parish
priest. The king's officers were now upon the scent.
The whole province was alive to the fact that it was
harboring within its borders the regent's ward. The
strictest vigilance was therefore necessary in order to
save his life. So the priest kept him but a week, and
then hurried him some thirty miles farther through the
woods to R&auml;ttvik, a hillside village at the eastern extremity
of Lake Siljan. There he tarried several days,
talking with the peasantry, and urging them to rebel
against the tyranny of their Danish ruler. He was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
on ground to be ever afterwards famous in Swedish history.
Here for the first time his words were heard with
some degree of favor. The proud spirits of these mountain
peasants had been already often roused by evidences
of foreign usurpation, and it needed little to induce them
to rebel. But their isolated position in a measure saved
them from the burdens of the Danish yoke, and they
answered they could venture nothing till they had held
a conference with their neighbors. The disheartened
outlaw therefore set forth once more. He traversed the
icy meadows that lie along the eastern side of Lake
Siljan, and after a journey of about twenty-five miles
reached the village of Mora, lying at the head of the
lake. It was on Christmas day that he addressed the
people of this village. Knowing this to be his last hope
of success, he took his stand on an elevated mound, and
gazed over the white fields, dotted here and there with
little hamlets, and to the snow-clad hills beyond. The
surroundings added even to the zeal with which his own
needs made him speak. He portrayed in burning terms
the wrongs and insults that had been heaped upon the
Swedish people. He alluded to his own affliction and
to the general scene of carnage that had taken place in
Stockholm. He pictured the evils in store for the proud
highlanders before him, and appealed to them in the
name of Almighty God to join him in a war for liberty.
But all this eloquence was wasted. His appeal struck
no responsive chord. The people flatly refused to give
him their assistance. He had, therefore, but one course
left. With no further hope of keeping his whereabouts
unknown, he hastened with all speed from the town, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
fled over the ice-bound hills of the west, to seek a last
asylum in the wilds of Norway.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Black indeed were the clouds now gathering over the
head of Sweden. Even the liberty-loving province of
Dalarne had refused to strike a blow for freedom.
Soon, it seemed, the whole of Sweden would be groaning
under the burden of a foreign despotism. Yet such an
issue was by the design of Providence to be averted.
But a few days after the flight of Gustavus out of Mora
news arrived that Christiern was preparing a journey
through the land, and had ordered a gallows to be
raised in every province. Rumor was rife, too, with
new taxes soon to be imposed. Nor was it long before
a messenger arrived who confirmed the words of
Gustavus as to the cruelties in Stockholm, and added
further that there were many magnates throughout the
realm who not only had not bowed the knee to Christiern,
but had declared that rather than do so they would
die with sword in hand. Then the blood of the villagers
of Mora boiled within them. Post-haste, and
trembling lest it were now too late, they put men on the
track of the young fugitive with orders to push on by
day and night and not rest till they had found Gustavus
and brought him back. They found him on the very
frontier of Norway, and announced to him that their
people were ready to join his banner and with him
pour out their blood for freedom. With a joyous heart
he turned about and hurried back to Mora. The whole
province was now awake. R&auml;ttvik had already had a
conflict with a body of Danish horsemen; and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
outcast hero appeared once more at Mora, he found a
vast throng of peasants flocking from every side to join
his ranks. By common consent he was chosen to be
their leader and a body of sixteen stout highlanders
selected to be his guard. This was in the early days of
1521. The perseverance of the stanch young outlaw
was rewarded, and the supremacy of Gustavus Vasa
had begun.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p class="cap">THERE are periods in the history of most nations
when all that has been hallowed by time and custom
seems of a sudden to lose its sanctity and bow
down before the commanding influence of some new
force. These periods are of rare occurrence and generally
of short duration. They remind one of those
thunderstorms which burst upon us at the close of a
sultry August day, unheralded but by the stifling heat
of a burning sky, and in a few moments leaving the atmosphere
behind them pure and clear and cool. Sudden
and unheralded as they appear, they are yet the direct
result of a long series of forces, whose ultimate issue
might have been accurately predicted did we but thoroughly
understand the forces themselves. So, too, it is
with great political upheavals. The revolution which
drenched the whole of France with blood in 1789 is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
more difficult to explain than the thunderstorm which
drenches the parched earth with rain on a hot midsummer
night. It was simply the reaction after a century
of oppression, extravagance and vice. In like manner
the great revolution whose development we are about
to trace was merely the natural result of long years of
tyranny culminating in the fearful carnage of the autumn
of 1520. The Revolution in Sweden is, however,
in one respect pre-eminent among the great crises known
to history. Never was a revolution so thoroughly the
work of a single man as that in Sweden. From beginning
to end there was one figure whose presence alone
infused life into a lukewarm people, and who, working
upon the forces which had been forged by years of
tyranny, shaped them gradually to his own commanding
will. The Revolution in Sweden is the history of Gustavus
Vasa. He it was who set the torch, and he, too,
pointed out the direction in which the flame should
burn.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1521, the war of independence
already had begun. By this time news of the revolt in
Dalarne had spread throughout the land, and the Danish
officers were wild with irritation that the young Gustavus
had escaped their clutches. The charge of affairs,
at the withdrawal of Christiern, had been placed in
the hands of a wretch scarce less contemptible than
his master. This was one Didrik Slagheck, a Westphalian
surgeon who, we are told, had "ingratiated
himself with Christiern and ravished the wives and
daughters of the Swedish magnates." Gad, for a time
the councillor of the Danish king, was now no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Christiern, shrewdly divining that one who had deserted
his former master might desert again, had used him to
mediate for the surrender of Stockholm and had then
removed his head. In place of the old burgomaster
and Council of Stockholm, the city was now held by
satellites of Christiern, and any whose hearts revolted
against his sickening cruelties were discreet enough to
hold their tongues. Dalarne had become the only spot
in Sweden where liberty still lived, and thither all
liberty-loving Swedes whose hands were not yet tied
repaired. Whenever these recruits appeared, Gustavus
placed them in the midst of his little army, and called
upon them to declare what they had seen of Christiern's
deeds. It makes a striking picture, this little band of
patriots, in a far-off mountain region in the dead of winter,
with no arms but their picks and axes, strong only
in their high resolve, and yet breathing defiance against
the whole army of the Danish king. Gustavus knew
the Swedish people well. He knew them slow to move,
dull of intellect, and averse from reason. But he knew
also that they were ardent in their emotions, permeated
with a love of liberty, courageous in defence of their
ancestral rights; and he foresaw that if he could once
but rouse their passions by a vivid picture of Danish
tyranny, he could make of them the finest soldiers in
all Christendom. By Lent the little army was four
hundred strong. With this force Gustavus marched to
the great copper-mine at Falun, where he seized the
Danish steward and took possession of the royal rents,
as well as of a quantity of clothing and some silk which
he at once turned to a good use as banners for his army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
He then retired to his camp, but shortly after returned,
this time fifteen hundred strong. This rapid increase in
his forces produced an instantaneous effect. No sooner
did he appear than the miners joined his ranks, and further
than that they wrote to their friends in all the
neighboring provinces to join him too. Gustavus then
fixed the headquarters of his army near the southern
boundary of Dalarne, and started, April 3, on a journey
in person through several of the northern provinces
to enlist recruits.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Meantime Slagheck had concentrated the Danish forces
in and near the Castle of Vester&aring;s, deeming this the
best point at which to hold the patriots at bay. One detachment,
indeed, proceeded north as far as the Dalelf,
on the southern frontier of Dalarne, and encamped there,
thinking to prevent the enemy from crossing. While
waiting, the Danish leader is said to have inquired the
population of Dalarne, and on being told that it was
about twenty thousand, to have asked how the province
could support so many. The answer was that the
people were not used to dainties, that their only drink
was water, and in hard times their only food a bread
made from the bark of trees. "Even the Devil," ejaculated
the officer, "could not vanquish men who live on
wood and water;" and with that he ordered a retreat.
Before they got off, however, the Swedes fell upon them
and drove them home in flight. About the same time
the burgomaster and Council of Stockholm despatched a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
letter to the northern provinces, urging them to pay no
heed to the lies of Gustavus; and Archbishop Trolle,
after several epistles of a like nature, set sail along the
coast of the Baltic to the north to use his influence in
quelling the insurrection. But wherever he tried to
land he was met by the peasantry with threats and imprecations;
and he soon beat a hasty and ignominious
retreat.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>On returning from his recruiting-tour to the headquarters
of his army, Gustavus put his men through a
regular course of training. Most of them were farmers,
with scarce enough knowledge of military affairs to
distinguish a javelin from a flagstaff. Their weapons
were of the rudest sort,&mdash;axes and bows and arrows.
He therefore taught them first of all to forge javelin
and arrow heads. He also introduced a pike with
spiral point which could be driven into a man's armor
so as to hold him fast. To meet the necessities of a
soldier, who was prevented by his occupation from paying
for his goods with wheat or rye, Gustavus issued a
copper coin which was at once received as money. These
preparations seem all to have been made with the prospect
of a long-continued war. While they were in progress,
a letter came from the burgomaster and Council
of Stockholm, dated April 10, and addressed to the
people of Dalarne, informing them that a number of
vessels had just arrived from the Hanse Towns, laden
by order of Christiern with clothing and food, which
were to be distributed among the people. After administering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
this mealy morsel the letter of the burgomaster
and Council went on to urge the Dalesmen to
have nothing to do with the lies and treachery of Gustavus,
but to consider their own and their children's
welfare and bow humbly before their gracious king.
This letter seems not to have produced the effect that
was intended. Another that came about the same time
was more effective. It was from some German soldiers
who declared, with more or less exaggeration, that they
were four thousand strong, that they had come to lend
their succor to Gustavus, had already seized nine of
Christiern's best men-of-war, and expected within a few
days to get possession of Stockholm. The news of this
marvellous achievement seems never to have been confirmed,
but at all events it fanned the enthusiasm of
the infant army.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Discontent had by this time spread throughout the
land. On the 18th of April we find the Danish authorities
in Stockholm writing that tumult and confusion
reign in all parts of the kingdom, and on the 23d of
April they write of an insurrection that has broken out
in Stegeholm. This rapid spread of the conflagration
made it necessary for the Danish officers to increase
their vigilance, and on the 26th of April they found an
opportunity to win their spurs. It occurred in this wise.
One of the recruiting-officers of Gustavus, in his eagerness
to advance the patriot cause, had pushed south into
the very heart of the enemy's country, and finally burst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
into the town of K&ouml;ping. Here, with all the rashness of
a new-made officer, he let loose his soldiers on the town.
The result was just what might have been expected.
Ere nightfall the whole army, officers and men, were
drunk. They retired to their camp, built blazing fires,
and lay down to sleep without watch or guard. News
of the situation was carried at once to Vester&aring;s, where
a force of three thousand men was got together and
sent post-haste to K&ouml;ping. It reached the patriot camp
soon after midnight on April 26. The scene of debauchery
was not yet past. The Danes fell upon them
as they lay there in their drunken stupor, and slew
them.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Three days before this catastrophe Gustavus divided
his entire forces into two parts, placing one under the
command of an officer named Olsson and the other
under one Eriksson. He then reviewed his troops,
and prepared to march against the Castle of Vester&aring;s.
He had planned an attack on the east side of the castle,
and the force sent down to K&ouml;ping had been given orders
to attack it simultaneously on the west. On learning
of the disaster at K&ouml;ping he seems to have made no
change in his own manoeuvres. He waited till the 29th,
and then advanced to the walls of Vester&aring;s. His design
was not to attack the town that day. But the Danish
soldiers, chafing for the fight and already glorying in
success, gave him no choice. They came boldly forth
to meet him, led by a line of cavalry, who dashed upon
the patriots, so runs the chronicle, "like raging lions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
The patriots received the charge like men. In their
front rank were the halberdiers, armed with sharp weapons
some fifteen or twenty feet in length. With these
they kept the cavalry at bay, and worried the horses till
at length confusion began to spread along the line. No
sooner did the patriots see this than they discharged a
volley of arrows, hitherto reserved. Under this double
discomfiture, from their own horses and their opponents'
arrows, the cavalry yielded, then finally turned and fled,
leaving four hundred dead upon the field. Nor was this
all. As the cavalry, frenzied with terror, dashed through
the town-gate, they found the narrow streets blocked
with the infantry, on whom their ungovernable steeds
rushed with all the fury lent by fear. A large number
were thus trampled to death, while the rest were precipitated
into flight. Eriksson followed them a short
distance, and then retired; but meantime Olsson entered
the city from another quarter, and got possession of the
enemy's cannon, ball, and powder. This he carried to
Gustavus, who had taken up his position on a ridge to
the north of the town. When now the garrison saw
that they were worsted, they set fire to the town and
then retired to the castle. At this many patriots rushed
back into the burning town, burst open the shops and
wine-vaults, and parted their booty among them. As
soon as the Danes saw what was going on, their courage
once more rose, and they fell upon the plundering patriots,
already half drunk with wine. Gustavus therefore sent
a detachment under Olsson into the town to drive the
Danish soldiers back. They met in the public square,
and a long and bloody battle followed; but at last the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
remnant of the Danish soldiers fled and took refuge in
the monastery. Here they remained three weeks, and
then escaped by boat to Stockholm. Gustavus, after the
fight was over, entered the town and destroyed every
wine-cask in the place. Though the town had fallen,
the Castle of Vester&aring;s still held out. Experience, however,
had made clear that it could not be reduced except
by siege. He therefore pitched his camp on the west
side of the castle, and despatched the main body of his
forces to other parts.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>First of all, he ordered Eriksson and Olsson to attack
Upsala. They therefore proceeded with a body of infantry
to a forest some twelve miles from the city, and
pitched their camp. As soon as the canons, with the
burgomaster and Council, heard that the city was to be
attacked, they sent a letter to the patriots urging them
to postpone the onset till after the 18th of May, Saint
Erik's day, that they might celebrate the festival. But
their messenger brought back answer that as Saint
Erik's day was a Swedish festival, the patriots would
enter the town before that day and attend to the festival
themselves. However, the archbishop's steward,
who held command of the town, felt no anxiety; and
out of bravado gave a sumptuous feast one evening on
the esplanade. The festivities were protracted with
song and dance till after midnight; and scarce had
the sound of revelry died away, when the patriots,
warned of the midnight orgies, burst upon the town,
beat down the guard, and held possession of the streets
before any of the carousers knew they were at hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
So soon as they did come to their senses they poured a
volley from their arquebuses into the spot where they
thought the enemy were collected. But they were
aiming in the dark, and not a finger of the Swedes
was hurt. The archbishop's steward then planned a
strategic movement on the rear, and endeavored to
move his troops through a long wooden passageway
running from the palace to the cathedral; but the
Swedes, perceiving it, set fire to the passageway, and
at the same time shot blazing arrows up into the palace
roof. The Danes retaliated by setting fire to the
buildings all about the palace; but the patriots in each
case extinguished the fire before it got fully under
way. The palace, however, was soon a mass of flames;
and the archbishop's forces, seeing all was lost, mounted
their steeds, burst open the palace-gate, and galloped in
all haste over the fields to the south. The Swedes pursued,
but, finding the enemy's steeds too fleet for them,
showered a volley of arrows after the flying horsemen,
and returned.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Early in June Gustavus came from Vester&aring;s, and
opened negotiations with the canons of Upsala, with a
view to win them over to his side. As they refused,
however, to take action without consulting the archbishop,
he begged them to consult him at once, and he
himself wrote a pacific letter urging the archbishop to
champion his country's cause. Trolle, then in Stockholm,
scorned the message and seized the messenger
who brought it. Then he placed himself at the head
of a troop of three thousand foot and five hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
horse, in glittering armor, and marched to Upsala, declaring
that his answer to the message he would convey
in person. Gustavus, expecting daily the return of
his messenger, was taken wholly unawares. The great
body of his soldiers had gone back to their farms, and
he had but six hundred of them left. With these it
would be madness to withstand the archbishop's force.
He therefore evacuated the city, and hurried over the
meadows to the west. As soon as he was out of danger,
he despatched officers to call back the farmers to his
ranks, and meantime drew up an ambuscade on the
road between Stockholm and Upsala, thinking to spring
upon the archbishop as he returned. The plot was discovered,
and when the troops returned they took another
path. Gustavus, however, did not give up the chase.
With his ranks once more replenished, he pursued the
enemy, and a battle followed so hot that when the archbishop
arrived at Stockholm, he entered the town with
only an eighth part of the glittering troop with which
he had started out.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The patriot army now proceeded to the capital, and
pitched their camp on the hill north of the town. There
they found four gallows from which were hanging the
bodies of four Swedes, murdered to glut the rapacity
of their Danish masters. One day, while encamped on
this spot, the Danes came out against them, and dividing
their forces into two bodies stormed the Swedish
redoubt simultaneously on both sides. The charge was
fierce, and lasted half a day, when the Swedes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
driven from their stronghold with heavy loss, and forced
to take up a new position about twelve miles farther
north. There they remained three weeks, battling daily
with the enemy with varying success. At last the commandant
of Stockholm had recourse to strategy. Advancing
with a powerful army till near the vicinity of
the Swedish camp, he halted and placed his force in
ambuscade. He then pushed forward with some forty
horse and a few weak infantry to the enemy's earthworks,
as if to storm them. After a slight skirmish,
in which some eight or ten of the horse were captured,
the Danish leader shouted that all was lost, and took
to flight. The patriots, all unsuspecting, dashed after
them, and followed blindly into the very midst of the Danish
army, into the jaws of death. Thus ended the first
attempt of Gustavus Vasa to capture Stockholm.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Better fared it with him in other parts. One of the
most valiant officers of Gustavus was Arvid Vestg&ouml;te.
This man was despatched, about the middle of May, to
the provinces south of Stockholm, to enlist the peasantry
in the Swedish cause. Collecting his forces along
the way, he advanced from one town to another, plundering
the estates of all who would not join him, and
before the end of June reached Stegeborg, a strongly
fortified castle on the Baltic coast. This he proceeded
to besiege. In July, Norby, the most famous naval
officer of Christiern, came to the rescue of the beleaguered
castle with sixteen men-of-war. Landing his
forces on the shore, he drew them up in battle-array,
three hundred strong. The Swedes, however, rushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
furiously upon them, and drove them to the sea. A few
days later, after provisioning the castle, Norby sailed
away to Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>All through this spring and summer Gustavus was
busy passing from camp to camp, giving orders as to
the disposition of his forces, and receiving the allegiance
of the people. His practice, as far as possible, seems to
have been to use persuasion, and only when that failed
did he resort to force. This method proved successful
in a marvellous degree. One after another the provinces
recognized him as their leader; and on the 14th of July
we find him issuing a proclamation as commander of
five provinces, named in the order of their declaration
of allegiance. His greatest difficulty at this time was
in finding the means with which to pay his men. Possessing
no authority to levy taxes, he was often forced
to close the mouths of his clamoring soldiers by allowing
them to plunder. The great body of his army was of
course made up of Swedes. These were fighting for the
welfare of their wives and children, and were content if
he provided them only with the necessities of life. The
mercenaries whom he employed were few. One of them,
a tough old warrior named Rensel, has left us a chronicle
of his life. He tells us he came over from Livonia
in the winter of 1521, and was among the four thousand
German veterans that counted on entering Stockholm
in the spring. Gustavus sent him back to the Continent
for more men and ammunition; and when he returned
in July of that year, he brought back sixty mercenaries
with him. In August Gustavus made an inspection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the camp at Stegeborg. While there, he learned that
the Bishop of Link&ouml;ping was more than half minded to
join the patriot cause. This bishop, Hans Brask, was a
man of rare shrewdness, excellent common-sense, and
as time-serving as any man in Europe. He had strong
convictions, but he always looked to see how the wind
was blowing before he spoke them out. He had, among
others, signed the decree for the demolition of St&auml;ket,
but had taken the precaution to place under his seal a
slip of paper declaring
that he affixed his signature
perforce, and when
his fellows were brought
out to be beheaded, he
removed the seal; by
this little bit of Romanism
he saved his head
and the emoluments of
his priestly office. To
this man Gustavus wrote
in August, asking for a conference. The aspect of the
heavens was not such as to justify the wily bishop in
refusing. The continued brutality of Didrik Slagheck
had raised such a storm of indignation in the country,
that his own followers had found it necessary, on June
16, to hurry him out of Sweden, and announce that they
had thrown him into jail. Nearly all of Sweden, except
the fortified castles, was in the patriots' hands. The
forces of Gustavus were growing stronger day by day,
and in the continued absence of Christiern the fortresses
that still held out were likely soon to yield for want of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
food and ammunition. In this state of affairs Hans
Brask made up his mind without delay. He granted
the interview with Gustavus, and was very easily persuaded
to join the Swedish cause. It now seemed best
that the vague authority conferred upon Gustavus by
the different provinces should be defined, so that he
might as representative of the Swedish nation treat
with foreign powers. He therefore announced that a
general diet would be held at Vadstena on August 24,
and all the chief men of different classes in the kingdom
were summoned to attend. By whom the delegates
were selected we are not told. Certainly they were not
selected by Gustavus. At all events, they came together
in vast numbers, and, if we are to believe the chronicle,
urged Gustavus to accept the crown. This, however, he
refused, but accepted the title of Commander of the
Swedish Army, at the same time adding that after they
had wholly freed themselves from Christiern, a general
diet might then be held to discuss the propriety of
choosing some man of their own nation king.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>While the patriots were occupied with their diet, the
Danes in Stockholm sent a force by water to the relief
of Vester&aring;s. The patriots, still in possession of the
town, sought by aid of their falconets to prevent a
landing, but without avail. The relief-party made its
way into the castle, replenished it with men and ammunition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and withdrew. Gustavus, knowing that the
Danes on their return to Stockholm must pass through
a narrow inlet some thirty yards in width, sent thither
a force to throw up earthworks on both sides of the
passage and await the coming of the enemy. The battle
which ensued was fierce, and lasted two whole days;
but finally, having inflicted as well as suffered heavy
loss, the Danish fleet escaped. Shortly after, in September,
Gustavus sent a force to Finland. This force received
large reinforcements from the people in that
province, and on the 24th of November, being furnished
ammunition by the bishop of &Aring;bo, laid siege to &Aring;bo
Castle. On December 18 the Castle of Stegeborg still
besieged by Arvid Vestg&ouml;te, fell; and the commandant,
Berent von Mehlen, after two months in prison swore
fealty to Gustavus. Six days after the castle yielded,
Norby, not having heard of the disaster, came sailing
boldly into the harbor with food and men. The patriots
soon informed him of his error by firing upon him from
the castle walls, and in the conflict which took place
it is reported that six hundred of his men were lost.
Most of Vestg&ouml;te's forces, after the fall of Stegeborg,
were transferred to the vicinity of Stockholm, to which
Gustavus early in the autumn had again laid siege.
The summer's experience had made manifest that it
would be useless to assault the capital. Gustavus therefore
held his forces several miles away from the city,
and with a view to cut off supplies divided them into
three camps,&mdash;one on the north, another on the south,
and the third on an island to the west. On Christmas
eve the garrison, finding that no assault was likely to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
made, embarked some fifteen hundred men on yawls
and coasting-vessels, and proceeded against the island-camp.
The Swedish leader watched the preparations
from a hill; and when he saw that the enemy were
coming against himself, divided his men into squads of
fourteen and sixteen, and placed these squads at intervals
through the woods with orders to sound their horns
as soon as the neighboring squad had sounded theirs.
He then waited till the enemy were all on shore, when
he gave the signal, and in a moment it was re-echoed all
along the line. The effect was marvellous. The enemy,
horrified by the apparent number of the Swedes, turned
and fled. The Swedes, who had but about four hundred
and fifty men in all, pursued them to their boats and
cut down two hundred of them on the shore. After this
the garrison from time to time made raids upon the
northern and southern camps, and generally got the
better of the Swedes, though nothing of marked importance
was accomplished by either side. On the 30th of
January the Castle of Vester&aring;s, hard pressed for food
and cut off from supplies, surrendered. Later in the
winter, seemingly in March, Norby came from Denmark
with a large force to Stockholm, and replenished the garrison
with fresh men. About the same time the Swedish
camp on the north was moved nearer; and the Danes,
thus reinforced by Norby, came out against them
April 17, and routed them with heavy loss. The day
following, a like sally was made on the southern camp
with like result. Having thus raised the siege of Stockholm,
Norby set sail for Finland, and routed the Swedish
forces still besieging &Aring;bo. The bishop of &Aring;bo, finding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
his own land too hot for him, embarked for Sweden; but
his vessel foundered, and all on board were drowned.
In April Gustavus recruited a strong force in Dalarne
and the other northern provinces, and pitched his camps
once more to the north and south of Stockholm.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The war had now been raging over a year, and Gustavus
had experienced the utmost difficulty in obtaining
money with which to pay his men. In the absence
of any authority to levy taxes, he had resorted to the
practice of coining money, and had established mints
in several places through
the realm. His coins, which
were known as "klippings,"
consisted of copper with a
very slight admixture of silver,
and twenty-four of them
were issued for a mark. As a matter of fact their actual
value fell far below what they purported to be worth. For
such a practice it is difficult to find excuse, except that
it was a practice universal at the time. Why a monarch
should be justified any more than an individual in giving
a penny where he owed a pound, is difficult to comprehend.
Yet this had been for centuries the custom,
and each successive monarch had pared a little from
the standard, so that in the eight hundred years preceding
Gustavus Vasa the various monetary units all over
Europe had declined to little more than an eighteenth
part of their original value. In Denmark the debasement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of the currency had been more rapid than in almost
any other land, and the "klippings" of Christiern
II. fell farther below their nominal value than any coin
in Europe&mdash;till the "klippings" were issued by Gustavus,
which were a trifle worse than those of Christiern.
Of course, as the standard of currency is lowered, its
buying-power gradually declines, so that ultimately, under
whatever name a particular coin may go, it will
buy no more than could be had for the actual bullion
which it contains. A mark in the sixteenth century
would have bought, provided the relative supply of
bullion and merchandise remained the same, only an
eighteenth part of what it bought originally. The aim
of monarchs was, therefore, to get rid of their debased
coins at more than the real value, and after they had
depreciated, to get them back at the depreciated value,
melt them down, and lower the standard further. Precisely
how much Gustavus made by tampering with the
currency is impossible to say, for there is no means of
determining how many of his "klippings" he threw
upon the market. It is clear, however, that the scheme
was from a financial point of view successful, and that
a vast number of the "klippings" were absorbed before
the public detected their inferiority.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Unquestionably the marvellous progress made by Gustavus
in this first year of the revolution was owing in
great measure to the critical state of things in Denmark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>.
Christiern had by this time made enemies all over Europe.
Lubeck, always a latent enemy, was particularly
imbittered by Christiern's favoritism of the market
towns of the Netherlands and his avowed intention of
making Copenhagen the staple market for his kingdom;
France hated him because he was the brother-in-law of
her enemy, Charles V.; Fredrik, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein,
opposed him because he had laid claim to those
dominions; and his own clergy opposed him because of
his rumored leaning towards Lutheranism and his efforts
to check their power. All these things prevented his
return to Sweden, and conspired against his credit so
that he was unable to raise an army of any strength.
Didrik Slagheck, too, whom he had placed at the head
of affairs in Sweden, had fallen into disgrace, and, to
appease the public clamor, had been beheaded. Even
Gustavus Trolle, after several attempts to exert his papal
authority in Sweden, had found the land too hot for
him, and for the present had withdrawn to Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Norby was at this time the most valuable officer that
Christiern had. He infested the shores of the Baltic
with his fleet, making frequent incursions on the land
to plunder; and at length became so obnoxious that
Gustavus sent to Lubeck for a fleet. On the 7th of June
it came, ten ships of war, laden with all sorts of merchandise,
and fully equipped with powder, shot, and men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
For this aid Gustavus is said to have paid an enormous
figure, giving his promissory note for the amount. Picking
out a battalion of five hundred men, he sent them
down to Kalmar, to which castle Vestg&ouml;te had just laid
siege. The rest of the reinforcements he despatched to
Stockholm, quartering them in his different camps, and
then discharged all of the Swedish peasants except the
young unmarried men. Shortly after this change the commandant
of &Aring;bo Castle crossed the Baltic with a powerful
fleet, and sought to break the siege of Stockholm. But
the Swedish fleet met him outside the harbor, captured or
burnt his vessels, and took him prisoner. In October,
seeing that the garrison was losing strength, Gustavus
advanced his camps nearer to the town. His southern
camp he moved to S&ouml;dermalm, from which he built a pontoon
bridge to connect it with the west camp now on
an island some three or four hundred yards from Stockholm.
Another bridge he threw across the channel
east of the city, and built upon it a turret which he
armed with heavy guns. The city was thus hemmed in
on every side, and a contemporary writes, "We cannot
find in any of the old chronicles that Stockholm ever
was so hard besieged before." Unless relief came it
was merely a question of time when the garrison would
have to yield. Once, in November, Norby came sailing
into the harbor with five ships-of-war; but the Swedish
fleet, consisting of fifteen vessels, drove him off, and,
were it not for the half-heartedness of the German
mercenaries, would very likely have destroyed his fleet.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>The high spirit of the garrison had fallen. Wasted
in numbers, with hunger and dissension spreading fast
among them, and with scarce enough ammunition to resist
an assault upon their walls, they waited impatiently
for the army of Christiern, and marvelled that it did not
come. All servants, old men, monks, burghers, and
prostitutes they sent away, that there might be fewer
mouths to feed. Each day, too, their numbers were
diminished through the desertion of able-bodied men
who escaped through the gates or over the walls and
made their way by one means or another to the Swedish
camp. There being no longer possibility of driving off
the enemy by force, they felt that their only hope was
fraud. They therefore one day sent a Swedish magnate
to the enemy, with instructions to pretend that he had
fled, and after finding out how matters stood, set fire to
the camp and either return to the garrison, or, that
being impossible, make his way to Denmark and induce
the monarch to send immediate relief. This piece of
stratagem, however, proved abortive; for two refugees
from the garrison came forward and denounced the
magnate as a spy.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>When winter came, Gustavus sent a large part of his
army, chiefly the cavalry, to take up winter-quarters in
Upsala. Others were sent to other towns. Some, too,
were sent, in February, 1523, to the Norwegian frontier
to gain the allegiance of the people. Towards the close
of winter Gustavus ordered his German troops to the
south of Sweden on a similar errand, but within six
weeks they came back and reported that the spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
freshets had carried away the bridges and they could
not proceed. Norby meantime lay with a strong force
in the town and castle of Kalmar, and was making preparations
to attack Vestg&ouml;te, who was still carrying on
the siege, as soon as spring should open. But just as he
was getting ready, he received word from the Danish
Cabinet that Christiern had been deposed in Denmark,
and Fredrik, duke of Schleswig-Holstein, summoned to
the throne. At this news he set sail with all his force
for Denmark, leaving only sixty men to hold the castle
and town of Kalmar. Their orders were to form two
garrisons of thirty each, one to guard the castle and the
other to guard the town; and if through assault or
failure of provisions they could not maintain the stronghold,
they were to slaughter all the Swedes in Kalmar,
set fire to the town, and sail to Gotland. As soon as
the burghers of Kalmar learned of these instructions,
they sent a messenger to the Swedish camp to tell the
Swedes to enter the town by the north gate on the 27th
of May, when the burghers would take care that the
gate should be opened for them. On the day appointed
Vestg&ouml;te advanced with all his cavalry, and drew them
up in battle-array along the west and south side of the
town as if to storm the southern gate. The garrison,
all unsuspecting, flocked to that point in order to receive
the charge. But meantime the Swedish infantry
had massed themselves outside the northern gate, which
at a concerted signal was thrown open on its hinges,
and the infantry pressed in. It was but the work of a
moment to put the little garrison to the sword. For a
few weeks more the castle refused to yield, and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
not till the 7th of July that, reduced to the last extremity,
it fell.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Kalmar had not yet fallen when it became clear that
the war of independence was drawing to its close, and it
was felt on every hand that the country had been too
long without a king. The powers which Gustavus possessed
as regent were too vague to meet the necessities
of a time of peace. While the army was in the field,
he had authority, as commander of the forces, to levy
the taxes necessary to sustain his men; but, so soon
as the war was over, there would be no means for raising
the money needed to pay the nation's debts. He therefore,
shortly before the fall of Kalmar, summoned a
general diet to be held at Strengn&auml;s on the 27th of May.
Whether or not all the magnates of Sweden were summoned
to the diet is not known, but at any rate the
peasantry were represented. The wily Brask, who had
once saved his head by a bit of strategy, dared not
put it in jeopardy again, and fearing that matters of
weight might be brought before the diet, was suddenly
taken ill and rendered unable to attend. The Cabinet,
hitherto the sum and substance of a general diet, was
practically dead, having been carried off in the fearful
slaughter of 1520. One of the first things to be done,
therefore, after the opening of the diet, was to fill these
vacant seats. This was accomplished on the 2d of June,
but whether the members were chosen by Gustavus or
by vote of the general diet we are not told. Noteworthy
it is, that the persons selected, nine in number, were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of them laymen and warriors in the service of Gustavus.
Four days later, on the 6th of June, the question of
electing a king of Sweden was brought before the house.
The proposal was received with shouts of acclamation,
and with one accord the delegates raised their voices in
favor of Gustavus. But the regent, so the reporter
tells us, rose to his feet, and, mid the deafening shouts
of those about him, declared that he had no wish for
further honor, that he was weary of leadership, that he
had found more gall than honey in the post, and that
there were others more worthy than himself on whom to
lay the crown. So importunate, however, were the delegates,
that at last he yielded, accepted their allegiance,
and took the royal oath. This done, the diet voted to
levy a tax to defray the expenses of the war. Among
the very first Acts to which the newly chosen monarch
attached his seal was one which granted the cities of
Lubeck and Dantzic, with their allies, the perpetual monopoly
of all foreign trade with Sweden. At the same
time it was provided that Stockholm, Kalmar, S&ouml;derk&ouml;ping,
and &Aring;bo should be the only ports of entry for
foreign merchants in the realm. This Act was the result
of an application made by Lubeck the year before,
and was carried by the importunities of Lubeck's ambassadors
to the diet. It was a sop to stay the flood of
their demands for immediate payment of the debt incurred
to Lubeck by the war. As it granted these
Hanse Towns entry for all goods free of duty, it must
be deemed a marked concession. One favorable clause,
however, was incorporated in the Act, providing that no
alien should thereafter be a burgher either of Stockholm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
or of Kalmar. Another measure of weight which the
diet passed provided that a tax payable in silver should
be levied to defray the expenses of the war, though apparently
nothing was fixed by the diet as to the amount
to be raised or as to the mode of levy. With this
meagre record our information regarding this celebrated
diet ends; but the new Cabinet, before it parted, drew up
a long-winded account of the cruelties of Christiern,
which it sent abroad among the people for a lasting
memorial of their tyrant king.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>No sooner had the diet closed its doors than the
monarch sped with all the haste he could command
to Stockholm. That city had been for several days in
the last stages of despair. The garrison was miserably
wasted in numbers, and its food was gone. Longer to
look for aid from Denmark was to hope against all
hope. Indeed, the wretched soldiers now thought only
of the terms on which they should capitulate. During
a month or more they had parleyed with their besiegers,
but the terms which they had offered had thus far been
refused. As soon as Gustavus reached the spot, negotiations
were once more opened. The new monarch,
fresh from the honors of Strengn&auml;s, seems to have
shown them mercy. Apparently he granted their requests;
for on the 20th of June the castle yielded, and
the garrison, supplied with food and ships, set sail for
Denmark. Three days later, June 23, the monarch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
entered the capital in triumph, amid the hosannas of
his people. With this glorious issue the Swedish war
of independence closed.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In contemplating this struggle as a whole, the reader
will doubtless be impressed by the extraordinary ease
with which the victory was won. In less than two years
and a half after the first blow was struck, the Danish
tyrants had been
driven from every
stronghold, and
the patriots had
placed their leader
on the throne.
Indeed, eighteen
months had scarcely passed when the issue was practically
decided. The remaining year consisted mainly
in the reduction of Sweden's strongholds, and was
marked by little bloodshed. It furnished small opportunity
either for brilliant strategy or for acts of startling
courage. The enforced absence of the Danish
monarch prevented his army from entering the field,
and the patriots had neither arms nor ammunition
with which to storm the forts. Both parties, therefore,
waited; and the last year was little more than a test
to determine the endurance of the contending armies.
While, however, this period wants many of the features
that make war grand, it is yet instructive if not interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
in its results. The struggle at the beginning was
against overwhelming odds. The patriots had neither
ammunition nor resources, and their leader was without
prestige. On the other hand the Danes were well supplied
with men and arms, and were led by one of the
powerful monarchs of Europe backed by all the authority
and influence of Rome. In spite of all this,
the patriots grew in numbers day by day, while the
Danish forces steadily declined. The patriots succeeded
in obtaining rich supplies of men and arms from abroad,
while Christiern was scarce able to keep his army from
starvation. One by one the strongholds which he had
seized surrendered, till finally his entire army was forced
to yield, and Sweden, from her place as a weak and
down-trodden Danish province, attained an enviable
position among the great monarchies of Europe. The
key to this marvellous transformation in the two parties
can be found only in the characters of their respective
leaders. The people were horrified by the brutal cruelties
of Christiern, while allured by the evident sincerity
and enthusiasm of Gustavus. In all history there is
no more striking example of the far-reaching influence
which individual characters sometimes exert upon a
nation's growth.</p>

<p class="cap">WE have now reached that point in our narrative
where the history of modern Sweden takes its
start. With the close of the war of independence those
features which mark the face of medi&aelig;val Sweden disappear,
and a wholly new countenance gradually settles
upon the land. Nor is this transformation peculiar in
any way to Sweden. Early in the sixteenth century all
Europe was passing from medi&aelig;val into modern history.
In the Middle Ages there was but one criterion for
every question that arose, and that criterion was the
past. Whatever had been, should continue. All Church
dogmas were settled by an appeal to the ancient Fathers;
all political aspirations were fought out on the basis of
descent. Tradition was the god of medi&aelig;val Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
At last, however, questions arose for which tradition
had no answer. On the Renaissance in Italy, on the
invention of printing and of gunpowder, on the discovery
of America, the ancient Fathers had not spoken.
On these things, therefore, which raised the greatest
questions of the age, men had nothing for it but to do
their thinking for themselves. The practice thus evoked
soon spread to other questions, and gradually men grew
bold enough to venture opinions on certain stereotyped
matters of religion. As all the world knows, the Reformation
followed, and from an age of blind acceptance
Europe passed to an age of eager controversy. Instead
of searching to find out what had been, men
argued to determine what it was desirable should be.
If tradition was the characteristic of medi&aelig;val, policy
is the characteristic of modern, history. Some old
dogmas, like the divine right of kings, still linger; but
since the fifteenth century kings have had little chance
whose claims conflict with the balance of European
power.</p>

<p>The beginnings of modern history are inextricably
bound up with the beginnings of the Reformation. It is
a common belief that the Reformation in Europe worked
a radical change in the doctrines of religious men, raising
up two parties with diametrically opposing creeds.
Such a conception, however, is misleading. The Reformation
was not so much a religious as a political revolt.
It was the natural outcome of a growth in the power of
northern Germany at a moment when Rome was losing
her political prestige. The alliance between the German
Empire and the popes of Rome had its origin in a need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of mutual assistance. Western Europe consisted, at the
accession of Charlemagne, of many independent principalities
at war among themselves, and what they needed
was a powerful protector to adjust their various disputes.
Later this need of a protector became still more
urgent, when Germany and France fell under different
rulers, and the German Empire began to be threatened
by the monarchy across the Rhine. Rome, by reason
of her spiritual supremacy, was the arbiter to whom the
northern nations naturally turned, and she found ready
recompense for her services in the treasures poured generously
into her lap. Such was the basis of the Holy
Roman Empire. But by the beginning of the sixteenth
century all this had changed. Germany was no longer
weak. Her little principalities had become cemented
together under an emperor well able to repel every
invasion of the French. Society had made vast progress,
not only in its comforts, but in its demands.
Rome, on the other hand, had lost her prestige. In Italy,
where the brutality and licentiousness of the popes were
open to every eye, people had long since lost all reverence
for the Church. This feeling did not spread readily
across the Alps; but it came at last, and at a moment
when Germany no longer needed aid. A nation guarded
by the strong arm of Maximilian could ill brook new
levies to feed the extravagance of its decrepit ally, and
the infamous practices of Tetzel served as a timely pretext
to shake off the burdensome alliance of the papal
see. The abuses of popery were little more than a war-cry,
while the real struggle of the Reformation was
against the political supremacy of Rome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>In Sweden, more than in almost any other land, the
Reformation was a political revolt. Indeed, it may well
be called a political necessity. At the moment when
Gustavus Vasa was elected king, Sweden was on the
verge of bankruptcy. The war just passed had drained
the resources of the country, and left her heavily involved
in debt. The principal creditor was Lubeck.
Precisely how much had been borrowed from that town
it is impossible to determine, though it is certain the
total amount fell not far short of 300,000 Swedish
marks.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> One payment of about 17,000 Swedish marks
Gustavus had made in 1522.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This of course was a
mere drop in the bucket, and other devices were necessary
to relieve the general distress. One favorite device,
to which allusion has been already made, consisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in a debasement of the currency. That device,
however, had soon lost its savor, and the coin which in
1522 Gustavus had issued for an &ouml;re and a half, he was
forced in 1523 to place upon the market as an &ouml;re.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> So
that when the new monarch ascended the throne it was
manifest that the treasury must be replenished in other
modes. The natural direction was that in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
greatest wealth of Sweden lay,&mdash;in other words, the
Church. We have already seen how completely, in the
centuries preceding the Reformation, the Church in
Sweden had freed herself from all authority of the people,
and had gradually accumulated for herself a vast
amount of wealth. Some conception of this treasure
may be had by comparing the edifices belonging to the
Church with those owned by individuals. Such a comparison
reveals at once an enormous disparity in favor
of the Church. At a time when well-to-do citizens
dwelt in what would at this day be known as hovels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
they worshipped in churches that must have seemed
to them palatial. The six cathedrals that existed in
the time of Gustavus still remain, and even at this day
compare favorably with the finest structures in the
land. In addition to a magnificent palace, the archbishop
and the five Swedish bishops each possessed a
fortified castle in his diocese. In each diocese, too,
there were an enormous number of estates belonging
to the bishopric; those in the diocese of Link&ouml;ping, for
example, numbering over six hundred. The rents and
profits from these estates went directly to the bishopric,
and were wholly exempt from taxation, as were
also the untold treasures of gold and silver belonging
to the various churches. Beside all this tithes of every
species of farm produce raised in any part of Sweden
were due the Church, also tithes of all other personal
property acquired. Further, a small annual tax was
due the Church for every building in the land from a
palace to a pig-sty; also a fee for every wedding, death, or
childbirth. No one could inherit property, or even take
the sacrament, without a contribution to the Church.
And every peasant was bound one day each year to labor
for his pastor without reward.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> How all this money was
disbursed, seems difficult to comprehend. Some clew,
however, may be gained when we consider what a vast
horde of clergy the Swedish people had to feed. Take,
for example, the cathedrals. Most of them formed a
little hierarchy in themselves. First of all was the
archbishop or the bishop, who lived in regal splendor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Around him was his chapter, comprising in one instance
as many as thirty canons. Then there was the archdeacon,
the cantor, the scholasticus, and some thirty
or forty prebends. This little army of Church officers required
to be fed, and fed well&mdash;and the people of Sweden
had to pay the bill. It was but natural, therefore, that,
Sweden being heavily involved in debt, the monarch
should seek to stay this wasteful extravagance and divert
a portion of the Church incomes to the crown.</p>

<p>By the war of independence the way had been already
paved for a war against the Church. Christiern had declared
himself the champion of the pope; and the higher
clergy, as vicegerents of the pope in Sweden, had generally
allied themselves with the foreign party. So that the rebellion
had been in large measure directed against the
authorities of the Church itself, and the victory of Gustavus
was felt distinctly as a victory over the powers
of the Church. The Chapter of Upsala had therefore
deemed it policy to please Gustavus, and were talking
of electing his chancellor archbishop in place of
Trolle, who had fled the realm. For a like reason
the Chapter of Vester&aring;s had chosen a former secretary
of Sture to their vacant bishopric. The bishoprics of
Strengn&auml;s and Skara, made vacant by the expulsion of
the Danes, had also been filled by persons favorable
to the general policy of Gustavus. So that when the
new monarch assumed control, the dignitaries of the
Church seemed likely to listen to his demands.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is not for a moment to be supposed that Gustavus
at this time contemplated an opposition to the pope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Such an idea had been spread abroad by Christiern
with a view to win sympathy in Europe; but Gustavus
had written to all the potentates of Europe to deny
the charge, and had sent a messenger to the pope to
raise a counter charge against Christiern as the murderer
of two Swedish bishops in the slaughter of 1520.
The pope, already distrustful of his Danish ally, had
listened favorably to the message, and in the following
summer, 1523, had sent a legate to Sweden to inform
him further on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This papal legate, Johannes Magni, was the son of
a pious burgher of Link&ouml;ping, and along with his two
brothers had been educated from childhood for the
Church. At the age of eighteen so marvellous was his
precocity that he was made a canon both of Link&ouml;ping
and of Skara. Later, as was the practice with scholars
of that period, he continued his studies at several of
the leading universities in Europe. But in spite of a
sojourn of some seventeen years away from Sweden,
he never ceased to keep up a fervid interest in the
affairs of his native land. As soon as the atrocities of
Christiern reached his ears, he made a personal visit to
Pope Leo X. and denounced the practices of the Danish
king. The suggestions which he offered seem to have
been scorned by Leo; but in 1521 that pontiff died,
and his successor, Adrian VI., listened more readily to
the Swedish canon. Adrian himself was from the north
of Europe, and had earlier been an instructor of Johannes
in the University of Louvain. The characters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of the two were not unlike. Both held strong theological
opinions, and looked with dread upon all opposition
to the papal power. But they were both keenly alive
to the abuses that had gathered about the Church, and
were eager to repress them. Johannes was peculiarly
suited by nature for a work of compromise. With no
ordinary talents, of untiring energy, sympathetic, generous,
and conciliating, but withal imbued with an ardent
love of the Church, Adrian at once discerned in
him a valuable mediator. When, therefore, Gustavus
wrote to Rome to defend himself against the charge
of heresy, the pope selected Johannes as his legate, with
instructions to proceed to Sweden and investigate the
charges made against each other by Christiern and
Gustavus. The legate, complying with these orders,
arrived in Sweden while the diet of Strengn&auml;s was in
session. He therefore made his way directly to that
town. While on the road the tidings reached him that
Gustavus Vasa had been elected king. As soon as the
new monarch learned of his approach, he sent for him
to come before the house. There he was overwhelmed
with expressions of gratitude for his past interest in
the Swedish cause. In return the legate addressed the
house at great length in favor of Gustavus. The impression
left upon his hearers was so pleasing that the
Cabinet drew up a letter to the pope requesting that
Johannes be given full authority, with the bishops of
Sweden, to reform the Swedish Church. In the same
letter opportunity was taken to denounce the vices of
Archbishop Trolle, and to beg that, he having already
resigned and fled the kingdom, the pope should use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his authority to have a new archbishop chosen in his
stead.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>This document bears strong evidence of the influence
of the king. Its allusion to the resignation of Archbishop
Trolle was of course untrue. That prelate had
fled the realm to escape the fury of his opponents, but
he still looked for the restoration of Danish power and
a return of his own prerogatives in the Swedish Church.
The king's desire, as reflected in the letter of his Cabinet,
was to secure from the pope a recognition that the
archbishopric was vacant, and then to use this recognition
to force the unwilling Chapter of Upsala to nominate
as archbishop one who was in the interests of the king.
The scheme, however, failed; for Pope Adrian died before
he had had time to act, and was succeeded by a
pontiff who hated everything which savored of reform.</p>

<p>During the first months of his reign Gustavus was
made wretched by the importunate demands of Lubeck.
Her ambassadors continually dogged his steps, and declared
they would not leave him till every cent that
Sweden owed was paid. After the fall of Kalmar the
monarch needed his foreign mercenaries no longer, and
would gladly have cashiered them and sent them off.
But the "klippings" struck the year before had so far
lost the confidence of his subjects that the soldiers
refused to take them at any price at all, and Gustavus
was compelled to keep his men on foot till he could obtain
the silver requisite to issue better coins. The diet
just dissolved had passed an act providing for the levy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of new taxes to be paid in silver, and the king apparently
had been given power to fix the mode in which
the levy should be made. This was a matter which
required skilful handling; and it is fair to say that the
policy which the king pursued, if not perfectly straightforward,
showed, at any rate, rare skill. Fearing lest
another direct call upon the peasantry would raise an
outcry, he resolved to make his application to the Church,
and give her the option of surrendering a portion of her
riches or of losing her prestige by laying new burdens
on her devotees. With this in view he wrote first of all
to Brask, and after demanding some five thousand guilders
which he understood that prelate had stored away
in Lubeck, he called upon him to collect four hundred
marks in silver from the clergy of his diocese. He then
issued a proclamation to the churches and monasteries
throughout the land to send him all the chalices, patens,
and ornaments that could be spared from the altars, as
well as all the silver coin that could be found; and
along with this he published a statement of the total
amount which each diocese and monastery must provide.
Two things are noticeable in this proclamation:
first, it does not specify the amount which each particular
church must furnish; and, secondly, it distinctly
states that the sums handed over are to be deemed as
loans, which he will duly acknowledge and ultimately
pay in full. In his letter to Brask, on the contrary, the
exact amount for which the bishop must be responsible
is named, and no definite promise is given to repay it.
The document seems part of a deliberate plan to crush
the power of the crafty bishop. This Brask noticed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and in his reply adverted to a suspicion lest for some
reason he had incurred the king's displeasure, which he
would willingly avert. The simplest mode of averting
the king's displeasure would have been a speedy compliance
with the king's demand. For this, however, Brask
had little relish. So Gustavus, two weeks later, wrote
again. "We are much surprised," he said, "that you
show no more concern while a weight like this rests
upon the kingdom. The amount which we must raise
without a moment's delay is two hundred thousand guilders,
and the Lubeck ambassadors refuse point-blank to
depart unless they take that sum with them. If they
don't get it we fear open war, which God forbid! Therefore,
by the allegiance which you owe us and the realm,
we exhort you, send the four hundred marks' weight
without delay." Even this appeal had no immediate
effect, and after two weeks more he sent Brask another
despatch. "The Lubeck ambassadors," wrote the king,
"will not leave us till they get the money which we
owe in Lubeck,&mdash;a vast sum. It is, therefore, of necessity
that we lay this tax upon the churches and monasteries.
Strain every nerve to obtain some relief for
us in your diocese, especially from your churches and
monasteries; the clergy we shall spare for the present."
The bishop finally complied, though with an ill grace;
and on the 10th of August we find Gustavus writing
that he has so far satisfied the demands of Lubeck that
her ambassadors have parted from him on good terms.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>The tax had been collected, though not without much
friction. It had found the people in an irritable temper,
and it had left them more irritable still. The ruin
which the war had caused was visible on every hand,
and the blessings that were expected to follow were not
so easily discerned. During two years the fields had
been lying fallow, commerce had steadily declined, and
the people were actually suffering for food. Stockholm
had been rendered desolate. Its population had fallen
to about one quarter. "Every other house," wrote Gustavus,
"is now empty;" and there appeared so little
chance of a revival that the king issued a proclamation
calling on the burghers of other towns as far as possible
to sell their houses and settle down in Stockholm.
Another cause of dissatisfaction was that, though the
war was over in Sweden, the Swedish possessions in
Finland were still in the hands of the enemy, and a considerable
army was needed to reduce them. Fredrik,
king of Denmark, had resigned his claim to Sweden;
but certain islands off the coast, as well as some districts
along the frontier of Norway, were still matters of dispute.
All these circumstances tended to raise a spirit
of discontent, which, though for the nonce restrained,
was ready to break out into violence at any moment.
To prevent evil, Gustavus resolved to issue a proclamation
to the people.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th of September the annual fair at Vester&aring;s
was opened, and Gustavus seized this opportunity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
make a public statement of his doings. This statement
was in the nature of an apology for the recent tax. It
declared in the first place that the expenses of the war
had reached a higher figure than had ever been incurred
by Swedish king before, amounting to a total of over nine
hundred thousand marks. A large part of this sum was
for foreign troops, hired that the Swedish peasantry might
"stay at home in peace, tending their fields and pastures,
and caring for their wives and children." When the
war was over and the mercenaries were ready to depart,
they had demanded with threats of violence immediate
payment for all the arms and vessels they had furnished.
Having no means to satisfy them, Gustavus had consulted
with his Cabinet, and by their advice had called
upon the churches and monasteries for a loan, "which
with God's help shall be paid, if all goes well." "Nor,"
continued the monarch, "was this tax in any way a
departure from the practice of former rulers, as may
be seen by referring to the ancient records.... Some
there are among you who assert openly or in private that
we have fleeced the churches and monasteries. This
we assert distinctly we have not done, but have merely
called upon them for a loan, which shall be paid....
We trust you will give no heed to such conspirators and
traitors, but will aid us in bringing them to punishment."
The document closes with some remarks upon the coinage.
"It must be clear to all," it runs, "that with the
enormous expenses which have been rolling up against
us we could not issue coins of the quality which you are
accustomed to of old. From sheer necessity we have
issued 'klippings' after the pattern of King Christiern,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
though his coins are now, thank God! departed from
the realm.... These 'klippings' are at present not
accepted for more than half their worth; and while
this has been strenuously forbidden, the only result thus
far has been that traders have refused to trade at all,
and have carried their salt and hops and clothing back
to Germany. We therefore intend at the first opportunity
to instruct our Cabinet with the most learned
men of the various classes to determine whether the
'klippings' shall be accepted for their present value or
for less; and whatever their decision, we promise faithfully
we shall obey."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>After administering this soothing drug, the monarch
turned his thoughts once more to the appointment of a
new archbishop. The letter despatched by the Cabinet
to Pope Adrian immediately after the diet of Strengn&auml;s
had proved of little service, for Brask on the 18th of
July had secretly sent a messenger to the pope with
word that Church property was being confiscated. Gustavus,
ignorant of the bishop's perfidy and wondering at the
pope's delay, now wrote again. "For a long time, Holy
Father," began the courteous monarch, "our cathedral
chapters have urged us to solicit you in behalf of the
persons elected by them to fill their vacant posts.
Trolle having resigned the archbishopric, the prelates
and canons of Upsala have chosen your legate Johannes
Magni in his stead; the canons of Skara have chosen
their archdeacon Magnus Haraldsson to the bishopric
vacated by his predecessor's death; and the canons of
Strengn&auml;s have chosen their provost Magnus Sommar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
The prelates and canons of Vester&aring;s, their bishop having
died, present the name of Petrus Magni for the post.
In &Aring;bo, though the bishop died a year ago, no successor
has as yet been chosen, that church having only recently
been captured from our enemies. As the persons above
named are satisfactory to us and to our people, we beg
you to confirm them as soon as possible, and thus avert
the danger to which vacancies in the episcopal office
would expose the Church." Whether or not the Chapters
had actually elected all the persons named, may well
be doubted, and is, indeed, of little moment; for their
spirit was by this time broken, and if they cherished any
preferences they dared not speak them. The letter was
intrusted to Johannes Magni with orders to obtain confirmation
from the pope and then return to Sweden.
But just as he was making ready to depart, the long-awaited
letter came from Adrian, though it differed
much in tenor from what had been expected. Instead
of urging the Upsala Chapter to choose a new archbishop,
it commanded Gustavus to restore Archbishop
Trolle to his post, threatening him with punishment if
he refused.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>This change of colors on the part of Adrian has been
accounted for in many ways. Johannes Magni himself
suggested that it was the work of evil-minded counsellors
in Rome. The more probable supposition is that
Adrian had been influenced by Brask. If Church property
was being confiscated, as Brask declared, Archbishop
Trolle could be relied on to offer much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
strenuous resistance than the prelate talked of as his
successor. But the very reason which induced the pope
to favor Trolle seemed to the king sufficient ground for
supporting his opponent. It was precisely because of
Johannes Magni's pliable and compromising temper that
Gustavus would have rejoiced to see the mitre on his
head. He was determined that Trolle, at any rate,
should not wear it. So he sat down, as soon as Adrian's
letter came, and wrote a warm reply to the College of
Cardinals in Rome. "If our Most Holy Father," he
said, "has any care for the peace of our country, we
shall be pleased to have him confirm the election of his
legate Johannes to the archbishopric, and we shall comply
with the pope's wishes as to a reformation of the Christian
Church and religion. But if his Holiness, against
our honor and the peace of our subjects, sides with the
crime-stained partisans of Archbishop Trolle, we shall
allow his legate to return to Rome, and shall govern
the Church in this country with the authority which we
have as king, and in a manner which we believe will
please God as well as all the princes of Christendom.
We beg you, however, to use your authority in the
Apostolic See in such way as not to harm our state, nor
give the appearance of championing the crimes of Trolle
against the tranquillity of a Christian people." Three
days after writing this vehement despatch, the monarch
sent off another, couched in language even more determined,
to the pope. "We shall never," he declared,
"allow that man to return as our archbishop. He not
only is unworthy of the priesthood, he is unworthy even
to live. We respect the Roman Church, and if need be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
would die in her behalf. But if she endeavors thus to
ruin our country, we shall resist her till the last drop
of blood is shed." This document was placed in the
hands of Olaus Magni, brother of the proposed archbishop,
with orders to inform the pope of the evils to
which the Church in Sweden was exposed, and to use
his utmost endeavor to secure the confirmation of the
bishops. The missive, however, never reached the pontiff
to whom it was addressed. Adrian was already
dead and buried ere the document was penned; and
when the messenger arrived in Rome, he found another
pontiff, Clement VII., seated in the papal chair.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The breach between the king and popery was now
open. Gustavus had actually flung down the gauntlet
at the feet of Rome, asserting that if officers satisfactory
to him were not appointed by the pope, he would
take the duty of appointing them upon himself. Still he
did not relinquish hope that the breach might yet be
healed; and on the 2d of November he wrote again,
this time requesting the pope to confirm the election of
Erik Svensson, a former secretary of Gustavus, to the
vacant bishopric of &Aring;bo. "And if your Holiness," wrote
the king, "shall delay in confirming the bishops-elect, we
shall ourselves undertake the restoration of our ruined
churches, and shall have the bishops confirmed by Him
who is our High Pontifex, that His Church and religion
may not be injured through the negligence of the
Apostolic See. Moreover, Most Holy Father, we hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
from certain men of Lubeck that one Francisco of Potentia
has returned from Rome to Denmark with arguments
in justification of that tyrant Christiern's massacre
of our bishops, and that your Holiness has rewarded
him with the bishopric of Skara. If this be true,
the Apostolic See has done us and the Church a
wrong equal in enormity to that of the Danish king,
and we shall by God's aid avert it if necessary with
our blood. Let not your Holiness fancy that we shall
permit foreigners to rule the Church in Sweden." At
about the same time with this letter the monarch, in
writing to Johannes Magni, uses even stronger language.
After suggesting that Christiern has so impoverished
the Church that it is unable to send its bishops
elect to Rome for confirmation, he asserts that it is
rumored the real cause of the delay is that the Church
has not been able to furnish the pope the customary
fees for confirmation. "Some assert, too," he adds,
"that there is no authority in Scripture for all the
dues that belong by custom to the pope.... So soon
as we find that our patience and moderation are of no
avail, we shall proceed to rigorous measures. We shall
not suffer our people to bend beneath a cruel foreign yoke,
for we are confident that Christ, who is our High Priest,
will not let his people die to suit the pope's caprice."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>These were bold words to use of the potentate whose
command all Christendom obeyed. The youthful monarch,
it was already clear, intended to rule his country
with an iron hand. When only three months on the
throne, he chanced upon some letters in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
bishop of Vester&aring;s alluded to him in arrogant and
contumelious terms. This bishop, who gloried in the
name of Peder Sunnanv&auml;der, had been at one time
chancellor of the young Sten Sture, and though elected
in 1522 to the bishopric of Vester&aring;s, had suffered the
same fate as the other bishops and never been confirmed.
Gustavus did not hesitate a moment. As soon
as the abusive letters reached him, he proceeded with
the entire Cabinet to Vester&aring;s, and summoned the
bishop with all his canons to the chapter-house. There
he laid before them the evidences of the bishop's guilt.
Unable to furnish satisfactory explanation, the bishop
was removed; and the Chapter, at the instance of Gustavus,
elected Petrus Magni in his stead. Even with
this, however, the monarch's vengeance did not end.
Knut, the dean of Vester&aring;s and a former chancellor of
Gustavus,&mdash;the man, indeed, who had been talked of
for the archbishopric of Upsala,&mdash;was indiscreet enough
to come forward at the trial with an apology for his
bishop. The monarch wanted no other proof of his
complicity, and discharged him along with Sunnanv&auml;der
from his post.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus was spurred on in his campaign against
the Church by a continued need of money to keep his
army in the field. Even after the subjection of Sweden
he had to carry on the war in Finland; and it was not
till nearly Christmas, and after he had sent a strong
force of mercenaries across the Baltic, that Finland was
subdued.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> After this the great bone of contention was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the isle of Gotland. This island, or rather its capital,
the town of Visby, had been in ages past the leader
of the Hanseatic League. Its situation in the Baltic, not
far from the east coast of southern Sweden, made it
still of great value to merchant-vessels passing between
Sweden and the Hanseatic Towns. When Christiern
fled from Denmark, Gotland was under the control of
Norby, who continued after his master's fall to make
depredations along the coast of Sweden and seize all
merchantmen that came within his grasp. Danish,
Swedish, and Hanse vessels were alike his prey, till
Gotland came to be known by all as a "nest of robbers."
Fredrik and Lubeck, unwilling though they were
that Gotland should fall to Sweden, welcomed any
movement intended to root out this impediment to the
Baltic trade, and raised no opposition when Gustavus
offered, in the winter of 1524, to attack the island in
the coming spring. The attitude of Fredrik to Gustavus
recalls the fable of the monkey and the cat. The Danish
king hoped ultimately to secure the chestnuts for himself,
but in the mean time was not sorry to see an army
gathering in Sweden to bear the brunt of the assault.
Which party first proposed an expedition against Gotland
is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> At the general diet held in Vadstena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in January, representatives from Fredrik were present,
and it was agreed that the expedition should be made as
soon as the harbors opened. The quotas to be furnished
by the different parts of Sweden by the first week after
Easter were also fixed. The Danish envoys, it appears,
made no promises except that a congress of the two
realms should be held on the 14th of February to settle
all matters of dispute. The passports for the Danish
envoys to this convention were issued by Gustavus on
the spot. They were never used, however; for just before
the appointed day he received notice from the
Danish Cabinet that they wished the congress to be
postponed. This action caused Brask to suspect that
Fredrik's sole object was to use up time. Whatever
Fredrik's object, the congress could not be held without
him. Gustavus therefore postponed it till the end of
April, and set about raising an army for himself.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The first person to whom the monarch turned was
Bishop Brask. It appears that there had been some
dispute between the bishop and one of the hospitals in
his diocese as to the tithes from certain lands. The
shrewd monarch conceived the notion that the simplest
mode of settling the dispute was to hand the disputed
property over to the crown. He wrote, therefore, to
both parties to send him at once the original documents
on which they based their claims. "And meantime,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
he said, "we forbid you positively to collect the disputed
tithes. Should you touch them, we shall be forced to
take further steps. We have, indeed, been told that in
the times of our fathers the crown received from the
canons throughout the realm one fourth of their tithes
under the name of 'the poor man's portion,' with the
understanding that the money should be used to found
hospitals, and over these hospitals the crown has ever
since held <i>jus patronatus</i>." To this demand Brask answered
that he would send the documents desired, but
that the crown had never taken the tithes from the canons
except by force. A few weeks later, on the 18th
of February, the king wrote Brask that the expedition
would start as soon as the harbors opened, and that, as
Brask had been one of the promoters of the scheme, he
must expect to contribute generously toward it, especially
since he and his diocese, being nearest to the isle
of Gotland, would be the ones most benefited by the
overthrow of Norby. Brask, in his answer of March
8, repudiated the idea that the expedition was the
fruit of his brain, and expressed the hope that the matter
might be settled without bloodshed. "'T is never
wise," he said, "to break down doors already open."
Brask asserted, further, that he had never received a
penny of rent from Gotland, but promised to do all he
could to obtain aid from the churches of his diocese.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>By this time it had become rumored that the king
was about to levy a new tax upon the people, and a
murmur of discontent had risen through the land. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
allay this, Gustavus issued several letters, declaring that
the contribution was to be wholly voluntary. One of
the convents he begged to send him all the silver collected
for a certain shrine, and offered to give the crown's
note for the amount, secured, if the convent wished it,
by a mortgage of certain crown fiefs. In writing to the
people of &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland he pointed out that the expedition
was necessitated by the piracies of Norby, who had
caused a dreadful scarcity of food by checking imports;
and he called upon the people to have a detachment
of armed men ready by the first week after Easter at
the latest, promising at the same time that as soon as
the fleet should put to sea the men would be provided
for at the crown's expense. To the people of Brask's
diocese he wrote that he had heard a rumor to the effect
that he was imposing a new tax upon the people. This
rumor the king characterized as "a palpable lie." He
declared further that he had applied the crown rents
to pay for the expedition, and had asked their bishop
to make a loan from his rents for the same purpose,
to which Brask had replied that he would lend the
money, but would raise it by imposing a tax upon his
churches. This Gustavus declared was not his desire;
all he wished was a free-will offering. From this letter
it is clear the monarch sought to cast upon Brask the
odium which this new levy had brought upon himself,
and it is equally clear that in doing so he exceeded
the bounds of truth. In calling upon Brask for a contribution
he had in no way specified the mode in which
the money should be raised; and Brask, so far from
refusing to apply his own rents for the purpose, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
distinctly stated, in every letter which he wrote, that he
would do his utmost to furnish the desired sum.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>A further cause of disaffection lay in the general
impression that the monarch was tampering with the
coinage. This impression had its origin naturally enough
in the fact that the general diet held in January had
repudiated the Swedish "klippings." The reason given
for that act was that, the Danish "klippings" having
been repudiated in Denmark the year before, merchants
were bringing barrelfuls of them into Sweden; so that
the Swedish "klipping," being scarcely discernible from
its Danish namesake, fell constantly in value, its fluctuations
depending upon the importations of the repudiated
coin from Denmark. In the Act repudiating the
Swedish "klipping" that coin was declared to be worth
four "hvitar;" that is, about one half of the amount
which the crown had received in issuing it. The outcry
which this Act called forth was universal, and the
king was forced to issue a letter to the people in which
he endeavored to allay their wrath. "We have never,"
he declared with brazen falsehood,&mdash;"we have never
altered the coinage either by raising or by lowering its
value, but have permitted each coin to pass for the
same value as it had before;" and he added with bland
simplicity, "the coin has fallen by its own weight."
The striking feature in this matter is the audacity of
the king. He trusted that the people generally would
not have access to the documents which we now possess
to contradict him. After issuing this mendacious letter,
he approached the Stockholm merchants, and, by certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
persuasive arguments whose nature it is easy to conceive,
prevailed upon them to deposit all their "klippings"
in the treasury, to be weighed and bought by
the Government at their actual bullion value. He then
began the issue of a new series of coins approximating
though still below their face value, and published another
letter, this time acknowledging that he had repudiated
the "klippings," but asserting that the step was taken
to comply with a suggestion made him by the people.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Late in March Gustavus received a note from Fredrik
requesting a further postponement of the congress till
May 15. As the Vend Cities were to be present, Gustavus
answered that he would communicate with Lubeck,
and so soon as he had word from her would give a definite
reply. He then despatched the Danish monarch's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
letter to Bishop Brask. The answer of that prelate was
full of wisdom. "I marvel much," wrote Brask, "that
his Grace should call a congress of these three realms
without first consulting you.... He must be well
aware that you cannot be present on so short notice,
especially since he knows that you are about to make
an expedition against Gotland. His real purpose, I
suspect, is to induce you to postpone your expedition."
In this surmise the shrewd bishop doubtless was correct.
Fredrik, though satisfied that Sweden should go
to great expense in preparing for an expedition against
Gotland, was reluctant to see her armies actually land
upon the isle, lest his own claims to Gotland might
thereby be lost. It seemed to him that Norby, terrified
by the armaments of Sweden, might be induced to go
to Denmark and yield the isle to him. He therefore
wrote to Sweden, requesting that the pirate be given a
safe-conduct through the land. But the army was already
in the field, and Gustavus answered firmly that he
would not comply with the request. To this answer
he was induced partly by a suspicion that Denmark was
already furnishing supplies to Norby.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th of May Gustavus despatched his fleet, eight
thousand strong, to Gotland. The command he gave to a
German adventurer who has already figured in this
story as Berent von Mehlen. This person, after breaking
faith with his former master, Christiern, had married
a cousin of Gustavus, and had become a trusted
counsellor of the king. By what traits he became attractive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in his monarch's eyes it is at this day difficult
to conceive. Certainly as a general he knew as little as
any general possibly could know. Again and again he
had been given opportunity to display his warlike power,
but thus far in every instance he had failed. He now
set forth, as admiral of the Swedish fleet, to besiege
the town of Visby. The siege began on the 19th of
May, and was enlivened during a few weeks by several
skirmishes. Nothing of importance, however, was accomplished.
The siege was protracted through the
summer, and at last the besiegers showed so little life
that their leader, the favorite of Gustavus, was reported
to have turned his coat once more and joined
the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Not yet had the siege begun when evidence was furnished
that Fredrik was in league with Norby. So
early as the 9th of May Gustavus wrote to Brask that
the Danes were rumored to be supplying Norby with
stores and ammunition. A few days later word arrived
from Fredrik that he wished once more to put off the
congress, this time till the 24th of June. Gustavus was
now fairly mad with indignation, and declared to Brask
that he would neither be present nor allow his envoys
to be present at the proposed congress. He was discreet
enough, however, to conceal his wrath from Fredrik;
and, without refusing the offer of the Danish king,
he called a meeting of his Cabinet, to which he urged
Lubeck to send her envoys. Fredrik in the mean time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
had been negotiating on his own account with Norby,
and had wrung promises from him which led to the
impression that Norby had thrown up his allegiance to
Christiern II. and was ready to accept the authority of
Fredrik. Elated by this false hope, the Danish monarch
felt in a position to ignore the slight that had been
put upon him by Gustavus, and sent delegates, apparently
unbidden, to the Swedish king and Cabinet, proposing
that a congress be held in Denmark to settle all
matters of dispute, the Swedish army in the mean time
to withdraw from Gotland, and Norby to be given safe-conduct
from the isle. These terms Gustavus rejected
with disdain, declaring that he had striven for the good
of all to scatter Norby with his "nest of robbers," and
would consent to a meeting with Fredrik only on condition
that in the interval Norby should receive no aid
of any shape or kind. Fredrik, finding that Gustavus
was determined, and that Norby's feigned alliance was
somewhat airy, yielded reluctantly to this condition.
The Swedish army continued in its camp at Visby;
and the two monarchs, attended by their Cabinets, proceeded
to the town of Malm&ouml; in hope of settling their
disputes. The congress opened on the first day of September.
The two monarchs with their retinues were
present, together with envoys from the Hanseatic Towns.
The meeting opened, as was usual, with an interchange
of courtesies and with mutual promises to resist their
common enemy, King Christiern. It was agreed, too,
that all renegades from either country should be returned,
and that citizens of one country should be entitled
to any property belonging to them in the other. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
soon, however, as the question of disputed territory
arose, it became clear that no conclusion could be reached.
It was therefore resolved, after long debate, that this
question be postponed, to be decided by a congress of
certain Hanse Towns, to be held in Lubeck in June of
the following year. Till then a provisional frontier
agreed upon by Norway, Denmark, and Sweden was to
be observed; and Gotland was to remain during the
interval in the hands of that party which held it on
September 1. If it should be found that Norby held
it on that day, he should be called upon to surrender
it to Fredrik, to be placed by him under the temporary
control of some person satisfactory to Sweden, Denmark,
and Lubeck. If Sweden should continue the war
in Gotland, she was to pay for all damage she might
do. Either party by violating these terms was to become
indebted to the other to the amount of one hundred
thousand guilders. This conclusion reached, the
congress was dissolved, envoys being first sent to Gotland
to carry out the terms. Finding that Norby was
still in possession, they entered into negotiations, and
soon obtained a contract, signed by Norby as well as
Mehlen, that each should withdraw his forces from the
land. In conformity with this contract Mehlen at once
broke camp and sailed with all the Swedish fleet to Kalmar;
but Norby, laughing at the credulity of his opponent,
continued to dominate the island, and began his
piracies afresh.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>This disastrous expedition caused a heavy drain upon
the Swedish treasury, an evil which the monarch sought
to meet by new demands upon the Church. On the 9th
of May he wrote to Brask that he must have more
money, and that the bishopric of Link&ouml;ping, being benefited
more than others by the expedition, must expect
to bear the chief part of the cost. To this Brask answered
humbly that he had already furnished more than
his proper share, but would do his utmost to obtain the
needed sum. This promise, however, did not satisfy
the king; and a few days later he sent a letter to Brask's
chapter, declaring that they had collected certain rents
belonging to the crown which must be yielded up without
delay. Brask appears to have been a special object
of the monarch's greed. On one occasion Gustavus
seized some tithes belonging to that prelate, and then
had face enough to write him that he had done so, his
only excuse being that the army was in need of food.
This high-handed mode of dealing with the Church is
in marked contrast to the monarch's complaisance when
dealing with the people. Before the common people
Gustavus grovelled in the dust. Every day nearly he
despatched some document granting new privileges to
this town or to that; and when the people of Kalmar
refused to contribute on the ground that their trade
had been ruined by foreign merchants, Gustavus sent
back answer that he would remedy this wrong. The
notion getting abroad in Brask's diocese that new taxes
were being levied, Gustavus insisted that the bishop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
should counteract this view, thus practically forcing him
to make the contribution from his private means.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>In spite of every effort to appease the people, discontent
was fast spreading through the land. To attribute
this entirely to the actions of Gustavus is unfair. His
expedition against Gotland, it is true, had proved a failure,
and had cost his country dear. The monarch should
have seen that, in the impoverished state of his finances,
the duty of destroying Norby belonged to Denmark or
Lubeck. But, granted that the expedition was ill-judged,
its failure certainly did not justify revolt. The truth is,
the Swedish people were so used to insurrection that the
slightest disappointment sufficed to set the whole country
by the ears, and no sooner was the expedition
brought to its humiliating end than the people began
to look about for pretexts for revolt. One of the first
cries raised against Gustavus was that he had transgressed
the law by admitting foreign citizens into the
Cabinet of Sweden. To this charge the monarch was
unable to make a rational reply. At the very outset
of his reign, he had displayed his first infatuation for
foreign men by raising Mehlen to the highest honors of
the state. Later another adventurer, one Count Johan
von Hoya, had appeared upon the scene. The king
had forthwith showered royal favors upon his head.
Scarcely two months after landing Hoya had betrothed
himself to the king's sister, and had been received by the
infatuated monarch into the Swedish Cabinet. Such a
course appeared to the people in direct opposition to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
promise made by Gustavus that he would drive out
foreign power. This evil, however, was but slight, in
comparison with others that the people had to bear. In
plain English, they were starving. The long-protracted
war with Denmark, followed by the brutal piracies of
Norby, had so reduced the supply of necessaries, particularly
salt, that few except the rich were able to get
enough to stay their hunger. Hoping to allay the people's
indignation in these matters, Gustavus called a
meeting of his Cabinet in October, summoning at the
same time two Link&ouml;ping burghers to advise the Cabinet
as to the best methods of improving trade. It is
worthy of note, however, that though the meeting was
expressly announced to be called for the purpose of
improving trade, the documents describing the debate
are devoted almost wholly to a consideration of methods
to augment the royal funds. The king, it seems, came
forward with a suggestion that, since he was likely soon
to marry, some, provision should be made for adding
to his income, and some steps be taken to reimburse him
for the sums advanced by him to carry on the war.
What he particularly wanted was the right to fix, according
to his own judgment, the amount of rents to
be paid by crown estates. He suggested, further, that,
since the pope would not confirm the bishops till they paid
their fees, his coronation should be delayed no longer, but
the bishops should perform the ceremony without the papal
sanction. He recommended also that, there being no
satisfactory place in which to keep the Swedish cavalry,
they be quartered in the various monasteries, "where,"
he added, "we find plenty of money, but very few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
monks." As to Hoya, he requested the Cabinet's sanction
of the proposed marriage, shrewdly intimating that
while he favored citizens of Germany, he believed no
marriage between a Swede and Dane should be allowed.
The answer which the Cabinet made to these proposals
shows traces of a feeble opposition along with a manifest
endeavor to accommodate the king. First of all,
the Cabinet advised the king to appoint a few of the
most intelligent and able debaters in the realm to represent
the cause of Sweden at the congress to be held
next year in Lubeck; and in accordance with this suggestion
the king named Hoya, and the new archbishop,
Johannes Magni. Regarding the matter of conferring
fiefs on Hoya, the Cabinet yielded to the king's desire.
"Though the law declares," they said, "that no foreigner
shall enter the Cabinet or govern land or castle,
yet we shall gladly see you grant him both castle and
land as you deem best, doubting not that you will so
watch over his and all other grants that your subjects
suffer not." In accordance with this concession Hoya
was given Stegeborg in fee, and his marriage with Margareta
was arranged to take place in January next. As
to quartering in the monasteries, the conservative element
prevailed, the Cabinet decreeing that it was not
advisable to fill the monasteries with horse and men.
That the coronation take place at once, the Cabinet
strongly urged, though they refrained from expressing
opinion as to the confirmation of the bishops. The
proposition that the king be given power to regulate the
royal rents was not rejected, but a hint was thrown
out that the proper step was rather to prepare an accurate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
list of all crown property and collect the rents as
due thereon of old.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Clearly enough this meeting would not satisfy a hungry
people. In fact apparently it added to their rage,
and we find the people of Dalarne at this time drawing
up a long list of grievances to be laid before the king.
Their first and weightiest complaint was that certain
rich men, stewards of the king, had bought up all the
grain in their district, and had made a corner in it so
that the poor man could not get enough to eat. Further
than this, they protested against the king's practice of
admitting into the kingdom all sorts of foreigners, "who
have put their heads together to ruin the common people."
This vehement lament aroused Gustavus to the
gravity of his position, particularly as he learned that
Sunnanv&auml;der was inciting the people to rebel. Hoping
to quiet matters, he despatched his messengers to all
parts of the kingdom with soothing words. He endeavored
in every way to impress upon the people that the
high price of food was due entirely to the war between
the emperor and the King of France; and as to
the repudiation of the "klippings," of which some people
had complained, he asserted that he had thereby suffered
far greater injury than his people. Sunnanv&auml;der's
conspiracy was the thing that caused him most anxiety,
and on the 9th of December he addressed the Dalesmen
on that theme. "Dear friends," he suavely wrote, "report
has reached our ears that Sunnanv&auml;der has gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
among you with plots to throw the kingdom into strife
once more. We beg you in the name of God give him
no heed. He has made statements about us, we are
told, which are absolutely false; among others, that we
are about to restore Trolle to his archbishopric,&mdash;the
man who deprived us of father and mother and threw
our kingdom into ruin. As we have called a diet to be
held in January, to investigate these charges among
other things, we request you at that time or earlier to
send representatives from every parish to judge between
us; and we hereby promise the said Sunnanv&auml;der safe-conduct
to and from Stockholm for this investigation.
You may make this proclamation to him; and if he
will not come, you may know that he is false....
Further, since we are informed that you are suffering
from great lack of salt, we have just despatched to you
between ten and twenty cargoes of salt to relieve your
want."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>While Gustavus was thus dickering with the Dalesmen,
a far more weighty matter kept him continually
on an anxious seat at home. This was the Reformation
of the Romish Church. It has been already noted that
the Swedish Reformation was a political revolt, and at
its outset had but little connection with theological dispute.
The conflagration that had raged in Germany
since 1519 produced no immediate effect in Sweden, and
it was not till the spring of 1523 that the Swedish
prelates felt real dread of Martin Luther. The father
of the Swedish Reformation was Olaus Petri, a blacksmith's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
son, of &Ouml;rebro. From his earliest years this
champion of Luther had been educated by a pious father
for the Romish Church. His childhood had been passed
amid the religious influence of a monastery in his native
town. There, with his younger brother Laurentius, he
had shared the daily routine of a monk. When a mere
boy his father, little knowing the temptation to which
his son would be exposed, had placed him in the University
of Wittenberg, where he sat for some years at
the feet of Luther. On his return to Sweden in 1519,
he was appointed to give instructions in the Bible to the
youth of Strengn&auml;s. Though only twenty-two, he already
showed such promise that within a year he was
chosen deacon of Strengn&auml;s, and placed at the head of
the school belonging to the Chapter. The opportunity
thus given him was great. The bishopric being vacant,
the charge of things in Strengn&auml;s fell upon Laurentius
Andre&aelig;, at the time archdeacon. Andre&aelig;, though fifteen
years his senior, was of a kindred spirit, and by a
contemporary is described as a willing pupil of the
young reformer. There can be no question that even at
this period Petri was regarded as a man of strength. A
portrait of him painted when still a youth shows in a
marked degree the traits by which he was distinguished
later. The face is full and round, with large, warm
eyes twinkling with merriment, and a high, clear forehead,
from which is thrown back a heavy mass of waving
hair. The mouth is firm as adamant, and the
sharp-cut lips and chin are eloquent of strength. Altogether,
it is the picture of just the man that Petri afterward
became,&mdash;a brilliant orator, daring, good-natured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and gifted with a generous supply of common-sense.
Precisely how much Petri owed to Martin Luther we
cannot know. It is not, however, likely that at first his
teaching in Strengn&auml;s differed materially from that inculcated
by the Romish Church. At any rate, he taught
four years before any serious complaint was made. The
first to charge him with heresy was Bishop Brask. On
the 7th of May, 1523, that much-enduring prelate wrote
to a member of the Upsala Chapter that a certain person
in Strengn&auml;s had inflamed the people by preaching heresies;
"and God knows," he added, "we are grieved
enough to learn that he is not silenced." What these
heresies preached by Petri were, appears from a polemic
hurled at the young reformer by Brask's deacon. They
include, among other things, a denial of the priest's
authority to solicit alms, with assertions that men
should place no faith in the Virgin or in other saints,
but in God alone; that the priest's first duty is to
preach, not pray, and that confession should be made
to none but God. Surely we have here the very essence
of the Reformation. Brask was already trembling with
apprehension, and despatched a letter to a brother bishop
to say that the heresies of Petri had begun to break
out in Upsala. "We must use our utmost vehemence,"
he gasped, "to persuade Johannes Magni to apply the
inquisition to this Petri; otherwise the flame will spread
throughout the land." Magni, it is clear, was deemed a
little lukewarm by such ardent men as Brask, and on
the 12th of July we find Brask pouring out a flood of
Latin eloquence to excite the tranquil legate. In nothing
is Brask's sagacity more manifest than in the enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
which he here displayed. He discerned with perfect
clearness that the battle must be fought at once. If
Petri should once gain the people's ear, all hope was lost.
Romanism was no match for Lutheranism in an open
war. He therefore sought to stamp out the new teachings
without allowing them to be fairly known; and
had his superiors shown equal zeal, the Reformation
might have been delayed.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>A few days after his earnest appeal to Magni, Brask
despatched to the Vadstena Chapter a tract in refutation
of the Lutheran doctrines, and along with it a
sermon preached by Petri, "in which," so wrote the
bishop, "you will observe his blasphemy of the Holy
Virgin." Brask, despite his spiritual duties, was no
ascetic, and, though suffering at the time from illness,
added a postscript begging the Chapter to let him have
a box of nuts. Apparently these delicacies came; for
the bishop's next letter, written to the pope, was in a
happier vein. "I have just had from Johannes Magni
a letter on exterminating heresy which fills my soul
with joy.... I grieve, however, to tell you that the
heresy which had its birth in Germany has spread its
branches across this kingdom.... I have sought to
the utmost of my power to stay the pestilence, but
through lack of authority outside my diocese, could not
accomplish what I would.... Give me your orders to
act outside my diocese, and I will crush the heresy with
my utmost zeal." About this time the bishop received
a letter from Johannes Magni that must have soothed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his temper. "God knows," the legate wrote, "how
eagerly I burn to effect the hoped-for freedom of the
Christian Church, had not circumstances been adverse.
I have at any rate pleaded with the king, and he has
promised to maintain our rights. He says that if any
of his soldiers wrong our tenants, they do so at their
peril. When I spoke to him of the burdens that had
been put upon us, he exclaimed with tears in his eyes
that no one felt it more than he, that it had been necessary
and contrary to his will, and that it was his full
intention so soon as peace was restored to refund the
money we had furnished. He promised also to repress
the Lutheran heresy, though he urged me to use persuasion
rather than force, lest by conflict of opinions the
whole Church be overturned." The impression left on
Magni by his monarch's tears is probably the impression
that the monarch had designed. We have no
reason to suppose Gustavus cherished any affection
yet for Luther, but neither is there reason to suppose
he hated him. What he hoped for above all else was
to keep the bishops under his control, and the surest
way to do so was to keep the Church at enmity with
Luther.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>That Gustavus played his cards with skill is manifest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from a letter written by Magni to the Link&ouml;ping
Chapter. "I understand," he wrote, "that you feel
little anxiety at my proposed return to Rome, thinking
that I have not shown enough energy in restoring the
disabled Church. I may say, however, that I have
pleaded and now plead for her before the king, who
protests that his whole heart is in her preservation,
and that any harm done by his officers to our tenants
has been done against his will. He says too, and with
tears in his eyes regrets, that the importunity of his
soldiers has forced him to lay burdens on the Church.
Nor is it his Majesty's intention to compel our weary
priests to give up the care of souls. His excuse for
exacting tribute from the churches to aid the kingdom
is that he undertook the war as much for the freedom
of the Church as for the safety of the kingdom. I give
you this excuse for whatever it is worth. His Majesty
promises that when he has paid the enormous debt
contracted to Lubeck, and has wholly freed the kingdom,
both clergy and people shall rejoice as never they
have rejoiced before. In the extirpation of Lutheranism
I am aided as much by the efforts of his Majesty
as by the authority of the pope. It seems to me that the
strife going on by letters among the clergy should be put
to an end, and more toleration shown. I know it will,
if continued, spread conflagration in other lands. The
clergy of Strengn&auml;s have promised me firmly that they
will abstain from all new doctrines, and will send out
no more letters unless they are harassed." This warning
from the legate proves that the Swedish prelates
were already cutting one another's throats. Apparently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
too, it worked like magic in quieting their disputes, for
six months now elapsed before the charge of heresy
was raised again.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st of February, 1524, Laurentius Andre&aelig;
returned to the assault with a long epistle to the Vadstena
Chapter. This epistle is moderate in tone, and
contains this sound advice: "His Majesty desires that
when you discover strange doctrines in the books of
Luther or of any other, you should not reject them without
a fair examination. If then you find anything
contrary to the truth, write a refutation of it based on
Holy Writ. As soon as scholars have seen your answer
and have determined what to accept and what reject,
you can preach according to their judgment and not according
to your individual caprice. I suspect, however,
there will hardly be many among you able to refute
these doctrines; for, though but little of the so-called
Lutheran teaching has come to my knowledge, I am
convinced that Luther is too great a man to be refuted
by simple men like us, for the Scriptures get their
strength from no man, but from God. Even if we have
the truth on our side, 'tis folly for us who have no arms
to attack those who are well equipped, since we should
thus do nothing but expose our own simplicity....
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Search
the spirit to see whether it be of God. I would urge every
one to read the new doctrines. Those who persuade or
command you otherwise, appear to me to act contrary to
the Scriptures, and I suspect they do not wish the truth to
come to light.... If there be any among you whom this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
letter offends, let him write to me, pointing out where I
am wrong, and I will withdraw my statements." Brask,
though offended deeply, scorned the challenge. Instead
of answering Andre&aelig;, he wrote to the bishop of Skara,
saying: "Certain persons are beginning to urge that we
should not banish Luther's writings, but should study
them carefully to the end that we may write against
them, as if, forsooth, we were simple enough to trouble
ourselves about the effrontery of Luther. He flatters
himself that he possesses greater wisdom than all the
saints. But we shall bow the knee to God, not man,
and shall do our utmost that the kingdom be not corrupted
by this new heresy." Brask was now boiling
with indignation, and a few days later wrote a friend:
"I have no fear of Luther or any other heretic. Were
an angel from heaven to predict his victory, I should not
waver."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>This feigned assurance on the part of Brask was not
deep-set. In the secrecy of his own cloisters he contemplated
the issue with fear and trembling. This is clear
from a letter penned at this period to the monarch.
"By the allegiance which I owe you," wrote the bishop,
"I deem it my duty to urge you not to allow the sale
of Luther's books within the realm, nor give his pupils
shelter or encouragement of any kind, till the coming
council of the Church shall pass its judgment.... I
know not how your Grace can better win the love of
God, as well as of all Christian kings and princes, than
by restoring the Church of Christ to the state of harmony
that it has enjoyed in ages past." The same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
day that this letter was despatched, Brask wrote to a
friend in terms which show that his anxiety was great.
After intimating that the king's constant demands on
him for money were probably inspired by the friends
of Luther, he exclaimed: "This party is growing all too
fast among us, and I greatly fear lest some new heresy,
which God forbid! may break out soon." As the king
appeared not likely to take very stringent measures to
repress the heresy, the bishop hastened to exert his own
authority, and issued a mandate, to be read from all
the pulpits in his diocese, forbidding the sale of Luther's
books and teachings. A few days later the monarch's
answer came. It was couched in temperate language,
but offered little solace to the bishop. "Regarding
your request," so wrote Gustavus, "that we forbid the
sale of Luther's writings, we know not by what right
it could be done, for we are told his teachings have
not yet been found by impartial judges to be false.
Moreover, since writings opposed to Luther have been
circulated through the land, it seems but right that his,
too, should be kept public, that you and other scholars
may detect their fallacies and show them to the people.
Then the books of Luther may be condemned. As to
your charge that Luther's pupils are given shelter at
our court, we answer that they have not sought it. If
indeed they should, you are aware it is our duty to protect
them as well as you. If there be any in our protection
whom you wish to charge, bring your accusation
and give their names." The method of trial suggested
in this letter was not in harmony with the bishop's
views. What he wanted was an inquisition, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
writing to a fellow-bishop he did not hesitate to say so.
"I maintain that every diocese should have an inquisition
for this heresy, and I think our Most Holy Father
ought to write his Majesty to that effect." The
mere prohibition of Luther's writings was of no avail.
As Brask declared to Johannes Magni, "The number of
foreign abettors of Lutheranism is growing daily, despite
our mandate, through the sale of Luther's books. I fear
the remedy will be too late unless it is applied at once."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>This letter was written on the 20th of June, 1524.
About the same time Petri was called to Stockholm to
fill the post of city clerk, and Andre&aelig;, already secretary
to the king, was made archdeacon of Upsala. This
double advancement of the Lutheran leaders left no
room longer to doubt the king's designs. From this
time forth he was felt on every hand to be an enemy to
the Romish Church. The striking fact in all this history
is the utter absence of conscientious motives in
the king. Though the whole of Christendom was ablaze
with theological dispute, he went on steadily reducing
the bishops' power with never a word of invective against
their teaching or their faith. His conduct was guided
solely by a desire to aggrandize the crown, and he seized
without a scruple the tools best fitted to his hand. Had
Brask been more compliant, or the Church less rich,
the king would not unlikely have continued in the faith.
The moral of all this is to hide your riches from those
that may become your foes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The part that Brask played in this drama calls forth
a feeling of respect. Artful and man&#339;uvring though he
was, there were certain deep principles within his breast
that only great adversity could touch. Of these the
most exalted was his affection for the Church. Apart
from all her splendor and the temporal advantages to
which her service led, Brask loved her for herself. She
was the mother at whose breast he had been reared, and
the feelings that had warmed his soul in childhood could
not easily be extinguished now that he was old. Every
dart that struck her pierced deep into his own flesh, and
a premonition of the coming ruin overwhelmed him with
bitter grief. It was this very grief, however, that raised
him to rebel. The old vacillating temper that he had
shown in days gone by was his no longer. Drear and
dismal though the prospect was, he did not hesitate, but
threw himself into the encounter heart and soul. From
this time forth, with all his cunning and sagacity, he
was the steadfast leader of the papal cause.</p>

made, Gustavus wrote to Brask that Lubeck still demanded
200,000 guilders, which was equivalent to about 300,000 Swedish
marks. This probably was an exaggeration for the purpose of getting
a generous contribution from Brask. Another source states it as more
than 120,000 Swedish marks. Svart, <i>Gust. I.'s kr&ouml;n.</i>, p. 72. This
clearly was too low an estimate; for we know that Gustavus paid at least
42,945 Lubeck marks (or 83,000 Swedish marks) in the course of 1523,
and that in the following spring the amount claimed by Lubeck was
about 240,000 Swedish marks. See <i>Kon. Gust. den F&ouml;rstes registrat.</i>,
vol. i. pp. 109-110, and the documents in the Archives at Lubeck cited
in Handelmann's <i>Die letzten Zeiten der hanseatischen Uebermacht im
Norden</i>, pp. 165-170. The matter is ably discussed by Forssell in his
<i>Sver. inre hist.</i>, vol. i. pp. 134-138. Much confusion is caused by the
fact that the debtor and creditor reckoned the sum each according to
his own monetary standard, and there can be no question, too, that between
the parties there was some dispute as to the exact sum due.</p></div>

Svart, <i>Gust. I.'s kr&ouml;n.</i>, pp. 64-65. Svart, whose chronicle was
written with a view to flatter Gustavus, informs us of the reduction in
the value at which the coin was
issued, and appears to attribute
this reduction to the generosity
of his master. It was "a good
fat coin," he adds, which merchants
carried out of the country
as an excellent piece of merchandise.
The zeal with
which the chronicler
defends the coin is
enough to raise suspicion
as to its true
value. If it was
really worth an &ouml;re
and a half, it is incredible
that Gustavus
in the strait in
which he then was should have ultimately
given it for an &ouml;re. Forssell,
in his <i>Anteckn. om mynt, vigt,
m&aring;tt och varupris i Sverige</i>, pp. 44-51,
suggests that probably the coin
was first issued for an &ouml;re and a
half, and then with the same size and weight but containing more alloy,
was issued for an &ouml;re. I think the true explanation is more simple.
Gustavus had been found out. The "klippings" which he had issued
a year before were such a palpable fraud that the Danish commandant
of Stockholm had actually forbidden their use, lest the Danish "klippings"
(which were about as bad as anything could be) might through
association with the others fall into ill repute. <i>Christ. II.'s arkiv</i>, vol. i.
pp. 214 and 218.
So that when he
issued a new coin
and called it an
&ouml;re and a half,
people were suspicious
and refused
to take it
till he reduced it
to something like
its value. This view is strengthened
by the fact that of the few
extant coins of Gustavus, dated
1522, not one contains enough
silver to have been worth an
&ouml;re and a half, and most of them
fall considerably below the value
of an &ouml;re. It is noticeable also that those stamped 1523, which were
presumably issued for an &ouml;re, contain a trifle more in value than those
stamped 1522, and called an &ouml;re and a half. As none of them have any
value stamped upon their face, it was a simple matter to start the figure
high, and then reduce it to what the coin would bring.</p>

that Gustavus undertook the campaign at the urgent solicitation
of Lubeck, who promised to defer payment of her loan for several years
without interest, provided Gustavus would undertake the war. This
proposition appears generous, but there is no trace of it in the contemporary
letters of the king. Those letters assert that Brask was
the prime mover of the scheme; but as Brask repudiated it at once, the
responsibility for it cannot be fairly laid on him. See <i>Kon. Gust. den

vary somewhat in phraseology. In the Royal Archives at Stockholm
is an official contemporary statement of the business transacted by the
general diet in January, 1524, which declares: "The 'klippings' were
in so far repudiated as to be valued at only four 'hvitar,' though any
person may accept them for what he will." <i>Kon. Gust. den F&ouml;rstes registrat.</i>,
vol. i. p. 182; and <i>Svenska riksdagsakt.</i>, vol. i. pp. 17-20. Svart,
<i>Gust. I.'s kr&ouml;n.</i>, p. 76, asserts that the diet "repudiated the 'klippings.'"
Tegel, <i>Then stoormecht.</i>, p. 81, says, "the 'klippings' were
utterly repudiated." In a letter issued by Gustavus to the people of
Dalarne immediately after the passage of the Act he says the diet advised
"that the 'klippings' fall so that they pass for only five 'hvitar,'
to which we and our Cabinet consented." <i>Kon. Gust. den F&ouml;rstes registrat.</i>,
vol. i. pp. 182-183. In a letter issued at about the same time
to the people of Vadstena, Gustavus made the same statement, except
that he used the word "four" instead of "five." <i>Kon. Gust. den
F&ouml;rstes registrat.</i>, vol. i. p. 184. The later letters of Gustavus, in
which he declares that he has not repudiated his coinage, are printed in

<p class="cap">BY the autumn of 1524 the whole of Sweden was in
a ferment of theological dispute. When Gustavus
returned from the congress of Malm&ouml; to the capital, he
found the people in a wild frenzy of religious zeal. The
turmoil was occasioned mainly by the efforts of two
Dutchmen, Melchior and Knipperdolling, who had renounced
their respective callings as furrier and huckster
to spread abroad the teachings of a new religious sect.
The history of this strange movement has been so often
told that it is hardly necessary to waste much time
upon it here. It originated doubtless in the stimulus
that Luther's preaching had given to religious thought.
As so frequently occurs, the very enthusiasm which the
Reformers felt for things divine led them to disregard
their reason and give their passions undivided sway.
One of the chronicles puts it: "Wherever the Almighty
builds a church, the Devil comes and builds a chapel by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
its side." The thing that most distinguished these weird
Dutchmen was their communistic views. They taught
that, since we all were equal in the eyes of God, we
should all be equal likewise in the eyes of men, that
temporal government along with class distinctions of
every kind should be abolished, and that Christians
should indulge in absolute community of goods. In religious
matters, too, they had peculiar views, believing
that only adults should receive baptism, and that all
adults who had been baptized in infancy should be baptized
again. By reason of this tenet they were known
as Anabaptists. Their first appearance in the Swedish
capital occurred at a moment when the monarch was
away. In that, at any rate, they manifested sense. The
capital was all agog with Luther's doctrines, and everything
that bore the stamp of novelty was listened to with
joy. Melchior and Knipperdolling were received with
open arms, the pulpits were placed at their disposal, and
men and women flocked in swarms to hear them. The
town authorities raised no opposition, believing the influence
of these teachers would be good. In a short time,
however, they were undeceived. The contagion spread
like wildfire through the town, and every other citizen
began to preach. Churches, monasteries, and chapels
were filled from morn till eve, and pulpits resounded
with doctrines of the most inflammatory kind. All
government was set at naught, and every effort to stay
the tempest merely added to its force. Finally these
fanatics made war upon the altars, throwing down statues
and pictures, and piling the fragments in huge heaps
about the town. They dashed about like maniacs, a witness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
writes, not knowing what they did. How far their
madness would have led them, it is idle to conceive.
Gustavus returned to Stockholm while the delirium
was at fever heat, and his presence in an instant
checked its course. He called the leaders of the riot
before him, and demanded sharply if this raving lunacy
seemed to them religion. They mumbled some incoherent
answer, and, the fury having spent its force, most
of them were reprimanded and discharged. Melchior
with one or two others was kept in jail awhile, and then
sent back to Holland, with orders not to return to Sweden
on pain of death. Some ten years later Melchior
was executed along with Knipperdolling for sharing in
the famous riot of the Anabaptist sect in M&uuml;nster.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The hurricane had swept past Stockholm and was
gone, but evils of every kind existed to attest its force.
Among the greatest sufferers from this fanaticism were
the partisans of Luther. Their attitude to the rioters
had at first been doubtful, and the condemnation heaped
on Melchior and Knipperdolling fell partially on them.
People in general could not distinguish between fanatics
and Luther. They were all deemed heretics, and Gustavus
was roundly cursed for neglecting the religion of
his fathers. To soothe the people Gustavus planned a
journey through the realm, intending to set forth before
the autumn closed. This journey he was forced by stress
of circumstances to postpone. He therefore turned to
other methods to effect his end. The strongest feature
of the Lutheran doctrine was that it purported to be
based upon the Word of God. To such a pretension no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
one but an unbeliever could object. Lutheranism was
opposed on the ground of its presumed basis in the
idiosyncrasies of men. Gustavus, confident that this
idea was false, resolved to put the question to a test.
Accordingly, among matters to be discussed at the Cabinet
meeting in October, we find a proposition that all
priests be ordered to confine their teaching to the Word
of God. The fate of this sound measure is not known.
It appears nowhere in the list of subjects on which the
Cabinet took a vote. A fair conclusion is that the question
was too broad to be determined at the time, and
therefore was omitted from the calendar by consent
of all.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus was determined, however, that the matter
should not drop. Convinced that any discord inside the
Church would be a benefit to the crown, he resolved to
hold a theological disputation, and selected a champion
from the two chief factions, with orders to appear at
Christmas in Upsala and defend the doctrines of his
party in open court. The Lutheran gladiator of course
was Petri, his opponent being one Peder Galle, a learned
canon of Upsala. The main points that were discussed
are these: man's justification; free will; forgiveness
of sins; invocation and worship of saints; purgatory;
celebration of vigils and masses for the dead; chanting
of the service; good works, and rewards; papal and
monastic indulgences; sacraments; predestination; excommunication;
pilgrimages. The battle on these questions
was fought, December 27, in the Chapter-house at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Upsala; and the chronicle tells us, somewhat unnecessarily,
that the fight was hot. Each party was struggling
for the very kernel of his faith. If the Bible
were acknowledged to be our sole authority in religious
things, the whole fabric of the papal Church was wrong.
On the other hand, if power were granted to the Fathers
to establish doctrines and methods supplementary to the
Bible, the Lutherans had no right to disobey. As Gustavus
was arbiter of the battle, there could be no doubt
of the result. Petri is asserted to have come off victor,
on the ground that his citations were all from Holy
Writ.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Flattered by this great victory, the Lutherans grew
bold. Though not so turbulent as before the riot, they
showed much indiscretion, and Gustavus often found it
necessary to interfere. What annoyed him chiefly was
their bravado in alluding to the popes and bishops.
The hierarchy of Romanism was fixed so firmly in people's
hearts that every effort to dislodge it caused a jar.
Especially in the rural districts was it necessary not to
give alarm. A single deed or word might work an injury
which many months of argument could not efface.
It is not strange, therefore, that the king was troubled
when Petri, in February, 1525, violated every rule of
Church propriety by being married publicly in Stockholm.
The marriage fell like a thunderclap upon the
Church. Brask apparently could not believe his ears.
He dashed off a letter to another prelate to inquire
whether the report was true, and finding that it was,
wrote to the archbishop as well as to the king, denouncing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the whole affair. "Though the ceremony has been
performed," he argued, "the marriage is invalid, for
such was the decree made by the sixth Council of the
Church." In his letter to the king, Brask used these
words: "Your Majesty must be aware that much talk
has been occasioned by the marriage in your capital of
Olaus Petri, a Christian priest. At a future day, should
the marriage result in children, there will be much
trouble, for the law declares that children of a priest
shall stand, in matters of inheritance, on a par with
bastards.... Even in the Grecian Church, where persons
who are married may be ordained on certain terms,
those already priests have never been allowed to marry.
Petri's ceremony is not a lawful marriage, and places
him under the ban, according to the doctrines of the
Church. For God's sake, therefore, act in this matter
as a Christian prince should do." On receiving this letter,
Gustavus, who had been in Upsala when the act
occurred, called for the offending preacher and asked
him what excuse he offered for violating the ancient
customs of the Church. To this the culprit answered
that he was ready to defend his conduct in open court,
and prove that the laws of God should not be sacrificed
to the laws of men. The king then wrote to Brask
and assured him that if Petri should be shown to have
done wrong, he should be punished. The king's own
prejudices are manifest in the words with which his
letter closed. "As to your assertion," he said, "that
Petri's act has placed him under the ban, it would
seem surprising if that should be the effect of marriage,&mdash;a
ceremony that God does not forbid,&mdash;and yet that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
for debauchery and other sins which are forbidden, one
should not fall beneath the ban.... In making this
charge concerning Petri, you appear elated at the opportunity
thus given you to censure me." This last insinuation
the bishop strenuously denied. "God knows," he
wrote the king, "that I have acted for your welfare in
this matter, as well as for my own. What joy I or any
other could feel in my present age and infirmity, I leave
to God. Petri has sent me an apology for his act. It
is full of words, but void of sense. I shall see to it,
however, that it gets an answer."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>These stormy scenes within the Church were but the
echo of what was going on outside. As the autumn
advanced it became each day more clear that Fredrik
had victimized the king at Malm&ouml;. The Swedish army
had retired from Gotland, and Norby with his horde of
pirates remained <i>in statu quo</i>. Brask, who had the interests
of Sweden constantly at heart, was the first person
to suspect foul play. So early as December 9 he
told a friend his fears had been aroused. Gustavus,
if he had suspicions, kept them dark. He opened correspondence
with Norby, hoping to inveigle him into a
conference in Stockholm. Norby, however, knew the
trick himself. The weather was such, he answered, that
he could not come. Some few weeks later Gustavus wrote
to Mehlen that the promises made to him at Malm&ouml; had
not been fulfilled. He also sent his messengers to Denmark
denouncing Norby's course. But all this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
his communications with Norby were filled with warm
assurance of respect.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The truth was, Norby cherished a project far more
ambitious than either Fredrik or Gustavus could suppose.
In January, 1524, the brave Christina, widow of
the young Sten Sture, had returned to Sweden after her
long captivity in Denmark. The same ambitious spirit
that had filled her breast in earlier days was with her
still, and she longed to see upon her son's head the crown
that but for his early death would have been worn by
her husband. This son, a mere boy of twelve, had recently
returned from Dantzic, whither he had been sent
as exile four years before by Christiern. He had disembarked
at Kalmar, and still remained there under custody
of Mehlen. In this state of affairs the piratical
Norby conceived the project of marrying Christina, and
then of conjuring with the name of Sture to drive Gustavus
out of Sweden. To this bold scheme Christina
apparently gave her consent. At all events, the news
of her projected marriage was spread abroad, and nothing
was done on her part to deny it.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Norby's chief anxiety was to get possession of the boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Mehlen had shown reluctance to give him to Christina,
and one might readily conclude his purpose was to hand
him over to the king. Such a purpose, however, Mehlen
seems never to have entertained. He preferred to
watch developments, and at the proper moment resign
his charge to the party that should make the highest
bid. The truth is, Mehlen had fallen into disrepute.
His pusillanimous conduct in the siege of Visby had
gradually dawned upon the king, and ere the close
of 1524 report was spread that Mehlen had incurred
his monarch's wrath. Though summoned to Stockholm
in January to the marriage of the monarch's sister, he
did not venture to appear, but wrote a letter to Gustavus
begging for a continuance of favor at the court. The
answer that came back was characteristic of the king.
Stripped of all its verbiage, it was an assurance that
the general report was wrong. Mehlen might still bask
in the smiles of royalty, and must pay no heed to public
slander. In confirmation of these sentiments Gustavus
induced the Cabinet to enclose a letter. "Dear brother,"
the Cabinet lovingly began, "we hear a rumor is abroad
that you have grown distasteful to the king, and you
are said to shun his presence in fear of danger to your
life. We declare before Almighty God we never heard
the monarch speak one word in your disfavor, though
we can well believe there may be slanderers who would
rejoice to see such discord spread. We doubt not you
will stamp out such discord with your utmost power.
Therefore we beg you pay no heed to evil messengers,
but come here at the earliest opportunity to the king."
This urgent exhortation meeting with no response, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
three weeks later the monarch wrote again, still with a
show of friendship, but insisting on the immediate presence
of the erstwhile favorite in Stockholm. So imperative
an order Mehlen dared not disobey. Proceeding at
once to Stockholm, he appeared before the king, and
soon discovered that his worst suspicions were not far
from true. The assurances of his monarch's favor had
been a blind to decoy the officer away from Kalmar.
On the 12th of March Gustavus removed him from the
post, and appointed another officer, Nils Eriksson, in his
stead. Anticipating that the change might cause some
friction, the monarch sent off a whole batch of letters
in explanation of his act. One of these letters, though
a trifle lengthy, is perhaps worth quoting. It is addressed
to the fief of Kalmar, and runs in this wise:
"Dear friends, we thank you warmly for the devotion
and allegiance which you, as true and loyal subjects,
have exhibited toward us as well as toward the kingdom
of your fathers. You will remember that last
summer, when we despatched our fleet to Gotland to
besiege Norby in the castle and town of Visby, and when
he found that he could expect no aid from Christiern,
he sent his ambassadors to take oath of allegiance to
Fredrik, King of Denmark. His purpose, which we
clearly saw, was simply to cause dissension between the
kingdoms, thus giving Christiern opportunity to come
forward and seize the reins once more. It appearing to
us and to our Cabinet unwise to permit a new war at that
time to spring up between the kingdoms, we proceeded
with delegates from our Cabinet to a congress of the
realms at Malm&ouml;. There we made a permanent alliance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
with each other and the Hanseatic Towns against King
Christiern. We agreed, moreover, that our respective
claims to Gotland should be left to arbitration. When,
now, Norby saw that the dissension which he had longed
for was not likely to ensue, he disregarded every oath
that he had made to Fredrik, and continued in his old
allegiance to King Christiern. He also feigned a willingness
to come to terms with us, if we would protect
his interests in this kingdom. This he offered, as we
have now found out, in hope of causing discord between
us and the Hanseatic Towns. He has, too, spread a
rumor among the Danes and Germans that we had
entered into an alliance with him against them. Of
any such alliance we assure you we are ignorant. Now,
as to Mehlen, we are told he does not wholly please
you. We have therefore recalled him from his post,
and made Nils Eriksson commander of Kalmar Castle
and governor of the town and fief. We beg you be submissive
and pay to him all rents and taxes which fall
due until we find an opportunity to visit you in person.
He will govern you, by God's help, according to Saint
Erik's law and the good old customs of your fathers.
If any among you are found encouraging dissension or
engaged in plots, we pray you all be zealous in aiding
Eriksson to bring them to destruction." Along with
this letter Gustavus sent one to the burghers in the
town of Kalmar. It appears they had protested against
the taxes imposed on them by Mehlen. There can be
little doubt these taxes were imposed by order of the
king. As matters stood, however, it seemed poor policy
to claim them. These are the monarch's words: "Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of your fellow-townsmen have let us understand that
taxes have been laid on you for which you are in no
wise liable. We have already written you that you
are to be free therefrom; but that letter, we now are
told, has never reached you. God knows we grieve extremely
that any such burden should have been imposed
against our wish and orders, and we hereby notify you
that we shall not claim these taxes laid on you by
Mehlen." Simultaneously with this document others of
like tenor were despatched to other persons to allay
their wrath.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>These summary proceedings of Gustavus made Mehlen
more ready to accept proposals from the other side;
and he was further impelled in that direction by recent
plots among the Dalesmen. The insurrection under
Sunnanv&auml;der, which the monarch had fancied he could
extinguish by a generous supply of salt, had not yet
yielded to the treatment. Indeed, according to the best
reports, the malady had spread. How serious the insurrection
was, appears from the frequency of the monarch's
exhortations. All through the winter he was
writing to the people, condoling with them for the exorbitant
price of food, and attributing all their evils to
the continuance of wars in Europe. The Cabinet also
addressed the Dalesmen, urging them not to ally themselves
with Sunnanv&auml;der, who was disgruntled, so they
heard, because he had not been given the bishopric of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Vester&aring;s. In one of his appeals Gustavus warned the
rebels to be still, lest Christiern might be encouraged
to return. The spectre of their gory tyrant seems not,
however, to have haunted them, and in February we
find that Knut, the deposed dean of Vester&aring;s, had joined
their ranks. To him Gustavus wrote a note, assuring
him that the archbishopric would have been conferred
upon him had he but done his duty. Knut, apparently,
did no great benefit to his brother's cause. Only a few
days after he arrived, his leader wrote archly to a person
who had loaned him funds, that he could stay no
longer in the land, for certain peasants were already
on his track, intending to capture him and take him to
the king. If these suspicions were correct, it was probably
as well for him that he escaped. Some two weeks
later these two scoundrels were both in Norway, waiting
for a more auspicious moment to return.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Whether their movements were in any way inspired
by Norby, is not clear. One thing, however, is very
sure. Whomever Norby thought could be of service, he
did not hesitate to use. In the previous summer, even
while truckling with Fredrik, he had been in steady communication
with Christiern, who was Fredrik's bitter
foe. And now, though every one believed him to have
broken with Fredrik, there was a story afloat that Fredrik's
hand was really behind the pirate's opposition to
Gustavus. No one could place the slightest confidence
in what he said. In January he started a rumor that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
he was ready to give up Gotland, provided the king
would grant him a like domain in Finland; but soon
it turned out that the whole project was a ruse. In
February he had so far befogged the intellect of Fredrik
as to induce that monarch to request of Gustavus a
full pardon for all of Norby's doings. It need scarce
be added, this ridiculous proposal met with no success;
and Fredrik, almost as soon as it was sent, had cause to
rue it, for Norby toward the close of winter sent an
army into Bleking,&mdash;a province ceded to Fredrik by the
Congress of Malm&ouml;,&mdash;and there spread ruin far and
wide.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The relations of Fredrik to Sweden at this juncture
are very strange. Though nominally at peace, the two
nations were utterly distrustful of each other, and at
frequent intervals tried in secret to cut each other's
throats. Their only bond of union was their common
abhorrence of the tyrant Christiern; and whenever Fredrik
fancied that danger averted, he spared no effort to
humiliate his rival beyond the strait. One instance of
his treachery was noticed in the comfort given to Knut
and Sunnanv&auml;der when they fled to Norway. The treaty
of Malm&ouml; had stated with sufficient clearness that all
fugitives from one country to the other should be returned;
and Fredrik, as king of Norway, was bound
to see to it that the treaty was observed. It cannot
be stated positively that he encouraged the fugitives
himself, but it is very certain that his officers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Norway did, and that he made no effort to restrain
them.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The share Christina had in this conspiracy is likewise
doubtful. So early as February Gustavus suspected
her, and ordered one of his officers to keep spies upon
her track. As a result one of her servants was detected
in treacherous proceedings and arrested. It appears,
however, that she did not merit all the king's severity;
for Brask in April wrote a friend, that the monarch was
treating her with undue harshness. She was widely
popular, and Gustavus would have been more wise had his
hostility to her been less open. "Nescit regnare qui nescit
dissimulare," wrote the wily bishop. Christina was not,
at any rate, on the best of terms with Mehlen, for her
boy was kept in Kalmar till the castle passed from
Mehlen's hands.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>This last result was not effected till a long time
after Mehlen had been deposed. Before leaving Kalmar
he had intrusted matters to his brother, with orders
not to yield the castle to any but himself. As soon,
therefore, as the new officer approached to take his fief,
the reply was given him that the castle would not be
yielded till Mehlen should return. After some three
weeks spent in futile negotiation, Gustavus wrung from
Mehlen a letter directed to his brother, instructing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to yield. This the monarch sent to Kalmar, April 8,
along with a letter of his own. Convinced that the
whole delay on the part of Mehlen was to use up time,
he instructed his messenger to warn the occupants that
if the castle were not surrendered by the 1st of May,
he would make them smart for it. In his letter, however,
Gustavus used more gentle language. "We have
kept your brother here," he wrote, "in order to protect
him from the populace, whose mouths are full of scandal
about our relations to him. From your letter it
appears you thought we held him in confinement....
We are minded to treat him well and kindly, unless we
shall be forced by you to treat him otherwise. We warn
you, however, we shall deal with Kalmar in the way
that we deem best, for the town and castle belong to
God, to us, and to the Swedish crown.... Our counsel
is that you obey our mandate, and the earlier you do
so the better it will be for you." Accompanying this
letter was a passport, similar to one drawn up for Mehlen,
to take his brother from the realm. He was not,
however, to be allured by passports or even terrified by
threats. The castle continued firm, and Gustavus began
to levy forces to besiege it.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>While these forces were being gathered, Gustavus
renewed his efforts to gain favor through the land.
This he soon discovered to be no easy task. Surrounded
by conspirators on every hand, he could not
turn without confronting some new rumor. Stories of
the most contradictory nature were set afloat each day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
At one time the report was spread through Dalarne
that he had cast Christina into jail. After that it was
rumored that he was sending despatches frequently to
Gotland, from which some persons caught the notion he
was in secret league with Norby. This notion was so
baleful that Gustavus felt it best to answer it. "No
one need think," he said, "we attach the slightest importance
to anything that Norby says. As he asked
us for a hearing, we have promised to let him have
it. He used smooth words to us, and we have given
him smooth answers in return.... As to these slanderous
stories," continued Gustavus, in writing to an
officer, "you are aware we cannot close men's mouths.
We believe our actions toward our people will bear
examination before both God and man." Such an examination
he proposed to make, and on the 25th of
March he sent out notice of a general diet to be held
in the early part of May. This notice contained among
other things these startling words: "If it shall happen
that the Cabinet and people then assembled believe the
present evils are in any respect the outcome of our
methods of government, we shall lay it before them to
determine whether they wish us to continue in the government
or not. It was at their request and exhortation
that we assumed the reins at Strengn&auml;s, and whatever
their judgment now may be, it shall be followed." In
addition to this notice, sent to all portions of the land,
Gustavus wrote to the people of Mora that he had
heard of a complaint from them that the kingdom was
going to pieces and that he was causing it. He assured
them that the rumor was untrue, and that he was doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
all he could to hold the realm together. When these
assurances reached Dalarne, the poor peasants of that
district were already starving. Half mad with hunger,
they called a mass meeting of their little parishes, and
drew up a heart-rending though unfair statement of their
wrongs. A copy of these grievances they despatched at
once to Stockholm. It charged the king with appointing
German and Danish officers to the highest positions
in the state, and with quartering foreign soldiers in the
towns and villages till the inhabitants were constrained
to flee. He had further, they asserted, laid taxes on the
monasteries and churches, and on the priests and monks;
he had seized jewels consecrated to God's service; he
had robbed the churches of all their Swedish money, and
substituted "klippings," which he then had repudiated;
and he had seized the tithes. Finally they charged him
with imprisoning Christina and her boy. The letter
ended with a warning that unless he at once drove out
all foreigners, released Christina with the others whom
he had in prison, and took some measures to better
trade, they would renounce allegiance to him. Gustavus
received this document while the diet was in session.
His answer to the people of Dalarne contained these
words: "We cannot believe this letter was issued by
your consent. Rather, we think, it was inspired by certain
wiseacres among you hoodwinked by Sunnanv&auml;der
and the like. That the purpose of these men is to bring
back Christiern we have definite proofs, not only within
the kingdom but without. Ever since Sunnanv&auml;der went
among you, letters and messengers have been passing
between Dalarne and Norby, the meaning of all which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
is that Norby is to attack the government on one side
and Dalarne on the other, and that we are to be dragged
down from the throne, which is then to be handed over
to Norby for the benefit of Christiern." This letter
reflected in some degree the spirit of the diet. The
main object for which it had been called was to spread
an impression that the king was acting as representative
of his people. It was not asked to legislate, and it
did not do so. Gustavus, however, went through the
farce which he had promised, and asked the delegates if
they wished him to resign the crown. Of course the
answer was a shower of plaudits upon the king. As
Gustavus modestly puts it, "The Cabinet and people
over all the land besought us not to resign, but govern
them hereafter as heretofore; and they promised obedience
as in the past, swearing by hand and mouth to
risk in our service their lives and everything they had."
With this seductive ceremony the diet was dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Ere the diet had come together, Norby had made a
second irruption into Fredrik's territory in the south
of Sweden. Toward the end of March he had sailed
from Gotland with twelve men-of-war, had captured a
couple of the strongest fortresses in Bleking, and had
enlisted many inhabitants of that province in the cause
of Christiern. Fredrik was by this time fully alive to
the error he had made in relying for a moment on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
promises of Norby. His anxiety was increased still further
when the news was brought him that Christiern's
brother-in-law, the emperor, had defeated the king of
France, and was coming with all his forces to the relief
of Christiern. One drop of comfort was granted him
when he heard that a fleet from Lubeck had sailed to
Gotland in Norby's absence, and on May 13 had seized
the town of Visby. In spite of this disaster, Norby's
hopes ran high. He sent letters every day to Christiern,
telling him that Denmark as well as Sweden was overrun
with rebels, and that he now had a chance of restoration
such as he had never had before. But Norby's
hopes were at the very highest when the bubble burst.
The emperor proved too busy with his own affairs to
send his army to the North, and Christiern could not
raise the armament requisite for a foreign war. Gustavus,
moreover, sent his troops to drive back the invader,
and the Danish nobility enlisted in behalf of Fredrik.
The result was that ere the close of May the pirate was
routed in two important battles. Gustavus literally
hugged himself for joy, and sent off a letter of congratulation
to the army that had won the day. "My good
men," he began, "you may rest assured that if Norby
shall escape you and come this way, he will meet with
a reception that will cause him little joy. From his
assertion that he expected aid from us, you will perceive
he sought to foster discord between your realm and us....
We had already ordered our men in Vesterg&ouml;tland
to go to your relief as soon as you should need them,
which now, thank God, we trust will never be." The monarch's
congratulation was a little premature. Norby's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
force was scattered, but it was not lost. Retiring with his
stragglers to one of the Danish strongholds, he ensconced
himself within, and there remained,&mdash;a constant menace
to the neighborhood. Late in June the pirate, reduced
to the utmost extremity, opened negotiations with Fredrik.
That monarch, still in dread of Christiern, readily
complied. Norby proceeded to Copenhagen, where it
was finally arranged that he should yield the castle
of Visby, which the Lubeck army had been besieging
ever since the town of Visby fell; and that in return
the pirate should be granted the whole province of
Bleking with all its strongholds, to hold as a fief of
Denmark. Norby was then conveyed to Denmark, and
before the first of August these terms were carried out.
Visby passed into the hands of Lubeck, and the pirate
returned to Bleking to guard his fief.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus, it need scarce be said, was vexed. The
congress which was to have been held in Lubeck to discuss
his claim to Gotland had been indefinitely postponed.
In place thereof, the island had been seized
by Lubeck, and Bleking&mdash;another of the disputed territories&mdash;had
been conferred upon a bitter foe. What
most irritated him was the close proximity of Norby's
fief to Sweden. He was at a loss, moreover, to understand
the king of Denmark's motives. "It may be," he
suggested in a letter of July 9, "that Fredrik's purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
was to secure Gotland, and then deal with Norby as he
pleased. However this may be, we must keep watch on
every side." The same day he wrote to another person,
"We are in no wise pleased to have Norby for a neighbor,
since we have noticed that he always seeks to do
us harm." Still, Gustavus believed in making a virtue
of necessity, and a few days later wrote: "We are glad
that hostilities between Fredrik and Norby are at an end,
and that the kingdom is once more on the road to peace
and quiet."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>This letter was written by Gustavus in his camp at
Kalmar. The castle there was still in the hands of
Mehlen's brother, though it had been under siege about
two months. Early in June Gustavus, unwilling to shed
more blood, had ordered Mehlen to proceed to Kalmar
and bid the castle yield. The confidence with which
the monarch even yet regarded Mehlen is astounding,
and the issue proved at once the monarch's folly. On
reaching Kalmar, Mehlen, after a conference with Eriksson,
was allowed to enter the castle to persuade his men
to yield. The following day, the portcullis was lowered
and Mehlen came out upon the bridge. But while he
pretended to be crossing, a portion of the garrison dashed
out of the castle and massacred a number of the people,
all unsuspecting, in the town. The alarm was then given
to the royal guard, and Mehlen's soldiers, finding themselves
outnumbered, retired across the bridge. Five
days later, Mehlen, with his wife and brother, scaled the
castle wall and sailed for Germany, leaving his wretched
soldiers to withstand the siege. If ever there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
cowardly, bustling, impotent, insignificant adventurer,
Berent von Mehlen was that man. During his two
years' stay in Sweden he had dabbled in every project
that arose, and he had accomplished absolutely nothing.
He had been the hero of a six months' bloodless siege,
that left matters precisely as they had begun; and he
had set on foot a conspiracy that had no object and that
ended in the air. It is a pleasure to dismiss him from
our thoughts. His subsequent career in Germany was
of a piece with his career in Sweden. He scurried about
from one court to another, endeavoring to raise an army
with which to conquer Sweden. But nothing came of
any of his projects, and after a short period oblivion
settled on his name.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus now learned definitely that Norby, ever since
his fleet left Gotland, had been in secret conspiracy
with Mehlen. He determined, therefore, that, since the
pirate had gained a foothold on the mainland, Kalmar
must be secured at any risk. So he collected men from
every quarter and sent them down to Kalmar to reinforce
the town. Some few weeks later, as the castle
had not yielded, he proceeded to the town himself.
The burghers, hoping the conflict would now be ended,
welcomed him with joy. But the garrison still believed
in Mehlen, and confidently awaited his return with aid.
Gustavus sent an envoy to the castle, to persuade the
garrison to yield. The answer was, the garrison would
not be yielded till every one of them was dead. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
one course, therefore, was open to the monarch,&mdash;the
castle must be stormed. This, with the guns which he
possessed, demanded almost more than human strength.
The castle was surrounded on all sides by a moat, beyond
which rose a perpendicular wall of masonry twenty
feet in height. This rampart was washed on three
sides by the sea, and on the other was protected by a
broad deep dike and then an outer wall. From within,
the rampart was guarded by eight huge towers that
stood out from the castle-walls, and the four corners of
the ramparts were further strengthened by four more
towers with apertures for crossbows, cannon, and muskets.
Such was the fortress that Gustavus, late in July,
resolved to storm. He began by throwing up a line of
earthworks, behind which he placed his heavy guns,
hoping to batter down the towers and ramparts, while
his pikemen and halberdiers were scaling the unprotected
parts. But his men at first were lukewarm.
The task seemed herculean, and every effort to ascend
the ramparts met with certain death. Those in the
castle fought like maniacs, the men with guns and crossbows,
and the women firing stones. Gustavus, it is reported,
stormed and swore, and finally put on his armor,
declaring that he would either have the castle or die
within its walls. His enthusiasm spread among his
men, and they shouted they would do their best, though
every man of them should fall. The effect was visible
at once. Each charge left the ramparts weaker than
before; and when night closed in, there was not a tower
or rampart whole. The next morning, when Gustavus
turned his culverins again upon the wall, the flag of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
truce was raised. The garrison hoped that if they sued
before the ramparts actually fell, they might be granted
favorable terms. But the monarch, who had now lost
nearly half his men, demanded an unconditional surrender.
As Norby had been conquered, and no signs of
Mehlen's succor had appeared, the garrison, after much
palaver, threw themselves upon the mercy of the king.
The castle, on the 20th of July, passed into the monarch's
hands once more, and a large portion of the rebel
garrison was put to death. With this scene the conspiracy
of Norby, Mehlen, and their adherents was at
an end.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h3>DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN POWERS. 1525-1527.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Negotiations between Fredrik and Gustavus.&mdash;Treachery of Norby.&mdash;Sunnanv&auml;der
and the Cabinet of Norway.&mdash;Overthrow and Death
of Norby.&mdash;Trial and Execution of Knut and Sunnanv&auml;der.&mdash;Debt

and the Lubeck Envoys.&mdash;Swedish Property in Denmark.&mdash;Province
of Viken.&mdash;Refugees in Norway.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE Swedish Revolution was the work of three
nations, all foes at heart, endeavoring to effect a
common object on utterly divergent grounds. Gustavus
wished to free his country from a tyrant's rule, while
Fredrik's purpose was to gain the throne of Denmark,
and Lubeck's was to crush her rival in the Baltic trade.
Without the alliance of these three parties, it is not
likely that any one of them could have gained his end.
So long, therefore, as the common object was in view,
each felt an assurance that the others would not fail.
It was only when Christiern's power was altogether
gone that this triple alliance was dissolved.</p>

<p>The varying hopes of Christiern may be gauged with
singular accuracy by Fredrik's show of friendship to
Gustavus. One cannot read the despatches sent from
Denmark without observing a constant change of attitude;
the monarch's feelings cooling somewhat as the
chance that Christiern would recover Denmark grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
more remote. At the moment when Norby returned to
Bleking, the movements of Christiern caused the monarch
much alarm, and his letters to Gustavus were
filled with every assurance of good-will. This assurance,
however, Gustavus took at little more than it was
worth. So long as Knut and Sunnanv&auml;der were protected
by Fredrik's officers in Norway, the Danish monarch's
assurances of friendship carried little weight.
Gustavus seems not to have appealed to Fredrik in this
matter till every effort to persuade the Danish officers
in Norway had been tried. He wrote even to the Norwegian
Cabinet, and begged them to keep the promises
made to him in Malm&ouml;. While in the midst of these
entreaties, a letter came from Fredrik asking for the
release of certain prisoners, among them Norby's daughter,
whom Gustavus had captured in the war with Norby.
This was the very opportunity which Gustavus craved.
He wrote back that in the same war in which these
prisoners had been taken, some guns belonging to him
had been lost, and he offered to exchange the prisoners
for the guns. He requested, further, that Fredrik command
his officers in Norway to yield the refugees.
While this answer was on the road, Fredrik received
a note from Norby, to whom Gustavus had written to
say that Fredrik had promised that the guns should be
returned. Fredrik, therefore, wrote Gustavus that these
guns were not in his possession, but if the Danish prisoners
were surrendered, he would try to get them.
When this letter came, the monarch was indignant.
Fredrik, it was clear, was playing with him, and hoped
to get the prisoners and give nothing in return. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
answer which the monarch made was this: "We have
just received your letter with excuses for the detention
of our guns and ammunition, along with a request for
the surrender of S&oslash;ren Brun, whom you assert we captured
in a time of truce. Of such a truce we wish to
inform you we are ignorant. He was lawfully taken,
inasmuch as he was one of Norby's men.... As to
our ammunition you say that it was captured from you
and carried off to Gotland. If so, it was no fault of
ours. We have written frequently about it, but have
met with nothing but delays. If Norby, who you say
has sworn allegiance to you, holds this ammunition in
Visby Castle, it is unquestionably in your power to order
that it be returned. So soon as this is done, the prisoners
shall be released." Before this determined letter
arrived in Denmark, Fredrik had modified his plans,
for news had come that Christiern's fleet was on the
way to Norway, intending to winter there and make an
incursion into Denmark in the spring. Fredrik, therefore,
despatched a note to Norby telling him to yield
the ammunition, and wrote Gustavus that the guns were
ready, and if he would send his officers to Denmark
for them they should be delivered. A few days later
an officer of Fredrik wrote Gustavus that property of
Danish subjects had been seized in Sweden, and begged
that the persons wronged be recompensed. To this
Gustavus answered that Swedish subjects had been
treated in the same way in Denmark, and promised to
observe the treaty if the Danes would do so in return.
He likewise wrote to Fredrik thanking him for his
action relating to the guns, declaring that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
send for them as requested, and as soon as they were
yielded would set the prisoners free.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>This amicable adjustment of their difficulty was on
paper, but much more shuffling was required before it
was reduced to fact. Gustavus feared that Fredrik was
in league with Norby, and rumor had it that Norby
was preparing for another war. Late in 1525, the pirate
wrote the Swedish officer in Kalmar that he had come
to terms with Fredrik, and that all the injury which he
had done to Sweden had been forgiven. To this the
officer replied: "I fail to see how Fredrik can have
promised that you may keep our ammunition." Norby
at all events did keep it, and early in 1526 Gustavus
wrote: "We hear that Norby has let fall calumnies
against us. We place no confidence whatever in him,
especially as he is growing stronger every day....
From his own letters we discover he has no thought
of giving up our ammunition." To Fredrik himself
the monarch wrote: "From Norby's letters we learn
he has no intention of obeying your commands." In
the same strain Gustavus addressed the Danish Cabinet,
and expressed the hope that Norby was not acting under
their behest. If the Cabinet's assertion can be trusted,
he was not; for several of the Cabinet wrote Gustavus
to keep an eye on Norby, as he was raising a large
force in Bleking despite their orders to him to desist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
There being little hope that Fredrik would force the
pirate to obey, Gustavus ventured to arrange the matter
for himself. It so happened at this moment that one
of Norby's vessels, laden with arms and ammunition,
stranded on the coast not far from Kalmar. The
monarch's officers hurried to the spot, and seized what
ammunition they could find. This stroke, however, was
in some degree offset by a reprisal which Norby managed
to secure upon the coast of Bleking. Matters
now appeared so serious that the king addressed himself
to Norby. "We find," he said, "that a part of
the ammunition taken from the wreck off Kalmar is
our own. All the rest of it you may have, provided
we are given the guns and ammunition promised us
by Fredrik.... As soon as these are handed over,
your daughter and the other prisoners shall be freed."
This proposition would have satisfied any man but
Norby. To him it seemed unfair. The fleet of Christiern
was looked for early in the spring, and Norby
thought by waiting to obtain more favorable terms.
He wrote back, therefore, that, though Fredrik may
have told Gustavus he should have his guns, he could
not have them, for in the treaty recently drawn up
between himself and Fredrik, it had been stipulated
that all injury done by him to Sweden should be forgotten,
and a part of this injury consisted in the seizure
of these guns. Norby closed his letter with an offer
to hold a personal conference with the king. The reply
which Norby had to this proposal was sharp and warm.
"We shall permit no nonsense," wrote the king. If
Norby wanted his daughter, let him return the guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"As to a personal meeting with you, we cannot spare
the time." Norby's pride apparently was not touched
by this rebuke. He wrote again, simply repeating what
he had said before, and in reply obtained another letter
from the king. "We have already told you," wrote
Gustavus, "that you may have your daughter when we
get our guns. We were promised them by the treaty
of Malm&ouml;, which we desire in every particular to observe.
And we will hand over the property belonging
to you in the wreck off Kalmar, if you will forward to
that town our ammunition together with a promise in
writing never from this day forth to wrong us or our
men." This letter, dated on the 4th of March, was the
last communication that passed between the pirate and
the king. Norby had at length discovered that he could
not dupe the king, and Gustavus deemed it folly to
continue parley with one whose only object was to use
up time.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Unable to accomplish anything with Norby, it was
more than ever important that Gustavus should be on
terms of amity with Fredrik. For the moment it appeared
that Fredrik would be fair. At all events, he
had made Gustavus a generous promise about the guns,
and his Cabinet kept Gustavus constantly informed
about the acts of Norby. In February, when the lakes
were frozen, the monarch sent, as Fredrik had suggested,
for his ammunition, and intrusted to the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
emissary a letter for the Danish king. This letter was
in reply to one from Fredrik, asking for the surrender
of a Danish refugee. Gustavus could not comply with
his request, for the refugee was gone; but he seized
again the opportunity to mention Sunnanv&auml;der. "We
earnestly entreat you," were his words, "to write your
Cabinet in Norway no longer to protect this man or any
of his party." It was certainly time that something
should be done by Fredrik, for at the very moment
while Gustavus was writing this appeal, the Norwegian
Cabinet were issuing a passport for the traitors through
their realm; and to a request from Gustavus for their
surrender, the Cabinet offered the absurd excuse that
the fugitives themselves protested they were innocent.
"However," it was added, "the fugitives will return if
they are given your assurance that they may be tried,
as priests, before a spiritual tribunal." In this reply
the reason for the detention of the fugitives leaked
out. They were high in office in the Church, and the
archbishop of Trondhem, with whom they had taken
refuge, feared the Lutheran tendencies of the king.
Fredrik did not wholly share this fear, and on the 4th
of March for the first time addressed the archbishop,
commanding him to revoke the passport of the renegades.
This letter producing no immediate effect, Gustavus
waited about six weeks, and then despatched to
the Cabinet of Norway a safe-conduct for the renegades
to be tried before "a proper tribunal," and, if adjudged
not guilty, to return to Norway. The passport was
directed to the Cabinet of southern Norway, to whom
the monarch used these words: "We marvel much at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the language of your northern brothers, and particularly
that they are deceived by the treachery of these rascals,
which is well known hundreds of miles from here, and
might be known in Norway if the people were not
blind. I might tell you how they lay a long while in
Dalarne, and in the name of the people sent deceitful
letters through the land, to stir up hostility against us.
But as soon as the people began to leave them, and
the Dalesmen announced that these letters were not
issued with their consent, they betook themselves to
Norway.... If, now, the fugitives will come before a
proper tribunal, we cannot and we would not refuse to
let them do so. We therefore send a safe-conduct to
guard them against all wrong, according to their request.
If they do not come, it will be manifest whether
they are innocent." The safe-conduct, it may be well to
say, ran only to the 10th of August following, and no
notice apparently was taken of it till near the expiration
of that time.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus now devoted himself to the task of fighting
Norby. The pirate had given the king of Denmark a
written promise that he would do no injury to Sweden,
but it was very soon apparent that this promise was
not likely to be kept. By the end of January Norby's
acts so far aroused suspicion that Gustavus ordered
spies to enter Bleking and discover Norby's plans. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
very definite information, however, was obtained, probably
for the reason that Norby did not know his plans
himself. He was waiting for intelligence from Christiern.
Late in March Gustavus fancied the pirate was
preparing to depart for Norway. A few days afterwards,
Brask wrote the monarch: "A report is spread
that Norby has seized some seven or eight small craft
and two large ships. I do not comprehend his purpose.
Merchants just arrived from Denmark add that
the Germans have handed Gotland over to the Danes,
though on the other hand it is declared that Lubeck
has sent a strong force of men and ammunition to the
isle." The day following the writing of this letter,
Gustavus despatched a note to Finland, with a warning
to beware of Norby, for the news had reached him
secretly that the pirate was about to make an incursion
into Finland. This was followed, after a week's
interval, by another letter announcing that Norby's fleet
was lying at anchor, all ready to set sail. The monarch's
apprehensions proved to be unfounded. Norby
had important business nearer home. Christiern had not
wintered in Norway, as some persons had supposed he
would, but had continued his efforts to raise a force in
Holland. His efforts had been attended with some
measure of success, and early in May the Swedish Cabinet
had word that Christiern had despatched a force
of seven or eight thousand men under Gustaf Trolle
to make an attack on Denmark. While this fleet was
believed to be under sail, the tortuous Norby wrote
to Denmark that he was ready to sacrifice his life for
Fredrik, and took the opportunity to charge Gustavus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with every sort of crime. The expedition of Christiern
appears to have miscarried, but it so startled
Fredrik that he hastened to rid himself of his doubtful
ally, Norby. On pretence of wanting an escort for his
daughter, about to sail for Prussia, he asked the pirate
to come to Copenhagen. Norby, willing though he was
to sacrifice his life for Fredrik, thought he scented bait.
He could not go, he said, unless he did so in his own
vessel attended by seven hundred of his men, and as an
additional guaranty demanded at the outset that his men
be paid. This was a little more than Fredrik could
digest. His answer was a letter to Gustavus, declaring
that the pirate was in constant communication with
Christiern, and meantime spared no efforts to stir up
discord between Gustavus and himself. He was now
preparing with a fleet and body of seven hundred men
to make an incursion into Sweden. Should this occur,
Gustavus might rely upon the aid of Fredrik. For this
generous assurance Gustavus in his answer thanked the
king, and promised, in return, that if the pirate should
make war on Denmark, Fredrik might count on him.
Despite these mutual promises of fidelity, neither party
relied much on the other. Gustavus, in a letter to his
Cabinet in Finland, openly declared his discontent with
Fredrik. However, a common danger kept the allies
together, and early in August Gustavus sent a fleet to
Kalmar Sound with orders to make an incursion into
Bleking on the north, at the same moment that Fredrik's
fleet was attacking Norby from the south. For some
reason Fredrik did not hear of the Swedish movement
till the day was won. On August 24 the Danish and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Lubeck fleets were lying off the coast of Bleking, and,
thinking that an attack would soon be made by land,
bore down upon the fleet of Norby. It was an unequal
contest, and the allied fleets were victorious. Seven of
Norby's vessels were captured, with four hundred of his
men. The conquerors then entered Bleking, and placed
the district once more under Danish rule. Norby himself
escaped across the Baltic Sea to Russia. There he
expected to enlist the grand duke in a war against
Gustavus. He found, however, that he had mistaken
the opinions of his host. The grand duke threw him
into prison, where he remained two years. At the end
of that time he was set at liberty by request of Charles
V., under whose banner he then enlisted. After serving
about a year, he was killed outside the walls of Florence,
whither he had been sent with the emperor's forces to
storm the town. "Such was the end," so runs the
chronicle, "of one who in his palmy days had called
himself a friend of God and an enemy to every man."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Meantime matters had progressed to some extent with
Norway. On the 22d of July, the passport issued for
the refugees having nearly expired without intimation
that it would be used, Gustavus wrote to Fredrik: "Sunnanv&auml;der
and the other fugitives are still maintained with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
honor in Norway, and are continually plotting new revolt.
They receive especial favor from the archbishop
of Trondhem, who is said to have appointed one of them
his deacon. We have written frequently about them to
the Cabinet of Norway, but the more we write the more
honor they receive." This charge was proved by subsequent
events to be a trifle hasty. Scarce had the
letter been despatched when Knut, who was probably
the least guilty of the two conspirators, arrived. He
came by order of the archbishop of Trondhem, and
along with him came a letter from the archbishop, declaring
that, as the king had promised the fugitives they
should be tried by prelates of the Church, one of them
was surrendered. Sunnanv&auml;der would likewise have
been handed over but that he was ill. The archbishop
closed by urging Gustavus to show mercy. It
is to be noted that the king had never promised that
the tribunal should consist of prelates. What he had
said was that they should be tried before a "proper
tribunal." Doubtless it was customary that priests
should not be tried by laymen, but the practice was not
invariably followed, and the language of the passport
was enough to throw the conspirators on their guard.
In a case of conspiracy against the crown, the Swedish
Cabinet would seem to be a proper tribunal, and as a
matter of fact it was before the Cabinet that this case
was tried. The Cabinet consisted of the archbishop of
Upsala, three bishops, and eight laymen. Their decree
was, in the first place, that the passport did not protect
Knut from trial, and secondly, that he was guilty of
conspiracy against the crown. The decree was dated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
August 9. On that very day the king of Denmark
wrote Gustavus that he had ordered the archbishop of
Trondhem to give no shelter to the traitors, and added:
"We are told that you are ready to promise them a trial
before yourself and the Swedish Cabinet, after which
they shall be permitted to go free." Gustavus had never
promised that they should go free, and it was preposterous
for anybody to expect it. The only object of the
trial was to give the traitors an opportunity to prove
their innocence, and if they failed to do so, it was only
fair that they should suffer. As soon as the decree was
signed, Gustavus wrote the archbishop of Trondhem that
Knut had been found guilty, but that his life should be
spared to satisfy the archbishop, at any rate until Gustavus
could learn what the archbishop proposed to do
with the other refugees. A similar letter was sent also
by the Cabinet, declaring that "many serious charges
were made against Knut, which he was in no way able
to disprove." One of the Cabinet members, who had
been asked by the archbishop to intercede for Knut,
wrote back: "His crime is so enormous and so clearly
proved by his own handwriting, that there is no hope for
him unless by the grace of God or through your intercession."
Even Brask wrote: "He has won the king's
ill-favor in many ways, for which he can offer no defence."
Against such a pressure of public opinion the
archbishop of Trondhem dared no longer stand, and on
the 22d of September despatched Sunnanv&auml;der to the
king, adding, with the mendacity of a child, that he had
detained him in Norway only in order that he might
not flee. Gustavus, with grim humor, thanked him for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
his solicitude, and begged him now to return all other
refugees. Sunnanv&auml;der was kept in jail till the 18th of
February, 1527. He was then brought before a tribunal
consisting of the entire Chapter of Upsala, two bishops,
and a number of laymen. The king produced some
sixty letters written by the traitor, establishing his conspiracy
beyond the shadow of a doubt. He was condemned
at once, and executed the same day outside the
Upsala walls. Three days later, his accomplice, Knut,
was similarly put to death in Stockholm. Thus ended a
conspiracy which had cost the monarch infinite annoyance,
and which during a period of three years had been
a constant menace to the realm.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>What most annoyed the king at this time was the
importunate demands of Lubeck. Ever since Gotland,
in the summer of 1525, had fallen into the hands of
Lubeck, Gustavus had appreciated the necessity of keeping
the Hanseatic town in check. So early as August of
that year the monarch wrote Laurentius Andre&aelig;: "You
have advised us to cling to Lubeck and place no confidence
in the Danes, since they have always played us false.
We are not sure, however, that even Lubeck can be
trusted, for we have no certainty what she has in mind,
especially as she is sheltering in Gotland that outspoken
traitor, Mehlen." The Swedish envoys, who had arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in Lubeck too late to meet the Danes, as had been agreed
in Malm&ouml;, seem to have reached no terms with Lubeck,
and, when they returned to Sweden in September, Gotland
was in Lubeck's hands, and Lubeck had announced
her purpose of defending Mehlen. Her strongest hold
on Sweden lay in the fact that Sweden was still her
debtor in a very large amount. Early in 1526 this burden
had become so great that the Cabinet passed an act
decreeing that two thirds of all the tithes accrued for
the year just ended should be surrendered by the Church
to meet the nation's debt. The announcement of this
levy made Lubeck for the moment more importunate than
before. Believing that the money would soon be pouring
in, she kept her envoys constantly dogging the monarch's
steps, and in the month of April Gustavus wrote:
"Our creditors will scarce permit us to leave the castle-gate."
They were, therefore, as greatly disappointed as
Gustavus when the money did not come. In June Gustavus
wrote that he had got together ten thousand marks,&mdash;a
mere nothing,&mdash;and that Lubeck had written to demand
immediate payment of the whole. "Her envoys
have now closed our doors so tight that it is hardly
possible for us to go out." It was clear that some new
scheme must be devised, and on the 23d of June the
king applied to certain members of his Cabinet. "We
have now," he wrote, "as frequently before, had letters
from Lubeck demanding in curt language the payment
of her debt. You are aware that we have often, especially
in Cabinet meetings, asked you to suggest some
mode of meeting this requirement, and have never yet
been able to elicit any tangible response. Indeed, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
have not had the matter much at heart, but have rather
left it to be arranged by us. You have, it is true, suggested
that the tithes be used, but we find that, though
we much relied upon them, they are but a tittle. Our
entire taxes for last year, including iron, skins, butter,
salmon, amounted to somewhat over ten thousand
marks. This sum, which would naturally be used to
pay the expenses of our court, has been handed over
to pay the debt. The tithes received, which we were
assured would be a considerable sum, are shown by our
books not to have exceeded two thousand marks in all.
The treasury balance has now run so low that we have
but a trifle left, and our soldiers, who are now much
needed to keep off Christiern and Norby, must be paid.
We therefore beg you take this matter seriously to heart,
and devise some means by which the debt may soon be
paid.... It is utterly impossible from the taxes alone
to keep an army and pay this heavy debt, for the taxes
are no greater than they were some years ago, though
the expenses are very much increased; and, moreover,
we have no mines to turn to, as our fathers had." This
urgent appeal inspired the Cabinet to act, and at a meeting
held in August they provided that a new tax be laid
on every subject in the realm. In the table that accompanied
this Act, the amounts to be contributed by the
different provinces were accurately fixed, as well as the
amounts to be collected in the towns. The bishops, too,
were called upon to furnish each his quota, based upon
an estimate of his means: the archbishop of Upsala
paying four thousand marks, the bishop of &Aring;bo three
thousand marks, Link&ouml;ping two thousand five hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
marks, Skara and Strengn&auml;s each two thousand marks,
Vester&aring;s one thousand marks, and Vexi&ouml; five hundred
marks. The amount imposed on &Aring;bo seems unreasonably
large, which is probably to be accounted for by the
fact that &Aring;bo was not present at the meeting. Brask,
in writing to &Aring;bo, told the bishop that his quota was
three thousand marks, but did not name to him the
individual amounts to be contributed by the other bishops.
Gustavus, in a letter to the members of his Cabinet
in Finland, was even more unfair. He told them
that &Aring;bo was to pay three thousand marks, and added
that Link&ouml;ping and Skara were to pay the same. Brask's
letter is particularly important in that it puts the balance
of the debt to Lubeck at forty-five thousand Lubeck
marks, equivalent to ninety thousand Swedish marks,
of which amount the archbishop and bishops were expected
to raise fifteen thousand marks. Brask, with his
usual shrewdness, urged the king to pay the debt that
autumn, and thus get rid of Lubeck before the winter
came. Gustavus doubtless shared with him this view,
but there were several grave difficulties in the way.
Early in October the monarch held a conference with
the Lubeck envoys, and found the balance, as they figured
it, to be larger than he had supposed. Moreover,
the peasants in the north of Sweden declared they could
not spare the funds, and urged Gustavus to postpone the
levy till a more convenient time. So that at the close
of 1526 the Lubeck envoys were still clamoring for their
pay.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>The cramped position in which Gustavus was held by
Lubeck made it of great importance that he should be
on amicable terms with other powers. So early as 1523,
he had sent ambassadors to Russia to ratify the treaty
made by Sture. They had returned, however, with announcement
that the grand duke's envoys would come
to Stockholm and arrange the terms. This promise had
never been fulfilled. As soon, therefore, as opportunity
was found, the monarch prepared to send ambassadors
again. The person to whom the matter was intrusted
was the monarch's brother-in-law, Johan von Hoya. In
November, 1525, this officer, who had just returned from
an expedition to Lubeck, set sail for Finland, where he
already had been granted fiefs, with orders to determine
whether or not it was desirable that the embassy should
go. Considerable delay ensued because Gustavus was in
want of funds. He thought that since the expedition
would be mainly for the benefit of Finland, the cost of
sending it should be borne by her. It was, therefore,
not till May of 1526, when Russian depredations became
unbearable in Finland, that an arrangement could be
made. Envoys then were sent to Moscow, and presented
to the grand duke a letter from Gustavus under
date of 20th of May. In this document the monarch
stated that his envoys had once before been sent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Moscow to ratify the treaty made with Sture, but for
some reason had never reached the capital. Since then
great injury had been done in Finland by Russian subjects.
Gustavus desired, therefore, to renew the treaty,
and begged the grand duke to recompense his subjects,
and also to make known to him in what towns in Russia
his subjects would be allowed to trade. This letter
appears to have been some months upon the road, for
the grand duke's answer was not given till the 2d of
September. In this answer he declared that the previous
embassy of Gustavus had held a conference with
Russian envoys, and by them the treaty made with
Sture had been ratified. Swedish merchants were allowed
to trade in all the towns of Russia, and all
wrongs done to Swedish subjects should be punished
and the persons injured recompensed. On the other
hand, he should expect Gustavus to punish his own
subjects for wrongs which they had done in Russia, and
all buildings by them erected on Russian soil must be
torn down. While the Swedish envoys were returning
with this letter, Norby reached the grand duke and
complained that Swedes had injured Russian subjects
in Lapland. The grand duke therefore ordered that
Gustavus be notified of the complaint, and asked to
punish the offenders if the charge were true. When
the embassy returned to Sweden, and the monarch
found they had not yet obtained the grand duke's seal,
he resolved to go to Finland in the spring of 1527 and
meet the Russian emissaries there. This plan, however,
was given up for lack of funds, and the Russian emissaries
were asked to meet the king in Stockholm. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
offer was accepted, the emissaries came, and after an
elaborate exchange of costly presents, both parties
signed a ratification of the treaty made for seventy
years with Sture. The ratification was dated on the
26th of May.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The main reason why Gustavus dreaded a rupture
between himself and Lubeck was that it would cause
great injury to his commerce. Immediately after his
election in 1523, the monarch in a moment of enthusiasm
had conferred on Lubeck, Dantzic, and their allies
a perpetual monopoly of Swedish trade. In an earlier
century, when these so-called Vend Cities controlled the
Baltic trade, Lubeck would have claimed the monopoly
even without a grant. But another branch of the Hanse
Towns had ere this grown up in Holland, with a power
so formidable that the Vend Cities dared not assert their
claim. So long, however, as the privileges granted Lubeck
were unrepealed, the Dutch Towns were reluctant
to incur her enmity by sending ships to Sweden. The
result was that practically all imports came from Lubeck,
and when relations between that city and Gustavus
became a trifle strained, great difficulty was experienced
in obtaining food. To remedy this evil, the envoys sent
to Lubeck in 1525, finding themselves too late for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
congress with the Danes, entered into negotiations with
the Dutch envoys that happened to be there. They
found at once that Holland wished to trade in Sweden,
and was ready to do so if the terms could be arranged.
As a provisional measure, the ambassadors on both
sides promised, August 17, that the two nations should
remain at peace during the next three years, and before
the end of that time another congress should be held
to make a more systematic treaty. It was agreed further
that in the coming autumn a consignment of salt
and other wares should be forwarded by the Dutch to
Sweden. Apparently this consignment did not come
till the spring of 1526, but both parties were eager to
arrange a treaty, and it was agreed that a congress for
this purpose should be held in Bremen, May 20, 1526.
This congress was afterwards postponed, though the
Swedish envoy brought a ratification of the former treaty
signed by Gustavus under date of May 12, 1526, and
promised further that salt should be admitted into
Sweden free. A similar ratification was signed by
Charles V., Sept. 19, 1526. This accomplished, Holland
opened negotiations with Sweden to the end that all
articles of commerce be placed upon the free-list along
with salt; and she requested further that all the Swedish
harbors be open to her ships. So ambitious a
proposal terrified Gustavus. He would have been rejoiced
to grant it, but he feared by doing so to irritate
Lubeck. It is somewhat amusing to trace the steps by
which he convinced himself that such a course was
right. Brask, as usual, was the first to question whether
Lubeck would consent. On the 9th of December, 1526,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
he wrote: "I advocate the treaty, but I doubt much
whether Lubeck will not raise objections, for she has
wished to have the Baltic to herself." A few days later
Gustavus put out a feeler to his Cabinet in the south of
Sweden. "So far as we know," he wrote with caution,
"our relations with Lubeck and the Vend Cities do not
forbid this treaty." By the spring of 1527 he had grown
more confident of his position, and wrote as follows:
"The provisional arrangement made with Holland has
proved greatly to our advantage. We now desire to
make a perpetual treaty with her before Whitsunday
next, and for this purpose recommend that Olaus Magni
be sent at once to Amsterdam." Two weeks after this
he added: "The privileges which the German cities
wrung from us in Strengn&auml;s are so grinding that we can
no longer adhere to them in all their points." On the
22d of April the monarch had so far removed his doubts
as to commission Magni to negotiate the treaty, and
he intrusted him with a written promise over the royal
signature and seal, conferring on Holland, Brabant, Zealand,
and East and West Friesland the right to enter all
the Swedish rivers and harbors, on payment of the customary
duties. It is noticeable that in this document
Gustavus did not remit the duties, as had been desired,
nor even promise that salt should be admitted free; and
in the letter to his envoy the diplomatic monarch used
these words: "Do not be too liberal, especially in the
matter of duties. If they really insist upon free-trade,
you must discreetly avoid promising it, and suggest that
probably the privilege will be granted them as a favor."
Brask, who feared lest these negotiations might cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
trouble, hastened to throw a favorable light upon his
own position. "You will remember," he wrote his
fellow-counsellors, "that I opposed the grant of these
great privileges to Lubeck, believing them injurious to
the welfare of our people." Magni, in conformity with
the king's injunctions, proceeded to the town of Ghent,
where he was given an audience of Margaret, regent of
the Netherlands. As soon as the letters of May 12,
1526, and April 18, 1527, were translated for her, she
raised a number of objections, chief of which were that
the latter letter did not provide that salt should be
admitted free, and did not seem to open to her vessels
all the Swedish ports. To these objections Magni answered
that certain harbors were made ports of entry
out of convenience to Gustavus, and as to duties, Magni
seems to have assured her that they would probably be
taken off. After more palaver, Margaret signed a document
accepting the offer assumed to have been made by
Sweden; namely, that vessels of the emperor might enter
all the rivers and harbors of Sweden, paying only the
same duties that were paid by Swedish subjects, salt,
however, to be admitted free. She expressed a hope,
moreover, that other articles might be exempt from duty
too. To this document she attached her seal, July
29, 1527.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>It is particularly to be noted that Lubeck did not raise
her voice against the treaty. A probable solution is that
she wished beyond all else to secure her money, and felt
that Sweden would be more able to meet the debt in
case she were allowed to trade with Holland. All
through the winter of 1527 Gustavus struggled to raise
funds. Some portions of the country seem to have
responded freely, but in Dalarne and other northern
provinces it appeared likely that the levy would end in
actual revolt. In January Gustavus warned the people
that all responsibility in the matter lay with them. If
Lubeck made war upon the kingdom, it would be because
of their unwillingness to pay the debt. As a matter of
fact, the Dalesmen had much reason for delay. The
monarch, by his ill-judged privileges to Lubeck, had
kept the country in a state of famine, from which it
now was just beginning to emerge. Many of the people
were utterly devoid of means, and the new levy seemed
like wringing water from a stone. This in the course of
time Gustavus learned, and in March he prudently suggested
to his officers that the tax be modified in special
cases. The Dalesmen, however, were not so easily to
be appeased. Other causes of complaint were rife among
them, and they formed a compact to the end that no tax
should be paid until these grievances had been redressed.
On the 2d of April Gustavus asserted that the Dalesmen
had not contributed a cent. Brask, for reasons that will
be manifest later on, was in sympathy with the people,
and declared: "I fear danger, for the Dalesmen are
reported to be incensed, and rightfully incensed, against
the king. If it lay with me, I should remit a portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of the tax rather than give occasion for this revolt."
Gustavus, however, was still harassed by Lubeck, and
dared not take this step. As there were several matters
to be straightened out in Dalarne, he summoned a
general diet of the realm. The Dalesmen showing opposition,
Gustavus urged the people in the south of Sweden
to persuade the people of Dalarne to come. "We should
be glad," he urged, "if you would write to the people of
Dalarne, and ask them to lay their complaints before
the diet to be held in Vester&aring;s. We shall there explain
our conduct, and if our people are not satisfied, shall
gladly resign the throne. The German envoys will be
present, and the Dalesmen can then adopt some means
to quiet their incessant demands." All efforts to persuade
the Dalesmen failed. They despatched a long list
of their grievances to Stockholm, but they did not attend
the diet. When the other delegates came together,
Gustavus laid these grievances before them. The Dalesmen
had complained, he said, that they were burdened
with heavy taxes. If they had been more obedient, a
smaller army would have been sufficient, and the taxes
would not have been so heavy. He told them, further,
that the whole debt occasioned by the war amounted to
about one hundred thousand marks, of which sum a large
portion was still unpaid.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The outcome of the matter
was that the delegates voted to quell the insurrection in
Dalarne, and if enough money could not now be raised
to pay the debt, to levy further taxes. These stringent
measures were not, however, put into effect at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Gustavus was busy, in the autumn of 1527, with other
things; and furthermore a dispute had arisen between
himself and Lubeck as to the exact total of the debt.
The year closed, therefore, with the debt still hanging
over Sweden's head. The Lubeck envoys accepted all
the goods and money they could get, the whole amount
thus paid in 1527 being in the neighborhood of 22,800
Swedish marks.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>All through this period Gustavus was in constant negotiation
with Fredrik. Christiern's efforts to recover
the crown had been brought to a halt by the sudden
collapse of Norby, and Fredrik had assumed in consequence
a more aggressive attitude toward Sweden. By
the treaty signed at Malm&ouml; each monarch promised to
protect the interests which citizens of the other held
within his realm. But the ink was scarcely dry when
complaints were heard that Fredrik had failed to substantiate
this clause. The most flagrant breach occurred
in the case of property owned in Denmark by Margaret,
sister of the king of Sweden. So great difficulty was
experienced by Margaret in protecting this estate, that
early in 1526 the monarch counselled her to sell it. He
wrote also to certain Danish officers, and begged them
to defend her rights. These exhortations proving futile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Margaret sent her agent to the spot to see what he
could do. This only irritated the natives, and they fell
upon the agent with their fists. It was reported, too,
that the deed was ordered by an officer of Fredrik. At
all events, the agent was given no redress, and Gustavus,
after urging Margaret's husband to appeal to Fredrik,
wrote finally to the Danish king himself. He laid
the whole affair before him, and declaring that he had
ever upheld the rights of Danes in Sweden, urged Fredrik
to investigate the matter and punish those by whom
the violence had been committed. With this request
the Danish monarch promised to comply; and as we find
no further mention of the case, it is probable the quarrel
was adjusted and the rights of Margaret maintained.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Another dispute originating in the Malm&ouml; treaty concerned
the province of Viken, which lay along the
Swedish frontier in the southeast part of Norway.
This province had joined Gustavus in the war with
Christiern, and after the war was over had continued
under Swedish rule. In course of time, however, the
inhabitants grew eager to return once more to Norway.
With a view to satisfy their longing, Gustavus
allowed them, early in 1526, to be governed by
Norwegian law and custom. Possibly this would have
appeased the natives, but Fredrik was desirous for
more. He thought that Viken, being originally a province
of Norway, should be ruled by him. He therefore
wrote Gustavus, and begged a conference to settle their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
respective claims. Gustavus, defrauded of his rights in
Gotland, answered that he would gladly hold a conference
to settle all matters of dispute between them.
Fredrik waited nearly six months before making his
reply. He then informed Gustavus that the Danish
envoys had appeared in Lubeck at the day fixed for the
conference, but that nothing was accomplished simply
because the Swedish envoys did not come. He therefore
urged Gustavus to name a time and place at which
the question of Viken should be settled. The Swedish
monarch had learned by sad experience that a conference
with Denmark meant no benefit to him. He answered
that his envoys had been sent to Lubeck, as agreed, but
had failed through stress of weather to reach the place
of meeting on the day arranged. Gustavus appears not
to have cared particularly to retain the province, though
he was not willing to yield it without obtaining something
in return. He saw no reason why Viken should
be given up to Fredrik unless Gotland should be given
up to him. In answer, therefore, to repeated solicitations,
he declared his readiness to meet the Danish king
half-way; he would treat with him concerning Viken,
but at the same time some definite conclusion must be
reached about the isle of Gotland. When negotiations
had reached this point, they were interrupted for the
moment by a new dispute.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>Ever since the fall of Kalmar, Christina's boy had
been in Stockholm, under the surveillance of the king.
Gustavus for some reason had never liked the boy, and
in April, 1527, he sent him to his mother with a reprimand,
at the same time urging that he be placed for a
period under the quiet influence of some rural town.
This incident was the signal for another conspiracy
against the crown. This time the aspirant was a gay
young hostler, who conceived the desperate project of
posing as the regent's son. Relying on his own audacity
and on the perennial state of insurrection in the
north of Sweden, he went to Dalarne with the story that
he had escaped the clutches of Gustavus, whose orders
were that he be put to death. He then proceeded from
one village to another, extolling the virtues of the young
Sten Sture, and urging the people, since they had sworn
allegiance to his father, to do the same to him. The
support which he received was small. One or two villages
were at first deceived, but the majority of them
told him flatly that he lied. He therefore followed the
course of earlier impostors, and betook himself to Norway.
Approaching first the archbishop of Trondhem,
he told his story and awoke the archbishop's interest by
announcing that Gustavus had fallen from the faith. It
being bruited that certain of the church dignitaries were
on terms of friendship with this impostor, the archbishop
received him kindly, and though he refused to
give him shelter, promised he would take no steps to
harm him. Gustavus then addressed the archbishop
and the Cabinet of Norway, urging that the traitor be
returned. He pointed out, moreover, that, Sten Sture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
having been married only fourteen years before, it was
impossible that this traitor was his son. This argument
producing no effect, Gustavus prevailed upon Fredrik's
emissaries, then in Stockholm, to join him in his appeal.
An answer then came back from the archbishop of
Trondhem that he had refused to shelter the impostor,
though he had promised that he would not harm him.
Since then a letter had arrived from Dalarne saying
that the Swedish king was dead. The impostor had
therefore collected a band of refugees in Norway, and
was now once more in Sweden. With this mendacious
explanation Gustavus was forced to be content. The
fraud had been discovered, and by the close of 1527 the
insurrection in Dalarne was practically at an end.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="cap">IN most instances the stirring periods of a nation's
history are not the periods in which the nation
grows. Warfare, even though it end in victory, must
be accompanied by loss, and the very achievements that
arouse our ardor bring with them evils that long years
of prosperity cannot efface. Take, as a single example,
the dazzling victories of Charles XII. He was, beyond
all doubt, the most successful general that Sweden ever
had. One after another the provinces around the Baltic
yielded to his sway, and at one time the Swedish frontiers
had been extended into regions of which no man
before his age had dreamt. Yet with what result?
Sweden was impoverished, commerce was at a standstill,
education had been neglected, and the dominions for
which his people had poured out their blood during
many years were lost almost in a single day. His career
shows, if it shows anything, that prosperity is incompatible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
with war. No man can serve two masters. So
long as nations are in active and continued warfare, they
cannot enjoy the blessings or even the comforts that
belong to them in time of peace.</p>

<p>A like argument may be drawn from the reign of
Gustavus Vasa. The early years of the Swedish Revolution
were marked by bloodshed. The country was in
a state of famine, superstition was universal, literature
was almost without a champion, and art was practically
dead. Not till the warfare ceased did people turn their
thoughts to matters of education, of religion, or of other
things that lend a charm to life; and even then the
country was hampered during a considerable period by
poverty,&mdash;an outcome of the war. It is in this last
period of the Revolution&mdash;a period of peace&mdash;that the
chief work of Gustavus Vasa was accomplished. Then
occurred the great changes in Church government and
doctrine that made Lutherans out of Roman Catholics,
and in place of accountability to the pope made every
soul accountable to God. In the first few years of his
supremacy the monarch's opposition to popery was based
almost entirely on politics, but by the middle of 1525
he began openly to oppose the Romish Church on grounds
of faith.</p>

<p>The heaviest blow to popery was the order issued
by the king in 1525 that the Scriptures be translated
into Swedish. This all-important measure resulted
doubtless from the general dissension that had arisen
about the Word of God. If, as Luther urged, the Scriptures
were our sole criterion of faith, it was obviously
proper that they should be published in a form which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
every one could understand. Luther had already three
years before translated the Bible into German, but in
Swedish the only effort at a translation was in a manuscript
of several centuries before, which even Brask
knew only by report. Gustavus, therefore, toward the
middle of 1525, instructed Archbishop Magni to have a
new translation made. His purpose, he affirmed, was
not merely to instruct the people but to instruct the
priests, for many of them were themselves incompetent
to read the Latin version. As shepherds their duty was
to feed Christ's flock with the Word of God; and if
they failed to do so, they were unworthy of their name.
This reasoning the archbishop was unable to refute. He
was himself disgusted with the ignorance of his clergy,
and promised Gustavus that the translation should be
made. Not wishing, however, to undertake too much,
he devoted his attention wholly to the New Testament,
dividing it into several parts and assigning the translation
of different parts to different men. Matthew and
the Epistle to the Romans he took himself. Mark and
the Epistles to the Corinthians were assigned to Brask,
while Luke and the Epistle to the Galatians were given
to the Chapter of Skara, and John and the Epistle to
the Ephesians to the Chapter of Strengn&auml;s. The announcement
of this choice was made to Brask on the
11th of June, and he was asked to forward his translation
to Upsala by September 10, when a congress of the
translators should be held to arrange the various portions
into one harmonious whole. This project was not
received with favor by the crafty bishop. He felt it to
be the knell of popery, and in writing to Peder Galle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
he inveighed against it. "We marvel much," he wrote,
"that the archbishop should enter this labyrinth without
consulting the prelates and chapters of the Church.
Every one knows that translations into the vernacular
have already given rise to frequent heresy.... It is
said the Bible is capable of four different interpretations.
Therefore it would imperil many souls were a
mere literal translation made. Moreover, laymen cannot
read the Bible even if it be translated, and the
clergy can understand it quite as well in Latin as in
Swedish. We fear that if this translation be published
while the Lutheran heresy is raging, the heresy will
become more pestilent, and, new error springing up, the
Church will be accused of fostering it." This letter
was dated on the 9th of August. Clearly Brask's share
of the translation would not be ready by September 10.
The fact was, Brask had no notion of furthering the
scheme. At every opportunity he raised his voice
against it, and the weight of his influence was such that
finally the whole project was given up. The Lutherans,
however, were not disheartened. Finding that nothing
could be effected through the Church, they proceeded
to make a translation of their own. This was published,
though without the translators' names, in 1526. It did
not, of course, receive the sanction of the archbishop, but
it paved the way for new reforms by checking the Roman
Catholics in their scholastic doctrine and by educating
the common people in the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>Brask was now openly beneath the monarch's frown.
The rupture between them was becoming every day
more wide, and both parties gradually grew conscious
it could not be healed. Brask had never forgiven the
king for sanctioning the marriage of Olaus Petri. Some
six months after the event he alluded to it in a letter
to Peder Galle. "I am much troubled," he declared,
"that marriage is permitted to the clergy, and that no
one cries out against it. I have urged the king that
Petri be excommunicated for his act, that evil example
may not spread, but have had only a half-hearted answer
from his Majesty." While this wrong still rankled
in the prelate's breast, his ire was further kindled by
the monarch's evident intention to rob the Church of
several of her chief estates. As an entering wedge
Gustavus had pastured his soldiers' horses on the rich
but fallow lands belonging to the monasteries, and in
some cases the officers had been billeted in the monasteries
themselves. Against this practice Brask protested,
and received this soothing answer: "When you
say that this mode of billeting cripples the service of
God, you are right, provided his service consists in feeding
a body of hypocrites sunk, many of them, in licentiousness,
rather than in providing protection for the
common people. As to your assertion that the monasteries
were not founded by the crown, and hence are not
subject to our dominion, we will look into the matter,
though our humble opinion is that the monasteries were
originally bound to pay taxes to the crown." The argument
which the monarch strove to make was this:
Those monasteries which were founded by individuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
comprised estates held by the donors in consideration of
military service to be rendered to the crown; and so soon
as the military service ended, the tenure by which the
lands were held no longer existed, and the crown once
more became entitled to the lands. It is difficult to feel
that the monarch's view was right. In countries where
there is no written law, all controversies must be determined
by the law of custom, and it is certain that for
centuries Swedish subjects had been allowed to dedicate
for religious purposes the property which they held by
military tenure of the crown. With Gustavus it appears
that custom was of little moment. The monasteries
were wealthy, and could be encroached upon without
directly injuring the people. He resolved, therefore,
as soon as possible to confiscate their property, using a
plausible argument if one was ready; otherwise, to close
their doors by force.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1525, the king found pretext for interfering
with the Dominican monks of Vester&aring;s. That order
numbered among its brothers a very large proportion of
Norwegians; and one of them had assumed the generalship
of the order in Sweden, contrary to the mandates
of the king. This seemed an opportunity to play the
patriot and at the same time secure a footing in the
monastery. So Gustavus wrote to the Swedish vicar-general
and declared: "We understand that the conspiracy
in Dalarne and other places is largely due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
this man and several of the Norwegian brothers. We
have therefore appointed our subject Nils Andre&aelig; to
be prior of Vester&aring;s, trusting that he will prove a friend
to Sweden, by expelling the foreigners and preventing
all such conspiracies in future. We beg you also ... to
punish all offenders among your brotherhood, that we
be not forced to punish them ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Later in the same year Gustavus asserted his claim
with even more distinctness to the monastery of Gripsholm.
That monastery, it will be remembered, was
on the estate at one time belonging to the monarch's
father. It therefore was a special object of his greed.
At a meeting of the Cabinet he laid his case before
them, and offered to abide by their decree. There was,
of course, no question what their decree would be. The
monastery was adjudged the property of the king, and
all the inmates were instructed to withdraw. This
judgment naturally caused an outcry in certain quarters.
So Gustavus addressed the monks of Gripsholm
with unctious promises, and under the mask of friendship
obtained from them a written statement that they
were satisfied of the justice of his claim. This document,
a copy of which was filed among the royal papers,
bears singular testimony to the meanness of the king.
"Our title to Gripsholm Monastery," the wretched victims
wrote, "has been disputed, and, the matter being
laid before the Cabinet, they have determined that Gustavus,
as heir of the founder, is entitled to the premises.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
He has offered us another monastery in place of this, but
we feared lest that too might some day prove to be the
property of other heirs, and have requested permission
to disband and retire each of us according to his own
caprice. It has now been agreed that Gustavus shall
provide us with the money and clothing which we need,
and in return that he shall be entitled to the monastery
together with all the property that we have acquired."
At the close of this affecting document the writers expressed
their gratitude to the monarch for his generosity.
Armed with this evidence of his good intentions,
Gustavus addressed the Dalesmen with a view to calm
their wrath. "You are aware," he wrote with confidence,
"that the elder Sten Sture, who was a brother of
our father's mother, founded Gripsholm Monastery with
property that would have descended by law to our
father, and that Sten Sture induced our father to append
his signature to the deed. The signature was
obtained, however, only on condition that if the monastery
should be unable to keep up its standing, Gripsholm
and all its possessions should revert to the heirs.
Hence we have good right to protest and to claim the
inheritance of which our father was deprived by threats
and fraud. Indeed, the good brothers have considered
the matter well, and have agreed to withhold no longer
property to which they have no right. We have therefore
offered them another monastery.... But they have
not ventured to accept it, fearing to offend the brothers
already occupying it. So they have asked permission to
go back to their friends and to the posts which they
held before entering the monastery. This, at the desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of our Cabinet, we have granted, since we are ever ready
to listen to their counsel, and we have furnished the
good brothers with clothing and money to aid them.
We trust they will be grateful; and to prove to you that
such is the case, we enclose herewith an extract from
the letter which they have written." As the deed conveying
Gripsholm to the brotherhood is lost, we cannot
discuss with thoroughness the merits of the case. It is
enough that the monarch's action accorded with the
policy which he adopted later toward all the monasteries
in the land. The seizure of Gripsholm was justified,
at any rate, by a show of right. Of later cases it is
difficult to say even this. The Gripsholm Monastery
had not been closed six months when Gustavus claimed
another monastery, this time in the diocese of Brask.
The abbot it appears had died, and Brask was busy
making a list of the monastery's property, that nothing
should be lost. Gustavus wrote to Brask with orders to
leave the place alone. "Your fathers," he added, "did
not found the monastery; and even though your predecessors
in the bishopric may have founded it, they did
so with money belonging to the people.... We intend,
therefore, to take charge of it ourselves." To these imperative
orders the wearied bishop answered: "I feel
a special obligation to this monastery, since it was
founded by the yearly incomes of the bishopric." This
assertion, however, proved of no avail. Within a year
the monastery was yielded to the crown, and one of the
monarch's officers took the entire property in fee.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<p>All things apparently conspired to bring the aged
bishop to the dust. The seizure of his monastery occurred
at a moment when he was in deep distress about
the newly levied tax. Early in 1525 Gustavus had
written him to surrender all the tithes accruing in his
diocese for the year last past; and following close upon
this order, the royal stewards had deprived him of a
right of fishery which he possessed. The hapless bishop
murmured, but did not rebel. In writing to a fellow
bishop, he declared: "The king has recently demanded
of us all our tithes, and the chief prelates of Upland
have yielded their consent. This policy appears to me
unwise. I dread an outburst from the people, and
scarce have courage to make the announcement to
them." A few days later he said: "I have written
Gustavus about the tithes, but do not dare to discuss
the matter seriously with the people.... Only a year
ago the officers seized our tithes without consulting us.
You can imagine, therefore, what the people will say to
this new levy. However, if his Majesty will not countermand
the order, we shall do our duty by writing and
speaking to the people. The feeding of the army, which
he wishes by consent of his advisers to impose upon the
monasteries, we asserted at Vadstena was a foreign
practice that ought never to be introduced." Despite
these protests, Brask appears to have obeyed the monarch's
orders. He wrote to the clergy of his diocese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
urging them to send their quota, and to send it quickly.
"Bis dat qui cito dat," translated for the ignorant
among his clergy, "He gives nothing who delays."
The result was precisely what the bishop feared. The
people fought against the imposition, and Brask, as a
reward for his efforts, was accused by Gustavus of being
a party to the revolt. The charge was utterly groundless
and unfair. From beginning to end the bishop's
object had been to avoid friction, and finally he had
sacrificed his own interests in order to prevent friction
with the king. When in January, 1526, it was once
more voted that the tithes be given to the crown, he
wrote to all his clergy urging them immediately to obey.
Gustavus, however, would not be appeased; and a parishioner
claiming that the bishop had withheld some
jewels that belonged to her, Gustavus, without examining
the matter, wrote to Brask: "The law, as we interpret
it, gives you no power to take high-handed measures
of this sort." A few days later Brask asserted: "The
royal officers are beginning to enter upon the possessions
of the Church, much to the displeasure of the
people." What he alluded to particularly was the acts
of Arvid Vestg&ouml;te, who had seized Church tithes and
committed every sort of violence to the priests in &Ouml;land.
Against this Brask protested, and before the year was
over Vestg&ouml;te was removed. By this time the spirit
of the aged bishop was well-nigh broken. In answer
to a summons from Gustavus in 1526, he wrote the
king: "Though shattered by illness and the infirmities
of age, I will obey your orders with all the haste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
I can, provided the weather or my death does not prevent
me."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1526, at one of the public fairs, an enthusiast
came forward and announced in public that a leading
Lutheran in Stockholm was preaching heresy, and that
the king himself had violated old Church customs in his
food and drink. This silly assertion burst like a bomb
upon the town, and for a short period there was danger
that the fanaticism of the year before would be renewed.
However, the excitement soon died away; and Gustavus,
when he heard of it, declared the story to be a fabrication.
"Would to God," he wrote, "that people would
examine into their own lives and not borrow trouble
about the lives of others! Let them first pluck the
beam out of their own eye, and then they can see
clearly to pluck the mote out of their brother's eye."
Lutheranism had by this time attained so general acceptance
that the monarch deemed it unnecessary to offer
arguments in its support. In August, 1526, Laurentius
Andre&aelig; forwarded to the archbishop of Trondhem the
New Testament in Swedish, and added that some two
or three hundred copies of the edition were still unsold,
and could be had if he desired them. This wide-spread
distribution of the Scriptures produced its natural effect.
The flame of theological discord that had been slumbering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
for a year broke out afresh. Brask, as an offset to
the new translation, interpreted into Swedish some
tracts composed in Germany against the Lutherans;
and the monarch, hearing of this move, sent off a letter
commanding the aged bishop to desist. "Report has
reached us, venerable father," he began, "that you have
translated into Swedish certain proclamations of the
emperor against the doctrines now current, ... and
that you have circulated them among the common people.
We are well aware that these proclamations are
used to cast aspersions on us, since we are not so zealous
as he is in opposition to these doctrines. It is,
therefore, our desire and our command that you be
patient, and send hither certain scholars from your
cathedral to prove that anything is taught here other
than the holy gospel. They shall be given a fair hearing,
and may postulate their views without prejudice in
any way. And if they can prove that any one preaches
unchristian doctrine, he shall be punished. Furthermore,
we object to having a printing-press established
in S&ouml;derk&ouml;ping, lest it may do injury to the one established
here." Gustavus was determined that the
enemies of Luther should defend their faith. The disputation
between Galle and Olaus Petri two years before
had been unsystematic, and had produced no permanent
effect. So the king resolved to force the parties
to debate again. This time he put down in writing
certain questions, and sent them to the leading prelates
of the land, with orders to forward him their answers.
The questions were similar to those already raised;
among them being these: Whether we may reject all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
teaching of the Fathers and all Church customs that are
unsupported by the Word of God; whether the dominion
of the pope and his satellites is for or against Christ;
whether any authority can be found in the Bible for monastic
life; whether any revelation is to be relied on
other than that recorded in the Bible; whether the saints
are to be considered patrons, or in any way are mediators
between ourselves and God. Gustavus intended
that when the answers were all received, a public hearing
should be had, and every prelate given an opportunity
to refute the doctrines of his opponents. Some of
the Roman Catholics, however, refused to enter the arena.
Brask, in writing to the monarch, declared his clergy
to be satisfied with their present doctrines, and unwilling
to discuss them publicly. The bishop also wrote
to Galle, hoping to dissuade him from the contest.
But Galle, it appears, was eager for the fray. He put
his answers down in writing, and sent them to the king.
Other prelates, it is reported, did the same. The contest,
however, presumably from lack of combatants, did
not succeed. Petri therefore took the written answers
filed by Galle, and printed them in book form, along with
comments by himself. This book does little credit
either to Petri or to the general intelligence of his
time. Should any one ask proof that we are more rational
creatures than our fathers, he can do no better
than study in Petri's book the controversy that raged
between the intellectual giants of Sweden at the close
of 1526. Of the positions taken by the two contestants,
Petri's was certainly less consistent than that of his
opponent. Galle declared explicitly: "Not everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
done by the Apostles or their successors is written in
the Scriptures;"<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and on matters concerning which the
Bible does not speak we must obey the practices handed
down by the Apostles through the Church. Petri, while
granting that many Fathers were inspired, declared we
must not follow their instructions, "lest we be led away
by the devil;"<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and yet the Bible, compiled from various
sources by the Fathers, he held should be implicitly
obeyed. In the light of recent scholarship, both combatants
were wrong. The Bible is no more intelligible
without a knowledge of its history than is the teaching
of the Fathers without a knowledge of the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The contest has its chief value in the opportunity
that it gives us to study the methods of the king. From
first to last it was a blow at popery and the temporal
supremacy of Rome. Each question was worded with
the very purpose of offering insult to the Church. Take
for example the second question: whether the dominion
of the pope and his satellites is for or against Christ.
The monarch could not have thrown the question into
a more irritating form. Certainly Galle showed forbearance
in arguing the point at all. His answer was
an appeal to history. From the days of Gregory popes
had enjoyed vast riches along with temporal power; this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
showed that they were justified in possessing wealth.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Galle's logic on the subject is not altogether clear.
Petri's was somewhat better. Christ had distinctly told
the Apostles that his kingdom was not of this world,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
and Paul had declared that the Apostles were not to
be masters but servants.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Petri then broke out into a
tirade against his opponent's view. What right, he
asked, had Galle to set up Gregory against Christ and
Paul? "What authority has he to expound the Word
of God according to the deeds of petty men? Rather, I
conceive, are the deeds of men to be judged according
to the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> To an assertion by Galle that
the Church had held temporal power for the last twelve
centuries, Petri answered: "For that matter, the Word
of God has lasted still longer than twelve centuries....
However, the question is not how old the thing is, but
how right it is. The devil is old, and none the better
for it. That bishops are temporal lords is contrary to
the Word of God; and the longer they have been so, the
worse for them. Princes and emperors have granted
the pope vast privileges, by which in course of time he
has become their master, till now all men bow down
and kiss his feet. Where he was given an inch, he has
taken an ell.... Christ told Saint Peter to feed his
lambs. But the popes with their satellites have long
since ceased to feed Christ's lambs, and for centuries
have done naught but fleece and slaughter them, not
acting like faithful shepherds, but like ravening wolves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
This vehement language must have pleased the king.
If bishops were not entitled to worldly goods, it was
an easy task to confiscate their property to the crown.
A like incentive called forth the question: whether any
authority can be found in the Bible for monastic life.
The question, in that form, permitted no reference to
the Fathers. So Galle cited the command of Jesus:
"Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor;" and
he further commended monastic life as a step on the
way to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Petri replied that monks did not sell
all they had and give to the poor, but clung fast to
their possessions, bringing vast treasures into the monasteries
with them.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The disputation, while strengthening the hands of
Petri, caused a momentary shout of opposition to the
king. The cry arose that he was introducing strange
and novel faiths. His faiths perhaps were novel, but
they were not strange. The strangest feature in the
matter was the position taken by the king. By this
time, there can be no question, he was at heart with
Luther; yet, judging from his own assertions, he was a
firm defender of the Church. The king's duplicity, of
course, is easily explained. He wished to rob the Roman
Catholics of their power without incurring their ill-will.
He intended to reform their doctrines, and at the same
time spread abroad the notion that these doctrines had
reformed themselves. Some time before the disputation,
he had written to the north of Sweden to explain his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
views. "Dear friends," he courteously began, "we hear
that numerous reports have spread among you to the
effect that we have countenanced certain novel doctrines
taught by Luther. No one can prove, however, that we
have countenanced aught except the teaching of God
and his Apostles. For the faith given us by our fathers
we shall battle so long as life remains, and die, as our
fathers died before us, in the faith. The seditious libels
spread by Sunnanv&auml;der and his followers have occasioned
all the injury that has fallen in days gone by
upon this kingdom, as every reasonable man must know.
Doubtless there are among the clergy as well as among
the people many who are conscious of what they ought
to do. But certain monks and priests have raised this
cry against us, chiefly for the reason that we have denounced
their ambitious projects and their unrighteous
dealings toward the people. If any person owes them
anything, they withhold from him the sacrament, and
thus wring his money from him against the law of God....
Again, if a man kills a bird or catches a fish on
the Sabbath day, they fine him in behalf of their bishop.
This they have no right to do unless the act is committed
during church service, when the culprit should
have been listening to the Word of God. Again, whenever
a priest has wronged a layman, the layman is
practically without a remedy. He ought, however, to
have the same remedy as the priest. Again, if a layman
kills a priest, he is at once put under the ban, whereas
if a priest kills a layman, he is not put under the ban.
Yet God has forbidden priests to kill laymen as well
as laymen to kill priests, making no difference in fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
between them, but commanding all men to be affectionate
and peaceable toward one another. Finally, if a
priest dies intestate, his heirs lose their inheritance and
his property is taken by the bishop. Even the crown
estates, which they know we are bounden by our oath of
office to protect, they have confiscated, and now they
proclaim that we have introduced new faiths and doctrines
taught by Luther. All we have done, as you
already know, is to command them not to carry on
their ambitious practices to the ruin of our realm."
This explanation did not wholly calm the peasants;
and when they found Gustavus holding another contest
over their religious tenets, their suspicions were
aroused again. Gustavus determined, therefore, that
he must take some drastic measure to prevent revolt.
What he needed was a vote of all the people to support
his views. So he issued a proclamation in January,
1527, informing the whole country that, since he was
reported to be introducing new beliefs, he should soon
summon a general diet to discuss the more important
matters of belief, particularly the overweening power
of the pope.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>To this serious step Gustavus was impelled by several
things. In the first place he desired to fortify himself
against the pope. During the last three years the pope
had practically been without authority in Sweden. Gustavus
had selected as his bishops men whose actions he
was able to control, and the pope had deprived himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of even the semblance of authority by refusing
to confirm them. However, the nominal supremacy of
Rome was not yet shaken off; and until it was so, there
was constant danger that her actual supremacy would
revive. The monarch's chief anxiety concerned Archbishop
Magni. That prelate owed his appointment
mainly to the pliability of his temper, and to the assumption
on the monarch's part that he would prove a ready
tool. In this assumption Gustavus had soon discovered
he was wrong. Magni, though of pliant temper, was a
thorough Papist, and, as time went on, displayed a growing
tendency to oppose the king. In consequence he
gradually fell from favor, till he became an object of
open distrust. The earliest evidence of this feeling appeared
in 1525, when Magni, as one of the envoys sent
to Lubeck, was warned to take no action without the
acquiescence of the other envoys. This mandate was
issued from a fear lest Magni should encourage Lubeck
to raise her voice against the spread of Lutheranism in
the Swedish kingdom. How far this fear was justified, it
is difficult to say. As Lubeck had not yet embraced the
Reformation, she doubtless sympathized in some degree
with Magni, but there is not the slightest evidence that
Magni was unfaithful to the king. In February, of the
following year, when Magni was starting for the Norwegian
frontier to administer the rite of confirmation, he
wrote the archbishop of Trondhem that he would like to
meet him and discuss the dangerous condition of the
Church. Gustavus, hearing of the contents of this letter,
was aroused again. The archbishop of Trondhem
had given offence by harboring Swedish refugees, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Magni's simple letter caused the monarch to believe that
the two archbishops were, as he expressed it, "in secret
negotiation." Some two months later, Gustavus being in
the archbishop's palace, a stately feast was given in his
honor. This only added to the feud. The monarch was
incensed to find that Magni was capable of such display.
Hot words ensued between them, and finally the archbishop
was arrested and conveyed to Stockholm. There
he was charged with conspiracy against the king. Certain
letters that had passed between him and the Roman
Catholics of Germany were produced; and though they
showed no evidence of fraud, the archbishop was remanded
to his prison to await the further disposition of his case.
Never was greater injustice done a worthy man. There
was not a scintilla of evidence against him. He was a
generous, kindly, single-minded prelate, and the only
reason for this cruelty was that he had no sympathy
with the methods of the king. After some months in
prison he was released upon the pretext of an embassy
to Poland. Nobody could be ignorant what this pretext
meant. He was to be an exile from his native land.
He sailed from Sweden in the autumn of 1526, never to
return. By such ignoble practices the monarch cleared
his path.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>After the banishment of Archbishop Magni, Gustavus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
gave free rein to his ambition. The principal object of
his greed was still the monasteries and convents. The
practice of quartering his soldiers in them was by this
time accepted as a necessary evil. But in August, 1526,
he raised a new pretension. The provost of the &Aring;bo Chapter
having died, its members had chosen another in his
stead, and had begun to distribute his property in accordance
with a will that he had left, when a letter came
from Sweden ordering them to stop. After expressing
surprise that they should have chosen a provost without
consulting him, Gustavus added: "We learn that your
last provost left a large amount of property by his testament
to those persons to whom he wished to have it
go. It is clear, however, that it would do more good if
given to the public, since the kingdom is in a state of
distress brought on by the long-protracted war against
King Christiern. We therefore command you, after distributing
the legacies given to his family and friends
as well as the poor, to hand the balance over to us
to pay the nation's debt." Against this high-handed
measure there was no redress. It was but part of a
policy by this time well established in the monarch's
mind. Some six months later, the burgomaster and
Council of Arboga wrote Gustavus that affairs in their
monastery were managed in a very slipshod way; that
when a brother died, the prior took possession of his
estate, and the monastery itself got nothing for it. To
prevent this state of things, Gustavus sent an officer
to take up quarters in the monastery and send him a
list of all the property he could find. "You will discover
also," he declared, "some chests belonging to foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
monks. Take a look at them, and see what they
contain." This letter, it should be remembered, was
not intended for the public eye. Gustavus was careful
to keep his actions dark, and, the monks of Arboga
being accused of secreting certain treasures, the royal
officer was instructed to make a diligent investigation,
but to lay his hands on nothing until he received more
positive commands. He was careful, also, that his
practice of confiscating Church property should not be
taken as an excuse for private individuals to do the
same. In one case, where such a thing was done, he
denounced the perpetrator in the strongest terms. Moreover,
when the monasteries began to murmur against the
soldiers quartered with them, he sent out an open letter
to them, declaring that he had instructed his officers to
be as courteous to them as they could. It may be noted,
however, that he showed no signs of mitigating their
distress.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1527 Gustavus determined that the crucial
moment for the Reformation had arrived. Dalarne, as
usual, was in a state of insurrection, and every effort
which he made to check the Church called forth a storm
of imprecations from the northern provinces. The tax
imposed upon the Dalesmen being still withheld, it was
particularly necessary that the insurrection should be
stayed. In February, therefore, Gustavus wrote a letter
to appease the people. "Dear friends," began the monarch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
"we understand a report is spread among the people
that some new creed is preached here to the dishonor
of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Before God we
declare this rumor to be false. Nothing is here preached
or taught except the pure word of God, as given by
Christ to his Apostles.... It is indeed true, that denunciations
have been heard in public against the vice
and avarice of the clergy, and against the flagrant abuse
of their privileges. They have oppressed the ignorant
with excommunication, withholding of the sacrament,
and all sorts of impositions. Wholly without authority
from Holy Writ, they have imposed their Romish indulgences
upon you, carrying vast treasures of gold
and silver out of the kingdom, thus weakening our
realm and impoverishing our people, while the high
prelates have grown rich and haughty toward the
lords and princes from whom these very privileges
were derived.... We therefore urge you all by your
sworn allegiance, not to be deceived by false rumors
about us, doubting nothing that we shall move
heaven and earth to promote your interests. And we
beg you earnestly to believe that we are as good a
Christian as any living man, and shall do our utmost
to promote the Christian faith." Every one could see
that this assertion was intended to persuade the Dalesmen
to pay the newly levied tax. As the effort
proved without avail, the monarch called a general
diet to be held on the 9th of June, the object being,
as he declared, to put an end to the dissension that
had arisen in divine affairs. Later, the diet was postponed
to June 15, and, to appease the Dalesmen, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
ordered to be held in Vester&aring;s, a city that was near
their province.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Before the day appointed for the diet, a long list of
their grievances was drawn up by the Dalesmen and
sent to Stockholm to the king. To these complaints
Gustavus issued a reply, in which he strove to pacify
the malcontents and thus obtain their presence at the
diet. The complaints themselves are somewhat trivial,
but the monarch's answer is important as an instance of
his peculiar power in avoiding discord without directly
compromising his affairs. To their murmur at the
abolition of the mint in Vester&aring;s, and the scarcity of
coins of small denominations, he answered that the mint
was closed because the mines adjacent were no longer
worked; so soon as the mines in question should be
opened he would reinstate the mint, and moreover he
would please them by issuing small coins. As to the
complaint of heavy taxes, the Cabinet were responsible
for that. He would say, however, that he did not contemplate
any further tax. The practice of billeting in
the towns and monasteries was made necessary by the
paucity of land about the royal castles, but this necessity
he hoped would not exist much longer. The charge
of reducing the number of monasteries and churches he
denied. He had not closed a single monastery except
Gripsholm, which was the property of his father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
had been made a monastery against his father's will.
To the ludicrous charge that he was planning to restore
Archbishop Trolle, he made a flat denial. One thing,
he said, was certain,&mdash;those who favored Trolle favored
Christiern; he could scarce be charged with that. Finally,
the Dalesmen complained of Luther's teachings,
particularly the doctrines that were taught in Stockholm
and the practice of allowing Swedish chants and hymns.
To this he could say only that he had ordered nothing
to be preached except the Word of God; and as to
Swedish chants, he could see no reason for punishing in
Stockholm what was permitted in all other portions of
the kingdom; it was certainly better to praise God in
a language that everybody understood than in Latin,
which no one understood. "I wonder much," he said
in closing, "that the Dalesmen trouble themselves concerning
matters of which they have no knowledge. It
would be wiser to leave the discussion of these things to
priests and scholars.... I do not believe, however,
that these complaints are made of your own free will,
but rather at the instigation of certain priests and
monks, whose desire is to keep the truth unknown."
This sentence with which he closed contains the pith
of the entire letter. The monarch felt that in the coming
contest the opposing parties were to be the Church
and State. He endeavored, therefore, by every means
to win the Dalesmen to his side. Letters were despatched
to Dalarne from various portions of the realm,
to instruct the peasants that if they persisted in their
opposition to Gustavus, they would have to fight alone.
The Dalesmen, however, were no more influenced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
threats than by persuasion. They stood firm in their
determination; and when the diet assembled on the 24th
of June, no delegates from Dalarne appeared.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The Diet of Vester&aring;s is the bulwark of the Swedish
Reformation. It is the first embodiment in the Swedish
law of the reforms of Martin Luther. Gustavus had
been making ready for this diet ever since the day of
his election, and at last the opportunity was ripe. One
by one the prelates that were hostile to his views had
been removed; and Brask, the only man of strength that
still held out against him, was tottering to the grave.
His enemies abroad had been by this time silenced, and
except in the little province of Dalarne, Sweden was
at peace. It was this revolt among the Dalesmen that
served as a pretext for the diet. Gustavus was too
shrewd a politician to make an open avowal of his aim.
He announced that the purpose of the diet was to quell
the constant riots in the realm, and hinted with mock
innocence that he wished also to end the dissension that
had arisen in matters of the Church. Among the persons
who answered to the summons we find the names
of four bishops, including Brask, together with representatives
from Upsala and all the other Chapters excepting
&Aring;bo. Beside these, there were present one hundred
and forty-four of the nobility (of whom sixteen
were Cabinet members), thirty-two burghers, one hundred
and five peasants, and fourteen delegates from the
mining districts. The king's design had been made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
manifest before the diet met; for on the previous Sunday,
at a banquet given by him to the delegates already
arrived in Vester&aring;s, he had taken especial pains to show
the bishops that their temporal supremacy was at an
end. Despising every venerated custom, he had ranged
about himself the higher members of the nobility, and
had consigned the bishops to an inferior position. The
affront thus put upon them galled them to the quick,
and on the following day they held a secret meeting to
discuss their wrongs. All of the bishops present excepting
Brask discerned the hopelessness of their cause,
and advocated a humble submission to the monarch's
will. But Brask was boiling over with indignation.
He sprang to his feet and shouted that they must be
mad. If the king wanted to deprive them of their rights
by force, he might do so. But they ought never to consent
to such a course, lest they might thereby offend the
Holy See. In times gone by, princes had frequently
attempted the same thing that Gustavus was attempting
now, but the thunders of the Vatican had always overwhelmed
them. If the bishops now should fall away
from their allegiance to the pope, their only refuge
would be gone. They would become mere puppets of
the king, afraid to speak a word in favor of their old
prerogatives. These sentiments of Brask's were listened
to with favor. The warmth with which he spoke
produced its natural effect, and before the prelates
parted they drew up a set of "protests," as they
called them, agreeing never to abandon the pope or
accept a single article of Luther's teaching. To these
"protests" the prelates all attached their seals; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
fifteen years afterward the document was discovered
under the floor of Vester&aring;s Cathedral, with all the seals
attached.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Directly following this secret session of the prelates,
the general diet assembled in the grand hall of the
monastery. The proceedings opened with a laborious
address from Gustavus,&mdash;his secretary, Laurentius Andre&aelig;,
acting as spokesman for the king. This address
reviewed the entire history of the monarch's reign. He
began by thanking his subjects for their presence at
the diet, and went on to remind them that he had
already more than once expressed his willingness to
resign the crown. Nothing had induced him to retain
it except their earnest prayer. He had therefore
striven, night and day, to promote the welfare of his
people, and in return for all his labors insurrection had
sprung up on every hand, till now, the Dalesmen having
once again rebelled, he was determined that he would no
longer be their king. They charged him now with imposing
heavy taxes, with keeping up the price of food,
with billeting his soldiers in the towns and monasteries,
with robbing churches and confiscating religious property,
with favoring new creeds and sanctioning new customs.
All these charges were untrue. He had commanded
that nothing should be preached except the
Word of God; but his orders had not been obeyed, for
the people preferred to cling to their ancient customs,
whether right or wrong. As it was impossible, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the present system, to avoid continual rebellion, he
wished to retire from the government. If they desired
him to remain, some method must be found to increase
the royal income. He was at present wholly unable to pay
the expenses of his army, for war had grown to be a much
more costly matter than it was in former days. Other
expenses, too, were very heavy. The cost of embassies
to foreign powers was a serious drain upon his revenue.
Moreover, the royal castles had all sunk into decay and
must be rebuilt; and if he married the daughter of some
foreign prince, a vast outlay would be required. The
nobility also were impoverished through constant warfare,
and were calling on the crown for aid. His present
income was twenty-four thousand marks per annum,
while his expenses in round numbers amounted to sixty
thousand marks.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>At the close of this address Gustavus called upon the
knights and bishops to reply. Although the monarch's
speech had not in terms denounced the bishops, it was
clear to all men that his purpose was to humble them.
The duty of making answer, therefore, naturally fell to
Brask. That venerable prelate rose, and with his usual
complaisance declared that, having sworn allegiance to
his gracious lord the king, he felt in duty bound to honor
his commands. He had, however, by his oath of office
promised to do nothing contrary to the will of Rome;
and since the pope had ordered him and the other prelates
to defend all property, whether real or personal, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the holy Church, they must not consent to sacrifice their
rights. But he would promise that any deacons, priests,
or monks who might devise tricks or superstitious practices
not prescribed by their superiors, should be ordered
to desist and should be punished.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>At this, Gustavus demanded of the Cabinet and nobility
whether they were satisfied with the answer. As
none seemed eager to defend the monarch's cause, Gustavus
took the floor himself and said: "I have no
further desire, then, to be your king. Verily I had
not counted on such treatment at your hands. I now
no longer wonder at the perversity of the people, since
they have such men as you for their advisers. Have
they no rain? They lay the blame on me. Have they
no sun? Again they lay the blame on me. When
hard times come, hunger, disease, or whatever it may
be, they charge me with it, as if I were not man, but
God. This is your gratitude to me for bringing corn
and rye and malt at great expense and trouble from
foreign lands, that the poor of Sweden might not starve.
Yea, though I labor for you with my utmost power
both in spiritual and in temporal affairs, you would gladly
see the axe upon my neck; nay, you would be glad to
strike the blow yourselves. I have borne more labor
and trouble both at home and abroad than any of you
can know or understand,&mdash;and all because I am your
king. You would now set monks and priests and all
the creatures of the pope above my head, though we
have little need of these mighty bishops and their retinue.
In a word, you all would lord it over me; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
yet you elected me your king. Who under such circumstances
would desire to govern you? Not the worst
wretch in hell would wish the post, far less any man.
Therefore I, too, refuse to be your king. I cast the
honor from me, and leave you free to choose him whom
you will. If you can find one who will continue ever
to please you, I shall be glad. Be so considerate, however,
as to let me leave the land. Pay me for my
property in the kingdom, and return to me what I have
expended in your service. Then I declare to you I will
withdraw never to return to my degenerate, wretched,
and thankless native land."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>After this burst of passion, the monarch strode in
anger from the hall. He had studied his position well,
and knew that his opponents in the end must yield.
No sooner had he left the meeting than his secretary
rose and sought to bring the members to the monarch's
views. "My good men," he began, "let us arrive at
some conclusion in this matter, seeking aid from God.
It is a weighty question that we are to answer, and
one upon which hangs the welfare of our people. You
heard the king say truly there were but two courses
open. One was to follow his request, imploring him to
be our leader hereafter as heretofore; the other was to
choose the king's successor." But the delegates continued
silent, and adjourned toward evening without
putting the question to a vote.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>During three whole days the deadlock lasted. From
the inactivity of the king's adherents, it would seem
that they were acting according to advice. Gustavus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
wished to force his enemies' hand. It was clear to
everybody that the blessings conferred by him on Sweden
were beyond all praise, and he was confident that
no one would be rash enough to talk seriously about
selecting another for the throne. His object was to wait
until the patience of his enemies was exhausted, in the
hope that ultimately the offer of a compromise should
come from them. If such methods of procedure are
to be allowed, it must be granted that the monarch's
policy was shrewd. During the three days following
his stormy action in the diet, he kept himself in the
castle, entertaining his trusty courtiers and feigning
utter indifference to what was going on outside. On
the very day after his withdrawal, this independent
policy began to tell. The bishop of Strengn&auml;s was apparently
the first to waver. He appreciated the folly of
longer holding out against the king, and rose to say
that he regarded such a step as fraught with danger.
Something must be done, he said, without delay. To
put aside Gustavus and elect another king was simply
childish, and to buy up all his property would be impossible.
While he wished the clergy's rights to be protected,
he asked for nothing that would be a detriment
to the realm. Matters in general were now improving,
and the future apparently was bright. If Gustavus should
be permitted to withdraw, nations that had ever coveted
the kingdom would no longer leave it unmolested. The
effect of these words was in a measure lost through a
wrangle that ensued between Laurentius Petri and the
Papist champion, Peder Galle. What they were fighting
over, no one knew, for Petri made his argument in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Swedish for the benefit of the people, and Galle would
not answer in anything but Latin. Nothing had been
accomplished, therefore, when the disputation ceased.
And the morning and the evening were the second day.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>When the diet once more came together, the battle
opened with replenished strength. By this time the
peasantry and burghers had pretty generally sided with
the king, and threats were heard that, if the knights
persisted in their stubborn purpose, they would be made
to suffer for it. This language proved more efficacious
than persuasion. The knights and bishops could agree
upon no policy, nor upon a leader. They were terrified,
moreover, by the preponderance in number of their
foes. As a consequence, they gradually weakened, till
at last the delegates all voted to obey the monarch's will.
Andre&aelig; and Petri were therefore chosen to approach
Gustavus and inform him that the delegates would now
consent to his requests. Gustavus then indulged once
more his love of masquerade. He feigned reluctance to
accept the proffered honor, and scorned the delegates
who came to him upon their knees. One after another
the recalcitrant members grovelled in the dust before
him, and begged that he would show them mercy. This
was the sort of ceremony that the monarch loved. He
kept his enemies in their humble posture till his vanity
was glutted, and then declared that he would go before
the diet on the following day.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus was at last in a position to dictate to the
diet. The opportunity for which he had been longing
since his first acceptance of the crown was now at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
hand. He had won an unconditional victory over every
one of his opponents, and he was minded to use this
victory for all that it was worth. It is matter of regret
that practically no account is given us of the steps by
which the measures that he sought to have enacted
were attained. This very meagreness, however, is strong
evidence that the measures were enacted without much
friction. Apparently, the only object of the delegates
now was to suit their action to the monarch's will.
They therefore adopted as their guiding star the propositions
with which the diet had been opened by the
king, and formulated a set of answers in conformity
therewith. These answers were drawn respectively by
the Cabinet and nobility, by the burghers and mountaineers,
and by the common people. It is worthy of
more than passing notice that no answer was presented
by the clergy. Indeed, the clergy appear to have been
regarded in the light of victims. The whole object of
the diet was to crush the Church, and the clergy were
not permitted even to have a hand in the proceedings.
The monarch's notion was to give the clergy no voice
whatever in the diet, but after the lay delegates had
formulated their resolves, to force the bishops to issue
a proclamation certifying their assent.</p>

<p>It seems desirable to describe in brief the answers
which the different classes of delegates presented. The
Cabinet and nobility began by promising that, if the
rebellion in Dalarne were not already quelled, they
would use every measure in their power to attain that
end. They were satisfied with the monarch's seizure of
Gripsholm. They deemed it proper, since the royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
rents were small, that Gustavus be at liberty to grant
the monasteries of the land as fiefs, but not, however, to
expel the monks. In order to increase the wealth of the
nobility, they advocated that all property granted by
former noblemen to churches or monasteries since 1454
revert to the donors' heirs, though not until such heirs
should prove their title. To augment the crown's resources,
they believed the bishops, chapters, and cathedrals
should surrender to the king all that portion of
their income which they did not absolutely need. No
one should be permitted to preach falsehood or anything
beyond the simple Word of God, and old Church customs
ought to be maintained.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The burghers and mountaineers gave their answer in
a similar vein. They begged Gustavus to remain their
king, and promised to defend him with their blood.
They would express no opinion concerning Dalarne till
the Dalesmen who were going thither should bring
back their report. Since the monks were clearly at the
bottom of the trouble, no monk should be permitted to
leave his monastery more than twice a year. Gustavus
should be given the right of billeting whenever it were
necessary. Before deciding about the new beliefs they
wished to hear a disputation on the subject. As the
rents of the nobility and crown had been diminished by
the Church, the Church ought certainly to restore them;
and the mode of restoration should be determined by
Gustavus and his Cabinet. The royal castles having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
been demolished, the prelates should surrender theirs
until the castles belonging to the crown could be rebuilt.
Finally, from that day forth no bishop ought to send to
Rome for confirmation.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The answer of the common people began with a promise
that they would go to Dalarne and inflict punishment
upon the traitors; and since many monks were in
the habit of inciting the people to rebel, it seemed desirable
that they be permitted to leave their monasteries
only twice each year. Gustavus might quarter his soldiers
in the monasteries whenever it was necessary.
The churches and monasteries near Stockholm, having
in times past given shelter to the enemy, should be torn
down and their materials used to repair the city walls.
All matters of creed they were willing to leave to the
bishops and prelates, but asked that a disputation on
these subjects might be had in presence of representatives
of the people. The king should have authority to
increase his revenue in the way that seemed to him most
fitting. The king might take the bishops' castles till his
own could be rebuilt. The proper disposition of the
Church incomes they were content to leave to the king
and his Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>One cannot but be startled by the revolutionary tendency
of these replies. Never before had such a thing
been dreamt of as the surrender of all the bishops' castles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
to the crown. Gustavus must have been bewildered
by his own audacity. Within four days the diet that
had come together puffed up by a consciousness of its
own magnificence, had sunk into a position of absolute
servility. Things had been granted by the delegates
which, when the diet opened, Gustavus had not even
dared to ask. The very mode in which the votes were
taken and the acts were passed, shows how completely
everybody answered to the monarch's nod. Instead of
the answers being submitted to a general vote, they were
laid before the Cabinet to be passed upon by them. In
defiance of every precedent, the Cabinet usurped the right
to clothe the diet's sentiment in language of their own.
The result was a decree promulgated in the diet's name
and celebrated in Swedish history as the Vester&aring;s Recess.
By this decree the delegates asserted, every one of them,
that they would do their utmost to punish all conspiracies
against the king. They declared, moreover, that as
the royal incomes were but meagre, the monasteries and
churches must come to the relief, and, to prevent all
danger, no bishop should keep up a larger retinue than
the king allowed. All bishops and cathedrals, with their
chapters, must hand over to the king all income not absolutely
necessary for their support. Since many monasteries
were dilapidated and their lands were lying waste, an
officer must be appointed by the crown to keep them up
and hand over all their rents not needed for that purpose
to the crown. The nobility were declared entitled
to all property that had passed from their ancestors to
the Church since 1454. Finally, Gustavus was ordered
to summon the two factions in the Church to hold a disputation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
in presence of the diet, and the members promised
to quell the outcry that had arisen against Gustavus
and to punish the offenders.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It is reported that something in the nature of a disputation
was now held. But its significance, at any rate,
was small. The bishops and their clergy were to all
intents and purposes without a voice; and ere the diet
closed, a set of resolutions had been passed which did
away with all necessity for further disputation. These
so-called "Vester&aring;s Ordinantia" were even more far-reaching
than the "Vester&aring;s Recess." Since they are
the touchstone of the modern Swedish faith, the reader
will pardon prolixity if I give them all. They are as
follows: (1) Vacancies in the parish-churches are to be
filled by the bishop of the diocese. If, however, he appoints
murderers, drunkards, or persons who cannot or
will not preach the Word of God, the king may expel
them and appoint other priests who are more fit. (2)
Where a parish is poor, two of them may be joined together,
though not if such a step would be an injury to
the Word of God. (3) All bishops shall furnish the king
with a schedule of their rents and incomes of every kind.
From these schedules he shall determine the relative
proportions for them to keep and to hand over to the
crown. (4) A similar course shall be pursued with regard
to the cathedrals and chapters. (5) Auricular confession
must be given up as already commanded, and an account
must be rendered to the king of all fines imposed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
(6) An account must also be rendered to the king of all
fees received for remitting the ban, and bishops with
their officers must not inflict the ban for petty offences,
as has been often done hitherto. (7) Bishops shall have
authority to determine as to the legality of marriages,
and may grant divorces, but an account shall be rendered
to the king of all fees received therefor. (8) Fees
for weddings, funerals, and churchings, may be taken as
provided in the Church ordinances, but no more. (9)
Since it has been decreed that the king and not the
bishop is to receive all fines imposed in cases within
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the provosts may hereafter hold
court just as the bishops have done hitherto, and shall
render an account of their doings to the king. (10) For
desecration of holy days no penalty is to be imposed on
those who have been tilling the ground, or fishing, or
catching birds, but persons discovered hunting or quarrelling
shall be fined. (11) Priests shall be subject to
temporal laws and temporal courts, in all disputes, of
their own or of their churches, concerning property,
torts, or contracts, and shall pay to the king the same
penalties as laymen. But all complaints against the
clergy for non-fulfilment of their priestly duties shall
be laid before the bishop. (12) If a priest and layman
come to blows, one shall not be placed under the ban
any more than the other, for God has forbidden priests
to quarrel as well as laymen. Both shall suffer for their
acts according to the laws of the land. (13) Since it
has been found that mendicant monks spread lies and
deceit about the country, the royal stewards are to see
that they do not remain away from their monasteries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
more than five weeks every summer and five weeks every
winter. Every monk must get a license from the steward
or burgomaster before he goes out, and return it
when he comes back. (14) Monks who receive rents shall
not go out to beg at all. (15) When a priest dies, the
bishop is not to defraud the priest's heirs of their inheritance.
Priests shall be bound, in regard to their wills,
by the same law as other people. (16) If a man has
sexual intercourse with a woman to whom he is engaged,
he shall not be punished, since they are already married
in the eye of God. (17) No person who is infirm shall be
compelled by priests to make a will. (18) The sacrament
shall not be withheld from any one for debt or other
reason. The church or priest has a remedy in court.
(19) Fines for adultery and fornication belong to the
king, not to the bishop. (20) The Gospel shall hereafter
be taught in every school. (21) Bishops shall consecrate
no priest who is incompetent to preach the Word of God.
(22) No one shall be made a prelate, canon, or prebend
unless he has been recommended by the king, or his
name submitted to the king.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>These ordinances were practically a signal for the death
of popery. They not only transferred to the king the
rich emoluments on which for centuries the bishops had
grown fat; they transferred also to him a right to superintend
the actions of ecclesiastical authorities in matters
appertaining to the Church. It is hardly credible that
so vast an object should have been attained without more
friction, and that it was attained is a lasting testimony
to the shrewdness of the king. We may sneer at the
childish indignation with which Gustavus strode forth
from the diet, but the fact remains that this pretended
indignation gained its end. Above all else, Gustavus
knew the character of his people. They were particularly
prone to sentiment. A few sham tears or an exuberant
display of wrath had more effect upon them than
the most sagacious argument that the monarch could
employ. His policy, therefore, was to stir their feelings,
and then withdraw to watch their feelings effervesce.
It is not too much to say that no monarch has ever in
so short a time effected greater change in sentiment than
Gustavus effected among the members of this diet.</p>

<p>Before the delegates departed, a letter was issued by
all the bishops present, and by representatives of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
absent bishops, declaring to the people that Gustavus
had portrayed in graphic terms the evil inflicted on the
crown in former times by bishops; and that the lay
members had voted, to prevent such danger in the future,
that the bishops' retinues should be limited thereafter
by the king, and that all their superfluous rents and
castles, as well as the superfluous rents of the cathedrals
and chapters, should be surrendered to the crown. "To
this," the humbled prelates added, "we could not, even
if we would, object, for we wish to dispel the notion that
our power and castles are a menace to the realm. We
shall be satisfied whether we are rich or poor." To
one who reads between these lines, it is easy to discern
the language of the king. He also wrote, above his
own name, to the people, informing them that the diet
had been held; and for details of the proceedings he
referred them to a letter which the Cabinet had penned.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>There was one man on whom the diet of Vester&aring;s
had fallen like a clap of thunder from on high. His
cherished dream of finally restoring Romanism to her
old position in the eyes of men was now no more.
The knell of popery had been sounded, and nothing
remained for the aged bishop but despair. True to the
spirit of the ancient Church, he had looked askance on
every effort to discuss her faith. The doctrines handed
down through centuries appeared to him so sacred that
in his eyes it was sacrilege to open them again. In
answer to the monarch's oft-repeated counsel that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Church reform her doctrines, he had steadily asserted
his unwillingness to take that step, "for these new doctrines,"
he declared, "have been investigated frequently
in other countries and have been condemned. No man
of wisdom, I believe, will champion a doctrine that is
contrary to the mandates of the Christian Church."
This constant opposition on the part of Brask had
brought him more and more beneath the monarch's
frown. Gustavus let no opportunity escape to add humiliation
to the venerable bishop. On one occasion
Brask unwittingly had consecrated as a nun a woman
who formerly had been betrothed; and when the woman
later left the convent to become her lover's wife, the
bishop placed them both beneath the ban. This act
called forth a condemnation from the king. "The
bearer tells us," were his words to Brask, "that he has
married a woman to whom he was engaged, and who
against her will was made a nun. We see no wrong
in such a practice, and wonder much that you did not
inform yourself before the girl received her consecration.
The husband informs us, further, that you have
placed them both beneath the ban. This course appears
to us unjust, and we command you to remit the punishment....
We think it better to allow this marriage
than to drive the woman to an impure life." A
little later, when revolt arose in Dalarne, Gustavus fancied
that he saw the bishop's hand. "The priests," he
said to one of his officers, "are at the bottom of all
rebellion, and the diocese of Link&ouml;ping is the heart of
this conspiracy." Gustavus had no ground for this
suspicion, and the charge was utterly untrue. Brask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
thought the tax imposed upon the Dalesmen altogether
too severe, and did not hesitate to say so; but he was
very far from sympathizing with the rebels, and when it
was ordered that the diet should be held in Vester&aring;s to
please the Dalesmen, he was the first person to suggest
a danger in holding it so near the seat of the revolt.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Brask's influential position in the diet only added to
the monarch's wrath, and it was against him chiefly that
the diet's acts were framed. He was the wealthiest
of the Swedish bishops. Hence the reduction in their
incomes, as commanded by the diet, fell heaviest on him.
But even here the monarch's greed was not assuaged.
After the "Ordinantia" had been passed, Gustavus rose
and called upon the several bishops to resign their castles.
This step, though advocated by the burghers and
mountaineers as well as common people, had not been
ordered by the diet. Gustavus seems, therefore, to have
made the demand upon his own authority alone, and
the issue proved that his authority was great. The
bishops of Strengn&auml;s and Skara, on whom the demand
was made first, acquiesced as gracefully as was possible
to so provoking a demand. But when the monarch came
to Brask, that prelate did not readily comply. One of
the nobility addressed the king, and begged him to
allow the aged bishop to retain his castle during the
few short years that yet remained to him of life. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
reasonable request, however, the monarch would not
grant; and Brask persisting in his right to hold the
castle, Gustavus deprived him of his retinue and held
him prisoner till he furnished bail conditioned for his
good behavior as well as for the surrender of his castle.
The diet then adjourned, Gustavus sending forth a body
of men who entered the bishop's castle by main force,
and placed it under the supremacy of the king.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The ground of this barbaric treatment appears in a
negotiation between the king and Brask some five weeks
later. By the Vester&aring;s Recess Gustavus was given a
claim to all the income not needed by the bishops, cathedrals,
and chapters for their support. But since the
sum required for the prelates was not named, the field
thus left for argument was wide. The prelates took a
much higher view of their necessities than was taken by
the king. Brask especially found it hard to do without
his ancient pomp and circumstance. Gustavus therefore
put the screws upon him to bring the lordly bishop
to the ground. How well this plan succeeded is shown
in a document of the 2d of August&mdash;about five weeks
after the seizure of Brask's castle&mdash;in which the bishop
is declared to have come to an understanding, and to
have promised the king fifteen hundred marks a year
beside some other tribute. In reward for this concession,
Gustavus declared himself contented, and received
the bishop once more into royal favor.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>There is now but little more to chronicle about the
aged bishop. Beaten at every point, and practically a
prisoner at the monarch's mercy, he had at last capitulated
and granted to Gustavus all that he had asked.
The surrender, furthermore, was but the prelude to the
bishop's flight. Conscious that every hope was crushed
forever, he craved permission to visit Gotland and perform
the sacred duties of his office. This request was
granted, and the venerable prelate set forth never to
return. On pretext of consulting eminent physicians,
he sailed across the Baltic, and watched the monarch's
movements from afar. Gustavus, when he learned of
this escape, confiscated all the property of Brask that
he could find, and, worse than all, he issued a letter,
filled with venom, denouncing the perfidy of the aged
bishop and telling the people of his diocese that Brask
had fled because of suits that certain persons were
about to bring against him for his wrongs.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to take our leave of Brask without a word
in admiration of his character. He was, in point of intellect,
the most commanding figure of his time. Though
born and bred among a people strangely void of understanding,
he displayed some talents by which he would
have stood conspicuous in any court of Europe. His
learning possibly was not so great as that of Magni, nor
did his eloquence by any means compare with that of
Petri. But in matters of diplomacy, in the art of comprehending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
human nature, he was unsurpassed by any
prelate of the day. He was singularly acute in forming
his conclusions. Rarely if ever did he express
opinions that were not ultimately verified by facts.
His versatility, moreover, was something marvellous.
While weighted down with every sort of trouble and
anxiety, he spent his leisure moments in writing perfectly
delightful letters to his friends. These letters
bear the marks of suffering, but are calm in spirit,
charitable, and replete with thought. They treat of
botany, of geographical experiments, and of various
schemes to benefit the Swedish nation. As specimens
of literature they are superior to any other documents of
the time; and the writer evidently took keen pleasure in
their composition. "By means of letters," he declared,
"we keep our friends; and I would rather keep the
friends I have than make new ones." Brask's greatest
fault was his hypocrisy; but even this was due
more to his education than to any innate trait. He
was a Romanist of the deepest dye, and along with
Romanism he inherited a tendency to sacrifice the
means in order to effect the end. His very earnestness
impelled him to deceive. But his deception, if
only we may judge him leniently, was of a very pardonable
kind. Take him for all in all, he was an extremely
interesting man; and when he left the country,
Sweden lost a valuable son.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_166_166" id="Footnote_166_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_166_166"><span class="label">[166]</span></a> There is a Latin version of the "Ordinantia" containing certain
regulations not given in the Swedish. They are these: The contribution
known as "Peter's penning" shall not be given hereafter to the
pope, but shall go to swell the royal revenue. A like disposition shall
be made of the money which the monasteries are wont to send to the
superiors of their orders. Bishops and other prelates shall not hereafter
pay anything to the pope for confirmation. It will be sufficient if
they take their office by consent of the king. All property, real and
personal, donated to the cathedrals, monasteries, and parochial or prebendal
churches, shall belong to the descendants of the noblemen who
gave it, and if there is any residue, it shall be conferred by the king on
whomsoever he will. All real property sold or pledged to churches
may be redeemed on payment of the sum received for the property. To
augment the crown's resources the bishops, cathedrals, and canons
ought to hand over to the king as large a sum as they can spare. All
these regulations in the Latin version bear on their face the stamp of
forgery. They are drawn in a careless manner, and convey the impression
of being part of a rough draught that never was perfected. Certainly they
never were enforced. See <i>Alla riksdag. och m&ouml;t. besluth</i>, vol. i. pp. 90-93;

<h3>CORONATION OF THE KING. 1528.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Reasons for Delay of the Coronation.&mdash;Preparations for the Ceremony.&mdash;Consecration
of the Bishops.&mdash;Coronation Festival.&mdash;Retrospect of
the Revolution.&mdash;Character of Gustavus.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THERE is but one scene needed now to bring the
drama of the Swedish Revolution to its close.
During a period of over four eventful years Gustavus
Vasa had been seated on the throne, but the final act
deemed necessary in the election of a king had not
yet taken place. Again and again the people had urged
Gustavus to be crowned, but on one pretext or another
he had put them off, and the ancient rite of coronation
was not yet performed. The mystery of this strange
delay can easily be explained by looking for a moment
into the condition of the Swedish Church.</p>

<p>It was a time-honored theory all over Christendom
that no person could be legally installed in any royal
post without first having the sanction of the Church
of Rome; and such sanction, it was held, could only
be conferred through the consecrated archbishop of the
land. When Gustavus was elected king, the Swedish
archbishop was in voluntary exile, and nobody expected
that he ever would return. Indeed, he was so far an
object of suspicion at the papal court that, shortly after
the election of Gustavus, the pope appointed another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
prelate to perform the duties of archbishop till the
charges brought against Gustaf Trolle should be set at
rest. It is matter of common knowledge that Trolle
never succeeded in vindicating his position; and Magni,
though not confirmed, continued to perform the duties
of archbishop.</p>

<p>In January, 1526, the Cabinet urged Gustavus to be
crowned, and he declared that he would do so in the
coming summer, trusting presumably that Magni would
receive his confirmation ere that time. A tax was even
levied to defray the expenses of the ceremony. But
some opposition was encountered when the royal officers
endeavored to collect the tax, and, the kingdom
being then in need of revenue, the project had to be
postponed. There is evidence, moreover, that Gustavus
was not eager for the confirmation of the prelates.
On one occasion he expressed a fear that they were
seeking to obtain their consecration with a view to
transfer their allegiance from himself to Rome. Apparently
his object was, by continual postponement of
the coronation, to have a standing argument whenever
he desired to obtain new funds.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Matters therefore dragged on in the same way till
Archbishop Magni had been banished and the diet of
Vester&aring;s had voted an addition to the income of the
king. As the Cabinet had been beyond all others urgent
in their solicitations, the announcement of the monarch's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
resolution was addressed to them. He would have still
preferred, he said, to delay his coronation till the summer
of 1528; but fearing that at that time he should be
too busy, he had resolved to have the rite performed
soon after Christmas, and the day he fixed at January 6.
Invitations were then sent out to all the noblemen of the
realm, who were instructed also to appear with all their
retinues, and to bring their wives and daughters with
them. Each town was asked to send two delegates to
the coronation, and a certain number of persons were to
represent the different parishes throughout the land.
Sheep, geese, and hens were ordered in enormous quantities
to be collected by the royal stewards for the festival.
These the thrifty monarch arranged should be
provided by the parishes themselves. Lest the Dalesmen,
already somewhat irritated, should have new cause
for discontent, Gustavus wrote them that they need not
take part in the contribution, nor even send their representatives
if they did not feel inclined.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Although the Swedish Church was practically severed
from the Church of Rome, a doubt still lingered in the
monarch's mind as to the propriety of a coronation by
prelates whose authority had not been sanctioned by the
pope. Therefore, to remove all chance of contest, he
directed that those bishops who had not received their
confirmation should be sanctified through laying on of
hands by those who had. As a matter of fact the only
bishops whose authority had been derived from Rome
were the bishops of Vexi&ouml; and Vester&aring;s. The former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
was too old to undertake the active duties of his office.
The bishop of Vester&aring;s was selected, therefore, to consecrate
the bishops of Skara, Strengn&auml;s, and &Aring;bo. This
was effected on the 5th of January,&mdash;just before the
coronation festival began.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The gorgeous ceremony was performed, according to
ancient practice, in the Cathedral of Upsala. Representatives
from every portion of the realm were present, and
the huge edifice was filled from choir to nave with all
the wealth and beauty that the land could boast. It
was the final tribute of gratitude to one whose ceaseless
energy had saved the nation from long years of tyranny.
Never had the Swedish people been more deeply bounden
to revere their ruler. If in the annals of all history a
king deserved to wear a crown, Gustavus Vasa was that
king. The honor, however, was not all his own. The
ceremony of coronation over, Gustavus selected from
among his courtiers twelve to whom he granted the degree
of knighthood. Here again, as on the day of his
election, he displayed the sentiments that inspired his
whole reign. No longer do we find among the monarch's
chosen counsellors the names of men illustrious
in the Church and Chapter. It was from the ranks of
the lower classes that the persons whom he was to knight
were chosen, and from this time forward the knights to
all intents and purposes composed his Cabinet. No
stronger argument can be offered to show the utter humiliation
of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>The act of coronation was followed by a period of
mirth. A rich repast was offered by the king, at which
the representatives of all the classes were invited to be
present. A new coin, also, bearing the full-length figure
of Gustavus, with his sword and sceptre, and wearing
on his head a crown, was issued and distributed gratuitously
among the people. On the following days the
ceremony was prolonged by tilt and tourney. With all
the gallantry of a warmer climate two gladiators entered
the lists to combat for the hand of one of Sweden's
high-born ladies. The chronicler has immortalized the
combatants, but the fair lady's name, by reason of a
blemish in the manuscript, is gone forever. From beginning
to end the scene was one which no eyewitness
ever could forget. Years later, it stirred the spirit of
the author whose zeal has given us the leading features
of our narrative. It is a fitting picture with which to
close this tale.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The Swedish Revolution now was at an end, and the
great achievements of Gustavus Vasa had been done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Though not yet thirty-two, the youthful monarch had
already secured a place among the foremost leaders of
the world. We have watched the Swedish nation rise
from insignificance, through a series of remarkable developments,
till its grandeur cast a lengthened shadow
across the face of northern Europe. In some regards
this revolution stands pre-eminent above all others known
in history. Few political upheavals have been more sudden,
and few, if any, have been more complete. Seven
years was all Gustavus needed to annihilate the ancient
constitution, and fashion another structure of an
absolutely new design. The Cabinet, at one time the
autocrat of Sweden, was now a mere puppet in the monarch's
hand. Under the guise of leader of the people,
Gustavus had crushed the magnates, with all their old
magnificence and power, beneath his feet. In place of
bishops and archbishops, whose insolence had been to
former kings a constant menace, his court was filled
with common soldiers selected from the body of the nation,
and raised to posts of highest honor, for no other
reason than their obedience to the monarch's will. Of
the old ecclesiastical authority not a trace was left.
Rome, in ages past the ultimate tribunal for the nation,
had now no more to say in Sweden than in the kingdom
of Japan. The Reformation was so thorough that from
the reign of Gustavus Vasa to the present day, it is
asserted, no citizen of Sweden has become a Romish
priest.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Revolution whose main incidents have here been
followed recalls another Revolution enacted near three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
centuries later amid the forests of the great continent of
North America. Both originated in a long series of acts
of tyranny, and each gave birth to a hero whose name
has become a lasting synonym of strength and greatness.
The lessons of history, however, are more often found
in contrasts than in similarities, and the points of difference
between these two upheavals are no less striking
than their points of likeness. The chief difference lies
in the individual characteristics of the leaders. George
Washington was pre-eminently a hero of the people.
He embraced the popular cause from no other motive
than a love of what he deemed the people's rights; and
when the war of independence closed, he retired from
public life and allowed the nation whose battle he had
fought to take the government of the country upon
itself. The result was the most perfect system of republican
government that the world has ever known. Gustavus
Vasa, on the other hand, though actuated in a
measure by enthusiasm for the public weal, was driven
into the contest mainly by a necessity to save himself.
The calm disinterestedness which marks the career of
Washington was wholly wanting in the Swedish king.
His readiness to debase the currency, his efforts to humiliate
the bishops, his confiscation of Church property,
his intimacy with foreign courtiers,&mdash;all show a desire
for personal aggrandizement inconsistent with an earnest
longing to benefit his race. One must regret that the
rare talents which he possessed, and the brilliant opportunities
that lay before him, were not employed in more
unselfish ends. It is true he gave his country a better
constitution than it had before; he freed it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the atrocities of a horrid tyrant; he laid the axe at the
root of many religious absurdities; and he relieved the
people from a heavy load of religious burdens. But he
did not lay that foundation of public liberty which the
blood poured out by the Swedish people merited. Of
all nations on the face of the globe none are more fitted
by temperament for a republican form of government
than the Swedes. They are calm, they are thoughtful,
they are economical, and above all else, they are imbued
with an ardent love of liberty. It is hard, therefore, to
repress the wish that Gustavus Vasa had been allowed,
at the diet of Vester&aring;s, to lay aside the crown, and that
in his place a leader had been chosen to carry on the
good work on the lines already drawn. The Revolution
had begun with a feeling that the Swedish nation was
entitled to be ruled according to its ancient laws,&mdash;that
it was entitled to a representative form of government;
and it was only because of the nation's admiration for
its leader that this object was relinquished. The people,
having expelled one tyrant, chose another; and ere Gustavus
closed his memorable reign, the principle of hereditary
monarchy was once more engrafted on the nation.
Nothing could demonstrate with greater clearness the
extreme danger that is always imminent in blind enthusiasm
for a popular and gifted leader.</p>

1865-1868. 3 vols. 8<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>This ancient collection of rhythmic chronicles, composed by various
unknown hands, is devoted chiefly to events occurring before
the sixteenth century; and most of the chronicles contained in it were
written before that time. Two of them, however, were written in
the monastery at Vadstena in 1520, one running through the reign
of Karl Knutsson, and the other running from 1452 to 1520. Beside
these there is a satire on Christiern II., written shortly after
1520. Although these chronicles are little to be relied on, they are
extremely valuable as specimens of early Swedish literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>This little work, containing only twelve pages, bears no date or
place of publication on the titlepage, but at the end is dated at
Surc&ouml;ping, Dec. 29, 1522. One copy of it is in the Royal Library
at Stockholm. It is merely a denunciation of the cruelties of Christiern
II., and was doubtless issued with a view to win friends for
Gustavus Vasa in different parts of Europe. It is written in High
German, and has since been translated and published several times
in Dutch and also in Swedish.</p>

<p>This chronicle runs to the year 1525. It was probably collected
by Stegmann, a Dantzic burgher of the time of Gustavus, but it
seems not to have been written by him. It is in Low German.
Pages 517-528 give the story of Christiern's cruelties in Sweden,
which the writer denounces in unmeasured terms.</p>

<p>This chronicle was written by Eliesen in the years 1519-1534,
closing abruptly with the year 1534, though it has been continued
by a later hand to the year 1555. The MS. was found in 1650, in the
church at Skiby in Seeland. Eliesen was a Danish priest, a Catholic,
and a vehement opponent of Christiern II.</p>

<p>Born in 1497; died in 1552. Called the Luther of Sweden. Was
a man of determined character, great eloquence, and common sense.
He wrote in a strong, pure style, and with a critical judgment.
His <i>Svenska kr&ouml;nika</i> is the first history of Sweden written in modern
Swedish. It was completed in 1534, but runs only to the year
1521. It awoke the hostility of Gustavus because of its leniency to
the old bishops and clergy.</p>

<p>A native of Livonia, came to Sweden in 1521 to enlist under the
banner of Gustavus. He writes like a blunt soldier who revels in
the story of a battle. His <i>Ber&auml;ttelse</i> seems to have been written
for the king. It is chiefly a chronicle of Swedish wars, running
from 1518 to 1536. The original MS. is in the University Library
at Upsala, and seems to have run later than the year 1536, a portion
at the end of the MS. being lost.</p>

<p>The author, the last Roman Catholic archbishop of Sweden, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
born in 1488 and died in 1544. The work is edited by his brother,
Olaus Magni. It runs to the year 1520. The writer lacks critical
judgment, and his work abounds in errors. He writes as one who,
though wronged, is unwilling to complain; yet he hints that later
generations may not think so highly of Gustavus as those living
at the time.</p>

<p><b>Magni</b>, Olaus. <i>Historia de gentibus Septentrionalibus, earumque

<p>Author was a brother of Archbishop Johannes Magni. Born
in 1490, travelled through the northern portions of Scandinavia in
1518 and 1519 on a papal mission. As a canon of Upsala and Link&ouml;ping
was employed by Gustavus Vasa in several missions, being
sent to Rome in 1523 to obtain papal confirmation of his brother's
election to the archbishopric. After his brother's disgrace he followed
him, as his secretary, to Rome, and at his brother's death
was appointed archbishop of Upsala by the pope, but never attempted
to assert his right. Died in Rome in 1558. He was a
man of remarkable memory, and possessed strong powers of observation;
but he lacked his brother's even temper. His <i>Hist. de gent.
Sept.</i> is one of the most singular books ever written. It is an encyclop&aelig;dia
of Sweden in the sixteenth century; and though filled with
errors and barefaced exaggerations, is invaluable to any student of
Swedish history.</p>

<p>Born 1499, died 1573. First Protestant archbishop of Sweden,
and brother of Olaus Petri. Lacked his brother's eloquence, but
surpassed him and indeed all men of his time as a writer of Swedish
prose. This work is nothing but his brother's <i>Svenska kr&ouml;nika</i>,
wholly revised, with the omission of certain manifest errors. Like
his brother's work, it runs only to the year 1521, and is believed
to have been completed about 1559.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

Magni Gothi Upsalensis, quibus in historia sua ac famosa oratione
Danicam gentem incensit.</i> 1560. 4<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>A Danish priest and royal historiographer; born 1503, died 1584.
Was a warm adherent of Fredrik II. of Denmark, and an opponent
of Christiern II. Wrote this book to refute the work <i>De omn.
Goth.</i> of Johannes Magni. It is so full of bitterness toward the
Swedes that, while it was going through the press, the Danish
chancellor suppressed the pages bearing Svaning's name, and the
book was published under that of a German professor named Rosefontanus,
who had died in 1559. The name of the printer and
place of publication was also left out, and it was made to appear
as if compiled many years before from some documents which
Rosefontanus had seen when Christiern II. took refuge at his house.
The copy in the Royal Library at Stockholm contains the suppressed
pages, all soiled and torn. A second edition, bearing the
author's real name, was printed in Copenhagen in 1561.</p>

<p>This is the funeral oration delivered over the body of Gustavus
in Upsala Cathedral, Dec. 21, 1560, by Peder Svart, who had formerly
been preacher to the court and had been made bishop of
Vester&aring;s by Gustavus in 1556. It is ornate and pretentious, and
of little value.</p>

death; and the author himself died in 1562, having brought his
work down only to the year 1533. The original MS. is in the Royal
Library at Stockholm. Svart writes in a forcible and at the same
time easy style. Nor does he lack good sense; though the work is
marred throughout by a bitterness toward popery and a total
blindness to the errors of Gustavus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

It contains eight quarto pages without pagination, and is

been printed in Stockholm in 1561. It is a mere eulogy of Gustavus
in Latin verse, and is addressed to King Erik XIV.</p>

<p>This is a short calendar of the births and deaths of some eminent
persons arranged in the order of the days of the year. The compiler
was born about 1490, and died in 1565. He was a Cabinet member,
and a warm supporter of Gustavus Vasa, whose niece he married.</p>

<p><b>Ludvigsson</b>, Rasmus. <i>Collectiones historicae.</i> [In <i>Scriptores rerum

<p>Born probably at beginning of sixteenth century. When Gustavus,
according to Act passed at Vester&aring;s, 1527, established the
Royal Archives, he employed Ludvigsson to collect all the old
documents belonging to the various churches. These were then
deposited in the Royal Archives. Ludvigsson also, by order of
Gustavus, compiled a genealogical table of the old nobility of Sweden,
that Gustavus might know what estates to claim. Under
Erik XIV., as well as under his brother Johan, Ludvigsson held the
post of secretary to the king. He died in 1594. As a writer he
shows great industry and poor judgment. The <i>Collectiones</i> comprises
a continuation of Svart's chronicle to 1560, a chronicle of
Erik XIV., and a compilation of the early Swedish chronicles from
1362 to 1522. Of these the chief is the continuation of Svart,
which includes also Svart's chronicle slightly altered, and the whole
of it was long supposed to be Ludvigsson's own work, though the
name was erroneously spelt Rasmus Carlsson. The original MS.
of this continuation of Svart is in the University Library at Upsala.
The MSS. of Ludvigsson's other works are in the Royal Library
at Stockholm.</p>

<p><i>Gustaf I.'s registratur.</i></p>

<p>This consists of thirty-one MS. folios containing copies of the
letters written by Gustavus throughout his reign, and is preserved
in the Royal Archives at Stockholm. The letters are arranged
in chronological order, each folio as a rule embracing the
letters of a year. Nearly all the folios were compiled by the king's
secretary in the course of the year which they represent, though
some of them were not compiled till 1600 or even later; and portions
of the contemporary folios, left incomplete at the time, are
filled out by a later hand. Besides this collection, the <i>Registratur</i>
originally embraced fifteen folios of the king's letters to foreign
powers, and some folios of his letters on the crown estates; but
these are lost. The thirty-first volume of the extant portion of the
<i>Registratur</i> does not properly belong there, being a transcription of
Claes Christersson's letters to Gustavus in 1558-1561. Of the <i>Registratur</i>,
ten volumes have now been published, extending through
the year 1535.</p>

<p><i>Gustaf I.'s acta historica.</i></p>

folios have been printed. As now bound, volumes 2, 3, and 4 of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
