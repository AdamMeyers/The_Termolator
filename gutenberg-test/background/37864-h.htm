<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This book has been written simply in the interest of
Truth. It was because the doctrines of the Hamiltonian
School were believed to be dangerous errors, which this process
of thought exposes, that it was undertaken.</p>

<p>Logically, and in the final analysis, there can be but two
systems of philosophical theology in the world. The one
will be Pantheism, or Atheism,&mdash;both of which contain
the same essential principle, but viewed from different standpoints,&mdash;the
other will be a pure Theism. In the schools
of Brahma and Buddh, or in the schools of Christ, the truth
is to be found. And this is so because every teacher is to be
held responsible for all which can be logically deduced from
his system; and every erroneous result which can be so
deduced is decisive of the presence of an error in principle
in the foundation; and all schemes of philosophy, by such a
trial, are seen to be based on one of these two classes of
schools. Just here a quotation from Dr. Laurens Hickok's
"Rational Psychology" will be in point:</p>

<p>"Except as we determine the absolute to be personality
wholly out of and beyond all the conditions and modes of
space and time, we can by no possibility leave nature for the
supernatural. The clear-sighted and honest intellect, resting
in this conclusion that the conditions of space and time<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span>
cannot be transcended, will be Atheistic; while the deluded
intellect, which has put the false play of the discursive understanding
in its abstract speculations for the decisions of an
all-embracing reason, and deems itself so fortunate as to have
found a deity within the modes of space and time, will be
Pantheistic. The Pantheism will be ideal and transcendent,
when it reaches its conclusions by a logical process in the
abstract law of thought; and it will be material and empiric,
when it concludes from the fixed connections of cause and
effect in the generalized law of nature; but in neither case
is the Pantheism any other than Atheism, for the Deity,
circumscribed in the conditions of space and time with nature,
is but nature still, and, whether in abstract thought or generalized
reality, is no God."</p>

<p>The Hamiltonian system is logically Atheism. Perceiving
that the Deity cannot be found in Nature, it denies that he
can be known at all. What the mind cannot know at all,
<i>it is irrational to believe</i>. If man cannot <i>know that</i> God is,
and have a clear sight of his attributes as a rational ground
of confidence in what he says, it is the height of blind credulity
to believe in him. And more; if man cannot have such
knowledge, he has <i>no standard</i> by which to measure teachings,
and be <i>sure</i> he has the truth. Under such circumstances,
faith is <i>impossible</i>. Faith can only be based on
<i>Reason</i>. If there is no Reason, there can be no faith.
Hence he who talks about faith, and denies Reason, does not
know what faith is. The logician rightfully held that God
could not be found in Nature; but he was just as wrong in
asserting that man is wholly in Nature and cannot know God,
as he was right in the former instance. The acceptance of
his one truth, and one error, compels man to be an Atheist;
because then he has no faculty by which to know aught of<span class="pagenum">[vii]</span>
God; and few thorough men will accept blind credulity as
the basis of Religion.</p>

<p>The author's sense of obligation to President Hickok cannot
be too strongly stated. But for his works, it is believed that
this little treatise could never have been written. Indeed,
the author looks for but scanty credit on the score of originality,
since most of what he has written he has learned,
directly or indirectly, from that profound thinker. He has
deemed it his chief work, to apply the principles developed
by others to the exposure of a great error. And if he shall
be judged to have accomplished this, his ambition will have
been satisfied.</p>

<p>After the substance of this treatise had been thought out,
and while the author was committing it to paper, the essays on
"Space and Time," and on "The Philosophy of the Unconditioned,"
in the numbers of the "North American Review"
for July and October, 1864, happened to fall under his notice.
Some persons will appreciate the delight and avidity with
which he read them; and how grateful it was to an obscure
student, almost wholly isolated in the world, to find the views
which he had wrought out in his secluded chamber, so ably
advocated in the leading review of his country. Not that he
had gone as far, or examined the subjects in hand as thoroughly
as has been there done. By no means. Rather what
results he had attained accord with some of those therein
laid down. Of those essays it is not too much to say, that, if
they have not exhausted the topics of which they treat, they
have settled forever the conclusions to be reached, and leave
for other writers only illustration and comment. If the author
shall seem to differ from them on a minor question,&mdash;that of
quantitative infinity,&mdash;the difference will, it is believed, be
found to be one of the form of expression only. And the difference<span class="pagenum">[viii]</span>
is maintained from the conviction that no term in science
should have more than one signification. It is better to adopt
illimitable and indivisible, as the technical epithets of Space,
in place of the commonly used terms infinite and absolute.</p>

<p>A metaphysical distinction has been incidentally touched
upon in the following discussion, which deserves a more
extensive consideration than the scope and plan of this work
would permit to it here; and which, so far as the author's
limited reading goes, has received very little attention from
modern writers on metaphysics. He refers to the distinction
between the animal nature and spiritual person, so repeatedly
enounced by that profound metaphysical theologian, the
apostle Paul, and by that pure spiritual pastor, the apostle
John, in the terms "flesh" and "spirit." The thinkers of
the world, even the best Christian philosophers, seem to have
esteemed this a moral and religious distinction, and no more,
when in fact it cleaves down through the whole human being,
and forms the first great radical division in any proper analysis
of man's soul, and classification of his constituent elements.
<i>This is a purely natural division.</i> It is organic in man. It
belonged as much to Adam in his purity, as it does to the
most degraded wretch on the globe now. It is of such a
character that, had it been properly understood and developed,
the Hamiltonian system of philosophy could never have been
constructed.</p>

<p>An adequate statement of the truth would be conducted as
follows. First, the animal nature should be carefully analyzed,
its province accurately defined, and both the laws and forms
of its activity exactly stated. Second, a like examination of
the spiritual person should follow; and third, the relations,
interactions, and influences of the two parts upon each other
should be, as extensively as possible, presented. But it is to<span class="pagenum">[ix]</span>
be remarked, that, while the analysis, by the human intellect,
of these two great departments of man's soul, may be exhaustive,
it is doubtful if any but the All-seeing Eye can
read all their relations and inter-communications. The development
of the third point, by any one mind, must needs,
therefore, be partial. Whether any portion of the above
designated labor shall be hereafter entered upon, will depend
upon circumstances beyond control of the writer.</p>

<p>As will appear, it is believed, in the development of the
subject, the great, the <i>vital</i> point upon which the whole controversy
with the Hamiltonian school must turn, is a question
of <i>fact</i>; viz., whether man has a Reason, as the faculty
giving <i>a priori</i> principles, or not. If he has such a Reason,
then by it the questions now at issue can be settled, and that
finally. If he has no Reason, then he can have no knowledge,
except of appearances and events, as perceived by the Sense
and judged by the Understanding. Until, then, the question
of fact is decided, it would be a gain if public attention was
confined wholly to it. Establish first a well ascertained and
sure foundation before erecting a superstructure.</p>

<p>The method adopted in constructing this treatise does not
admit the presentation of the matter in a symmetrical form.
On the contrary, it involves some, perhaps many, repetitions.
What has been said at one point respecting one author must
be said again in reply to another. Yet the main object for
which the work was undertaken could, it seemed, be thoroughly
accomplished in no other way.</p>

<p>The author has in each case used American editions of the
works named.</p>

<p class="h3">THE SEEKING AND THE FINDING.</p>

<p>In April, 1859, there was republished in Boston, from an
English print, a volume entitled "The Limits of Religious
Thought Examined," &amp;c., "by Henry Longueville Mansel,
B. D."</p>

<p>The high position occupied by the publishers,&mdash;a firm of
Christian gentlemen, who, through a long career in the publication
of books either devoutly religious, or, at least, having
a high moral tone, and being marked by deep, earnest
thought, have obtained the confidence of the religious community;
the recommendations with which its advent was heralded,
but most of all the intrinsic importance of the theme
announced, and its consonance with many of the currents of
mental activity in our midst,&mdash;gave the book an immediate
and extensive circulation. Its subject lay at the foundation
of all religious, and especially of all theological thinking.
The author, basing his teaching on certain metaphysical
tenets, claimed to have circumscribed the boundary to all
positive, and so valid effort of the human intellect in its upward
surging towards the Deity, and to have been able to
say, "Thus far canst thou come, and no farther, and here
must thy proud waves be stayed." And this effort was declaredly
made in the interest of religion. It was asserted<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
that from such a ground only, as was therein sought to be
established, could infidelity be successfully assailed and destroyed.
Moreover, the writer was a learned and able divine
in the Anglican Church, orthodox in his views; and his volume
was composed of lectures delivered upon what is known
as "The Bampton Foundation;"&mdash;a bequest of a clergyman,
the income of which, under certain rules, he directed
should be employed forever, in furthering the cause of Christ,
by Divinity Lecture Sermons in Oxford. Such a book, on
such a theme, by such a man, and composed under such auspices,
would necessarily receive the almost universal attention
of religious thinkers, and would mark an era in human
thought. Such was the fact in this country. New England,
the birthplace and home of American Theology, gave it her
most careful and studious examination. And the West alike
with the East pored over its pages, and wrought upon its
knotty questions. Clergymen especially, and theological students,
perused it with the earnestness of those who search
for hid treasures. And what was the result? We do not
hesitate to say that it was unqualified rejection. The book
now takes its place among religious productions, not as a
contribution to our positive knowledge, not as a practicable
new road, surveyed out through the Unknown Regions of
Thought, but rather as possessing only a negative value, as a
monument of warning, erected at that point on the roadside
where the writer branched off in his explorations, and on
which is inscribed, "In this direction the truth cannot be
found."</p>

<p>The stir which this book produced, naturally brought prominently
to public attention a writer heretofore not extensively
read in this country, Sir William Hamilton, upon
whose metaphysical teachings the lecturer avowedly based
his whole scheme. The doctrines of the metaphysician were
subjected to the same scrutinizing analysis, which dissolved
the enunciations of the divine; and they, like these, were
pronounced "wanting." This decision was not reached or<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
expressed in any extensive and exhaustive criticism of these
writers; in which the errors of their principles and the revolting
nature of the results they attained, were presented;
but it rather was a shoot from the spontaneous and deep-seated
conviction, that the whole scheme, of both teacher and
pupil, was utterly insufficient to satisfy the craving of man's
highest nature. It was rejected because it <i>could</i> not be received.</p>

<p>Something more than a year ago, and while the American
theological mind, resting in the above-stated conviction, was
absorbed in the tremendous interests connected with the Great
Rebellion, a new aspirant for honors appeared upon the stage.
A book was published entitled "The Philosophy of Herbert
Spencer: First Principles." This was announced as the foundation
of a new system of Philosophy, which would command
the confidence of the present, and extort the wonder of all
succeeding ages. Avowing the same general principles with
Mansel and Hamilton, this writer professed to have found a
radical defect in their system, which being corrected, rendered
that system complete and final; so that, from it as a base, he
sets out to construct a new scheme of Universal Science. This
man, too, has been read, not so extensively as his predecessors;
because when one has seen a geometrical absurdity demonstrated,
he does not care, unless from professional motives,
to examine and disprove further attempts to bolster up the
folly; but still so widely read, as to be generally associated
with the other writers above mentioned, and, like them, rejected.
Upon being examined, he is found to be a man of
less scope and mental muscle than either of his teachers;
yet going over the same ground and expressing the same
ideas, scarcely in new language even; and it further appears
that his discovery is made at the expense of his logic
and consistency, and involves an unpardonable contradiction.
Previous to the publication of the books just mentioned,
an American writer had submitted to the world a system
of thought upon the questions of which they treat, which<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
certainly seems worthy of some notice from their authors.
Yet it has received none. To introduce him we must retrace
our steps for a little.</p>

<p>In 1848, Laurens P. Hickok, then a Professor in Auburn
Theological Seminary, published a work entitled "Rational
Psychology," in which he professed to establish, by <i>a priori</i>
processes, positions which, if true, afford a ground for the
answer, at once and forever, of all the difficulties raised by
Sir William Hamilton and his school. Being comparatively
a new writer, his work attracted only a moiety of the attention
it should have done. It was too much like Analytical
Geometry and Calculus for the popular mind, or even for
any but a few patient thinkers. For them it was marrow
and fatness.</p>

<p>Since the followers of Sir William Hamilton, whom we
will hereafter term Limitists, have neglected to take the
great truths enunciated by the American metaphysician, and
apply them to their own system, and so be convinced by their
own study of the worthlessness of that system, it becomes
their opponents, in the interest of truth, to perform this work
in their stead; viz., upon the basis of immutable truth, to
unravel each of their well-knit sophistries, to show to the
world that it may "<i>know the truth</i>;" and thus to destroy
a system which, if allowed undisputed sway, would sap the
very foundations of Christian faith.</p>

<p>The philosophical system of the Limitists is built upon a
single fundamental proposition, which carries all their deductions
with it. He who would strike these effectually, must
aim his blow, and give it with all his might, straight at that
one object; sure that if he destroys that, the destruction of
the whole fabric is involved therein. But, as the Limitists
are determined not to confess the dissolution of their scheme,
by the simple establishment of principles, which they cannot
prove false, and which, if true, involve the absurdity of
their own tenets, it is further necessary to go through their
writings, and examine them passage by passage, and show<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
the fallacy of each. In the former direction we can but re-utter
some of the principles of the great American teacher.
In the latter there is room for new effort; and this shall be
our especial province.</p>

<p>The proposition upon which the whole scheme of the Limitists
is founded, was originally enunciated by Sir William
Hamilton, in the following terms. "The Unconditioned is
incognizable and inconceivable; its notion being only negative
of the conditioned, which last can alone be positively
known or conceived." "In our opinion, the mind can conceive,
and consequently can know, only the <i>limited and the
conditionally limited</i>. The unconditionally unlimited, or the
Infinite, the unconditionally limited, or the Absolute, cannot
positively be construed to the mind; they can be conceived
only by a thinking away from, or abstraction of, those very
conditions under which thought itself is realized; consequently,
the notion of the Unconditioned is only negative&mdash;negative
of the conceivable itself. For example, on the one
hand we can positively conceive, neither an absolute whole,
that is, a whole so great, that we cannot also conceive it as a
relative part of a still greater whole; nor an absolute part,
that is, a part so small, that we cannot also conceive it as a
relative whole, divisible into smaller parts. On the other
hand, we cannot positively represent, or realize, or construe
to the mind, (as here understanding and imagination coincide,)
an infinite whole, for this could only be done by the
infinite synthesis in thought of finite wholes, which would
itself require an infinite time for its accomplishment; nor,
for the same reason, can we follow out in thought an infinite
divisibility of parts.... As the conditionally limited
(which we may briefly call the conditioned) is thus the only
possible object of knowledge, and of positive thought&mdash;thought
necessarily supposes conditions. <i>To think</i> is <i>to condition</i>;
and conditional limitation is the fundamental law of
the possibility of thought." ... "The conditioned is the
mean between two extremes&mdash;two inconditionates, exclusive<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
of each other, neither of which <i>can be conceived as possible</i>,
but of which, on the principles of contradiction and excluded
middle, one <i>must be admitted as necessary</i>."</p>

<p>This theory may be epitomized as follows:&mdash;"The Unconditioned
denotes the genus of which the Infinite and
Absolute are the species." This genus is inconceivable, is
"negative of the conceivable itself." Hence both the species
must be so also. Although they are thus incognizable, they
may be defined; the one, the Infinite, as "that which is beyond
all limits;" the other, the Absolute, as "a whole beyond
all conditions:" or, concisely, the one is illimitable immensity,
the other, unconditional totality. As defined, these are seen
to be "mutually repugnant:" that is, if there is illimitable
immensity, there cannot be absolute totality; and the reverse.
Within these two all possible being is included; and, because
either excludes the other, it can be in only one. Since both
are inconceivable we can never know in which the conditioned
or conceivable being is. Either would give us a being&mdash;God&mdash;capable
of accounting for the Universe. This fact
is assumed to be a sufficient ground for faith; and man may
therefore rationally satisfy himself with the study of those
matters which are cognizable&mdash;the conditioned.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose at this point to enter upon a criticism
of the philosophical theory thus enounced. This will fall,
in the natural course, upon a subsequent page. We have
stated it here, for the purpose of placing in that strong light
which it deserves, another topic, which has received altogether
too little attention from the opponents of the Limitists.
Underlying and involved in the above theory, there
is a question of <i>fact</i>, of the utmost importance. Sir William
Hamilton's metaphysic rests upon his psychology; and if
his psychology is true, his system is impregnable. It is his
diagnosis of the human mind, then, which demands our attention.
He has presented this in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"While we regard as conclusive Kant's analysis of Time
and Space into conditions of thought, we cannot help viewing<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
his deduction of the 'Categories of Understanding' and
the 'Ideas of Speculative Reason' as the work of a great
but perverse ingenuity. The categories of understanding
are merely subordinate forms of the conditioned. Why not,
therefore, generalize the <i>Conditioned&mdash;Existence Conditioned</i>,
as the supreme category, or categories, of thought?&mdash;and
if it were necessary to analyze this form into its subaltern
applications, why not develop these immediately out of
the generic principle, instead of preposterously, and by a
forced and partial analogy, deducing the laws of the understanding
from a questionable division of logical proposition?
Why distinguish Reason (Vernunft) from Understanding
(Verstand), simply on the ground that the former is conversant
about, or rather tends toward, the unconditioned; when
it is sufficiently apparent, that the unconditioned is conceived
as the negation of the conditioned, and also that the conception
of contradictories is one? In the Kantian philosophy,
both faculties perform the same function, both seek the one
in the many;&mdash;the Idea (Idee) is only the Concept (Begriff)
sublimated into the inconceivable; Reason only the
Understanding which has 'overleaped itself.'"</p>

<p>Not stopping now to correct the entirely erroneous statement
that "both faculties," <i>i. e.</i>, Understanding and Reason,
"perform the same function," we are to notice the two leading
points which are made, viz.:&mdash;1. That there is no distinction
between the Understanding and the Reason; or, in
other words, there is no such faculty as the Reason is
claimed to be, there is none but the Understanding; and,
2. A generalization is the highest form of human knowledge;
both of which may be comprised in one affirmation; the Understanding
is the highest faculty of knowledge belonging to
the human soul. Upon this, a class of thinkers, following
Plato and Kant, take issue with the logician, and assert that
the distinction between the two faculties named above, has
a substantial basis; that, in fact, they are different in <i>kind</i>,
and that the mode of activity in the one is wholly unlike<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
the mode of activity in the other. Thus, then, is the great
issue between the Hamiltonian and Platonic schools made
upon a question of <i>fact</i>. He who would attack the former
school successfully, must aim his blow straight at their fundamental
assumption; and he who shall establish the fact of
the Pure Reason as an unquestionable faculty in the human
soul, will, in such establishment, accomplish the destruction
of the Hamiltonian system of philosophy. Believing this
system to be thoroughly vicious in its tendencies; being such
indeed, as would, if carried out, undermine the whole Christian
religion; and what is of equal importance, being false
to the facts in man's soul as God's creature, the writer will
attempt to achieve the just named and so desirable result;
and by the mode heretofore indicated.</p>

<p>It is required, then, to <i>prove</i> that there is a faculty belonging
to the human soul, essentially diverse from the Sense or
the Understanding; a faculty peculiar and unique, which
possesses such qualities as have commonly been ascribed by
its advocates to the Pure Reason; and thereby to establish
such faculty as a fact, and under that name.</p>

<p>Previous to bringing forward any proofs, it is important to
make an exact statement of what is to be proved. To this
end, let the following points be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Its modes of activity are essentially diverse from those
of the Sense or Understanding. The Sense is only capacity.
According to the laws of its construction, it receives impressions
from objects, either material, and so in a different place
from that which it occupies, or imaginary, and so proceeding
from the imaging faculty in itself. But it is only capacity
to receive and transmit impressions. The Understanding,
though more than this, even faculty, is faculty shut within
the limits of the Sense. According to its laws, it takes up
the presentations of the Sense, analyzes and classifies them,
and deduces conclusions: but it can attain to nothing more
than was already in the objects presented. It can construct
a system; it cannot develop a science. It can observe a<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
relation it cannot intuit a law. What we seek is capacity,
but of another and higher kind from that of the Sense.
Sense can have no object except such, at least, as is constructed
out of impressions received from without. What
we seek does not observe outside phenomena; and can have
no object except as inherent within itself. It is faculty moreover,
but not faculty walled in by the Sense. It is faculty
and capacity in one, which, possessing inherent within itself,
as objects, the <i>a priori</i> conditional laws of the Universe, and
the <i>a priori</i> conditional ideal forms which these laws, standing
together according to their necessary relations, compose,
transcends, in its activity and acquisitions, all limitations
of a <i>Nature</i>; and attends to objects which belong to the
Supernatural, and hence which absoluteness qualifies. We
observe, therefore,</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The objects of its activity are also essentially diverse
in kind from those of the Sense and the Understanding. All
the objects of the Sense must come primarily or secondarily,
from a material Universe; and the discussions and conclusions
of the Understanding must refer to such a Universe.
The faculty which we seek must have for its objects, <i>laws</i>,
or, if the term suit better, first principles, which are reasons
why conduct must be one way, and not another; which, in
their combinations, compose the forms conditional for all
activity; and which, therefore, constitute within us an <i>a priori</i>
standard by which to determine the validity of all judgments.
To illustrate. Linn&aelig;us constructed a system of botanical
classification, upon the basis of the number of stamens in a
flower. This was satisfactory to the Sense and the Understanding.
Later students have, however, discovered that
certain <i>organic laws</i> extend as a framework through the
whole vegetable kingdom; which, once seen, throw back the
Linn&aelig;an system into company with the Ptolemaic Astronomy;
and upon which laws a <i>science</i> of Botany becomes possible.
That faculty which intuits these laws, is called the
Pure Reason.<span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>To recapitulate. What we seek is, in its modes and objects
of activity, diverse from the Sense and Understanding.
It is at once capacity and faculty, having as object first principles,
possessing these as an <i>inherent heritage</i>, and able to
compare with them as standard all objects of the Sense and
judgments of the Understanding; and to decide thereby
their validity. These principles, and combinations of principles,
are known as <i>Ideas</i>, and, being innate, are denominated
<i>innate Ideas</i>. It is their reality which Sir William
Hamilton denies, declaring them to be only higher generalizations
of the Understanding, and it is the faculty called the
Pure Reason, in which they are supposed to inhere, whose
actuality is now to be proved.</p>

<p>The effort to do this will be successful if it can be shown
that the logician's statement of the facts is partial, and essentially
defective; what are the phenomena which cannot be
comprehended in his scheme; and, finally, that they can be
accounted for on no other ground than that stated.</p>

<p>1. The statement of facts by the Limitists is partial and
essentially defective. They start with the assumption that a
generalization is the highest form of human knowledge. To
appreciate this fully, let us examine the process they thus
exalt. A generalization is a process of thought through
which one advances from a discursus among facts, to a conclusion,
embodying a seemingly general truth, common to all
the facts of the class. For instance. The inhabitants of
the north temperate zone have long observed it to be a fact,
that north winds are cold; and so have arrived at the general
conclusion that such winds will lower the temperature.
A more extensive experience teaches them, however, that in
the south temperate zone, north winds are warm, and their
judgment has to be modified accordingly. A yet larger investigation
shows that, at one period in geologic history,
north winds, even in northern climes, were warm, and that
tropical animals flourished in arctic regions; and the judgment
is again modified. Now observe this most important<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
fact here brought out. <i>Every judgment may be modified by
a larger experience.</i> Apply this to another class of facts.
An apple is seen to fall when detached from the parent stem.
An arrow, projected into the air, returns again. An invisible
force keeps the moon in its orbit. Other like phenomena are
observed; and, after patient investigation, it is found to be
a fact, that there is a force in the system to which our planet
belongs, which acts in a ratio inverse to the square of the
distance, and which thus binds it together. But if a
generalization is the highest form of knowledge, we can never be
sure we are right, for a subsequent experience may teach us
the reverse. We know we have not <i>all the facts</i>. We may
again find that the north wind is elsewhere, or was once here,
warm. Should a being come flying to us from another sphere
so distant, that the largest telescope could catch no faintest
ray, even, of its shining, and testify to us that there, the force
we called gravitation, was inversely as the <i>cube</i> of the distance,
we could only accept the testimony, and modify our
judgment accordingly. Conclusions of to-day may be errors
to-morrow; and we can never know we are right. The Limitists
permit us only interminable examinations of interminable
changes in phenomena; which afford no higher result
than a new basis for new studies.</p>

<p>From this wearisome, Io-like wandering, the soul returns
to itself, crying its wailing cry, "Is this true? Is this all?"
when suddenly, as if frenzied by the presence of a god, it
shouts exultingly "The truth! the truth! I see the eternal
truth."</p>

<p>The assumption of the Limitists is not all the truth. Their
diagnosis is both defective and false. It is defective, in that
they have failed to perceive those qualities of <i>universality</i>
and <i>necessity</i>, which most men instinctively accord to certain
perceptions of the mind; and false, in that they deny the
reality of those qualities, and of the certain perceptions as
modified by them, and the actuality of that mental faculty
which gives the perceptions, and thus qualified. They state a<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
part of the truth, and deny a part. The whole truth is, the
mind both generalizes and intuits.</p>

<p>It is the <i>essential</i> tenet of their whole scheme, that the
human mind nowhere, and under no circumstance, makes an
affirmation which it unreservedly qualifies as necessary and
universal. Their doctrine is, that these affirmations <i>seem</i> to
be such, but that a searching examination shows this seeming
to be only a bank of fog. For instance. The mind seems
to affirm that two and two <i>must</i> make four. "Not so," says
the Limitist. "As a fact, we see that two and two do make
four, but it may make five, or any other sum. For don't you
see? if two and two must make four, then the Infinite must
see it so; and if he must see it so, he is thereby conditioned;
and what is worse, we know just as much about it as he does."
In reply to all such quibbles, it is to be said,&mdash;there is no
seeming about it! If the mind is not utterly mendacious, it
affirms, positively and unreservedly, "Two and two are four,
<i>must</i> be four; and to see it so, <i>is conditional for</i> <span class="smcap">all</span> <i>intellect</i>."
Take another illustration. The mind instinctively, often unconsciously,
always compulsorily, affirms that the sentiment,
In society the rights of the individual can never trench upon
the rights of the body politic,&mdash;is a necessary, and universally
applicable principle; which, however much it may be violated,
can never be changed. The whole fabric of society is
based upon this. Could a mind think this away, it could not
construct a practical system of society upon what would be
left,&mdash;its negation. But the Limitists step in here, and say,
"All this seems so, perhaps, but then the mind is so weak,
that it can never be sure. You must modify (correct?) this
seeming, by the consideration that, if it is so, then the Infinite
must know it so, and the finite and Infinite must know
it alike, and the Infinite will be limited and conditioned
thereby, which would be impious." Again, the intellect unreservedly
asserts, "There is no seeming in the matter. The
utterance is true, absolutely and universally true, and every
intellect <i>must</i> see it so."<span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>Illustrations like the above might be drawn from every
science of which the human mind is cognizant. But more are
not needed. Enough has been adduced to establish the <i>fact</i>
of those qualities, universality and necessity, as inherent
in certain mental affirmations. Having thus pointed out the
essential defect of the logician's scheme, it is required to state:</p>

<p>2. What the phenomena are which cannot be comprehended
therein.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that all those perceptions and
assertions of the mind, which are instinctive, and which it
involuntarily qualifies as universal and necessary, are not,
and cannot be comprehended in Sir William Hamilton's
scheme. To give an exhaustive presentation of all the
<i>a priori</i> laws of the mind, would be beyond the scope of
the present undertaking, and would be unnecessary to its
success. This will be secured by presenting a classification
of them, and sufficient examples under each class. Moreover,
to avoid a labor which would not be in place here, we
shall attempt no new classification; but shall accept without
question, as ample for our purpose, that set forth by one of
our purest and every way best thinkers,&mdash;Rev. Mark Hopkins,
D. D., President of Williams College, Mass.</p>

<p>"The ideas and beliefs which come to us thus, may be
divided into, first, mathematical ideas and axioms. These
are at the foundation of the abstract sciences, having for
their subject, quantity. In the second division are those
which pertain to mere being and its relations. Upon these
rest all sciences pertaining to actual being and its relations.
The third division comprises those which pertain to beauty.
These are at the foundation of &aelig;sthetical science. In the
fourth division are those which pertain to morals and religion.
Of these the pervading element is the sense of obligation
or duty. Of this the idea necessarily arises in connection
with the choice by a rational being of a supreme end,
and with the performance of actions supposed to bear upon
that."&mdash;<i>Moral Science</i>, p. 161.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>First.&mdash;Mathematical ideas and axioms.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the multiplication table. Can any one,
except a Limitist, be induced to believe that it was originally
<i>constructed</i>; that a will put it together, and might take it
apart? Seven times seven now make forty-nine. Will
any one say that it might have been made to make forty-seven;
or that at some future time such may be the case?
Or again, take the axiom "Things which are equal to the
same thing are equal to one another." Will some one say,
that the intellectual beings in the universe might, with equal
propriety, have been so constructed as to affirm that, in some
instances, things which are equal to the same thing are <i>unequal</i>
to one another? Or consider the properties of a triangle.
Will our limitist teachers instruct us that these properties are
a matter of indifference; that for aught we know, the triangle
might have been made to have three right angles? Yet
again. Examine the syllogism. Was its law constructed?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All M is X;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Z is M;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Z is X.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Will any one say that <i>perhaps</i>, we don't know but it might
have been so made, as to appear to us that the conclusion
was Some Z is not X? Or will the Limitists run into that
miserable petty subterfuge of an assertion, "All this <i>seems</i>
to us as it is, and we cannot see how it could be different;
but then, our minds are so feeble, they are confined in such
narrow limits, that it would be the height of presumption to
assert positively with regard to stronger minds, and those of
wider scope? Perhaps they see things differently." <i>Perhaps</i>
they do; but if they do, their minds or ours falsify! The
question is one of <i>veracity</i>, nothing more. Throughout all the
range of mathematics, the positive and <i>unqualified</i> affirmation
of the mind is that its intuitions are absolute and universal;
that they are <i>a priori</i> laws conditional of <i>all</i> intellect; that
of the Deity just as much as that of man. Feebleness and
want of scope have nothing to do with mind in its affirmation,<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
"Seven times seven <i>must</i> make forty-nine; <i>and cannot by
any possibility of effort make any other product</i>;" and every
intellect, <i>if it sees at all, must see it so</i>. And so on through
the catalogue. From this, it follows in this instance, that
human knowledge is <i>exhaustive</i>, and so is exactly similar,
and equal to the Deity's knowledge.</p>

<p>Second. Those ideas and beliefs which pertain to mere
being and its relations.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the axiom, A material body cannot exist
in the Universe without standing in some relation to all
the other material bodies in that Universe. Either this is
absolutely true, or it is not. If it is so true, then every intellectual
being to whom it presents itself as object at all,
must see it as every other does. One may see more relations
than another; but the axiom in its intrinsic nature must
be seen alike by all. If it is not absolutely true, then the
converse, or any partially contradictory proposition, may be
true. For example. A material body may exist in the Universe,
and stand in no relation to some of the other material
bodies in that Universe. But, few men will hesitate to say,
that this is not only utterly unthinkable, but that it could only
become thinkable by a denial and destruction of the laws of
thought; or, in other words, by the stultification of the mind.</p>

<p>Take another instance, arising from the fact of parentage
and offspring, in the sentient beings of the world. A pair,
no matter to what class they belong, by the fact of becoming
parents, establish a new relation for themselves; and, "after
their kind," they are under bonds to their young. And, to a
greater or less extent, their young have a claim upon them.
As we ascend in the scale of being, the duty imposed is
greater, and the claim of the offspring stronger. Whether
it be the fierce eagle, or the timid dove, or the chirping sparrow;
whether it be the prowling lion, or the distrustful deer,
or the cowering hare; or whether it be the races of man who
are examined, the relations established by parentage are
everywhere recognized. Now, will one say that all this<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
might be changed for aught we know; that, what we call
law, is only a judgment of mankind; and so that this relation
did not exist at first, but was the product of growth?
And will one further say that there is no necessity or universality
in this relation; but that the races might, for aught
we know, have just as well been established with a parentage
which involved no relation at all; that the fabled indifference
of the ostrich, intensified a hundredfold, might have been the
law of sentient being? Yet such results logically flow from
the principles of the Limitists. Precisely the same line of
argument might be pursued respecting the laws of human
society. But it is not needed here. It is evident now, that
what gives validity to judgments <i>is the fact that they accord
with an a priori principle in the mind</i>.</p>

<p>Third. The ideas and beliefs which pertain to beauty.
A science of beauty has not yet been sufficiently developed
to permit of so extensive an illustration of this class as the
others. Yet enough is established for our purpose. Let us
consider beauty as in proportioned form. It is said that certain
Greek mathematicians, subsequently to the Christian
era, studied out a mathematical formula for the human body,
and constructed a statue according to it; and that both were
pronounced at the time <i>perfect</i>. Both statue and formula
are now lost. Be the story true, or a legend, there is valid
ground for the assertion, that the mind instinctively assumes,
in all its criticisms, the axiom, There is a perfect ideal by
which as standard, all art must be judged. The very fact
that the mind, though acknowledging the imperfection of its
own ideal, unconsciously asserts, that somewhere, in some
mind, there is an ideal, in which a perfect hand joins a perfect
arm, and a perfect foot a perfect leg, and these a perfect
trunk; and a perfect neck supports a perfect head, adorned
by perfect features, and thus there is a perfect ideal, is <i>decisive</i>
that such an ideal exists. And this conclusion is true,
because God who made us, and constructed the ground from
whence this instinctive affirmation springs, is true.<span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>Take another instance. Few men, who have studied
Gothic spires, have failed to observe that the height of some,
in proportion to their base, is too great, and that of others,
too small. The mind irresistibly affirms, that between these
opposite imperfections, there is a golden mean, at which the
proportion shall be <i>perfect</i>. When the formula of this proportion
shall be studied out, any workman, who is skilled
with tools, can construct a perfect spire. The law once discovered
and promulgated, becomes common knowledge. Mechanical
skill will be all that can differentiate one workman
from another. The fact that the law has not been discovered
yet, throws no discredit upon the positive affirmation of the
mind, that there must be such a law; any more than the fact
of Newton's ignorance of the law of gravitation, when he
saw the apple fall, discredited his instinctive affirmation, upon
seeing that phenomenon, there is a law in accordance with
which it fell.</p>

<p>Now how comes the mind instinctively and positively to
make these assertions. If they were judgments, the mind
would only speak of probabilities; but here, it qualifies the
assertion with necessity. Men, however positive in their
temperament, do not say, "I know it will rain to-morrow,"
but only, "In all probability it will." Not so here. Here
the mind refuses to express itself doubtfully. Its utterance
is the extreme of positiveness. It says <i>must</i>. And if its
affirmation is not true, then there is no <i>reason</i> why those
works of art which are held in highest esteem, should be
adjudged better than the efforts of the tyro, except the whim
of the individual, or the arbitrary determination of their
admirers.</p>

<p>Fourth. The ideas and beliefs which pertain to morals
and religion.</p>

<p>We now enter a sphere of which no understanding could
by any possibility ever guess, much less investigate. Here
no sense could ever penetrate; there is no object for it to
perceive. Here all judgments are impertinent; for in this<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
sphere are only laws, and duties, and obligations. An understanding
cannot "conceive" of a moral law, because such
a law is inconceivable; and it cannot perceive one, because
it has no eye. If it were competent to explain every phenomenon
in the other classes, it would be utterly impotent
to explain a single phenomenon in this. What is moral obligation?
Whence does it arise, or how is it imposed? and
who will enforce it, and how will it be enforced? All these,
and numerous such other questions, cannot be raised even
by the Understanding, much less answered by it. The moral
law of the Universe is one which can be learned from no
judgment, or combination of judgments. It can be learned
only by being <i>seen</i>. The moral law is no conclusion, which
may be modified by a subsequent experience. It is an affirmation
which is <i>imperative</i>. To illustrate. It is an axiom,
that the fact of free moral agency involves the fact of obligation.
Man is a free moral agent; and so, under the obligation
imposed. At the first, it was optional with the Deity
whether he would create man or not. But will any one
assert that, having determined to create man such as he is, it
was optional with him, whether man should be under the
obligation, or not? Can man be a free moral agent, and be
free from the duties inherent therein? Does not the mind
instinctively and necessarily affirm, that the fact of free moral
agency assures the fact of such a relation to God's moral
government, that obligation <i>must</i> follow? One cannot hesitate
to say, that the formula, A free agent may be released
from his obligation to moral law, is absolutely unthinkable.</p>

<p>Again, no judgment can attain to the moral law of the
Universe; and yet man knows it. Jesus Christ, when he
proclaimed that law in the words "Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy mind and strength, and thy neighbor
as thyself," only uttered what no man can, in thought, deny.
A man can no more think selfishness as the moral law of
the Universe, than he can think two and two to be five. Man
not only sees the law, but he feels and acknowledges the<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
obligation, even in his rebellion. In fact there would be
no rebellion, no sense of sin, if there were no obligation.
Whence comes the authority of the law? No power can
give it authority, or enforce obedience. Power can crush a
Universe, it cannot change a heart. The law has, and can
have authority; it imposes, and can impose obligation; only
because <i>it is an a priori law of the Universe</i>, alike binding
upon <i>all</i> moral beings, upon God as well as man; and is
so seen immediately, and necessarily, by a direct intuition.
Man finds this law fundamental to his self; and as well, a
necessarily fundamental law of <i>all</i> moral beings. <i>Therefore</i>
he acknowledges it. And the very efforts he makes to set
up a throne for Passion, over against the throne of Benevolence,
is an involuntary acknowledgment of the authority of
that law he seeks to rival.</p>

<p>It was said above, that neither Sense nor Understanding
can take any cognizance of the objects of investigation which
fall in this class. This is because the Sense can gather no
material over which the Understanding can run. Is the
moral law matter? No. How then can the Sense observe
it? One answer may possibly be made, viz.: It is deduced
from the conduct of men; and sense observes that. To this
it is replied</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The allegation is not true. Most men violate the moral
law of the Universe. Their conduct accords with the law
of selfishness. Such conclusions as that of Hobbes, that war
is the natural condition of Society, are those which would
follow from a consideration of man, as he appears to the
Sense.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> If it were true, the question obtrudes itself,&mdash;How came
it there? <i>How came this fundamental law to be?</i> and to this
the Sense and Understanding return no shadow of answer.</p>

<p>But from the stand-point of a Pure Reason, all is clear.
All the ideas and beliefs, every process of thought which
belongs to this sphere, are absolute and universal. They
must be what they are; and so are conditional of all moral<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
beings. Here what the human mind sees, is just what the
Deity sees; and it sees just as the Divine mind sees, so that
the truth, as far as so seen, is <i>common</i> to both.</p>

<p>Although the facts which have been adduced above, are
inexplicable by the Limitists, and are decisive of the actuality
of the Reason, as it has been heretofore described, yet
another line of argument of great wight must not be omitted.
There are in language certain <i>positive</i> terms, which
the Limitists, and the advocates of the Reason agree in
asserting cannot convey any meaning to, or be explained by
the Sense and Understanding. Such are the words infinite
and absolute. The mere presence of such words in language,
as positive terms, is a decisive evidence of the fact, that there
is also a faculty which entertains positive ideas corresponding
to them. Sir William Hamilton's position in this matter, is
not only erroneous, but astonishing. He asserts that these
words express only "negative notions." "They," the infinite
and absolute, "can be conceived only by a thinking away
from, or abstraction of, those very conditions under which
thought itself is realized; consequently, the notion of the
Unconditioned is only negative&mdash;negative of the conceivable
itself." But, if this is true, how came these words in the
language at all? Negative ideas produce negative expressions.
Indeed, the Limitists are confidently challenged to
designate another case in language, in which a positive term
can be alleged to have a <i>purely</i> negative signification. Take
an illustration to which we shall recur further on. The
question has been raised, whether a sixth sense can be. Can
the Limitists find in language, or can they construct, a positive
term which will represent the negation of a sixth sense?
We find in language the positive terms, ear and hearing; but
can such positive terms be found, which will correspond to
the phrase, no sixth sense? In this instance, in physics, the
absurdity is seen at once. Why is not as readily seen the
equal absurdity of affirming that, in metaphysics, positive
terms have grown up in the language which are simple<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
negations? Here, for the present, the presentation of facts
may rest. Let us recapitulate those which have been adduced.
The axioms in mathematics, the principles of the
relations of being, the laws of &aelig;sthetics, and most of all the
whole system of principles pertaining to morals and religion,
standing, as they do, a series of mental affirmations, which
all mankind, except the Limitists, qualify as necessary and
universal, compel assent to the proposition, that there must
be a faculty different in kind from the Sense and Understanding,&mdash;for
these have already been found impotent&mdash;which
can be ground to account of all these facts satisfactorily.
And the presence in language of such positive terms
as absolute and infinite, is a most valuable auxiliary argument.
The faculty which is required,&mdash;the faculty which
qualifies all the products of its activity with the characteristics
above named, is the Pure Reason. And its actuality
may therefore be deemed established.</p>

<p>The Pure Reason having thus been proved to be, it is next
required to show the mode of its activity. This can best be
done, by first noticing the <i>kind</i> of results which it produces.
The Reason gives us, not thoughts, but ideas. These are
simple, pure, primary, necessary. It is evident that any such
object of mental examination can be known only in, and by,
itself. It cannot be analyzed, for it is simple. It cannot
be compared, for it is pure; and so possesses no element
which can be ground for a comparison. It cannot be deduced,
for it is primary and necessary. <i>It can only be seen.</i>
Such an object must be known under the following circumstances.
It must be inherent in the seeing faculty, and must
be <i>immediately and directly seen</i> by that faculty; all this in
such a manner, that the abstraction of the object seen, would
annihilate the faculty itself. Now, how is it with the Reason?
Above we found it to be both capacity and faculty:
capacity in that it possessed as integral elements, <i>a priori</i>
first principles, as objects of sight; faculty in that it saw,
brought forward, and made available, those principles. The<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
mode of activity of the Pure Reason is then a <i>seeing</i>, direct,
immediate, <i>sure</i>; which holds pure truth <i>fast</i>, right in the
very centre of the field of vision. This act of the Reason in
thus seeing pure truth is best denominated an intuition of
the Reason. And here it may be said,&mdash;If perception and
perceive could be strictly confined to the Sense; concept and
conceive to the Understanding; and intuition and intuit to
the Reason, a great gain would be made in accuracy of expression
regarding these departments of the mind.</p>

<p>Having thus, as it is believed, established the fact of the
existence of a Pure Reason, and shown the mode of its
activity, it devolves to declare the function of that faculty.</p>

<p>The function of the Pure Reason is, first:&mdash;to intuit, by
an immediate perception, the <i>a priori</i> elemental principles
which condition all being; second,&mdash;to intuit, by a like immediate
perception, those principles, combined in <i>a priori</i>
systematic processes, which are the conditional ideal forms
for all being; and third,&mdash;again to intuit, by another immediate
perception, precisely similar in kind to the others, the
fact, at least, of the perfectly harmonious combination of all
<i>a priori</i> elemental principles, in all possible systematic processes,
into a perfect unity,&mdash;an absolute, infinite Person,&mdash;God.</p>

<p>To illustrate.</p>

<p>1. The Reason asserts that "Malice is criminal;" and
that it is <i>necessarily</i> criminal; or, in other words, that no act,
of any will, can make it otherwise than it is. The assertion,
then, that "Malice is criminal," is an axiom, and conditions
all being, God as well as man.</p>

<p>2. The Reason asserts that every mathematical form must
be seen in Space and Time, and it affirms the same necessity
in this as in the former case.</p>

<p>3. The full illustration of this point would be Anselm's
<i>a priori</i> argument for the existence of God. His statement
of it should, however, be so modified as to appear, not as an
<i>a priori</i> argument for the existence of God, but as an ampli<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>fied
declaration of the fact, that the existence of God is a
first principle of Reason; and as such, can no more be denied
than the multiplication table. Objection.&mdash;This doctrine
degrades God to the level of the finite; both being
alike conditioned. Answer.&mdash;By no means; as will be
seen from the two following points.</p>

<p>1. It is universally acknowledged that God must be self-existent,
which means, if it means anything, that the existence
of God is <i>beyond his own control</i>; or, in other words,
that self-existence is an <i>a priori</i> elemental principle, which
conditions God's existing at all.</p>

<p>2. In the two instances under consideration, the word condition
has entirely different significations. God is conditioned
only by <i>Himself</i>. Not only is this conditioning not a limitation,
properly speaking, but the very absence of limitation.
The fact that He is absolute and infinite, is a condition of
His existence. Man's conditions are the very opposite of
these. He is relative, instead of absolute; finite, instead
of infinite; dependent, instead of self-existent. Hence he
differs in <i>kind</i> from God as do his conditions.</p>

<p>Such being the function of the Pure Reason, it is fully
competent to solve the difficulties raised by Sir William
Hamilton and his followers; and the statement of such
solution is the work immediately in hand.</p>

<p>Much of the difficulty and obscurity which have, thus far,
attended every discussion of this subject, will be removed by
examining the definitions given to certain terms;&mdash;either
by statement, or by implication in the use made of them;&mdash;by
exposing the errors involved; and by clearly expressing
the true signification of each term.</p>

<p>By way of criticism the general statement may be made,&mdash;that
the Limitists&mdash;as was natural from their rejection of
the faculty of the Pure Reason&mdash;use only such terms, and
in such senses, as are pertinent to those subjects which come
under the purvey of the Understanding and the Sense; but
which are entirely impertinent, in reference to the sphere of<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
spiritual subjects. The two following phases of this error
are sufficient to illustrate the criticism.</p>

<p>1. The terms Infinite and Absolute are used to express
abstractions. For instance, "<i>the infinite</i>, from a human point
of view, is merely a name for the absence of those conditions
under which thought is possible." "It is thus manifest that
a consciousness of the Absolute is equally self-contradictory
with that of the Infinite."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i>,
pp. 94 and 96. If asked "Absolute" what? "Infinite"
what? Will you allow person, or other definite term to be
supplied? Mansel would reply&mdash;No! no possible answer
can be given by man.</p>

<p>Now, without passing at all upon the question whether
these terms can represent concrete objects of thought or not,
it is to be said, that the use of them to express abstract notions,
is utterly unsound. The mere fact of abstraction is
an undoubted limitation. There may be an Infinite and Absolute
Person. By no possibility can there be an abstract
Infinite.</p>

<p>2. But a more glaring and unpardonable error is made by
the Limitists in their use of the words infinite and absolute,
as expressing quantity. Take a few examples from many.</p>

<p>"For example, we can positively conceive, neither an absolute
whole, that is, a whole so great that we cannot also
conceive it as a relative part of a still greater whole; nor an
absolute part, that is, a part so small, that we cannot also
conceive it as a relative whole, divisible into smaller parts.
On the other hand, we cannot positively represent, or realize,
or construe to the mind (as here understanding and imagination
coincide), an infinite whole, for this could only be done
by the infinite synthesis in thought of finite wholes which
would itself require an infinite time for its accomplishment;
nor, for the same reason, can we follow out in thought an
infinite divisibility of parts."&mdash;<i>Hamilton's Essays</i>, p. 20.</p>

<p>"The metaphysical representation of the Deity as absolute
and infinite, must necessarily, as the profoundest meta<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>physicians
have acknowledged, amount to nothing less than
the sum of all reality."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i>, p. 76.</p>

<p>"Is the First Cause finite or infinite?... To think
of the First Cause as finite, is to think of it as limited. To
think of it as limited, necessarily implies a conception of
something beyond its limits; it is absolutely impossible to
conceive a thing as bounded, without conceiving a region surrounding
its boundaries."&mdash;<i>Spencer's First Principles</i>, p. 37.</p>

<p>The last extract tempts one to ask Mr. Spencer if he ever
stood on the north side of the affections. Besides the extracts
selected, any person reading the authors above named,
will find numerous phrases like these: "infinite whole," "infinite
sum," "infinite number," "infinite series," by which
they express sometimes a mathematical, and sometimes a
material amount.</p>

<p>Upon this whole topic it is to be said, that the terms infinite
and absolute have, and can have, no relevancy to any
object of the Sense or of the Understanding, judging according
to the Sense, or to any number. There is no
whole, no sum, no number, no amount, but is definite and
limited; and to use those words with the word infinite, is as
absurd as to say an infinite finite. And to use words thus,
is to "multiply words without knowledge."</p>

<p>Again, the lines of thought which these writers pursue, do
not tend in any degree to clear up the fogs in which they
have lost themselves, but only make the muddle thicker.
Take, for instance, the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thus we are landed in an inextricable dilemma. The
Absolute cannot be conceived as conscious, neither can it be
conceived as unconscious; it cannot be conceived as complex,
neither can it be conceived as simple; it cannot be conceived
by difference, neither can it be conceived by the absence of
difference; it cannot be identified with the Universe, neither
can it be distinguished from it. The One and the Many,
regarded as the beginning of existence, are thus alike incomprehensible."&mdash;<i>Limits
of Religious Thought</i>, p. 79.<span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>The soul, while oaring her way with weary wing, over the
watery waste of such a philosophy, can find no rest for the
sole of her foot, except on that floating carcase of a doctrine,
Chaos is God. The simple fact that such confusion logically
results from the premises of the Limitists, is a sufficient warrant
for rejecting their whole system of thought,&mdash;principle
and process; and for striking for a new base of operations.
But where shall such a base be sought for? On what immutable
Ararat can the soul find her ark, and a sure resting-place?
Man seeks a Rock upon which he can climb and cry,
I <span class="smcap">know</span> that this is truth. Where is the Everlasting Rock?
In our search for the answer to these queries, we may be
aided by setting forth the goal to be reached,&mdash;the object to
be obtained.</p>

<p>By observation and reflection man comes to know that he
is living in, and forms part of, a system of things, which he
comprehensively terms the Universe. The problem is,&mdash;<i>To
find an Ultimate Ground, a Final Cause, which shall be
adequate to account for the existence and sustentation of this
Universe</i>. There are but two possible directions from which
the solution of this problem can come. It must be found
either within the Universe, or without the Universe.</p>

<p>Can it be found within the Universe? If it can, one of
two positions must be true. Either a part of the Universe
is cause for the existence of the whole of the Universe; or
the Universe is self-existent. Upon the first position nothing
need be said. Its absurdity is manifested in the very statement
of it. A full discussion, or, in fact, anything more than
a notice of the doctrine of Pantheism, set forth in the second
point, would be beyond the intention of the author. The
questions at issue lie not between theists and pantheists, but
between those who alike reject Pantheism as erroneous. The
writer confesses himself astonished that a class of rational
men could ever have been found, who should have attempted
to find the Ultimate Ground of the Universe <i>in itself</i>. All
that man can know of the facts of the Universe, he learns<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
by observation; and the sum of the knowledge he thus gains
is, that a vast system of physical objects exists. From the
facts observed, he draws conclusions: but the stream cannot
rise higher than its fountain. With reference to any lesser
object, as a watch, the same process goes on. A watch is.
It has parts; and these parts move in definite relations to
each other; and to secure a given object. If now, any person,
upon being asked to account for the existence of the
watch, should confine himself wholly to an examination of
the nature of the springs, the wheels, the hands, face, &amp;c.,
endeavoring to find the reason of its being within itself, the
world would laugh at him. How much more justly may the
world laugh, yea, shout its ridicule, at the mole-eyed man
who rummages among the springs and wheels of the vast
machine of the Universe, to find the reason of <i>its</i> being. In
the former instance, the bystander would exclaim,&mdash;"The
watch is an evidence of intelligence. Man is the only intelligent
being on the earth; and is superior to the watch.
Man made the watch." And his assertion would be true.
<i>A fortiori</i> would a bystander of the Universe exclaim, "The
Universe is an evidence of intelligence. An intelligent Being,
superior to the Universe, made the Universe." And his
assertion is true. We are driven then to our last position;
but it is the Gibraltar of Philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ultimate Ground of the Universe must Be
sought for, and can only be found, without
the Universe.</span></p>

<p>From this starting-point alone can we proceed, with any
hope of reaching the goal. Setting out on our new course
we will gain a step by noticing a fact involved in the illustration
just given. The bystander exclaims, "The watch is
an evidence of intelligence." In this very utterance is necessarily
expressed the fact of two diverse spheres of existence:
the one the sphere of matter, the other the sphere of
mind. One cannot think of matter except as inferior, nor<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
of mind except as superior. These two, matter and mind,
comprise all possible existence. The Reason not only cannot
see <i>how</i> any other existence can be, but affirms <i>that</i> no
other can be. Mind, then, is the Ultimate Ground of the
Universe. What mind?</p>

<p>By examination, man perceives what appears to be an
order in the Universe, concludes that there is such an order,
assumes the conclusion to be valid, and names the order Nature.
Turning his eye upon himself, he finds himself not
only associated with, but, through a portion of his faculties,
forming a part of that Nature. But a longer, sharper scrutiny,
a profounder examination, reveals to him his soul's most
secret depth; and the fact of his spiritual personality glows
refulgent in the calm light of consciousness. He sees himself,
indeed, in Nature; but he thrills with joy at the quickly
acquired knowledge that Nature is only a nest, in which he,
a purely supernatural being, must flutter for a time, until he
shall be grown, and ready to plume his flight for the Spirit
Land. If then, man, though bound in Nature, finds his central
self utterly diverse from, and superior to Nature, so that
he instinctively cries, "My soul is worth more than a Universe
of gold and diamonds;" <i>a fortiori</i> must that Being,
who is the Ultimate Ground, not only of Nature, but of those
supernatural intelligences who live in Nature, be supernatural,
spiritual, and supreme?</p>

<p>Just above, it was seen that matter and mind comprise all
possible existence. It has now been found that mind, in its
highest form, even in man, is pure spirit; and as such, wholly
supernatural. It has further been determined, that the object
of our search must be the Supreme Spirit.</p>

<p>Just at this point it is suitable to notice, what is, perhaps,
the most egregious and unpardonable blunder the Limitists
have made. In order to do this satisfactorily, the following
analysis of the human mind is presented. The soul is a
spiritual person, and an animal nature. To this animal nature
belong the Sense and the Understanding. It is universally<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
acknowledged,&mdash;at least the Limitists will not deny,&mdash;that
the Sense and the Understanding are wholly within, and
conditioned by Nature. Observe then their folly. They
deny that a part can account for a whole; they reject Pantheism;
<i>and yet they employ only those faculties which they
confess are wholly within and conditioned by Nature</i>&mdash;for
they deny the existence of the Pure Reason, the perceptive
faculty of the spiritual person&mdash;<i>to search, only in Nature,
for the cause of Nature</i>. A fly would buzz among the wheels
of a clock to as little purpose.</p>

<p>The result arrived at just above, now claims our careful
attention.</p>

<p><i>The Ultimate Ground of the Universe is</i> <span class="smcap">the Supreme
Spirit</span>.</p>

<p>To appreciate this result, we must return to our analysis
of man. In his spiritual personality we have found him
wholly supernatural. We have further found that, only as a
spiritual person is he capable of pursuing this investigation to
a final and valid termination. If, then, we would complete our
undertaking, we must ascend into a sphere whose light no
eagle's eye can ever bear; and whose atmosphere his daring
wing can never beat. There no sense can ever enter; no
judgments are needed. Through Reason&mdash;the soul's far-darting
eye,&mdash;and through Reason alone, can we gaze on the
Immutable.</p>

<p>Turning this searching eye upon ourselves, we find that
man, as spiritual person, is a Pure Reason,&mdash;the faculty
which gives him <i>a priori</i> first principles, as the standard for
conduct and the forms for activity,&mdash;a Spiritual Sensibility,
which answers with emotive music to the call of the Reason;
and lastly, a Will, in which the Person dwells central, solitary,
and supreme, the final arbiter of its own destiny.
Every such being is therefore a miniature final cause.</p>

<p>The goal of our search must be near at hand. In man
appears the very likeness of the Being we seek. His highest
powers unmistakably shadow forth the form of that Being,<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
who is The Final. Man originates; but he is dependent
for his power, and the sphere of that power is confined to
his own soul. We seek a being who can originate, who is
utterly independent; and the sphere of whose activity extends
wherever, without himself, he chooses. Man, after a
process of culture, comes to intuit some first principles, in
some combinations. We seek a being who necessarily sees,
at once and forever, all possible first principles, in all possible
relations, as the ideal forms for all possible effort. Man
stumbles along on the road of life, frequently ignorant of
the way, but more frequently perversely violating the eternal
law which he finds written on his heart. We seek a being
who never stumbles, but who is perfectly wise; and whose
conduct is in immutable accord with the <i>a priori</i> standards
of his Reason. Man is a spiritual person, dependent for existence,
and limited to himself in his exertions. He whom
we seek will be found to be also a spiritual person who is
self-existent, and who sets his own bounds to his activity.</p>

<p>That the line of thought we are now pursuing is the true
one, and that the result which we approach, and are about
to utter, is well founded, receives decisive confirmation from
the following facts. Man perceives that malice must be
criminal. Just so the Eternal Eye must see it. A similar
remark is true of mathematical, and all other <i>a priori</i> laws.
Sometimes, at least, there awakens in man's bosom the unutterable
thrill of benevolence; and thus he tastes of the crystal
river which flows, calmly and forever, through the bosom
of the "Everlasting Father." For his own conduct, man is
the final cause. In this is he, must he be, the likeness of
the Ultimate. Spiritual personality is the highest possible
form of being. It is then a form common to God and man.
Here, therefore, Philosophy and Revelation are at one.
With startling, and yet grateful unanimity, they affirm the
solemn truth, "<span class="smcap">God made man in his own image</span>."</p>

<p>We reach the goal at last. The Final Truth stands full
in the field of our vision. "I am Alpha and Omega, the<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
beginning and the ending, saith Jehovah, who is, and who
was, and who is to come, the Almighty." <span class="smcap">That spiritual
Person who is self-existent, absolute, and infinite,
is the Ultimate Ground, the Final Cause of the
Universe.</span></p>

<p>The problem of the Universe is solved. We stand within
the portico of the sublime temple of truth. Mortal has lifted,
at last, the veil of Isis, and looked upon the eternal mysteries.</p>

<p>It is manifest now, how irrelevant and irreverent those
expressions must be, in which the terms infinite and absolute
are employed as signifying abstractions or amounts. They
can have no meaning with reference to the Universe. But
what their true significance is, stands out with unmistakable
clearness and precision.</p>

<p>1. <i>Absoluteness is that distinctive spiritual</i> <span class="smcap">quality</span> <i>of the
necessary Being which establishes Him as unqualified except
by Himself, and as complete</i>.</p>

<p>2. Absoluteness and Unconditionedness are,&mdash;the one the
positive, and the other the negative term expressive of the
same idea.</p>

<p>3. <i>Infinity is that distinctive spiritual</i> <span class="smcap">quality</span> <i>of the
necessary Being which gives to Him universality</i>.</p>

<p>Absoluteness and Infinity are, then, spiritual qualities of
the self-existent Person, which, distinguishing Him from all
other persons, constitute Him unique and supreme.</p>

<p>It is a law of Logic, which even the child must acknowledge,
that whenever, by a process of thought, a result has
been attained and set forth, he who propounds the result is
directly responsible for all that is logically involved in it.
The authority of that law is here both acknowledged and
invoked. The most rigid and exhaustive logical development
of the premises heretofore obtained, which the human
mind is capable of, is challenged, in the confidence that
there can be found therein no jot of discrepancy, no tittle
of contradiction. As germain, and important to the matter
in hand, some steps in this development will be noted.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>In solving the problem placed before us, viz: To account
for the being and continuance of the Universe, we have
found that the Universe and its Cause are two distinct and
yet intimately and necessarily connected beings, the one dependent
upon the other, and that other utterly independent;
and so that the one is limited and finite, and the other absolute
and infinite; that the one is partly thing and partly person,
and that to both thing and person limitation and finiteness
belong; while the other is wholly person, and consequently
the pure, absolute, and infinite Person. We have
further found that absoluteness and infinity are spiritual
qualities of that one Person, which are incommunicable, and
differentiate Him from all other possible beings; and which
establish Him as the uncaused, self-active ground for all
possible beings besides. It is then a Person with all the
limitations and conditions of personality,&mdash;a Person at once
limited and unlimited, conditioned and unconditioned, related
and unrelated, whose limitations, conditions, and relations
are entirely consistent with his absoluteness and infinity, who
is the final Cause, the Ultimate Ground of the Universe.</p>

<p>The finite person is self-conscious, and in a measure self-comprehending;
but he only partially perceives the workings
of his own being. <i>A fortiori</i>, must the infinite Person be
self-conscious, and exhaustively self-comprehending. The
finite person is an intellect, sensibility, and will; but these
are circumscribed by innumerable limitations. So must the
infinite Person be intellect, sensibility, and will; but His
intellect must be Universal Genius; His sensibility Pure Delight,
and His will, as choice, Universal Benevolence, and as
act, Omnipotence.</p>

<p>1. As intellect, the infinite Person is Universal Genius.</p>

<p>Then, he "must possess the primary copies or patterns of
what it is possible may be, in his own subjective apprehension;"
or, in other words, "The pure ideals of all possible
entities, lie as pure reason conceptions in the light of the
divine intelligence, and in these must be found the rules<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
after which the creative agency must go forth." These <i>a
priori</i> "pure ideals" are <i>conditional</i> of his knowledge.
They are the sum and limit of all possible knowledge. He
must know them as they are. He cannot intuit, or think
otherwise than in accordance with them. However many
there may be of these ideals, the number is fixed and definite,
and must be so; and so the infinite Person must see it.
In fine, in the fact of exhaustive self-comprehension is involved
the fact, that the number of his qualities, attributes,
faculties, forms of activity, and acts, are, and must be limited,
definite, and so known to him; and yet he is infinite
and absolute, and thoroughly knows himself to be so.</p>

<p>2. As sensibility, the infinite Person is Pure Delight.</p>

<p>Then he exists in a state of unalloyed and complete bliss,
produced by the ceaseless consciousness of his perfect worth
and worthiness, and his entire complacency therein. Yet he
is pleased with the good conduct, and displeased with the
evil conduct, of the moral beings he has made. And if two
are good, and one better than another, he loves the one more
than the other. Yet all this in no way modifies, or limits, or
lessens his own absolute self-satisfaction and happiness.</p>

<p>3. As will, the infinite Person is, in choice, Universal Benevolence;
in act, Omnipotence.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> In choice, the whole personality,&mdash;both the spontaneous
and self activity, are entirely and concordantly active in the
one direction. Some of the objects towards which this state
manifests itself may be very small. The fact that each receives
the attention appropriate to his place in the system of
beings in no way modifies the Great Heart, which spontaneously
prompts to all good acts. But</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In act, the infinite Person, though omnipotent, is, always
must be, limited. His ability to act is limited and
determined by the "pure ideals," in which "must be found
the rules after which the creative agency must go forth." In
act he is also limited by his choice. The fact that he is
Universal Benevolence estops him from performing any act<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
which is not in exact accordance therewith. He cannot construct
a rational being, to whom two and two will appear
five; and if he should attempt to, he would cease to be perfect
Goodness. Again, the infinite Person performs an act&mdash;of
Creation. The act is, must be, limited and definite; and
so must the product&mdash;the Universe be. He cannot create
an unlimited Universe, nor perform an infinite act. The very
words unlimited Universe, and as well the notions they express,
are contradictory, and annihilate each other. Further,
an infinite act, even if possible, would not, could not create,
or have any relation to the construction of a Universe. An
infinite act must be the realization of an infinite ideal. The
infinite Person has a thorough comprehension of himself;
and consequently a complete idea of himself. That idea,
being the idea of the infinite Person, is infinite; and it is the
only possible infinite idea. He finds this idea realized in
himself. But, should it be in his power to realize it <i>again</i>,
that exertion of power would be an infinite act, and its
product another infinite Person. No other infinite act, and
no other result, are rationally supposable.</p>

<p>The Universe, then, however large it be, is, must be, limited
and definite. Its magnitude may be inconceivable to us;
but in the mind of its Creator every atom is numbered. No
spirit may ever have skirted its boundary; but that boundary
is as clear and distinct to his eye as the outline of the Alps
against a clear sky is to the traveller's. The questions Where?
How far? How long? How much? and the like, are pertinent
only in the Universe; and their answers are always
limited and definite.</p>

<p>The line of thought we have been pursuing is deemed by
a large class of thinkers not only paradoxical, but utterly
contradictory and self-destructive. We speak of a Person,
a term which necessarily involves limitation and condition,
as infinite and absolute. We speak of this infinity and absoluteness
as spiritual qualities, which are conditional and limiting
to him. We speak of him as conditioned by an inability<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
to be finite. In fine, to those good people, the Limitists,
our sense seems utter nonsense. It is required, therefore,
for the completion of this portion of our task, to present a
rational ground upon which these apparent contradictions
shall become manifestly consistent.</p>

<p>In those sentences where the infinite Person is spoken of
as limited and unlimited, &amp;c., it is evident that there is a
play upon words, and that they apply to different qualities in
the personality. It is not said, of course, that the number of
his faculties is limited and unlimited; or that his self-complacency
is boundless and constrained; or that his act is conditioned
and unconditioned. Nor are these seeming paradoxes
stated to puzzle and disturb. They are written to
express a great, fundamental, and all-important truth, which
seems never once to have shadowed the minds of the Limitists,&mdash;a
truth which, when once seen, dispels forever all
the ghostly battalions of difficulties which they have raised.
The truth is this.</p>

<p>That Being whose limitations, conditions, and relations
are wholly subjective, <i>i. e.</i> find their whole base and spring
in his self; and who is therefore entirely free from on all possible
limitations, conditions, and relations, from without himself;
and who possesses, therefore, all possible fulness of all
possible excellences, and finds the perennial acme of happiness
in self-contemplation, and the consciousness of his perfect
worth; and being such is ground for all other possible
being; is, in the true philosophical sense, unrelated, unconditioned,
unlimited. Or, in other words, the conditions imposed
by Universal Genius upon the absolute and infinite
Person are <i>different in kind</i> from the conditions imposed
upon finite persons and physical things. The former in no
way diminish aught from the fulness of their possessor's endowments;
the latter not only do so diminish, but render
it impossible for their possessor to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The following dictum will, then, concisely and exactly
express the truth we have attained.<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p><i>Those only are conditions, in the philosophical sense, which
diminish the fulness of the possessor's endowments.</i></p>

<p>An admirable illustration of this truth can be drawn from
some reflections of Laurens P. Hickok, D. D., which we
quote. "What we need is not merely a rule by which to
direct <i>the process</i> in the attainment of any artistic end, but
we must find the legislator who may determine the end itself"...</p>

<p>Whence is the ultimate behest that is to determine
the archetype, and control the pure spontaneity in its action.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Must the artist work merely because there is an inner
want to gratify, with no higher end than the gratification of
the highest constitutional craving? Can we find nothing
beyond a want, which shall from its own behest demand that
this, and not its opposite, shall be? Grant that the round
worlds and all their furniture are <i>good</i>&mdash;but why good?
Certainly as means to an end. Grant that this end, the happiness
of sentient beings, is <i>good</i>&mdash;but why good? Because
it supplies the want of the Supreme Architect. And is this
the <i>supreme good</i>? Surely if it is, we are altogether within
nature's conditions, call our ultimate attainment by what
name we may. We have no origin for our legislation, only
as the highest architect finds such wants within himself, and
the archetypal rule for gratifying his wants in the most effectual
manner; and precisely as the ox goes to his fodder in
the shortest way, so he goes to his work in making and peopling
worlds in the most direct manner. Here is no will;
no personality; no pure autonomy. The artist finds himself
so constituted that he must work in this manner, or the craving
of his own nature becomes intolerable to himself, and
the gratifying of this craving is <i>the highest good</i>."</p>

<p>We attain hereby a mark by which to distinguish the
diminishing from the undiminishing condition. A sense of
want, <i>a craving</i>, is the necessary result of a diminishing condition.
Hence the presence of any craving is the distinguishing
mark of the finite; and that plenitude of endowments<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
which excludes all possible craving or lack, is the
distinguishing mark of the infinite and absolute Person. In
this plenitude his infinity and absoluteness consist; and it is,
therefore, conditional of them. Upon this plenitude, as conditional
of this Person's perfection, Dr. Hickok speaks further,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must find that which shall itself be the reason and
law for benevolence, and for the sake of which the artist
shall be put to his beneficent agency above all considerations
that he finds his nature craving it. It must be that for whose
sake, happiness, even that which, as kind and benevolent,
craves on all sides the boon to bless others, itself should be.
Not sensient nor artistic autonomy, but a pure ethic autonomy,
which knows that within itself there is an excellency
which obliges for the sake of itself. This is never to be
found, nor anything very analogous to it, in sensient nature
and a dictate from some generalized experience. It lies
within the rational spirit, and is law in the heart, as an inward
imperative in its own right, and must there be found....
This inward witnessing capacitates for self-legislating
and self-rewarding. It is inward consciousness of a worth
imperative above want; an end in itself, and not means to
another end; a user of things, but not itself to be used by anything;
and, on account of its intrinsic excellency, an authoritative
determiner for its own behoof of the entire artistic agency
with all its products, and thus a conscience excusing or accusing.</p>

<p>"This inward witnessing of the absolute to his own worthiness,
gives the ultimate estimate to nature, which needs and
can attain to nothing higher, than that it should satisfy this
worthiness as end; and thereby in all his works, he fixes, in
his own light, upon the subjective archetype, and attains to
the objective result of that which is befitting his own dignity.
It is, therefore, in no craving want which must be gratified,
but from the interest of an inner behest, which should be
executed for his own worthiness' sake, that 'God has created
all things, and for his pleasure they are and were created.'"<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>In the light of the foregoing discussion and illustrations,
the division of conditions into two classes&mdash;the one class,
conditions proper, comprising those which diminish the endowments
of the being upon whom they lie, and are ground
for a craving or lack; and the other class, comprising those
conditions which do not diminish the endowments of the
being upon whom they lie, and which are, therefore, ground
for perfect plenitude of endowments, and of self-satisfaction
on account thereof&mdash;is seen to be thoroughly philosophical.
And let it be here noted, that the very construction, or, if
the term suit better, perception of this distinction, is a decisive
evidence of the fact, and a direct product of the operation
of the Pure Reason. If our intellect comprised only
what the Limitists acknowledge it to be, a Sense and an Understanding,
not only could no other but diminishing conditions
be thought of, but by no possibility could a hint that
there were any others flit through the mind. Such a mind,
being wholly in nature, and conditioned by nature, <i>cannot</i>
climb up out of nature, and perceive aught there. But those
conditions which lie upon the infinite Person are supernatural
and spiritual; and could not be even vaguely guessed
at, much more examined critically and classified, but by a
being possessed of a faculty the same in kind with the intellect
in which such spiritual conditions inhere.</p>

<p>The actual processes which go on in the mind are as
follows. The Sense, possessing a purely mechanical structure,
a structure not differing in <i>kind</i> from that of the vegetable,&mdash;both
being alike entirely conditioned by the law of
cause and effect,&mdash;perceives phenomena. The relation of the
object to the sensorium, or of the image to the sensory, and
the forms under which the Sense shall receive the impression,
are fixed. Because the Sense acts compulsorily, in
fixed mechanical forms, it is, by this very construction, incapable,
not only of receiving impressions and examining
phenomena outside of those forms, but it can never be startled
with the guess that there <i>is</i> anything else than what is received<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
therein. For instance: A man born blind, though
he can have no possible notion of what light is, knows that
light is, from the testimony of those who can see. But if a
race of men born blind should be found, who had never had
any communication with men who could see, it is notorious
that they could have no possible notion even that light was.
A suspicion of its existence could never cross their minds.
This position is strengthened and established beyond controversy,
by the failure of the mind in its efforts to construct
an entirely new sense. Every attempt only intensifies our
appreciation of the futility of the effort. From fragments
of the five senses we might, perhaps, construct a patchwork
sixth; but the mind makes no presentation to itself of a new
sense. The reason is, that, to do so, the Sense, as mental
faculty, must transcend the very conditions of its existence.
It is precisely with the Understanding as with the lower faculty.
It cannot transcend its limits. It can add no item to
the sum of human knowledge, except as it deduces it from a
presentation by the Sense. Hence its conditions correspond
to those in its associate faculty.</p>

<p>It is manifest, then, that a being with only these faculties
may construct a <i>system</i>, but can never develop a <i>science</i>.
It can arrange, classify, by such standards as its fancy may
select, the phenomena in nature; but this must be in accordance
with some sensuous form. <i>No law can be seen</i>, by which
it ought to be so, and not otherwise. Such classification must
always be determined by the number of stamens in the flower,
for instance; and that standard, though arbitrary, will be as
good as any other, <i>unless there comes a higher faculty</i> which,
overlooking all nature, perceives the <i>a priori</i> law working in
nature, which gives the ultimate ground for an exhaustive
development of a science which in its <i>idea</i> cannot be improved.
It is manifest, further, that those conditions, to which
we have applied the epithet proper, lie upon the two faculties
we have been considering. In this we agree with the
Limitists.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>It now behooves to present the fact that the faculty whose
existence was proved in the earlier part of our work, is competent
to overlook, and so comprehend nature, and all the
conditions of nature, and thereby assign to said conditions
their true and inferior place, while it soars out of nature, and
intuits those <i>a priori</i> laws which, though the conditions of,
are wholly unconditioned <i>by nature</i>; but which are both the
conditions of and conditioned by the supernatural; and this
in an entirely different sense from the other. This is the
province of the Pure Reason. Standing on some lofty peak,
above all clouds of sense, under the full blaze of eternal
truth, the soul sees all nature spread like a vast map before
her searching eye, sharply observes, and appreciates all the
conditions of nature; and then, while holding it full in the
field of her vision, with equal fulness perceives that other
land, the spiritual plains of the supernatural, sees them too
in all their conditionings; and sees, with a clearness of vision
never approximated by the earthly eye, the fact that these
supernatural conditions are no deprivation which awaken a
want, but that they inhere and cohere, as final ground for
absolute plenitude of endowments and fulness of bliss, in
the Self-existent Person.</p>

<p>It will be objected to the position now attained, that it involves
the doctrine that the Pure Reason in the finite spiritual
person is on a par with the Universal Genius in the infinite
spiritual Person. The objection is fallacious, because
based upon the assumption that likeness in mode of action
involves entire similarity. The mode of action in the finite
Pure Reason is precisely similar to that of the Universal
Genius; the objects perceived by both are the same, they
are seen in the same light, and so are in accord; but the
<i>range</i> of the finite is one, and the <i>range</i> of the infinite is
another; and so diverse also are the circumstances attending
the act of seeing. The range of the finite Reason is, <i>always
must be, partial</i>: the range of the infinite Reason is, <i>always
must be, exhaustive</i> (not infinite). In circumstances, the finite<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
Reason is created dependent for existence, must begin in a
germ in which it is inactive, and <i>must</i> be developed by association
with nature, and under forms of nature; and can
never, by any possibility of growth, attain to that perfectness
in which it shall be satisfied, or to a point in development
from which it can continue its advance as <i>pure spirit</i>. It
always must be spirit in a body; even though that be a spiritual
body. The infinite Reason is self-existent, and therefore
independent; and is, and always must be, in the absolute
possession of all possible knowledge, and so cannot grow.
Hence, while the infinite and finite reasons see the same object
in the same light, and therefore <i>alike</i>, the difference in
range, and the difference in circumstance, must forever constitute
them dissimilar. The exact likeness of sight just
noticed is the <i>necessary a priori</i> ground upon which a moral
government is <i>possible</i>.</p>

<p>In thus declaring the basis upon which the above distinction
between the two classes of conditions rests, we have been
led to distinguish more clearly between the faculties of the
mind, and especially to observe how the Pure Reason enables
us thereby to solve the problems she has raised. In this
radical distinction lies the rational ground for the explication
of all the problems which the Limitists raise. It also appears
that the terms must, possible, and the like, being used
to express no idea of restraint, as coming from without upon
the infinite Person, or of lack or craving, as subsisting within
him, are properly employed in expressing the fact that his
<i>Self, as a priori ground for his activity</i>, is, though the only,
yet a real, positive, and irremovable limit, condition, and law
of his action. Of two possible ends he may freely choose
either. Of all possible modes of action he may choose one;
but the constituting laws of the Self he <i>cannot</i>, and the moral
laws of his Self he <i>will not</i>, violate.</p>

<p>That point has now been reached at which this branch of
the discussion in hand may be closed. The final base from
which to conduct an examination of the questions respecting<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
absoluteness and infinity has been attained. In the progress
to this consummation it was found that a radical psychological
error lay at the root of the philosophy taught by the Limitists.
Their theory was seen to be partial, and essentially
defective. Qualities which they do not recognise were found
to belong to certain mental affirmations. Four classes of
these affirmations or ideas were named and illustrated; and
by them the fact of the Reason was established. Then its
mode of activity and its functions were stated; and finally
the great truth which solves the problem of the ages was, by
this faculty, attained and stated. It became evident that the
final cause of the Universe must be found without the Universe;
and it was then seen that</p>

<blockquote><p>That spiritual Person who is self-existent, absolute, and
infinite, is the Ultimate Ground, the Final Cause, of the
Universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Definitions of the terms absolute and infinite suitable to
such a position were then given, with a few concluding reflections.
From the result thus secured the way is prepared
for an examination of the general principles and their special
applications which the Limitists maintain, and this will
occupy our future pages.</p>

<h2 id="PART_II">PART II.</h2>

<p class="h3">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION
OF THE LIMITISTS, AND OF CERTAIN GENERAL COROLLARIES
UNDER IT.</p>

<p>It has been attempted in the former pages to find a valid
and final basis of truth, one which would satisfy the cravings
of the human soul, and afford it a sure rest. In the
fact that God made man in his own image, and that thus
there is, <i>to a certain extent</i>, a community of faculties, a community
of knowledge, a community of obligations, and a
community of interests, have we found such a basis. We
have hereby learned that a part of man's knowledge is necessary
and final; in other words, that he can know the truth,
and be sure that his knowledge is correct. If the proofs
which have been offered of the fact of the Pure Reason, and
the statements which have been made of the mode of its activity
and of its functions, and, further, of the problem of
the Universe, and the true method for solving it, shall have
been satisfactory to the reader, he will now be ready to consider
the analysis of Sir William Hamilton's fundamental
proposition, which was promised on an early page. We
there gave, it was thought, sufficiently full extracts for a fair
presentation of his theory, and followed them with a candid
epitome. In recurring to the subject now, and for the purpose
named, we are constrained at the outset to make an
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>It would be simple folly, a childish egotism, to pass by in
silence the masterly article on this subject in the "North
American Review" for October, 1864, and after it to pretend<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
to offer anything new. Whatever the author might
have wrought out in his own mental workshop,&mdash;and his
work was far less able than what is there given,&mdash;that article
has left nothing to be said. He has therefore been
tempted to one of two courses: either to transfer it to these
pages, or pass by the subject entirely. Either course may,
perhaps, be better than the one finally chosen; which is,
while pursuing the order of his own thought, to add a few
short extracts therefrom. One possibility encourages him in
this, which is, that some persons may see this volume, who
have no access to the Review, and to whom, therefore, these
pages will be valuable. To save needless repetition, this
discussion will presuppose that the reader has turned back
and perused the extracts and epitome above alluded to.</p>

<p>Upon the very threshold of Sir William Hamilton's statement,
one is met by a logical <i>faux pas</i> which is truly amazing.
Immediately after the assertion that "the mind can
know only the <i>limited and the conditionally limited</i>," and in
the very sentence in which he denies the possibility of a
knowledge of the Infinite and Absolute, <i>he proceeds to define
those words in definite and known terms</i>! The Infinite he
defines as "the unconditionally unlimited," and the Absolute
as "the unconditionally limited." Or, to save him, will one say
that the defining terms are unknown? So much the worse,
then! "The Infinite," an unknown term, may be represented
by <i>x</i>; and the unconditionally unlimited, a compound
unknown term, by <i>ab</i>. Now, who has the right to say, either
in mathematics or metaphysics, in any philosophy, that
<i>x</i>=<i>ab</i>? Yet such dicta are the basis of "The Philosophy
of the Unconditioned." But, one of two suppositions is possible.
Either the terms infinite and absolute are known terms
and definable, or they are unknown terms and undefinable.
Yet, Hamilton says, they are unknown and definable. Which
does he mean? If he is held to the former, they are unknown;
then all else that he has written about them are
batches of meaningless words. If he is held to the latter,<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
they are definable; then are they known, and his system is
denied in the assertion of it. Since his words are so contradictory,
he must be judged by his deeds; and in these he always
assumes that we have a positive knowledge of the infinite
and absolute, else he would not have argued the matter;
for there can be no argument about nothing. Our analysis
of his theory, then, must be conducted upon this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Turn back for a moment to the page upon which his theory
is quoted, and read the last sentence. Is his utterance a
"principle," or is it a judgment? Is it an axiom, or is it a
guess. The logician asserts that we know only the conditioned,
and yet bases his assertion upon "the principles," &amp;c.
What is a principle, and how is it known? If it is axiom,
then he has denied his own philosophy in the very sentence
in which he uttered it. And this, we have no hesitation in
saying, is just what he did. He blindly assumed certain
"fundamental laws of thought,"&mdash;to quote another of his
phrases&mdash;to establish the impotence of the mind to know
those laws <i>as fundamental</i>. Again, if his philosophy is valid,
the words "must," "necessary," and the like are entirely
out of place; for they are unconditional. In the conditioned
there is, can be, no must, no necessity.</p>

<p>From these excursions about the principle let us now return
to the principle itself. It may be stated concisely thus:
There are two extremes,&mdash;"the Absolute" and the "Infinite."
These include all being. They are contradictories,
that is, one must be, to the exclusion of the other. But the
mind can "conceive" of neither. What, then, is the logical
conclusion? <i>That the mind cannot conceive of anything.</i>
What is his conclusion? That the mind can conceive of
something between the infinite and the absolute, which is
neither the one nor the other, but a <i>tertium quid</i>&mdash;the conditioned.
Where did this <i>tertium quid</i> come from, when he
had already comprehended everything in the two extremes?
If there is a mean, the conditioned, and the two extremes,
then "excluded middle" has nothing to do with the matter
at all.<span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>To avoid the inevitable conclusion of his logic as just
stated, Hamilton erected the subterfuge of <i>mental imbecility</i>.
To deny any knowledge to man, was to expose himself to
ridicule. He, therefore, and his followers after him, drew a
line in the domain of knowledge, and assigned to the hither
side of it all knowledge that can come through generalizations
in the Understanding; and then asserted that the contradictions
which appeared in the mind, when one examined
those questions which lie on the further side of that line, resulted
from the impotency of the mind to comprehend the
questions themselves. This was, is, their psychology. How
satisfactory it may be to Man, a hundred years, perhaps, will
show. But strike out the last assertion, and write, Both are
cognizable; and then let us proceed with our reasoning.
The essayist in the North American presents the theory
under four heads, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. The Infinite and Absolute as defined, are contradictory
and exclusive of each other; yet, one must be true.</p>

<p>"2. Neither of them can be conceived as possible.</p>

<p>"3. Each is inconceivable; and the inconceivability of
each is referable to the same cause, namely, mental imbecility.</p>

<p>"4. As opposite extremes, they include everything conceivable
between them."</p>

<p>The first and fourth points require our especial attention.</p>

<p>1. Let us particularly mark, then, that it is <i>as defined</i>,
that the terms are "contradictory." The question, therefore,
turns upon the definitions. Undoubtedly the definitions are
erroneous; but in order to see wherein, the following general
reflections may be made:&mdash;</p>

<p>The terms infinite and absolute, as used by philosophers,
have two distinct applications: one to Space and Time, and
one to God. Such definitions as are suitable to the latter
application, and self-consistent, have already been given.
Though reluctant to admit into a philosophical treatise a term
bearing two distinct meanings, we shall waive for a little our<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
scruples,&mdash;though choosing, for ourselves, to use the equivalent
rather than the term.</p>

<p>Such definitions are needed, then, as that absolute Space
and Time shall not be contradictory to infinite Space and
Time. Let us first observe Hamilton's theory. According
to it, Space, for instance, is either unconditional illimitation,
or it is unconditional limitation; in other words, it is illimitable,
or it is a limited whole. The first part of the assertion
is true. That Space is illimitable, is unquestionably a self-evident
truth. Any one who candidly considers the subject
will see not only that the mind cannot assign limits to Space,
but that the attempt is an absurdity just alike in kind with
the attempt to think two and two five. The last part is a
psychological blunder, has no pertinence to the question, and
is not what Hamilton was groping for. He was searching
for the truth, that <i>there is no absolute unit in Space</i>. A limited
whole has nothing to do with the matter in hand&mdash;absoluteness&mdash;at
all. The illimitability of Space, which has
just been established as an axiom, precludes this. What,
then, is the opposite pole of thought? We have just declared
it. There is no absolute unit of Space; or, in other words,
all division is in Space, but Space is indivisible. This, also,
is an axiom, is self-evident. We attain, then, two poles of
thought, and definitions of the two terms given, which are
exhaustive and consistent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Space is illimitable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Space is indivisible."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The one is the infinity of Space, the other is the absoluteness
of Space. The fact, then, is, all limitation is <i>in</i> Space,
and all division is <i>in</i> Space; but Space is neither limited or
divided. One of the logician's extremes is seen, then, to
have no foundation in fact; and that which is found to be
true is also found to be consistent with, nay, essential to,
what should have been the other.</p>

<p>Having hitherto expressed a decided protest against any
attempt to find out God through the forms of Space and<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
Time, a repetition will not be needed here. God is only to
be sought for, found, and studied, by such methods as are
suitable to the supreme spiritual Person. Hence all the attempts
of the Limitists to reason from spatial and temporal
difficulties over to those questions which belong to God, are
simply absurd. The questions respecting Space and Time
are to be discussed by themselves. And the questions respecting
God are to be discussed by themselves. He who
tries to reason from the one to the other is not less absurd
than he who should try to reason from a farm to the multiplication
table.</p>

<p>In Sir William Hamilton's behalf it should be stated, that
there is just a modicum of truth underlying his theory,&mdash;just
enough to give it a degree of plausibility. The Sense,
as faculty for the perception of physical objects, or their images,
and the Understanding as discursive faculty for passing
over and forming judgments upon the materials gathered by
the Sense, lie under the shadow of a law very like the one he
stated. The Sense was made <i>incapable</i> of perceiving an ultimate
atom or of comprehending the universe. From the
fact that the Sense never has perceived these objects, the
Understanding concludes that it never will. Only by the insight
and oversight of that higher faculty, the Pure Reason,
do we come to know that it never <i>can</i>. It was because those
lower faculties are thus walled in by the conditions of Space
and Time, and are unable to perceive or conceive anything
out of those conditions, and because, in considering them, he
failed to see the other mental powers, that Sir William Hamilton
constructed his Philosophy of the Unconditioned.</p>

<p>2. Neither of them can be conceived as possible.</p>

<p>Literally, this is true. The word "conceive" applies
strictly to the work of the Understanding; and that faculty
can never have any notion of the Infinite or Absolute. But,
assuming that "conceive" is a general term for cognize, the
conclusion developed just above is inevitable. If all being
is in one or the other, and neither can be known, nothing can
be known.<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>3. They cannot be known, because of mental imbecility.
If man can know nothing because of mental imbecility, why
suppose that he has a mental faculty at all? Why not
enounce, as the fundamental principle of one's theory, the
assertion, All men are idiots? This would be logically consistent.
The truth is, the logician was in a dilemma. He
must confess that men know something. By a false psychology
he had ruled the Reason out of the mind, and so
had left himself no faculty by which to form any notion of
absoluteness and infinity; and yet they would thrust themselves
before him, and demand an explanation. Hence, he
constructed a subterfuge. He would have been more consistent
if he had said, There is no absolute and infinite.
The conditioned is the whole of existence; and this the mind
knows.</p>

<p>"4. As opposite extremes, they include everything conceivable
between them."</p>

<p>What the essayist in the North American says upon this
point is so apt, and so accords with our own previous reflections,
that we will not forbear making an extract. "The
last of the four theses will best be re-stated in Hamilton's
own words; the italics are his. 'The conditioned is the
mean between two extremes&mdash;two inconditionates, exclusive
of each other, neither of which <i>can be conceived as possible</i>,
but of which, on the principles of contradiction and excluded
middle, one <i>must be admitted as necessary</i>.' This sentence
excites unmixed wonder. To mention in the same breath the
law of excluded middle, and two contradictions with a mean
between them, requires a hardihood unparalleled in the history
of philosophy, except by Hegel. If the two contradictory
extremes are themselves incogitable, yet include a cogitable
mean, why insist upon the necessity of accepting either
extreme? This necessity of accepting one of two contradictories
is wholly based upon the supposed impossibility of
a mean; if the mean exists, that may be true, and both the
contradictories false. But if a mean between the two contradictories<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
be both impossible and absurd, (and we have
hitherto so interpreted the law of excluded middle,) Hamilton's
conditioned entirely vanishes."</p>

<p>Upon a system which, in whatever aspect one looks at it,
is found to be but a bundle of contradictions and absurdities,
further criticism would appear to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Having, impliedly at least, accepted as true Sir William
Hamilton's psychological error,&mdash;the rejection of the Reason
as the intellectual faculty of the spiritual person,&mdash;and having,
with him, used the terms limit, condition, and the like,
in such significations as are pertinent to the Sense and Understanding
only, the Limitists proceed to present in a paradoxical
light many questions which arise concerning "the Infinite."
They take the ground that, to our view, he can be
neither person, nor intellect, nor consciousness; for each of
these implies limitation; and yet that it is impossible for us
to know aught of him, except as such. Then having, as
they think, completely confused the mind, they draw hence
new support for their conclusion, that we can attain to no
satisfactory knowledge on the subject. The following extracts
selected from many will show this.</p>

<p>"Now, in the first place, the very conception of Consciousness,
in whatever mode it may be manifested, necessarily implies
distinction between one object and another. To be
conscious, we must be conscious of something; and that
something can only be known as that which it is, by being
distinguished from that which it is not. But distinction is
necessarily a limitation; for, if one object is to be distinguished
from another, it must possess some form of existence
which the other has not, or it must not possess some form
which the other has. But it is obvious that the Infinite cannot
be distinguished, as such, from the Finite, by the absence
of any quality which the Finite possesses; for such absence
would be a limitation. Nor yet can it be distinguished by
the presence of an attribute which the Finite has not; for
as no finite part can be a constituent of an infinite whole,<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
this differential characteristic must itself be infinite; and
must at the same time have nothing in common with the
finite....</p>

<p>"That a man can be conscious of the Infinite, is thus a supposition
which, in the very terms in which it is expressed,
annihilates itself. Consciousness is essentially a limitation;
for it is the determination of the mind to one actual out of
many possible modifications. But the Infinite, if it is conceived
at all, must be conceived as potentially everything,
and actually nothing; for if there is anything in general
which it cannot become, it is thereby limited; and if there is
anything in particular which it actually is, it is thereby excluded
from being any other thing. But again, it must also
be conceived as actually everything, and potentially nothing;
for an unrealized potentiality is likewise a limitation. If
the infinite can be that which it is not, it is by that very
possibility marked out as incomplete, and capable of a higher
perfection. If it is actually everything, it possesses no
characteristic feature by which it can be distinguished from
anything else, and discerned as an object of consciousness....</p>

<p>"Rationalism is thus only consistent with itself when it
refuses to attribute consciousness to God. Consciousness, in
the only form in which we can conceive it, implies limitation
and change,&mdash;the perception of one object out of many, and
a comparison of that object with others. To he always conscious
of the same object, is, humanly speaking, not to be
conscious at all; and, beyond its human manifestation, we
can have no conception of what consciousness is."&mdash;<i>Limits
of Religious Thought</i>, pp. 93-95.</p>

<p>"As the conditionally limited (which we may briefly call
the conditioned) is thus the only possible object of knowledge
and of positive thought&mdash;thought necessarily supposes conditions.
To <i>think</i> is to <i>condition</i>; and conditional limitation
is the fundamental law of the possibility of thought....</p>

<p>"Thought cannot transcend consciousness; consciousness
is only possible under the antithesis of a subject and object<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
of thought; known only in correlation, and mutually limiting
each other; while, independently of this, all that we know
either of subject or object, either of mind or matter, is only
a knowledge in each of the particular, of the plural, of the
different, of the modified, of the phenomenal. We admit
that the consequence of this doctrine is&mdash;that philosophy, if
viewed as more than a science of the conditioned, is impossible.
Departing from the particular, we admit that we can
never, in out highest generalizations, rise above the finite;
that our knowledge, whether of mind or matter, can be nothing
more than a knowledge of the relative manifestations of
an existence, which in itself it is our highest wisdom to recognize
as beyond the reach of philosophy."</p>

<p>"In all this, so far as human intelligence is concerned, we
cordially agree; for a more complete admission could not be
imagined, not only that a knowledge, and even a notion, of
the absolute is impossible for man, but that we are unable
to conceive the possibility of such a knowledge even in the
Deity himself, without contradicting our human conceptions
of the possibility of intelligence itself."&mdash;<i>Sir William Hamilton's
Essays</i>, pp. 21, 22, 38.</p>

<p>"The various mental attributes which we ascribe to God&mdash;Benevolence,
Holiness, Justice, Wisdom, for example&mdash;can
be conceived by us only as existing in a benevolent and holy
and just and wise Being, who is not identical with any one
of his attributes, but the common subject of them all; in one
word, a <i>Person</i>. But Personality, as we conceive it, is
essentially a limitation and relation. Our own personality
is presented to us as relative and limited; and it is from that
presentation that all our representative notions of personality
are derived. Personality is presented to us as a relation
between the conscious self and the various modes of his
consciousness. There is no personality in abstract thought without
a thinker: there is no thinker unless he exercises some
mode of thought. Personality is also a limitation; for the
thought and the thinker are distinguished from and limit each<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
other; and the various modes of thought are distinguished
each from each by limitation likewise...."&mdash;<i>Limits of
Religious Thought</i>, p. 102.</p>

<p>"Personality, with all its limitations, though far from exhibiting
the absolute nature of God as He is, is yet truer, grander,
more elevating, more religious, than those barren, vague,
meaningless abstractions in which men babble about nothing
under the name of the Infinite and Personal conscious existence,
limited though it be, is yet the noblest of all existence
of which man can dream.... It is by consciousness
alone that we know that God exists, or that we are able to
offer Him any service. It is only by conceiving Him as a
Conscious Being, that we can stand in any religious relation
to Him at all; that we can form such a representation of
Him as is demanded by our spiritual wants, insufficient though
it be to satisfy our intellectual curiosity."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious
Thought</i>, p. 104.</p>

<p>The conclusions of these writers upon this whole topic are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mind is not represented as conceiving two propositions
subversive of each other as equally possible; <i>but only
as unable to understand</i> as possible two extremes; one of
which, however, on the ground of their mutual repugnance,
it is compelled to recognize as true.... And by a wonderful
revelation we are thus, in the very consciousness of
our inability to conceive aught above the relative and finite,
inspired with a belief in the existence of something unconditioned
beyond the sphere of all comprehensive reality."&mdash;<i>Sir
William Hamilton's Essays</i>, p. 22.</p>

<p>"To sum up briefly this portion of my argument. The
conception of the Absolute and Infinity, from whatever side
we view it, appears encompassed with contradictions. There
is a contradiction in supposing such an object to exist, whether
alone or in conjunction with others; and there is a contradiction
in supposing it not to exist. There is a contradiction
in conceiving it as one; and there is a contradiction in conceiving<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
it as many. There is a contradiction in conceiving
it as personal; and there is a contradiction in conceiving it
as impersonal. It cannot, without contradiction, be represented
as active; nor, without equal contradiction, be represented
as inactive. It cannot be conceived as the sum of
all existence; nor yet can it be conceived as a part only of
that sum."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i>, pp. 84, 85.</p>

<p>We have quoted thus largely, preferring that the Limitists
should speak for themselves. Their doctrine, as taught, not
simply in these passages, but throughout their writings, may
be briefly summed up as follows.</p>

<p>The human mind, whenever it attempts to investigate the
profoundest subjects which come before it, and which it is
goaded to examine, finds itself in an inextricable maze of
contradictions; and, after vainly struggling for a while to get
out, becomes nonplussed, confused, confounded, dazed; and,
falling down helpless and effortless in the maze, and with
devout humility acknowledging its impotence, it finds that
the "highest reason" is to pass beyond the sphere and out
of the light of reason, into the sphere of a superrational and
therefore dark, and therefore <i>blind</i> faith.</p>

<p>But it is to be stated, and here we strike to the centre of
the errors of the Limitists, that a perception and confession
of mental impotence is <i>not</i> the logical deduction from their
premises. Lustrous as may be their names in logic,&mdash;and
Sir William Hamilton is esteemed a sun in the logical firmament,&mdash;no
one of them ever saw, or else dared to acknowledge,
the logical sequence from their principles. They have
climbed upon the dizzy heights of thought, and out on their
verge; and there they stand, hesitating and shivering, like
naked men on Alpine precipices, with no eagle wings to
spread and soar away towards the Eternal Truth; and not
daring to take the awful plunge before them. Behold the
gulf from which they shrink. Mr. Mansel says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is our duty, then, to think of God as personal; and it
is our duty to believe that He is infinite. It is true that we<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
cannot reconcile these two representations with each other,
as our conception of personality involves attributes apparently
contradictory to the notion of infinity. But it does
not follow that this contradiction exists anywhere but in our
own minds: it does not follow that it implies any impossibility
in the absolute nature of God. The apparent contradiction,
in this case, as in those previously noticed, is the
necessary consequence of an attempt on the part of the
human thinker to transcend the boundaries of his own consciousness.
It proves that there are limits to man's power of
thought; and it proves no more."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious
Thought</i>, p. 106.</p>

<p>Or, to put it in sharp and accurate, plain and unmistakable
English. "It is our duty to think of God as personal,"
when to think of Him as personal is to think a lie; "to believe
that He is infinite," when so to believe is to believe
the lie already thought; and when to believe a lie is to incur
the penalty decreed by the Bible&mdash;God's book&mdash;upon
all who believe lies. And this is the religious teaching of
a professed Christian minister in one of the first Universities
in the world. Not that Mr. Mansel meant to teach this.
By no means. But it logically follows from his premises.
In his philosophy the mind instinctively, necessarily, and
with equal authority in each case, asserts</p>

<p>That there must be an infinite Being;</p>

<p>That that Being must be Self-conscious,</p>

<p>Must be unlimited; and that</p>

<p>Consciousness is a limitation.</p>

<p>These assertions are contradictory and self-destructive. What
follows then? That the mind is impotent? No! It follows
that the mind is a deceiver! We learn again the lesson we
have learned before. It is not weakness, it is falsehood:
it is not want of capacity, it is want of integrity that is proved
by this contradiction. Man is worse than a hopeless, mental
imbecile, he is a hopeless, mental cheat.</p>

<p>But is the result true? How can it be, when with all its<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
might the mind revolts from it, as nature does from a
vacuum? True that the human mind is an incorrigible falsifier?
With the indignation of outraged honesty, man's soul
rejects the insulting aspersion, and reasserts its own integrity
and authority. Ages of controversy have failed to obliterate
or cry down the spontaneous utterance of the soul, "I have
within myself the ultimate standard of truth."</p>

<p>It now devolves to account for the aberrations of the Limitists.
The ground of all their difficulties is simple and
plain. While denying to the human mind the faculty of
the Pure Reason, they have, <i>by the (to them) undistinguished
use of that faculty</i>, raised questions which the Understanding
by no possibility could raise, which the Reason
alone is capable of presenting, and which that Reason alone
can solve; and have attempted to solve them solely by the
assistance, and in the forms of, the Sense and the Understanding.
Their problems belong to a spiritual person; and
they attempt to solve them by the inferior modes of an animal
nature. Better, by far, could they see with their ears.
All their processes are developed on the vicious assumption,
that the highest form of knowledge possible to the human
mind is a generalization in the Understanding, upon facts
given in the Sense: a form of knowledge which is always
one, whether the substance be distinguished in the form, be
a peach, as diverse from an apple; or a star, as one among
a million. The meagreness and utter insufficiency of this
doctrine, to account for all the phenomena of the human
mind, we have heretofore shown; and shall therefore need
only now to distinguish certain special phases of their fundamental
error.</p>

<p>As heretofore, there will be continual occasion to note
how the doctrine of the Limitists, that the Understanding
is man's highest faculty of knowledge, and the logical sequences
therefrom respecting the laws of thought and consciousness
vitiate their whole system. One of their most
important errors is thus expressed:&mdash;"To be conscious, we<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
must be conscious of something; and that something can
only be known as that which it is, by being distinguished
from that which it is not." "Thought cannot transcend
consciousness; consciousness is only possible under the antithesis
of subject and object of thought known only in correlation,
and mutually limiting each other; while, independently
of this, all that we know either of subject or object,
either of mind or matter, is only a knowledge in each of the
particular, of the plural, of the different, of the modified, of
the phenomenal." In other words, our highest possible form
of knowledge is that by which we examine the peach, distinguish
its qualities among themselves, and discriminate
between them and the qualities of the apple. And Sir William
Hamilton fairly and truly acknowledges that, as a
consequence, science, except as a system of objects of sense,
is impossible.</p>

<p>The fact is, as has been made already sufficiently apparent,
that the diagnosis by the Limitists of the constitution of
the mind is erroneous. Their dictum, that all knowledge
must be attained through "relation, plurality, and difference,"
is not true. There is a kind of knowledge which
we obtain by a direct and immediate <i>sight</i>; and that, too,
under such conditions as are no limitation upon the object
thought. For instance, the mind, by a direct intuition, affirms,
"Malice is criminal." It also affirms that this is an
eternal, immutable, universal law, conditional for all possibility
of moral beings. This direct and immediate sight, and
the consciousness attending it, are <i>full</i> of that one object,
and so are occupied only with it; and it does <span class="smcap">not</span> come
under any forms of relation, plurality, and difference. So is
it with all <i>a priori</i> laws. The mode of the pure reason is
thus seen to be the direct opposite of that of the Understanding
and the Sense.</p>

<p>Intimately connected with the foregoing is a question whose
importance cannot be overstated. It is one which involves
the very possibility of God's existence as a self-conscious<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
person. To present it, we recur again to the extracts made
just above from Sir William Hamilton. "Consciousness is
only possible under the antithesis of a subject and object of
thought known only in correlation, and mutually limiting
each other." Subsequently, he makes the acknowledgment
as logically following from this: "that we are unable to
conceive the possibility of such knowledge," <i>i. e.</i> of the absolute,
"even in the Deity himself." That is, God can be
believed to be self-conscious only on the ground that the
human intellect is a cheat. The theory which underlies this
assertion of the logician&mdash;a theory not peculiar to the Limitists,
but which has, perhaps, been hitherto universally maintained
by philosophers&mdash;may be concisely stated thus. In
every correlation of subject and object,&mdash;in every instance
where they are to be contrasted,&mdash;the subject must be one,
and the object must be <i>another and different</i>. Hamilton, in
another place, utters it thus: "Look back for a moment into
yourselves, and you will find, that what constitutes intelligence
in our feeble consciousness, is, that there are there
several terms, of which the one perceives the other, of which
the other is perceived by the first; in this consists self-knowledge,"
&amp;c. Mark the "several terms," and that the
one can only see the other, never itself.</p>

<p>This position is both a logical and psychological error.
It is a logical error because it <i>assumes</i>, without argument,
that there is involved in the terms subject and object such a
logical contradiction and contradistinction that the subject
cannot be object to itself. This assumption is groundless.
As a matter of fact, it is <i>generally</i> true that, so far as man is
concerned, the subject is one, and the object another and different.
But this by no means proves that it is <i>always</i> so; it
only raises the presumption that such may be the case. And
when one comes to examine the question in itself, there is
absolutely no logical ground for the assumption. It is found
to be a question upon which no decision from logical considerations
can have any validity, because <i>it is purely psycho<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>logical</i>,
and can only be decided by evidence upon a matter
of fact. Furthermore, it is a psychological error, because
a careful examination shows that, in some instances, the opposite
is the fact; that, in certain experiences, the subject
and object are identical.</p>

<p>This fact that the subject and object are often identical in
the searching eye of human reason, and <i>always</i> so under the
eye of Universal Genius, is of too vast scope and too vital
importance to be passed with a mere allusion. It seems
amazing that a truth which, the instant it is stated, solves a
thousand difficulties which philosophy has raised, should
never yet have been affirmed by any of the great spiritual-eyed
thinkers, and that it should have found utterance, only
to be denied, by the pen of the Limitists. A word of personal
reminiscence may be allowed here. The writer came
to see this truth during a process of thought, having for its
object the solution of the problem, How can the infinite Person
be self-comprehending, and still infinite? While considering
this, and without ever having received a hint from any
source that the possibility of such a problem had dawned on
a human mind before, there blazed upon him suddenly, like a
heaven full of light, this, which appeared the incomparably
profounder question: How can any soul, not God only, but
any soul, be a self-examiner? Why don't the Limitists entertain
and explain this? It was only years after that he
met the negative statement in Herbert Spencer's book. The
difficulty is, that the Limitists have represented to their
minds the mode of the seeing of the Reason, by a sensuous
image, as the eye; and because the eye cannot see itself,
have concluded that the Reason cannot see itself. It is always
dangerous to argue from an illustration; and, in this
instance, it has been fatal. If man was only an animal
nature, and so only a <i>receiver</i> of impressions, with a capacity
to generalize from the impressions received, the doctrine of
the Limitists would be true. But once establish that man is
also a spiritual <i>person</i>, with a reason, which sees truth by immediate<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
intuition, and their whole teaching becomes worthless.
The Reason is not receptivity merely, or mainly; it is
originator. In its own light it gives to itself <i>a priori</i> truth,
and itself as seeing that truth; and so the subject and object
are identical. This is one of the differentiating qualities
of the spiritual person.</p>

<p>Our position may be more accurately stated and more
amply illustrated and sustained as follows:</p>

<p><i>Sometimes, in the created spiritual person, and always in
the self-existent, the absolute and infinite spiritual Person, the
subject and object are</i> <span class="smcap">identical</span>.</p>

<p>1. Sometimes in the created spiritual person, the subject
and object are identical. The question is a question of fact.
In illustrating the fact, it will be proved. When a man
looks at his hands, he sees they are instruments for <i>his</i> use.
When he considers his physical sense, he still perceives it to
be instrument for <i>his</i> use. In all his conclusions, judgments,
he still finds, not himself, but <i>his</i> instrument. Even in the
Pure Reason he finds only <i>his</i> faculty; though it be the
highest possible to intellect. Yet still he searches, searches
for the <i>I am</i>; which claims, and holds, and uses, the faculties
and capacities. There is a phrase universally familiar
to American Christians, a fruit of New England Theology,
which leads us directly to the goal we seek. It is the phrase,
"self-examination." In all thorough, religious self-examination
the subject and object are identical. In the ordinary
labors and experiences of life, man says, "I can do this or
that;" and he therein considers only his aptitudes and capabilities.
But in this last, this profoundest act, the assertion
is not, "I can do this or that." It is, "I am this or that."
The person stands unveiled before itself, in the awful sanctuary
of God's presence. The decision to be made is not
upon the use of one faculty or another. It is upon the end
for which all labor shall be performed. The character of
the person is under consideration, and is to be determined.
The selfhood, with all its wondrous mysteries, is at once<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
subject and object. The I am in man, alike in kind to that
most impenetrable mystery, the eternal I AM of "the everlasting
Father," is now stirred to consider its most solemn
duty. How shall the finite I am accord <i>itself</i> to the pure
purpose of the infinite I AM? It may be, possibly is, that
some persons have never been conscious of this experience.
To some, from a natural inaptitude, and to others, from a
perverse disinclination, it may never come. Some have so
little gift of introspection, that their inner experiences are
never observed and analyzed. Their conduct may be beautiful,
but they never know it. Their impressions ever come
from without. Another class of persons shun such an experience
as Balshazzar would have shunned, if he could, the
handwriting on the wall. Their whole souls are absorbed in
the pursuit of earthly things. They are intoxicated with
sensuous gratification. The fore-thrown shadow of the coming
thought of self-examination awakens within them a vague
instinctive dread; and they shudder, turn away, and by
every effort avoid it. Sometimes they succeed; and through
the gates of death rush headlong into the spirit-land, only to
be tortured forever there with the experience they so successfully
eluded here. For the many thousands, who know
by experience what a calm, candid, searching, self-examination
is, now that their attention has been drawn to its full
psychological import, no further word is necessary. They
know that in that supreme insight there was seen and
known, at one and the same instant, in a spontaneous and
simultaneous action of the soul, the seer and the seen as
one, as identical. And this experience is so wide-spread,
that the wonder is that it has not heretofore been assigned its
suitable place in philosophy.</p>

<p>2. Always in the self-existent, the absolute and infinite,
spiritual Person, the subject and object are identical. This
question, though one of fact, cannot be determined <i>by us</i>, by
our experience; it must be shown to follow logically from
certain <i>a priori</i> first principles. This may be done as follows.<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
Eternity, independence, universality, are qualities of
God. Being eternal, he is ever the same. Being independent,
he excludes the possibility of another Being to whom
he is necessarily related. Being universal, he possesses all
possible endowment, and is ground for all possible existence;
so that no being can exist but by his will. As Universal
Genius, all possible objects of knowledge or intellectual
effort are immanent before the eye of his Reason; and this
is a <i>permanent state</i>. He is an object of knowledge, comprehending
all others; and therefore he <i>exhaustively</i> knows himself.
He distinguishes his Self as object, from no what else,
because there is no else to distinguish his Self from; but
having an exhaustive self-comprehension, he distinguishes
within that Self all possible forms of being each from each.</p>

<p>He is absolute, and never learns or changes. There is
nothing to learn and nothing to change to, except to a wicked
state; and for this there <i>can be to him no temptation</i>. He is
ever the same, and hence there can be no instant in time
when he does not <i>exhaustively</i> know himself. Thus always
in him are the subject and object identical.</p>

<p>These two great principles, viz: That the Pure Reason
sees <i>a priori</i> truth <i>immediately</i>, and out of all relation, plurality
and difference, and that in the Pure Reason, in self-examination,
the subject and object are identical, by their simple
statement explode, as a Pythagorean system, the mental
astronomy of the Limitists. Reason is the sun, and the
Sense and the Understanding, with their satellite faculties, the
circumvolving planets.</p>

<p>The use of terms by the Limitists has been as vicious as
their processes of thought, and has naturally sprung from
their fundamental error. We will note one in the following
sentence. "Consciousness, in the only form in which we
can conceive it, implies limitation and change,&mdash;the perception
of one object out of many, and a comparison of that object
with others." Conceive is the vicious word. Strictly,
it is usable only with regard to things in Nature, and can<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
have no relevancy to such subjects as are now under consideration.
It is a word which expresses <i>only</i> such operations
as lie in the Sense and Understanding. The following definition
explains this: "The concept refers to all the things
whose common or similar attributes or traits it conceives
(con-cepis), or <i>grasps together</i> into one class and one act of
mind."&mdash;<i>Bowen's Logic</i>, p. 7. This is not the mode of the
Reason's action at all. It does not run over a variety of
objects and select out from them the points of similarity, and
grasp these together into one act of mind. It sees one object
in its unity as pure law, or first truth; and examines that in
its own light. Hence, the proper word is, <i>intuits</i>. Seen
from this standpoint, consciousness does <i>not</i> imply limitation
and change. A first truth we always see as <i>absolute</i>,&mdash;we
are conscious of this sight; and yet we know that neither
consciousness nor sight is any limitation upon the truth.
We would paraphrase the sentence thus: Consciousness, in
the highest form in which we know it, implies and possesses
<i>permanence</i>; and is the light in which pure truth is
seen as pure object by itself, and forever the same.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how the Understanding and the
Pure Reason run along side by side in the same sentence;
the inferior faculty encumbering and defeating the efforts of
the other. Take the following for example.</p>

<p>"If the infinite can be that which it is not, it is by that
very possibility marked out as incomplete, and capable of a
higher perfection. If it is actually everything, it possesses
no characteristic feature by which it can be distinguished
from anything else, and discerned as an object of consciousness."
The presence in language of the word infinite and
its cognates is decisive evidence of the presence of a faculty
capable of entertaining it as a subject for investigation.
This faculty, the Reason having presented the subject for
consideration, the Understanding seizes upon it and drags it
down into her den, and says, "can be that which it is not."
This she says, because she cannot act, except to conceive,<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
and cannot conceive, except to distinguish this from something
else; and so cannot perceive that the very utterance
of the word "infinite" excludes the word "else." The
Understanding conceives the finite as one and independent,
and the infinite as one and independent. Then the Reason
steps in, and says the infinite is all-comprehending. This
conflicts with the Understanding's <i>conception</i>, and so the puzzle
comes. In laboring for a solution, the Reason's affirmation
is expressed hypothetically: "If it (the infinite) is actually
everything;" and thereupon the Understanding puts in
its blind, impertinent assertion, "it possesses no characteristic
feature by which it can be distinguished from anything else."
<i>There is nothing else from which to distinguish it.</i> The perception
of the Reason is as follows. The infinite Person
comprehends intellectually, and is ground for potentially and
actually, all that is possible and real; and so there can be
no else with which to compare him. Because, possessing all
fulness, he is actually everything, by this characteristic feature
of completeness he distinguishes himself from nothing,
which is all there is, (if no-thing&mdash;void&mdash;can be said to <i>be</i>,)
beside him; and from any part, which there is within him.
Thus is he object to himself in his own consciousness.</p>

<p>This vicious working of the Understanding against the
Reason, in the same sentences, can be more fully illustrated
from the following extracts. "God, as necessarily determined
to pass from absolute essence to relative manifestation,
is determined to pass either <i>from the better to the worse, or
from the worse to the better</i>. A third possibility that both
states are equal, as contradictory in itself, and as contradicted
by our author, it is not necessary to consider."&mdash;<i>Sir William
Hamilton's Essays</i>, p. 42. "Again, how can the Relative be
conceived as coming into being? If it is a distinct reality
from the absolute, it must be conceived as passing from non-existence
into existence. But to conceive an object as non-existent
is again a self-contradiction; for that which is conceived
exists, as an object of thought, in and by that conception.<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
We may abstain from thinking of an object at all;
but if we think of it, we cannot but think of it as existing.
It is possible at one time not to think of an object at all, and
at another to think of it as already in being; but to think of
it in the act of becoming, in the progress from not being into
being, is to think that which, in the very thought, annihilates
itself. Here again the Pantheistic hypothesis seems forced
upon us. We can think of creation only as a change in the
condition of that which already exists; and thus the creature
is conceivable only as a phenomenal mode of the being
of the Creator."&mdash;<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i>, p. 81.</p>

<p>"God," a word which has <i>no significance</i> except to the
Reason: "as necessarily determined,"&mdash;a phrase which belongs
only to the Understanding. The opposite is the truth:
"to pass from absolute essence." This can have no meaning
except to the Pure Reason: "to relative manifestation."
This belongs to the Understanding. It contradicts the other;
and the process is absurd. The mind balks in the attempt
to think it. In creation there is no such process as "passing
from absolute essence to relative manifestation." The
words imply that God, in passing from the state of absolute
essence, ceased to be absolute essence, and became "relative
manifestation." All this is absurd; and is in the Understanding
and Sense. God never <i>became</i>. The Creator is
still absolute essence, as before creation; and the logician's
this or that are both false; and his third possibility is not a
contradiction, but the truth. The fact of creation may be
thus stated. The infinite Person, freely according his will
to the behest of his worth, and yet equally free to not so
accord his will, put forth from himself the creative energy;
and this under such modes, that he neither lost nor gained
by the act; but that, though the latter state was diverse from
the first, still neither was better than the other, but both
were equally good. Before creation, he possessed absolute
plenitude of endowments. All possible ideals were present
before his eye. All possible joy continued a changeless<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
state in his sensibility. His will, as choice, was absolute benevolence;
and, as act, was competent to all possible effort.
To push the ideal out, and make it real, added nothing to,
and subtracted nothing from, his fulness.</p>

<p>The fact must be learned that muscular action and the
working of pure spirit are so diverse, that the inferior mode
cannot be an illustration of the superior. A change in a
pure spirit, which neither adds nor subtracts, leaves the good
unchanged. Hence, when the infinite Person created, he
passed neither from better to worse, nor from worse to better;
but the two states, though diverse, were equally good.</p>

<p>We proceed now to the other extract. "Again, how can
the relative," etc. "If the Relative is a distinct reality from
the absolute," then each is <i>self-existent</i>, and independent.
The sentence annihilates itself. "It must be conceived as
passing from non-existence into existence." The image here
is from the Sense, as usual, and vicious accordingly. It is,
that the soul is to look into void, and see, out of that void,
existence come, without there being any cause for that existence
coming. This would be the phenomenon to the Sense.
And the Sense is utterly unable to account for the phenomenon.
The object in the Sense must appear as <i>form</i>; but in
the Reason it is idea. Mr. Mansel's presentation may well
be illustrated by a trick of jugglery. The performer stands
before his audience, dressed in tights, and presents the palms
of his hands to the spectators, apparently empty. He then
closes his right hand, and then opening it again, appears holding
a bouquet of delicious flowers, which he hands about to
the astonished gazers. The bouquet seems to come from
nothing, <i>i. e.</i> to have no cause. It appears "to pass from
non-existence to existence." But common sense corrects the
cheating seeming, and asserts, "There is an adequate cause
for the coming of the bunch of flowers, though we cannot
see it." Precisely similar is creation. Could there have
been a Sense present at that instant, creation would have
seemed to it a juggler's trick. Out of nothing something<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
would have seemed to come. But under the correcting
guide of the Pure Reason, an adequate cause is found. Before
creation, the infinite Person did not manifest himself;
and so was actually alone. At creation his power, which before
was immanent, he now made emanent; and put it forth
in the forms chosen from his Reason, and according to the
requirement of his own worth. Nothing was added to God.
That which was ideal he now made actual. The form as
Idea was one, the power as Potentiality was another, and
each was in him by itself. He put forth the power into the
form, the Potentiality into the Idea, and the Universe was.
Thus it was that "the Relative came into being." In the
same manner it might be shown how, all along through the
writings of the Limitists, the Understanding runs along by
the Reason, and vitiates her efforts to solve her problems.
We shall have occasion to do something of this farther on.</p>

<p>The topic now under discussion could not be esteemed finished
without an examination of the celebrated dictum, "To
think is to condition." Those who have held this to be universally
true, have also received its logical sequence, that to
the finite intellect God cannot appear self-comprehending.
In our present light, the dictum is known to be, not a universal,
but only a partial, truth. It is incumbent, therefore,
to circumscribe its true sphere, and fix it there. We shall
best enter upon this labor by answering the question, What
is thinking?</p>

<p>First. In general, and loosely, any mental operation is
called thinking. Second. Specifically, all acts of reflection
are thinkings. Under this head we notice two points.
<i>a.</i> That act of the Understanding in which an object presented
by the Sense is analyzed, and its special and generic
elements noted, and is thus classified, and its relations determined,
is properly a thinking. Thus, in the object cat I distinguish
specifically that it is domestic, and generically that
it is carnivorous. <i>b.</i> That act of the finite spiritual person
by which he compares the judgments of the Understanding<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
with the <i>a priori</i> laws of the Pure Reason, and by this final
standard decides their truth or error. Thus, the judgment
of the young Indian warrior is, that he ought to hunt down
and slay the man who killed his father in battle. The standard
of Reason is, that Malice is criminal. This judgment is
found to involve malice, and so is found to be wrong. Third,
the intuitions of the reason. These, in the finite person,
come <i>after</i> a process of reflection, and are partly consequent
upon it; yet they take place in another faculty, which is
developed by this process; but they are such, that by no
process of reflection <i>alone</i> could they be. Thinking, in the
Universal Genius, is the <i>sight</i>, at once and forever, of all
possible object of mental effort. It is necessary and <i>spontaneous</i>,
and so is an endowment, not an attainment; and is
possessed without effort. We are prepared now to entertain
the following statements:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. So far as it represents thinking as the active, <i>i. e.</i>
causative ground, or agent of the condition, the dictum is not
true. The fact of the thinking is not, cannot be, the ground
of the condition. The condition of the object thought, whatever
the form of thinking may be, must lie as far back at
least as the ground of the thinker. Thus, God's self, as
ground for his Genius, must also be ground for <i>all</i> conditions.
Yet men think of an object <i>in its conditions</i>. This is because
the same Being who constructed the objects in their
conditions, constructed also man as thinker, <i>correlated to
those conditions</i>, so that he should think upon things <i>as they
are</i>. In this view, to think is not condition, but is mental
activity in the conditions already imposed. Thus it is with
the Understanding; and the process of thinking, as above
designated, goes on in accordance with the law stated in <i>a</i>,
of the second general definition. It follows, therefore,</p>

<p>B. That so far as the dictum expresses the fact, that within
the sphere of conditions proper,&mdash;observing the distinction
of conditions into two classes heretofore made,&mdash;the
finite intellect must act under them, and see those objects<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
upon which they lie, accordingly,&mdash;as, for instance, a geometrical
figure must be seen in Time and Space,&mdash;so far it is
true, and no farther. For instance: To see an eagle flying,
is to see it under all the conditions imposed upon the bird as
flying, and the observer as seeing. But when men intuit the
<i>a priori</i> truth, Malice is criminal, they perceive that it lies
under no conditions proper, but is absolute and universal.
We perceive, then,</p>

<p>C. That for all mental operations which have as object
pure laws and ideal forms, and that Being in whom all these
inhere, this dictum is not true. The thinker may be conditioned
in the proper sense of that term; yet he entertains
objects of thought which are unconditioned; and they are
not affected by it. Thus, it does not affect the universality
of the principle in morals above noted that I perceive it to
be such, and that necessarily.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that by the dictum, To think is to condition,
is meant, not that the thinker, by the act of thinking,
constructs the conditions, but that he recognizes in himself,
as thinking subject, and in the object thought, the several
conditions (proper) thereof,&mdash;the following statements will
define the province of this dictum.</p>

<p>1. The Universe as physical object, the observing Sense,
and the discursive Understanding, lie wholly within it.</p>

<p>2. Created spiritual persons, <i>as constituted beings,</i> also lie
wholly within it. <i>But it extends no farther.</i> On the other
hand,</p>

<p>3. Created spiritual persons, in their capacities to intuit
pure laws, and pure ideal forms; and those laws and forms
themselves lie wholly without it.</p>

<p>4. So also does God the absolute Being in whom those
laws and forms inhere. Or, in general terms,</p>

<p>When conditions (proper) already lie upon the object
thought, since the thinker must needs see the object under
its conditions, it is true that, To think is to condition. But
so far as it is meant that thinking is such a kind of operation<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
that it cannot proceed except the object be conditioned, it is
not true; for there are processes of thought whose objects
are unconditioned.</p>

<p>The question, "What are Space and Time?" with which
Mr. Spencer opens his chapter on "Ultimate Scientific Ideas,"
introduces a subject common to all the Limitists, and which,
therefore, should be considered in this part of our work. A
remark made a few pages back, respecting an essay in the
"North American Review" for October 1864, applies with
equal force here in reference to another essay by the same
writer, in the preceding July number of that periodical. At
most, his view can only be unfolded. He has left nothing to
be added. In discussing a subject so abstruse and difficult as
this, it would seem, in the present stage of human thought at
least, most satisfactory to set out from the Reason rather than
the Sense, from the idea rather than the phenomenon; and
so will we do.</p>

<p>In general, then, it may be said that Space and Time are
<i>a priori</i> conditions of created being. The following extracts
are in point. "Pure Space, therefore, as given in the primitive
intuition, is pure form for any possible phenomenon.
As unconjoined in the unity of any form, it is given in the
primitive intuition, and is a cognition necessary and universal.
Though now obtained from experience, and in chronological
order subsequent to experience, yet is it no deduction
from experience, nor at all given by experience; but it is
wholly independent of all experience, prior to it, and without
which it were impossible that any experience of outer object
should be." "Pure Time, as given in the intuition, is immediately
beheld to be conditional for all possible period,
prior to any period being actually limited, and necessarily
continuing, though all bounded period be taken away."&mdash;<i>Rational
Psychology</i>, pp. 125, 128.</p>

<p>Again, a clearly defined distinction may be made between
them as conditions. Space is the <i>a priori</i> condition of <i>material</i>
being. Should a spiritual person, as the soul of a man,<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
be stripped of all its material appurtenances, and left to exist
as pure spirit, it could hold no communication with any other
being but God; and no other being but he could hold any
communication with it. It would exist out of all relation to
Space. Not so, however, with Time. Time is the <i>a priori</i>
condition of all created being, of the spiritual as well as
material. In the case just alluded to, the isolated spiritual
person would have a consciousness of succession and duration,
although he would have no standard by which to measure
that duration, he could think in processes, and only in
processes, and thus would be necessarily related to Time.
Dr. Hickok has expressed this thus: "Space in reference to
time has no significancy. Time is the pure form for phenomena
as given in the internal sense only, and in these there
can be only succession. The inner phenomenon may endure
in time, but can have neither length, breadth, nor thickness
in space. A thought, or other mental phenomenon, may fill
a period, but cannot have superficial or solid content; it may
be before or after another, but not above or below it, nor with
any outer or inner side."&mdash;<i>Rational Psychology</i>, p. 135.</p>

<p>Space and Time may also be distinguished thus: "Space
has three dimensions," or, rather, there can be three dimensions
in space,&mdash;length, breadth, and thickness. In other
words, it is solid room. "Time has but one dimension," or,
rather, but one dimension can enter into Time,&mdash;length. In
Time there can only be procession. Space and Time may
then be called, the one "statical," the other "dynamical,"
illimitation. Following the essayist already referred to, they
may be defined as follows:</p>

<p>"Space is the infinite and indivisible Receptacle of Matter.</p>

<p>"Time is the infinite and indivisible Receptacle of Existence."</p>

<p>Both, then, are marked by receptivity, indivisibility, and
illimitability. The one is receptivity, that material object
may come into it; the other, that event may occur in it.
There is for neither a final unit nor any limit. All objects<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
are divisible in Space, and all periods in Time; and thus
also are all limits comprehended, but they are without limit.
Turning now from these more general aspects of the subject,
a detailed examination may be conducted as follows.</p>

<p>The fundamental law given by the Reason is, as was seen
above, that Space and Time are <i>a priori</i> conditions of created
being. We can best consider this law in its application to
the facts, by observing two general divisions, with two sub-divisions
under each. Space and Time have, then, two general
phases, one within, and one without, the mind. Each
of these has two special phases. The former, one in the
Sense, and one in the Understanding. The latter, one within,
and one without, the Universe.</p>

<p>First general phase within the mind. First special phase,
in the Sense. "As pure form in the primitive intuition, they
are wholly limitless, and void of any conjunction in unity,
having themselves no figure nor period, and having within
themselves no figure nor period, but only pure diversity, in
which any possible conjunction of definite figures and periods
may, in some way, be effected." In other words, they are
pure, <i>a priori</i>, formal laws, which are conditional to the being
of any sense as the perceiver of a phenomenon; and yet this
sense could present no figure or period, till some figure or
period was produced into it by an external agency. As such
necessary formal laws, Space and Time "have a necessity
of being independently of all phenomena." Or, in other
words, the fact that all phenomena <i>must</i> appear in them, lies
beyond the province of power. This, however, is no more a
limit to the Deity than it is a limit to him that he cannot
hate his creatures and be good. In our experience the Sense
gives two kinds of phenomena: the one the actual phenomena
of actual objects, the other, ideal phenomena with ideal
objects. The one is awakened by the presentation, in the
physical sense, of a material object, as a house; the other,
by the activity of the imaging faculty, engaged in constructing
some form in the inner or mental sense, from forms<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
actually observed. Upon both alike the formal law of Space
and Time must lie.</p>

<p>Second special phase, in the Understanding. Although
there is pure form, if there was no more than this, no notion
of a system of things could be. Each object would have its
own space, and each event its own time. But one object
and event could not be seen in any relation to another object
and event. In order that this shall be, there must be some
ground by which all the spaces and times of phenomena shall
be joined into a unity of Space and Time; so that all objects
shall be seen in one Space, and all events in one Time. "A
notional connective for the phenomena may determine these
phenomena in their places and periods in the whole of all
space and of all time, and so may give both the phenomena
and their space and time in an objective experience." The
operation of the Understanding is, then, the connection, by a
notional, of all particular spaces and times; <i>i. e.</i> the space
and time of each phenomenon in the Sense, into a comprehensive
unity of Space and Time, in which all phenomena
can be seen to occur; and thus a system can be. In a word,
not only must each phenomenon be seen in its own space
and time, but all phenomena must be seen in <i>one</i> Space and
Time. This connection of the manifold into unity is the
peculiar work of the Understanding. An examination of
the facts as above set forth enables us to construct a general
formula for the application to all minds of the fundamental
law given by the Reason. That law, that all objects must
be seen in Space, and all events in Time, involves the subordinate
law:</p>

<p><i>That no mind can observe material objects or any events
except under the conditions of Space and Time</i>; or, to change
the phraseology, <i>Space and Time are</i> a priori <i>conditional to
the being of any mind or faculty in a mind capable of observing
a material object or any event</i>. This will, perhaps,
be deemed to be, in substance, Kant's theory. However
that may be, this is true, but is only <i>a part of the truth</i>.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
The rest will appear just below. The reader will notice
that no exception is made to the law here laid down, and will
start at the thought that this law lies upon the Deity equally
as upon created beings. No exception is made, because
none can be truthfully made. The intellect is just as unqualified
in its assertion on this point as in those noticed on
an earlier page of this work. Equally with the laws of
numbers does the law of Space and Time condition all intellect.
The Deity can no more see a house out of all relation
to Space and Time than he can see how to make two and
two five.</p>

<p>Second general phase, without the mind. First special
phase, within the Universe. All that we are now to examine
is objective to us; and all the questions which can arise
are questions of fact. Let us search for the fact carefully
and hold it fearlessly. To recur to the general law. It was
found at the outset that Reason gave the idea of Space and
Time as pure conditions for matter and event. We are now
to observe the pure become the actual condition; or, in other
words, we are to see the condition <i>realized</i>. Since, then, we
are to observe material objects and events in a material system,
it is fitting to use the Sense and the Understanding;
and our statements and conclusions will conform to those
faculties.</p>

<p>We have a concept of the Universe as a vast system in
the form of a sphere in which all things are included. This
spherical system is complete, definite, limited, and so has
boundaries. A portion of "immeasurable void"&mdash;Space&mdash;has
been occupied. Where there was nothing, something
has become. Now it is evident that the possibility of our
having a concept of the Universe, or of a space and a time
in the Universe, is based upon the presence of an actual, underlying,
all-pervading substance, which fills and forms the
boundaries of the Universe, and thus enables spaces and
times to be. We have no concept except as in limits, and
those limits are conceived to be substance. In other words,<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
space is distance, and time is duration, in our concept. Take
away the boundaries which mark the distance, and the procession
of events which forms the duration, and in the concept
pure negation is left. To illustrate. Suppose there be
in our presence a cubic yard of vacuum. Is this vacuum an
entity? Not at all. It can neither be perceived by the
Sense nor conceived by the Understanding. Yet it is a
space. Speaking carelessly, we should say that this cube
was object to us. Why? Because it is enclosed by substantial
boundaries. All, then, that is object, all that is entity,
is substance. In our concept, therefore, a space is solid
distance within the substance, and the totality of all distances
in the Universe is conceived to be Space. Again; suppose
there pass before our mind a procession of events. One
event has a fixed recurrence. In our concept the procession
of events is a time, and the recurring event marks a period
in time. The events proceeding are all that there is in the
concept; and apart from the procession a conception of time
is impossible. The procession of all the events of the Universe,
that is <i>duration</i>, is our concept of Time. Thus, within
the Universe, space is solid distance and time is duration;
and neither has any actuality except as the Universe is.
Let us assume for a moment that our concept is the final
truth, and observe the result. In that concept space is limited
by matter, and matter is conceived of as unlimited.
This result is natural and necessary, because matter, substance,
"a space-filling force," is the underlying notional
upon which as ground any concept is possible. If matter is
truly illimitable, then materialistic pantheism, which is really
atheism, logically follows. Again; in our concept time is
duration, and duration is conceived of as unlimited. If so,
the during event is unlimited. From this hypothesis idealistic
pantheism logically follows. But bring our concept into
the clear light, and under the searching eye of Reason, and
all ground for those systems vanishes instantly. Instead of
finding matter illimitable and the limit for a space, Space is<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
seen to be illimitable and pure condition, that matter may
establish a limit within it. And Time, instead of being duration,
and so limited by the during event, is found to be
illimitable and pure condition, that event may have duration
in it. This brings us to the</p>

<p>Second special phase, without or independent of the Universe.
We have been considering facts in an objective experience,
and have used therefore the Sense and Understanding,
as was proper. What we are now to consider is a subject
of which all experience is impossible. It can therefore
be examined only by that faculty which presents it, the Pure
Reason. Remove now from our presence all material object
in Space, and all during event in Time; in a word, remove
the Universe, and what will be left? As the Universe had
a beginning, and both it and all things in it are conditioned
by Space and Time, so also let it have an end. Will its conditions
cease in its ceasing? Could another Universe arise,
upon which would be imposed no conditions of Space and
Time? These questions are answered in the statement of
them. Those conditions must remain. When we have abstracted
from our <i>concept</i> all substance and duration, there is
left only <i>void</i>. Hence, in our concept it would be proper to
say that without the Universe is void, and before the Universe
there was void. Also, that in void there is no thing,
no where, and no when; or, void is the negation of actual
substance, space and time. But pure Space and Time, as <i>a
priori</i> conditions that material object and during event may
be, have not ceased. There is still <i>room</i>, that an object may
become. There is still <i>opportunity</i>, that an event may occur.
By the Reason it is seen that these conditions have the same
necessary being for material object and occurring event, as
the conditions of mental activity have for mind; and they
have their peculiar characteristics exactly according with
what they do condition, just as the laws of thought have
their peculiar characteristics, which exactly suit them to
what they condition. If there be a spiritual person, the<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
moral law must be given in the intuition as necessarily binding
upon him; and this is an <i>a priori</i> condition of the being
of such person. Precisely similar is the relation between
Space and Time as <i>a priori</i> conditions, and object and event
upon which they lie. The moral law has its characteristics,
which fit it to condition spiritual person. Space and Time
have their characteristics, which fit them to condition object
and event. Space, then, as room, and Time as opportunity,
and both as <i>a priori</i> conditions of a Universe, must have the
same necessity of being that God has. They <i>must</i> be, as he
<i>must</i> be. But observe, they are pure conditions, and no
more. They are neither things nor persons. The idea of
them in the Reason is simple and unanalyzable. They can
be assigned their logical position, but further than this the
mind cannot go.</p>

<p>The devout religious soul will start, perhaps, at some of
the positions stated above. We have not wrought to pain
such soul, but only for truth, and the clue of escape from all
dilemmas. The only question to be raised is, are they true?
If a more patient investigation than we have given to this
subject shall show our positions false, then we shall only
have failed as others before us have; but we shall love the
truth which shall be found none the less. But if they shall
be found true, then is it certain that God always knew them
so and was always pleased with them, and no derogation to
his dignity can come from the proclamation of them, however
much they may contravene hitherto cherished opinions.
Most blessed next after the Saviour's tender words of forgiveness
are those pure words of the apostle John, "No lie
is of the truth."</p>

<p>The conclusions to which we have arrived enable us to
state how it is that primarily God was out of all relation to
Space and Time. He was out of all relation to Space, because
he is not material object, thereby having limits, form,
and position in Space. He was out of all relation to Time,
because he holds immediately, and at once, all possible objects<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
of knowledge before the Eye of his mind. Hence he can
learn nothing, and can experience no process of thought.
Within his mind no event occurs, no substance endures. Yet,
while this is true, it is equally true that, as the Creator, he
is conditioned by Space and Time, just as he is conditioned
by himself; and it may be found by future examination that
they are essential to that Self. But, whatever conclusion
may be arrived at respecting so difficult and abstract a subject,
this much is certain: God, as the infinite and absolute
spiritual Person, self-existent and supreme, is the great Fact;
and Space and Time, whatever they are, will, <i>can</i> in no wise
interfere with and compromise his perfectness and supremacy.
It is a pleasure to be able to close this discussion with reflections
profound and wise as those contained in the following
extract from the essay heretofore alluded to.</p>

<p>"The reciprocal relations of Space, Time, and God, are
veiled in impenetrable darkness. Many minds hesitate to
attribute real infinity to Space and Time, lest it should conflict
with the infinity of God. Such timidity has but a slender
title to respect. If the Laws of Thought necessitate
any conclusion whatever, they necessitate the conclusion that
Space and Time are each infinite; and if we cannot reconcile
this result with the infinity of God, there is no alternative
but to accept of scepticism with as good a grace as possible.
No man is worthy to join in the search for truth, who
trembles at the sight of it when found. But a profound
faith in the unity of all truth destroys scepticism by anticipation,
and prophesies the solutions of reason. Space is
infinite, Time is infinite, God is infinite; three infinites coexist.
Limitation is possible only between existences of the
same kind. There could not be two infinite Spaces, two infinite
Times, or two infinite Gods; but while infinites of the same
kind cannot coexist, infinites of unlike kinds may. When an
hour limits a rod, infinite Time will limit infinite Space;
when a year and an acre limit wisdom, holiness, and love,
infinite Space and Time will limit the infinite God. <i>But not</i><span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
<i>before.</i> Time exists ubiquitously, Space exists eternally,
God exists ubiquitously and eternally. The nature of the
relations between the three infinites, so long as Space and
Time are ontologically incognizable, is utterly and absolutely
incomprehensible; but to assume contradiction, exclusion, or
mutual limitation to be among these relations, is as gratuitous
as it is irreverent."</p>

<p class="h3">AN EXAMINATION IN DETAIL OF CERTAIN IMPORTANT PASSAGES
IN THE WRITINGS OF THE LIMITISTS.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL REFLECTIONS UPON THE WRITINGS OF SIR WILLIAM
HAMILTON.</p>

<p>It never formed any part of the plan of this work to give
an extended examination of the logician's system of metaphysics,
or even to notice it particularly. From the first, it
was only proposed to attempt the refutation of that peculiar
theory which he enounced in his celebrated essay, "The
Philosophy of the Unconditioned," a monograph that has
generally been received as a fair and sufficient presentation
thereof; and which he supplemented, but never superseded.
If the arguments adduced, and illustrations presented, in the
first part, in behalf of the fact of the Pure Reason, are satisfactory,
and the analysis and attempted refutation of the
celebrated dictum based upon two extremes, an excluded
middle and a mean, in the second part, are accepted as sufficient,
as also the criticisms upon certain general corollaries,
and the explanation of certain general questions, then, so far
at least as Sir William Hamilton is concerned, but little, if
any, further remark will be expected. A few subordinate
passages in the essay above referred to may, however, it is
believed, be touched with profit by the hand of criticism and
explanation. To these, therefore, the reader's attention is
now called.</p>

<p>In remarking upon Cousin's philosophy, Hamilton says:
"Now, it is manifest that the whole doctrine of M. Cousin
is involved in the proposition, <i>that the Unconditioned, the</i><span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
<i>Absolute, the Infinite, is immediately known in consciousness,
and this by difference, plurality, and relation</i>." It is hardly
necessary to repeat here the criticism, that the terms infinite,
absolute, &amp;c. are entirely out of place when used to express
abstractions. As before, we ask, infinite&mdash;what? The fact
of abstraction is one of the greatest of limitations, and vitiates
every such utterance of the Limitists. The truth may
be thus stated:&mdash;The infinite Person, or the necessary principle
as inhering in that Person, is <i>immediately</i> known in
consciousness, and this, not by difference, plurality, and relation,
but by a direct intuition of the Pure Reason. In this
act the object seen&mdash;the idea&mdash;is held right in the Reason's
eye; and so is seen by itself and in itself. Hence it is not
known by difference, because there is no other object but the
one before that eye, with which to compare it. Neither is it
known by plurality, because it is seen by itself, and there is
no other object contemplated, with which to join it. Nor is
it known by relation, because it is seen to be what it is <i>in
itself</i>, and as out of all relation. A little below, in the same
paragraph, Hamilton again remarks upon Cousin, thus:&mdash;"The
recognition of the absolute as a constitutive principle
of intelligence, our author regards as at once the condition
and the end of philosophy." The true idea, accurately
stated, is as follows. The fact that, by a constituting law of
intelligence, the Pure Reason immediately intuits absoluteness
as the distinctive quality of <i>a priori</i> first principles, and
of the infinite Person in whom they inhere, is the condition,
and the application of that fact is the end of philosophy.</p>

<p>These two erroneous positions the logician follows with
his celebrated "statement of the opinions which may be entertained
regarding the Unconditioned, as an immediate object
of knowledge and of thought." The four "opinions," to
which he reduces all those held by philosophers, are too well
known to need quotation here. They are noticed now, only
to afford an opportunity for the presentation of a fifth, and,
as it is believed, the true opinion, which is as follows.<span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>The infinite Person is "inconceivable," but is cognizable
as a fact, is known to be, and is, to a certain extent, known
to be such and such; all this, by an immediate intuition of
the Pure Reason, of which the spiritual person is definitely
conscious; and that Person is so seen to be primarily unconditioned,
<i>i. e.</i> out of all relation, difference, and plurality.</p>

<p>"Inconceivable." As we have repeatedly said, this word
has no force except with regard to things in nature.</p>

<p>Is cognizable as a fact, &amp;c. Nothing can be more certain
than that an <i>exhaustive</i> knowledge of the Deity is impossible
to any creature. But equally certain is it, that, except as we
have some true, positive, <i>reliable</i> knowledge of him <i>as he is</i>,
we cannot be moral beings under his moral government.
Take, for instance, the moral law as the expression of God's
nature. 1. Either "God is love," or he is not love&mdash;hate;
or he is indifferent, <i>i. e.</i> love has no relation to him. If
the last alternative is true, then the other two have no relevancy
to the subject in hand. Upon such a supposition, it
is unquestionably true that he is utterly inscrutable. Then
are we in just the condition which the Limitists assert. But
observe the results respecting ourselves. Our whole moral
nature is the most bitter, tantalizing falsehood which it is
possible for us to entertain as an object of knowledge. We
feel that we ought to love the perfect Being. At times we
go starving for love to him and beg that bread. He has no
love to give. He never felt a pulsation of affection. He
sits alone on his icy throne, in a realm of eternal snow; and,
covered with the canopy, and shut in by the panoply, of inscrutable
mystery, he mocks our cry. We beg for bread.
He gives us a stone. Does such a picture instantly shock,
yea, horrify, all our finer sensibilities? Does the soul cry out
in agony, her rejection of such a conclusion? In that cry
we hear the truth in God's voice; for he made the soul.
Still less can the thought be entertained that he is hate. It
is impossible, then, to think of God except as <i>love</i>. We know
what love is. We know what God is. There is a somewhat<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
common to the Deity and his spiritual creatures. This
enables us to attain a final law, as follows.</p>

<p><i>In so far as God's creatures have faculties and capacities
in common with him, in so far do they know him positively;
but in all matters to which their peculiarities as creatures pertain,
they only know him negatively;</i> i. e. <i>they know that he
is the opposite of themselves.</i></p>

<p>That passage which was quoted in a former page, simply
to prove that Sir William Hamilton denied the reality of the
Reason as distinct from the Understanding, requires and will
now receive a particular examination. He says: "In the
Kantian philosophy, both faculties perform the same function;
both seek the one in the many;&mdash;the Idea (Idee) is
only the Concept (Begriff) sublimated into the inconceivable;
Reason only the Understanding which has 'overleaped
itself.'" In this sentence, and the remarks which follow it,
the logician shows that he neither comprehends the assigned
function and province of the Reason, nor possesses any accurate
knowledge of the mental phenomena upon which he
passes judgment. A diagnosis could not well be more thoroughly
erroneous than his. For "both faculties" do <i>not</i>
"perform the same function." Only the Understanding
seeks "the one in the many." The Reason seeks <i>the many
in the one</i>. The functions and modes of activity of the two
faculties are exactly opposite. The Understanding runs
about through the universe, and gathers up what facts it may,
and concludes truth therefrom. The Reason sees the truth
<i>first</i>, as necessary <i>a priori</i> law, and holding it up as standard,
measures facts by it, or uses the Sense to find the facts
in which it inheres. Besides, the author, in this assertion, is
guilty of a most glaring <i>petitio principii</i>. For, the very
question at issue is, whether "both faculties" do "perform
the same function"; whether "both" do "seek the one in
the many." In order not to leave the hither side of the
question built upon a bare assertion, it will be proper to
revert to a few of those proofs adduced heretofore. The<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
Reason sees the truth first. Take now the assertion, Malice
is criminal. Is this primarily learned by experience; or is
it an intuitive conviction, which conditions experience. Or,
in more general terms, does a child need to be taught what
guilt is, before it can feel guilty, as it is taught its letters
before it can read; or does the feeling of guilt arise within
it spontaneously, upon a breach of known law. If the latter
be the true experience, then it can only be accounted for
upon the ground that an idea of right and wrong, as an <i>a
priori</i> law, is organic in man; and, by our definition, the
presentation of this law to the attention in consciousness is
the act of the Reason. Upon such a theory the one principle
was not sought, and is not found, in the many acts, but
the many acts are compared with, and judged by, that one
standard, which was seen <i>first</i>, and as necessarily true.
Take another illustration. All religions, in accounting for
the universe, have one common point of agreement, which is,
that some being or beings, superior to it and men, produced
it. And, except perhaps among the most degraded, the more
subtle notion of a final cause, though often developed in a
crude form, is associated with the other. These notions
must be accounted for. How shall it be done? Are they
the result of experience? Then, the first human beings had
no such notions. But another and more palpable objection
arises. Are they the result of individual experience?
Then there would be as many religions as individuals. But,
very ignorant people have the experience,&mdash;persons who
never learned anything but the rudest forms of work, from
the accumulated experience of others; nor by their own experience,
to make the smallest improvement in a simple agricultural
instrument. How, then, could they learn by experience
one of the profoundest speculative ideas? As a last
resort, it may be said they were taught it by philosophers.
But this is negatived by the fact, that philosophers do not, to
any considerable extent, teach the people, either immediately
or mediately; but that generally those who have the least philosophy<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
have the largest influence. And what is most in point,
none of these hypotheses will account for the fact, that the
gist of the idea, however crude its form, is everywhere the
same. Be it a Fetish, or Brahm, or God, in the kernel final
cause will be found. It would seem that any candid mind
must acknowledge that no combined effort of men, were this
possible, could secure such universal exactitude. But turn
now and examine any individual in the same direction, as
we did just above, respecting the question of right and wrong,
and a plain answer will come directly. The notion of first
cause, however crude and rudimentary its form, is organic.
It arises, then, spontaneously, and the individual takes it&mdash;"the
one,"&mdash;and in it finds a reason for the phenomena of
nature&mdash;"the many,"&mdash;and is satisfied. And this is an
experience not peculiar to the philosopher; but is shared
equally by the illiterate,&mdash;those entirely unacquainted with
scientific abstractions. These illustrations might be carried
to an almost indefinite length, showing that commonly, in
the every-day experiences of life, men are accustomed not
only to observe phenomena and form conclusions, as "It is
cloudy to-day, and may rain to-morrow," but also to measure
phenomena by an original and fixed standard, as, "This
man is malicious, and therefore wicked." Between the two
modes of procedure, the following distinction may always be
observed. Conclusions are always doubtful, only probable.
Decisions are always certain. Conclusions give us what
may be, decisions what must be. The former result from
concepts and experience, the latter from intuitions and logical
processes. Thus is made plain the fact that, to give it
the most favorable aspect, Sir William Hamilton, in his
eagerness to maintain his theory, has entirely mistaken one
class of human experiences, and so was led to deny the actuality
of the most profound and important faculty of the
human mind. In view of the foregoing results, one need
not hesitate to say that, whether he ever attempted it or not,
Kant never "has clearly shown that the idea of the unconditioned<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
can have no objective reality," for it is impossible
to do this, the opposite being the truth. Its objective reality
is God; it therefore "conveys" to us the most important
"knowledge," and "involves" no "contradictions." Moreover,
unconditionedness is a "simple," "positive," "notion,"
and not "a fasciculus of negations"; but is an attribute of
God, who comprehends all positives. A little after, Hamilton
says: "And while he [Kant] appropriated Reason as a
specific faculty to take cognizance of these negations, hypostatized
as positive, under the Platonic name of <i>Ideas</i>," &amp;c.
Here, again, the psychological question arises, Is the Reason
such a faculty? Are its supposed objects negations? Are
they hypostatized as positive? Evidently, if we establish
an affirmative answer to the first question, a negative to the
others follows directly, and the logician's system is a failure.
Again, the discrimination of thought into <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i>
is simply absurd. All thought is <i>positive</i>. The phrase,
negative thought, is only a convenient expression for the
refusal of the mind to think. But "Ideas" are not thoughts
at all, in the strict sense of that term. It refers to the
operations of the mind upon objects which have been presented.
Ideas are a part of such objects. All objects in the
mind are positive. The phrase, negative object, is a contradiction.
But, without any deduction, we see immediately
that ideas are positives. The common consciousness of the
human race affirms this.</p>

<p>The following remark upon Cousin requires some notice.
"For those who, with M. Cousin, regard the notion of the
unconditioned as a positive and real knowledge of existence
in its all-comprehensive unity, and who consequently employ
the terms <i>Absolute</i>, <i>Infinite</i>, <i>Unconditioned</i>, as only various
expressions for the same identity, are imperatively bound to
prove that their idea of <i>the One corresponds, either with that
Unconditioned we have distinguished as the Absolute, or with
that Unconditioned we have distinguished as the Infinite, or
that it includes both, or that it excludes both</i>. This they have<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
not done, and, we suspect, have never attempted to do." The
italics are Hamilton's. The above statement is invalid, for
the following reasons. The Absolute, therein named, has
been shown to be irrelevant to the matter in hand, and an
absurdity. It is self-evident that the term "limited whole,"
as applied to Space and Time, is a violation of the laws of
thought. Since we seek the truth, that Absolute must be
rejected. Again, the definitions of the terms absolute and
infinite, which have been found consistent, and pertinent to
Space and Time, have been further found irrelevant and
meaningless, when applied to the Being, the One, who is the
Creator. That Being, existing primarily out of all relation
to Space and Time, must, if known at all, be studied, and
known as he is. The terms infinite and absolute will, of
necessity, then, when applied to him, have entirely different
significations from what they will when applied to Space and
Time. So, then, no decision of questions arising in this latter
sphere will have other than a negative value in the former.
The questions in that sphere must be decided on their
own merits, as must those in this. What is really required,
then, is, that the One, the Person, be shown to be both absolute
and infinite, and that these, as qualities, consistently inhere
in that <i>unity</i>. As this has already been done in the
first Part of this treatise, nothing need be added here.</p>

<p>Some pages afterwards, in again remarking upon M.
Cousin, Hamilton quotes from him as follows: "The condition
of intelligence <i>is difference</i>; and an act of knowledge
is only possible where there exists a plurality of terms."
In a subsequent paragraph the essayist argues from this,
thus: "But, on the other hand, it is asserted, that the condition
of intelligence, as knowing, is plurality and difference;
consequently, the condition of the absolute as existing, and
under which it must be known, and the condition of intelligence,
as capable of knowing, are incompatible. For, if we
suppose the absolute cognizable, it must be identified either,
first, with the subject knowing; or, second, with the object<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
known; or, third, with the indifference of both." Rejecting
the first two, Hamilton says: "The <i>third</i> hypothesis, on the
other hand, is <i>contradictory of the plurality of intelligence</i>;
for, if the subject of consciousness be known as one, a plurality
of terms is not the necessary condition of intelligence.
The alternative is therefore necessary: Either the absolute
cannot be known or conceived at all, or our author is wrong
in subjecting thought to the conditions of plurality and difference."</p>

<p>In these extracts may be detected an error which, so far
as the author is informed, has been hitherto overlooked by
philosophers. The logician presents an alternative which is
unquestionably valid. Yet with almost, if not entire unanimity,
writers have been accustomed to assign plurality, relation,
difference, and&mdash;to adopt a valuable suggestion of
Mr. Spencer&mdash;likeness, as conditions of all knowledge; and
among them those who have claimed for man a positive
knowledge of the absolute. The error by which they have
been drawn into this contradiction is purely psychological;
and arises, like the other errors which we have pointed out,
from an attempt to carry over the laws of the animal nature,
the Sense and Understanding, by which man learns of, and
concludes about, things in nature, to the Pure Reason, by
which he sees and knows, with an <i>absolutely certain</i> knowledge,
principles and laws; and to subject this faculty to those
conditions. Now, there can be no doubt but that if the logician's
premiss is true, the conclusion is unavoidable. If
"an act of knowledge is only possible where there exists a
plurality of terms," then is it impossible that we should
know God, <i>or that he should know himself</i>. The logic is impregnable.
But the conclusion is revolting. What must be
done, then? Erect some makeshift subterfuge of mental
impotence? It will not meet the exigency of the case. It
will not satisfy the demand of the soul. Nay, more, she
casts it out utterly, as a most gross insult. Unquestionably,
but one course is left; and that is so plain, that one cannot<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
see how even a Limitist could have overlooked it. Correct
the premiss. Study out the true psychology, and that will
give us perfect consistency. Hold with a death-grip to the
principle that <i>every truth is in complete harmony with every
other truth</i>; and hold with no less tenacity to the principle
that the human intellect is true. And what is the true premiss
which through an irrefutable logic will give us a satisfactory,
a true, an undoubted conclusion. This. A plurality
of terms is <i>not</i> the necessary condition of intelligence; but
objects which are pure, simple, unanalyzable, may be directly
known by an intellect. Or, to be more explicit. Plurality,
relation, difference, and likeness, are necessary conditions of
intelligence through the Sense and Understanding; but they
do not in the least degree lie upon the Reason, which sees its
objects as pure, simple ideas which are <i>self-evident</i>, and, consequently,
are not subject to those conditions. Whatever
knowledge we may have of "mammals," we undoubtedly
gain under the conditions of plurality, relation, difference,
and likeness; for "mammals" are things in nature. But
absoluteness is a pure, simple, unanalyzable idea in the Reason,
and as such is seen and known by a direct insight as
out of all plurality, relation, difference, and likeness: for
this is a <i>quality</i> of the self-existent Person, and so belongs
wholly to the sphere of the supernatural, and can be examined
only by a spiritual person who is also supernatural.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate these two kinds of knowledge. 1. The
knowledge given by the Sense and Understanding. This is
of material objects. Take, for example, an apple. The
Sense observes it as one of many apples, and that many
characteristics belong to it as one apple. Among these, color,
skin, pulp, juices, flavor, &amp;c. may be mentioned. It observes,
also, that it bears a relation to the stem and tree on which it
grows, and, as well, that its several qualities have relations
among themselves. One color belongs to the skin, another
to the pulp. The skin, as cover, relates to the pulp as covered,
and the like. The apple, moreover, is distinguished<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
from other fruits by marks of difference and marks of likeness.
It has a different skin, a different pulp, and a different
flavor. Yet, it is like other fruits, in that it grows on a tree,
and possesses those marks just named, which, though differing
among themselves, according to the fruit in which they
inhere, have a commonality of kind, as compared with other
objects. This distinguishing, analyzing, and classifying of
characteristics, and connecting them into a unity, as an
apple, is the work of the Sense and Understanding.</p>

<p>2. The knowledge given by the Pure Reason. This is
of <i>a priori</i> laws, of these laws combined in pure archetypal
forms, and of God as the Supreme Being who comprehends
all laws and forms. A fundamental difference in the two
modes of activity immediately strikes one's attention. In
the former case, the mode was by distinguishment and <i>analysis</i>.
In the latter it is by comprehension and <i>synthesis</i>.
Take the idea of moral obligation to illustrate this topic.
No one but a Limitist will, it is believed, contend against the
position of Dr Hopkins, "that this idea of obligation or
<i>oughtness</i> is a simple idea." This being once acceded, carries
with it the whole theory which the author seeks to
maintain. How may "a simple idea" be known? It cannot
be distinguished or analyzed. Being simple, it is <i>sui generis</i>.
Hence, it cannot be known by plurality or relation, difference
or likeness. If known at all, it must be known <i>as it is in
itself</i>, by a spontaneous insight. Such, in fact, is the mode of
the activity of the Pure Reason, and such are the objects of
that activity. In maintaining, then, the doctrine of "intellectual
intuition," M. Cousin was right, but wrong in subjecting
all knowledge "to the conditions of plurality and difference."</p>

<p>Near the close of the essay under examination Sir Wm.
Hamilton states certain problems, which he is "confident"
Cousin cannot solve. There is nothing very difficult about
them; and it is a wonder that he should have so presented
them. Following the passage&mdash;which is here quoted&mdash;will
be found what appear simple and easy solutions.<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>"But (to say nothing of remoter difficulties)&mdash;(1) how
liberty can be conceived, supposing always a plurality of
modes of activity, without a knowledge of that plurality;&mdash;(2)
how a faculty can resolve to act by preference in a particular
manner, and not determine itself by final causes;&mdash;(3)
how intelligence can influence a blind power, without
operating as an efficient cause;&mdash;(4) or how, in fine, morality
can be founded on a liberty which at best only escapes
necessity by taking refuge with chance;&mdash;these are problems
which M. Cousin, in none of his works, has stated, and
which we are confident he is unable to solve."</p>

<p>1. Liberty cannot be <i>conceived</i>. It must be intuited.
There is "a plurality of modes," and there is "a knowledge
of that plurality." 2. "A faculty" cannot resolve
to act; cannot have a preference; and cannot determine
itself <i>at all</i>. Only a <i>spiritual person</i> can <i>resolve</i>, can have
a preference, can determine. 3. Intelligence cannot influence.
Blind power cannot be influenced. Only a spiritual
person can be influenced, and he by object through
the intelligence as medium, and only he can be an efficient
cause. 4. Morality cannot "be founded on a liberty, which
only escapes necessity by taking refuge with chance;" and,
what is more, such a liberty is impossible, and to speak of it
as possible is absurd. What vitiates the processes of thought
of the Limitists so largely, crops out very plainly here:
viz., the employment both in thinking and expressions of faculties,
capacities, and qualities, as if they possessed all the
powers of persons. This habit is thoroughly erroneous, and
destructive of truth. The truth desired to answer this whole
passage, may be stated in exact terms thus: The infinite and
absolute spiritual Person, the ultimate and indestructible, and
indivisible and composite unit, possesses as a necessary quality
of personality pure liberty; which is freedom from compulsion
or restraint in the choice of one of two possible ends.
This Person intuits a multitude of modes of activity. He
possesses also perfect wisdom, which enables him, having<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
chosen the right end, to determine with unerring accuracy
which one of all the modes of activity is the best to secure
the end. Involved in the choice of the end, is the determination
to put in force the best means for securing that end.
Hence this Person decides that the best mode shall <i>be</i>. He
also possesses all-power. This is <i>his</i> endowment, not that
of his intelligence. The intelligence is not person, but <i>faculty</i>
in the person. So is it with the <i>power</i>. So then this
Person, intuiting through his intelligence what is befitting
his dignity, puts forth, in accordance therewith, his power;
and is efficient cause. Such a being is neither under necessity
nor chance. He is not under necessity, because there
is no constraint which compels him to choose the right
end, rather than the wrong one. He is not under chance,
because he is <i>certain</i> which is the best mode of action to
gain the end chosen. In this distinction between ends and
modes of activity, which has been so clearly set forth by
Rev. Mark Hopkins, D. D., and in the motions of spiritual
persons in each sphere, lie the ground for answering
<i>all</i> difficulties raised by the advocates of necessity or chance.
With these remarks we close the discussion of Hamilton's
philosophical system, and proceed to take up the teachings of
his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<h2 id="REVIEW_OF_LIMITS_OF_RELIGIOUS_THOUGHT">REVIEW OF "LIMITS OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT."</h2>

<p>This volume is one which will always awaken in the mind
of the candid and reflective reader a feeling of profound
respect. The writer is manifestly a deeply religious man.
The book bears the marks of piety, and an earnest search
after the truth respecting that august Being whom its author
reverentially worships. However far wrong we may believe
him to have gone in his speculative theory, his devout spirit
must ever inspire esteem. Though it is ours to criticize and
condemn the intellectual principles upon which his work is
based, we cannot but desire to be like him, in rendering
solemn homage to the Being he deems inscrutable.</p>

<p>In proceeding with our examination, all the defects which
were formerly noticed as belonging to the system of the
Limitists will here be found plainly observable. Following
his teacher, Mr. Mansel holds the Understanding to be the
highest faculty of the human intellect, and the consequent
corollary that a judgment is its highest form of knowledge.
The word "conceive" he therefore uses as expressive of the
act of the mind in grasping together various marks into a
concept, when that word and act of mind are utterly irrelevant
to the object to which he applies them; and hence they
can have no meaning as used. We shall see him speak
of "starting from the divine, and reasoning down to the
human"; or of "starting from the human, and reasoning up
to the divine"; where, upon the hypothesis that the two are
entirely diverse, no reasoning process, based upon either one,
can reach the other. On the other hand, if any knowledge
of God is possible to the created mind, it is only on the
ground that there is a similarity, an exact likeness in certain<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
respects, between the two; in other words, that the Creator
plainly declared a simple fact, in literal language, when he
said, "God made man in his own image." If man's mind is
wholly unlike God's mind, he cannot know truth as God
knows it. And if the human intellect is thus faulty, man
cannot be the subject of a moral government, for every
subject of a moral government is amenable to law. In
order to be so amenable, he must know the law <i>as it is</i>.
No phantasmagoria of law, no silhouette will do. It must
be immediately seen, and known to be binding. Truth
is <i>one</i>. He, then, who sees it as it is, and knows it to be
binding, sees it as God sees it, and feels the same obligation
that God feels. And such an one must man be if he is
a moral agent. Whether he is such an agent or not, we will
not argue here; since all governments and laws of society
are founded upon the hypothesis that he is, it may well be
assumed as granted.</p>

<p>Of the "three terms, familiar as household words," which
Mr. Mansel, in his second lecture, proceeds to examine, it is
to be said, that "First Cause," if properly mentioned at all,
should have been put last; and that "Infinite" and "Absolute"
are not pertinent to Cause, but to Person. So then
when we consider "the Deity as He is," we consider him, not
as Cause, for this is <i>incidental</i>, but as the infinite and absolute
Person, for these three marks are <i>essential</i>. Further,
these last-mentioned terms express ideas in the Reason;
while the term Cause expresses "an <i>a priori</i> Element of
connection, and thus a primitive understanding-conception."
Hardly more satisfactory than his use of the term Cause
is his definition of the terms absolute and infinite. He
defines "the Absolute" to be "that which exists in and by
itself, having no necessary relation to any other Being,"
when it is rather the exclusion of the possibility of any other
Being. Again, he defines "the Infinite" to be "that which
is free from all possible limitation; that than which a greater
is inconceivable; and which, consequently, can receive no<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
additional attribute or mode of existence which it had not
from all eternity." "That which" means the thing which,
for which is neuter. Mr. Mansel's infinite is, then, the <i>Thing</i>.
This <i>Thing</i> "is free from all possible limitation." How can
that be when the Being he thus defines is, must be, necessarily
existent, and so is bound by one of the greatest of limitations,
the inability to cease to be. But some light may
be thrown upon his use of the term "limitation" by the
subsequent portions of his definition. The Thing "which is
free from all possible limitation" is "that than which a
greater is inconceivable." Moreover, this greatest of all
possible things possesses all possible "attributes," and is in
every possible "mode of existence" "from all eternity."
Respecting the phrase "than which a greater is inconceivable,"
two suppositions may be made. Either there may be
a thing "greater" than, and diverse from, all other things;
or there may be a thing greater than, and including all, other
things. Probably the latter is Mr. Mansel's thought; but
it is Materialistic Pantheism. This Being must be in every
"mode of existence" "from all eternity." Personality is a
"mode of existence"; therefore this Being must forever
have been in that mode. But impersonality is also a mode
of existence, therefore this Being must forever have been in
that mode. Yet again these two modes are contradictory
and mutually exclusive; then this Being must have been
from all eternity in two contradictory and mutually exclusive
modes of existence! Is further remark necessary to show
that Mr. Mansel's definition is thoroughly vitiated by the
understanding-conception that infinity is amount, and is,
therefore, utterly worthless? Can there be a thing so great
as to be without limits? Has greatness anything to do with
infinity? Manifestly not. It becomes necessary, then, to
recur to and amplify those definitions which we have already
given to the terms he uses.</p>

<p>Absoluteness and infinity are qualities of the necessary
Being.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>Absoluteness is that quality of the necessary Being by
which he is endowed with self-existence, self-dependence, and
totality. Or in other words, having this quality, he is wholly
independent of any other being; and also the possibility of
the existence of any other independent Being is excluded;
and so he is the Complete, the Final, upon whom all possible
beings must depend.</p>

<p>Infinity is that quality of the necessary Being which gives
him universality in the totality. It expresses the fact, that
he possesses all possible endowments in perfection.</p>

<p>Possessing these qualities, that Being is free from any external
restraint or limitation; but those restraints and limitations,
which his very constituting elements themselves impose,
are not removed by these qualities. For instance, the
possession of Love, Mercy, Justice, Wisdom, Power, and the
like, are essential to God's entirety; and the possession of
them in <i>perfect harmony</i> is essential to his perfectness in the
entirety. This fact of perfect harmony, exact balance, bars
him from the <i>undue</i> exercise of any one of his attributes; or,
concisely, his perfection restrains him from being imperfect.
We revert, then, to the fundamental distinction, attained heretofore,
between improper limitations, or those which are involved
in perfection; and proper limitations, or those which
are involved in deficiency and dependence; and applying it
here, we see that those limitations, which we speak of as belonging
to God, are not indicative of a lack, but rather are
necessarily incidental to that possession of all possible perfection
which constitutes him the Ultimate.</p>

<p>In this view infinity can have no relevancy to "number."
It is not that God has one, or one million endowments. It
asks no question about the number; and cares not for it. It
is satisfied in the assertion that he possesses <i>all that are possible</i>,
and in perfect harmony. It is, further, an idea, not a
concept. It must be intuited, for it cannot be "conceived."
No analogy of "line" or "surface" has any pertinence; because
these are concepts, belonging wholly in the Understanding<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
and Sense, where no idea can come. Yet it may be, <i>is</i>,
the quality of an intelligence endowed with a limited number
of attributes;&mdash;for there can be no number without limitation,
since the phrase unlimited number is a contradiction
of terms;&mdash;but this limitation involves no lack, because
there are no "others," which can be "thereby related to it,
as cognate or opposite modes of consciousness." Without
doubt it is, in a certain sense, true, that "the metaphysical
representation of the Deity, as absolute and infinite, must
necessarily, as the profoundest metaphysicians have acknowledged,
amount to nothing less than the sum of all reality."
This sense is that all reality is by him, and for him, and from
him; and is utterly dependent upon him. But Hegel's conclusion
by no means follows, in which he says: "What kind
of an Absolute Being is that which does not contain in itself
all that is actual, even evil included." This is founded upon
the suppressed premiss, that such a Being <i>must</i> do what he
does, and his creatures <i>must</i> do what they do; and so evil
must come. This much only can be admitted, and this may
be admitted, without derogating aught from God's perfectness:
viz., that he sees in the ideals of his Reason <i>how</i> his
laws may be violated, and so, how sin may and will be in
this moral system; but it is a perversion of words to say that
this knowledge on the part of God is evil.</p>

<p>The knowing how a moral agent may break the perfect
law, is involved in the knowing how such agent may keep
that law. But the fact of the knowledge does not involve
any whit of consent to the act of violation. On the other
hand, it may, does, become the ground for the putting forth
of every wise effort to prevent that act. Again; evil is produced
by those persons whom God has made, who violate
his moral laws. He being perfectly wise and perfectly good,
for perfectly wise and good reasons sustains them in the
ability to sin. There can be, in the nature of things, no
persons at all, without this ability to sin. But God does not
direct them to sin; neither when they do sin does any stain<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
fall upon him for sustaining their existence during their sinning.
That definition of the term absolute, upon which
Hegel bases his assertion, is one fit only for the Sense and
Understanding; as if God was the physical sum of all existence.
It is Materialistic Pantheism. But by observing the
definitions and distinctions, which have been heretofore laid
down, it may be readily seen how an actual mode of existence,
as that of finite person, may be denied to God, and no
lack be indicated thereby. Hegel's blasphemy may, then,
be answered as follows: God is the infinite and absolute
spiritual Person. Personality is the form of his being. The
form cannot be empty. Organized essence fills the form.
Infinity and absoluteness are <i>qualities</i> of the Person as thus
organized. The quality of absoluteness, for instance, as
transfusing the essence, is the endowment of pure independence,
and involves the exclusion of the possibility of any
other independent Being, and the possession of the ability to
create every possible dependent being. In so far, then, as
Hegel's assertion means that no being can exist, and do evil,
except he is created and sustained by the Deity, it is true.
But in so far as it means&mdash;and this is undoubtedly what
Hegel did mean&mdash;that God must be the efficient author of
sin, that, forced by the iron rod of Fate, he must produce
evil, the assertion is utterly false, and could only have been
uttered by one who, having dwelt all his life in the gloomy
cave of the Understanding, possessed not even a tolerably
correct notion of the true nature of the subject he had in
hand,&mdash;the character of God. From the above considerations
it is apparent that all the requirements of the Reason
are fulfilled when it is asserted that all things&mdash;the Universe&mdash;are
dependent upon God; and he is utterly independent.</p>

<p>The paragraphs next succeeding, which have been quoted
with entire approbation by Mr. Herbert Spencer, are thoroughly
vitiated by their author's indefensible assumption,
that cause is "indispensable" to our idea of the Deity.
As was remarked above, the notion of cause is incidental.<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
The Deity may or may not become a cause, as he shall
decide. But he has no choice as to whether he shall be
a person or not. Hence we may freely admit that "the
cause, as such, exists only in relation to its effect: the cause
is a cause of the effect; the effect is an effect of the
cause." It is also true that "the conception"&mdash;idea&mdash;"of
the Absolute implies a possible existence out of all relation."
The position we have taken is in advance of this,
for we say, involves an actual existence out of all relation.
Introducing, then, not "the idea of succession in time," but
the idea of the logical order, we rightly say, "the Absolute
exists first by itself, and afterwards becomes a Cause." Nor
are we here "checked by the third conception, that of the
Infinite." "Causation is a possible mode of existence," and
yet "that which exists without causing" is infinite. How is
this? It is thus. Infinity is the universality of perfect endowment.
Now, taking as the point of departure the first
creative nisus or effort of the Deity, this is true. Before
that act he was perfect in every possible endowment, and
accorded his choice thereto. He was able to create, but did
not, for a good and sufficient reason. In and after that act,
he was still perfect as before. That act then involved no
<i>essential</i> change in God. But he was in one mode of being
before, and in another mode of being in and after that act.
Yet he was equally perfect, and equally blessed, before as
after. What then follows? This: that there was some good
and sufficient reason why before that act he should be a
potential creator, and in that act he should become an actual
creator: and this reason preserves the perfection, <i>i. e.</i> the
infinity of God, equally in both modes. When, then, Mr.
Mansel says, "if Causation is a possible mode of existence,
that which exists without causing is not infinite, that which
becomes a cause has passed beyond its former limits," his
utterance is prompted by that pantheistic understanding-conception
of God, which thinks him the sum of all that
was, and is, and ever shall be, or can be; and that in all this,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
he is <i>actual</i>. On the other hand, as we have seen, all that
is required to fulfil the idea of infinity is, that the Being,
whom it qualifies, possesses all fulness, has all the forms and
springs of being in himself. It is optional with him whether
he will create or not; and his remaining out of all relation,
or his creating a Universe, and thus establishing relations to
and for himself, in no way affect his essential nature, <i>i. e.</i>
his infinity. He is a person, possessing all possible endowments,
and in this does his infinity consist. In this view,
"creation at any particular moment of time" is seen to be the
only possible hypothesis by which to account for the Universe.
Such a <i>Person</i>, the necessary Being, must have been
in existence before the Universe; and his first act in producing
that Universe would mark the first moment of time.
No "alternative of Pantheism" is, can be, presented to the
advocates of this theory. On the other hand, that scheme
is seen to be both impossible and absurd.</p>

<p>One cannot disagree with Mr. Mansel, when in the next
paragraph he says, that, "supposing the Absolute to become
a cause, it will follow that it operates by means of free will
and consciousness." But the difficulties which he then
raises lie only in the Understanding, and may be explained
thus. Always in God's consciousness <i>the subject and object
are identical</i>. All that God is, is always present to his Eye.
Hence all relations always appear subordinate to, and dependent
upon him; and it is a misapprehension of the true
idea to suppose, that any relation which falls <i>in idea</i> within
him, and only becomes actual at his will, is any proper limitation.
Both subject and object are thus absolute, being
identical; and yet there is no contradiction.</p>

<p>The difficulty is further raised that there cannot be in the
absolute Being any interrelations, as of attributes among
themselves, or of attributes to the Being. This arises from
an erroneous definition of the term absolute. The definition
heretofore given in this treatise presents no such difficulty.
The possession of these attributes and interrelations is essential<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
to the exclusion by then possessor of another independent
Being; and it is a perversion to so use a quality
which is essential to a being, that it shall militate against the
consistency of his being what he must be. If then "the
almost unanimous voice of philosophy, in pronouncing that
the absolute is both one and simple," uses the term "simple"
in the same sense that it would have when applied to the idea
of moral obligation, viz., that it is unanalyzable, then that
voice is wrong, just as thoroughly as the voice of antiquity
in favor of the Ptolemaic system of Astronomy was wrong;
and is to be treated as that was. On such questions <i>opinions</i>
have no weight. The search is after a knowledge which is
sure, and which every man may have within himself. We
land, then, in no "inextricable dilemma." The absolute
Person we see to be conscious; and to possess complexity
in unity, universality in totality. By an immediate intuition
we know him as primarily out of all relation, plurality,
difference, and likeness; and yet as having, of his own self,
established the Universe, which is still entirely dependent
upon him; from which he differs, and with which he is not
identified.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Mansel says: "A mental attribute to be conceived
as infinite, must be in actual exercise on every possible
object: otherwise it is potential only, with regard to
those on which it is not exercised; and an unrealized potentiality
is a limitation." With our interpretation the assertion
is true and contains no puzzle. Every mental attribute
of the Deity is most assuredly "in actual exercise," upon
every one of its "possible objects" <i>as ideas</i>. But the objects
are not therefore actual. Neither is there any need
that they should ever become so. He sees them just as
clearly, and knows them just as thoroughly as ideals, as he
does as actual objects. All ideal objects are "unrealized
potentialities"; and yet they are the opposite of limitations
proper. But this sentence, as an expression of the thought
which Mr. Mansel seemingly wished to convey, is vitiated<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
by the presence of that understanding-conception that infinity
is amount, which must be actual. Once regard infinity
as <i>quality</i> of the necessarily existent Person, and it
directly follows that this or that act, of that Person, in no
way disturbs that infinity. The quality conditions the
acting being; but the act of that being cannot limit the
quality. The quality is, that the act may be; not the reverse.
Hence the questions arising from the interrelations
of Power and Goodness, Justice and Mercy, are solved at
once. Infinity as quality, not amount, pervades them all,
and holds them all in perfect harmony, adjusting each to
each, in a melody more beautiful than that of the spheres.
Even "the existence of Evil" is "compatible with that of"
this "perfectly good Being." He does not will that it shall
be; neither does he will that it shall not be. If he willed
that it should not be, and it was, then he would be "thwarted";
but only on such a hypothesis can the conclusion follow.
But he does will that certain creatures shall be, who,
though dependent upon him for existence and sustenance,
are, like him, final causes,&mdash;the final arbiters of their own
destinies, who in the choice of ends are unrestrained, and
may choose good or ill. He made these creatures, knowing
that some of them would choose wrong, and so evil would
be: but <i>he</i> did not will the evil. He only willed the conditions
upon which evil was possible, and placed all proper
bars to prevent the evil; and the <i>a priori</i> facts of his immutable
perfection in endowments, and of his untarnished holiness,
are decisive of the consequent fact, that, in willing those
conditions, God did the very best possible deed. If it be
further asserted that the fact, that the Being who possesses
all possible endowments in perfection could not wisely prevent
sin, is a limitation; and, further, that it were better to
have prevented sin by an unwise act than to have permitted
it by a wise act; it can only be replied: This is the same
as to say, that it is essential to God's perfection that he be
imperfect; or, that it was better for the perfect Being to<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
violate his Self than to permit sin. If any one in his thinking
chooses to accept of such alternatives, there remains no
ground of argument with him; but only "a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall
devour the adversary."</p>

<p>Carrying on his presentation of difficulties, Mr. Mansel
further remarks: "Let us however suppose for an instant,
that these difficulties are surmounted, and the existence of
the Absolute securely established on the testimony of reason.
Still we have not succeeded in reconciling this idea with
that of a Cause: we have done nothing towards explaining
how the absolute can give rise to the relative, the infinite to
the finite. If the condition of causal activity is a higher
state than that of quiescence, the absolute, whether acting
voluntarily or involuntarily, has passed from a condition of
comparative imperfection to one of comparative perfection;
and therefore was not originally perfect. If the state of
activity is an inferior state to that of quiescence, the Absolute,
in becoming a cause, has lost its original perfection."
On this topic we can but repeat the argument heretofore
adduced. Let the supposition be entertained that perfection
does not belong to a state, but to God's nature, to what God
<i>is</i>, as ground for what God does, and standing in the logical
order before his act; and it will directly appear that a state
of quiescence or a state of activity in no way modifies his
perfection. What God is, remains permanent and perfect,
and his acts are only manifestations of that permanent and
perfect. It follows, then, taking the first moment of time as
the point of departure, that, before that point, God was in a
state of complete blessedness, and that after that point he
was also in such a state; and, further, that while these two
states are equal, there is not "complete indifference," because
there was a reason, clearly seen by the Divine mind,
why the passage from quiescence to activity should be when
it was, and as it was, and that this reason having been acknowledged
in his conduct, gives to the two states equality,
and yet differentiates the one from the other.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>"Again, how can the Relative be conceived as coming
into being?" It cannot be <i>conceived</i> at all. The faculty
of the mind by which it forms a concept&mdash;the discursive
Understanding&mdash;is impotent to conceive what cannot be
conceived&mdash;the act of creation. The changes of matter
can be concluded into a system, but not the power by which
the matter came to be, and the changes were produced. If
the how is known at all, it must be seen. The laws of the
process must be intuited, as also the process as logically
according with those laws. The following is believed to be
an intelligible account of the process, and an answer to the
above question. The absolute and infinite Person possesses
as <i>a priori</i> organic elements of his being, all possible endowments
in perfect harmony. Hence all laws, and all possible
combinations of laws, are at once and always present before
the Eye of his Reason, which is thus constituted Universal
Genius. These combinations may be conveniently named
ideal forms. They arise spontaneously, being in no way
dependent upon his will, but are rather <i>a priori</i> conditional
of any creative activity. So, too, they harmoniously arrange
themselves into systems,&mdash;archetypes of what may be,
some of which may appear nobler, and others inferior. This
Person, being such as we have stated, possesses also as endowment
all power, and thereby excludes the possibility of
there being any "<i>other</i>" power. This power is adequate to
do all that <i>power</i> can do,&mdash;to accomplish all that lies within
the province of power. So long as the Person sees fit not
to exert his power, his ideal forms will be only ideals, and
the power will be simply power. But whenever he shall see
fit to send forth his power, and organize it according to the
ideal forms, the Universe will become. In all this the Person,
"of his own will," freely establishes whatever his unerring
wisdom shows is most worthy of his dignity; and so the
actualities and relations which he thus ordains are no proper
limit or restraint, for they in no way lessen his fulness, but
are only a manifestation of that fulness,&mdash;a declaration of<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
his glory. In a word, Creation is that executive act of God
by which he combines with his power that ideal system which
he had chosen because best, or <i>it is the organization of ample
power according to perfect law</i>. If one shall now ask, "How
could he send forth the power?" it is to be replied that the
question is prompted by the curiosity of the "flesh," man's
animal nature; and since no representation&mdash;picture&mdash;can
be made, no answer can be furnished. It is not needed to
know <i>how</i> God is, or does anything, but only that he does it.
All the essential requirements of the problem are met when
it is ascertained in the light of the Reason, that all fulness is
in God, that from this fulness he established all other beings
and their natural relations, and that no relation is <i>imposed</i>
upon him by another. The view thus advanced avoids the
evil of the understanding-conception, that creation is the
bringing of something out of nothing. There is an actual
self-existent ground, from which the Universe is produced.
Neither is the view pantheistic, for it starts with the <i>a priori</i>
idea of an absolute and infinite Person who is "before all
things, and by whom all things consist,"&mdash;who organizes his
own power in accordance with his own ideals, and thus produces
the Universe, and all this by free will in self-consciousness.</p>

<p>On page eighty-four, in speaking "of the atheistic alternative,"
Mr. Mansel makes use of the following language:
"A limit is itself a relation; and to conceive a limit as such,
is virtually to acknowledge the existence of a correlative on
the other side of it." Upon reading this sentence, some
sensuous form spontaneously appears in the Sense. Some
object is conceived, and something outside it, that bounds it.
But let the idea be once formed of a Being who possesses
all limitation within himself, and for whom there is no
"other side," nor any "correlative," and the difficulty vanishes.
We do not seek to account for sensuous objects. It is pure
Spirit whom we consider. We do not need to form a concept
of "a first moment in time," or "a first unit of space,"<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
nor could we if we would. To do so would be for the faculty
which forms concepts to transcend the very laws of its organization.
What we need is, to see the fact that a Spirit
is, who, possessing personality as form, and absoluteness and
infinity as qualities, thereby contains all limits and the
ground of all being in himself, and antithetical to whom is
only negation.</p>

<p>From the ground thus attained there is seen to result, not
the dreary Sahara of interminable contradictions, but the fair
land of harmonious consistency. A Spirit, sole, personal,
self-conscious, the absolute and infinite Person, is the Being
we seek and have found; and upon such a Being the soul
of man may rest with the unquestioning trust of an infant
in its mother's arms. One cannot pass by unnoticed the
beautiful spirit of religious reverence which shines through
the closing paragraphs of this lecture. It is evident with
what dissatisfaction the writer views the sterile puzzles of
which he has been treating, and what a relief it is to turn
from them to "the God who is 'gracious and merciful, slow
to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the
evil.'" The wonder is, that he did not receive that presentation
which his devout spirit has made, as the truth&mdash;which
it is&mdash;and say, "I will accept this as final. My definitions
and deductions shall accord with this highest revelation.
This shall be my standard of interpretation." Had he done
so, far other, and, as it is believed, more satisfactory and
truthful would have been the conclusions he would have
given us.</p>

<p>In his third Lecture Mr. Mansel is occupied with an examination
of the human nature, for the purpose, if possible,
of finding "some explanation of the singular phenomenon
of human thought," which he has just developed. At the
threshold of the investigation the fact of consciousness appears,
and he begins the statement of its conditions in the
following language: "Now, in the first place, the very conception
of Consciousness, in whatever mode it may be manifested,<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
necessarily implies <i>distinction between one object and
another</i>. To be conscious we must be conscious of something;
and that something can only be known as that which
it is, by being distinguished from that which it is not." In
this statement Mr. Mansel unconsciously assumes as settled,
the very question at issue; for, the position maintained by
one class of writers is, that in certain of our mental operations,
viz., in intuitions, the mind sees a simple truth, idea,
first principle, as it is, in itself, and that there is no distinction
in the act of knowledge. It is unquestionably true that,
in the examination of objects on the Sense, and the conclusion
of judgments in the Understanding, no object can come
into consciousness without implying a "distinction between
one object and another." But it is also evident that a first
truth, to be known as such, must be intuited&mdash;seen as it is in
itself; and so directly known to have the qualities of necessity
and universality which constitute it a first truth. Of
this fact Sir William Hamilton seems to have been aware,
when he denied the actuality of the Reason,&mdash;perceiving,
doubtless, that only on the ground of such a denial was his
own theory tenable. But if it shall be admitted, as it would
seem it must be, that men have necessary and universal convictions,
then it must also be admitted that these convictions
are not entertained by distinguishing them from other mental
operations, but that they are seen of themselves to be true;
and thus it appears that there are some modes of consciousness
which do not imply the "distinction" claimed. The
subsequent sentences seem capable of more than one interpretation.
If the author means that "the Infinite" cannot
be infinite without he is also finite, so that all distinction
ceases, then his meaning is both pantheistic and contradictory;
for the word infinite has no meaning, if it is not the
opposite of finite, and to identify them is undoubtedly Pantheism.
Or if he means "that the Infinite cannot be distinguished"
as independent, from the Finite <i>as independent</i>, and
thus, as possessing some quality with which it was not endowed<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
by the infinite Person, then there can be no doubt of
his correctness. But if, as would seem, his idea of infinity is
that of amount, is such that it appears inconsistent, contradictory,
for the infinite Person to retain his infinity, and still
create beings who are really other than himself, and possessing,
as quality, finiteness, which he cannot possess as quality,
then is his idea of what infinity is wrong. Infinity is quality,
and the capacity to thus create is essential to it. All that
the Reason requires is, that the finite be created by and
wholly dependent upon the infinite Person; then all the relations
and conditions are only <i>improper</i>,&mdash;such as that Person
has established, and which, therefore, in no way diminish
his glory or detract from his fulness. When, then, Mr. Mansel
says, "A consciousness of the Infinite, as such, thus
necessarily involves a self-contradiction, for it implies the
recognition, by limitation and difference, of that which can
only be given as unlimited and indifferent," it is evident that
he uses the term infinite to express the understanding-conception
of unlimited amount, which is not relevant here,
rather than the reason-idea of universality which is not contradictory
to a real distinction between the Infinite and finite.
There is also involved the unexpressed assumption that we
have no knowledge except of the limited and different, or,
in other words, that the Understanding is the highest faculty
of the mind. It has already been abundantly shown that
this is erroneous,&mdash;that the Reason knows its objects in
themselves, as out of all relation, plurality, difference, or
likeness. Dropping now the abstract term "the infinite,"
and using the concrete and proper form, we may say:</p>

<p>We are conscious of infinity, <i>i. e.</i> we are conscious that we
see with the eye of Reason infinity as a simple, <i>a priori</i> idea;
and that it is quality of the Deity.</p>

<p>2. We are conscious of the infinite Person; in that we are
conscious, that we see with the eye of Reason the complex <i>a
priori</i> idea of a perfect Person possessing independence and
universality as qualities of his Self. But we are not conscious<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
of him in that we exhaustively comprehend him. As
is said elsewhere, we know that he is, and to a certain extent,
but not wholly what he is.</p>

<p>In further discussing this question Mansel is guilty of
another grave psychological error. He says, "Consciousness
is essentially a limitation, for it is the determination to one
actual out of many possible modifications." There is no truth
in this sentence. Consciousness is not a limitation; it is not
a determination; it is not a modification. It may be well to
state here certain conclusions on this assertion, which will be
brought out in the fuller discussion of it, when we come to
speak of Mr. Spencer's book. Consciousness is <i>one</i>, and
retains that oneness throughout all modifications. These occur
in the unity as items of experience affect it. Doubtless
Dr. Hickok's illustration is the best possible. Consciousness
is the <i>light</i> in which a spiritual person sees the modifications
of himself, <i>i. e.</i> the activity of his faculties and capacities.
Like Space, only in a different sphere, it is an illimitable
indivisible unity, which is, that all limits may be in it&mdash;that
all objects may come into it. If, then, only one modification&mdash;object&mdash;comes
into it at a time, this is because the faculties
which see in its light are thus organized;&mdash;the being to
whom it belongs is partial; but there is nothing pertaining
to consciousness <i>as such</i>, which constitutes a limit,&mdash;which
could bar the infinite Person from seeing all things at once
in its light. This Person, then, so far as known, must be
known as an actual absolute, infinite Spirit, and hence no
"thing"; and further as the originator and sustainer of all
"<i>things</i>,"&mdash;which, though dependent on him, in no way take
aught from him. He may be known also, as potentially
everything, in the sense that all possible combinations, or
forms of objects, must ever stand as ideals in his Reason; and
he can, at his will, organize his power in accordance therewith.
But he must also be known as free to create or not to
create; and that the fact that many potential forms remain
such, in no way detracts from his infinity.<span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>Another of Mr. Mansel's positions involve conclusions
which, we feel assured, he will utterly reject. He says, "If
all thought is limitation,&mdash;if whatever we conceive is, by the
very act of conception, regarded as finite,&mdash;the infinite, from
a human point of view, is merely a name for the absence of
those conditions under which thought is possible." "From
a human point of view," and <i>we</i>, at least, can take no other,
what follows? That the Deity <i>can have no thoughts</i>; cannot
know what our thoughts are, or that we think. But three
suppositions can be made. Either he has no thoughts, is
destitute of an intellect; or his intellect is Universal Genius,
and he sees all possible objects at once; or there is a faculty
different in kind from and higher than the Reason, of which
we have, can have, no knowledge. The first, though acknowledged
by Hamilton in a passage elsewhere quoted, and logically
following from the position taken by Mr. Mansel, is so
abhorrent to the soul that it must be unhesitatingly rejected.
The second is the position advocated in this treatise. The
third is hinted at by Mr. Herbert Spencer. We reject this
third, because the Reason affirms it to be impossible; and
because, being unnecessary, by the law of parsimony it
should not be allowed. To advocate a position of which, in
the very terms of it, the intellect can have no possible
shadow of knowledge, is, to say the least, no part of the
work of a philosopher. "The condition of consciousness is"
not "distinction" in the understanding-conception of that
term. So consciousness is not a limitation, though all limits
when cognized are seen in the light of consciousness. According
to the philosophy we advocate, God is a particular
being, and is so known; yet he is not known as "one thing
out of many," but is known in himself, as being such and
such, and yet being <i>unique</i>. When Mr. Mansel says, "In
assuming the possibility of an infinite object of consciousness,
I assume, therefore, that it is at the same time limited and
unlimited," he evidently uses those terms with a signification
pertinent only to the Understanding. He is thinking of<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
<i>amount</i> under the forms of Space and Time; and so his remark
has no validity. He who thinks of God rightly, will
think of him as the infinite and absolute spiritual Person;
and will define infinity and absoluteness in accordance therewith.</p>

<p>If the views now advanced are presentations of truth, a
consistent rationalism <i>must</i> attribute "consciousness to God."
<i>We</i> are always conscious of "limitation and change," because
partiality and growth are organic with us. But we can perceive
no peculiarity in consciousness, which should produce
such an effect. On the contrary we see, that if a person has
little knowledge, he will be conscious of so much and no
more. And if a person has great capabilities, and corresponding
information, he is conscious of just so much.
Whence, it appears, that the "limitation and change" spring
from the nature of the constitution, and not from the consciousness.
If, then, there should be one Person who possessed
the sum of all excellencies, there could arise no reason
from consciousness why he should be conscious thereof.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansel names as the "second characteristic of Consciousness,
that it is only possible in the form of a <i>relation</i>.
There must be a Subject, or person conscious, and an Object
or thing of which he is conscious." This utterance, taken in
the sense which Mr. Mansel wishes to convey, involves the
denial of consciousness to God. But upon the ground that
the subject and object in the Deity are always identical the
difficulty vanishes. But how can man be "conscious of the
Absolute?" If by this is meant, have an exhaustive comprehension
of the absolute Person, the experience is manifestly
impossible. But man may have a certain knowledge,
<i>that</i> such Person is without knowing in all respects <i>what</i> he is,
just as a child may know that an apple is, without knowing
what it is. Again Mr. Mansel uses the terms absolute and
infinite to represent a simple unanalyzable Being. In this he
is guilty of personifying an abstract term, and then reasoning
with regard to the Being as he would with regard to the<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
term. Absoluteness is a simple unanalyzable idea, but it is
not God; it is only one quality of God. So with infinity.
God is universal complexity; and to reason of him as unanalyzable
simplicity is as absurd as to select the color of the
apple's skin, and call that the apple, and then reason from it
about the apple. So, then, though man cannot comprehend
the absolute Person <i>as such</i>, he has a positive idea of absoluteness,
and a positive knowledge that the Being is who
is thus qualified. Upon the subsequent question respecting
the partiality of our knowledge of the infinite and absolute
Person, a remark made above may be repeated and amplified.
We may have a true, clear, thorough knowledge <i>that</i>
he exists without having an exhaustive knowledge of <i>what</i>
he is. The former is necessary to us; the latter impossible.
So, too, the knowledge by us, of any <i>a priori</i> law, will be exhaustive.
Yet while we know that it <i>must</i> be such, and not
otherwise, it neither follows that we know all other <i>a priori</i>
laws, nor that we know all the exemplifications of this one.
And since, as we have heretofore seen, neither absoluteness
nor infinity relate to number, and God is not material substance
that can be broken into "parts," but an organized
Spirit, we see that we may consider the elements of his
organization in their logical order; and, remembering that
absoluteness and infinity as qualities pervade all, we may
examine his nature and attributes without impiety.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansel says further: "But in truth it is obvious, on
a moment's reflection, that neither the Absolute nor the Infinite
can be represented in the form of a whole composed of
parts." This is tantamount to saying, the spiritual cannot be
represented under the form of the material&mdash;a truth so evident
as hardly to need so formal a statement. But what the
Divine means is, that that Being cannot be known as having
qualities and attributes which may be distinguished in and
from himself; which is an error. God is infinite. So is his
Knowledge, his Wisdom, his Holiness, his Love, &amp;c. Yet
these are distinguished from each other, and from him. All<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
this is consistent, because infinity is <i>quality</i>, and permeates
them all; and not amount, which jumbles them all into a
confused, <i>indistinguishable</i> mass.</p>

<p>In speaking of "human consciousness" as "necessarily
subject to the law of Time," Mr. Mansel says, "Every object
of whose existence we can be in any way conscious is
necessarily apprehended by us as succeeding in time to some
former object of consciousness, and as itself occupying a certain
portion of time." In so far as there is here expressed
the law of created beings, under which they must see objects,
the remark is true. But when Mr. Mansel proceeds further,
and concludes that, because we are under limitation in seeing
the object, it is under the same limitation, so far as we apprehend
it in being seen, he asserts what is a psychological
error. To show this, take the mathematical axiom, "Things
which are equal to the same things, are equal to one another."
Except under the conditions of Time, we cannot see
this, that is, we do, must, occupy a time in observing it.
But do we see that the axiom is under any condition of
Time? By no means. We see, directly, that it is, <i>must be</i>,
true, and that in itself it has no relation to Time. It is thus
<i>absolutely</i> true; and as one of the ideas of the infinite and
absolute Person, it possesses these his qualities. We have,
then, a faculty, the Reason, which, while it sees its objects in
succession, and so under the law of Time, also sees that
those objects, whether ideas, or that Being to whom all ideas
belong, are, <i>in themselves</i>, out of all relation to Time. Thus
is the created spiritual person endowed; thus is he like God;
thus does he know "the Infinite." Hence, "the command,
so often urged upon man by philosophers and theologians,
'In contemplating God, transcend time,'" means, "In all
your reflections upon God, behold him in his true aspect, in
the reason-idea, as out of all relation." It is true that "to
know the infinite" <i>exhaustively</i>, "the human mind must itself
be infinite." But this knowledge is not required of that
mind. Only that knowledge is required which is possible,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
viz., that the Deity is, and what he is, <i>in so far as we are in
his image</i>.</p>

<p>Again; personality is not "essentially a limitation and a
relation," in the sense that it necessarily detracts aught from
any being who possesses it. It rather adds,&mdash;is, indeed, a
pure addition. We appear to ourselves as limited and related,
not because of our personality, but because of our
finiteness as <i>quality</i> in the personality.</p>

<p>Hence we not only see no reason why the complete and
universal Spirit should not have personality, but we see that
if he was destitute of it, he must possess a lower form of
being,&mdash;since this is the highest possible form,&mdash;which
would be an undoubted limitation; or, in other words, we
see that he must be a Person. In what Mr. Mansel subsequently
says upon this subject, he presents arguments for the
personality of God so strong, that one is bewildered with the
question, "How could he escape the conviction which they
awaken? How could he reject the cry of his spiritual nature,
and accept the barren contradictions of his lower
mind?" Let us note a few sentences. "It is by consciousness
alone that we know that God exists, or that we are able
to offer him any service. It is only by conceiving Him as a
Conscious Being, that we can stand in any religious relation
to Him at all,&mdash;that we can form such a representation of
Him as is demanded by our spiritual wants, insufficient
though it be to satisfy our intellectual curiosity." "Personality
comprises all that we know of that which exists; relation
to personality comprises all that we know of that which
seems to exist. And when, from the little world of man's
consciousness and its objects, we would lift up our eyes to the
inexhaustible universe beyond, and ask to whom all this is
related, the highest existence is still the highest personality,
and the Source of all Being reveals Himself by His name,
'I AM.'" "It is our duty, then, to think of God as personal;
and it is our duty to believe that He is infinite." We
may at this point quote with profit the words of that Book<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
whose authority Mr. Mansel, without doubt, most heartily
acknowledges. "And for this cause God shall send them
strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all
might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure
in unrighteousness." "I have not written unto you because
ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and
that no lie is of the truth." Either God is personal or he is
not. If he is, then all that we claim is conceded. If he is
not personal, and "it is our duty to think" of him as personal,
then it is our duty to think and believe a <i>falsehood</i>.
This no man, at least neither Mr. Mansel nor any other enlightened
man, <i>can</i> bring his mind to accept as a moral law.
The soul instinctively asserts that obligation lies parallel
with <i>truth</i>, and "that no lie is of the truth." So, then, there
can be no duty except where truth is. And the converse
may also be accepted, viz.: Where an enlightened sense of
duty is, there is truth. When, therefore, so learned and
truly spiritual a man as Mr. Mansel asserts "that it is our
duty to think God personal, and believe him infinite," we unhesitatingly
accept it as the utterance of a great fundamental
truth in that spiritual realm which is the highest realm of
being, and so, as one of the highest truths, and with it we
accept all its logical consequences. It is a safe rule anywhere,
that if two mental operations seem to clash, and one
must be rejected, man should cling to, and trust in the
higher&mdash;the teaching of the nobler nature. Thus will we
do, and from the Divine's own ground will we see the destruction
of his philosophy. "It is our duty to think of God
as personal," because he is personal; and we know that he
is personal because it is our duty to think him so. We need
pay no regard to the perplexities of the Understanding. We
soar with the eagle above the clouds, and float ever in the
light of the Sun. The teachings of the Moral Sense are far
more sure, safe, and satisfactory than any discursions of the
lower faculty. Therefore it is man's wisdom, in all perplexity
to heed the cry of his highest nature, and determine to<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
stand on its teachings, as his highest knowledge, interpret all
utterances by this, and reject all which contradict it. At the
least, the declaration of this faculty is <i>as</i> valid as that of the
lower, and is to be more trusted in every disagreement, because
higher. Still further, no man would believe that God,
in the most solemn, yea, awful moment of his Self-revelation,
would declare a lie. The bare thought, fully formed, horrifies
the soul as a blasphemy of the damned. Yet, in that
supreme act, in the solitude of the Sinaitic wilderness, to one
of the greatest, one of the profoundest, most devout of men,
He revealed Himself by the pregnant words, "I AM": the
most positive, the most unquestionable form in which He
could utter the fact of His personality. This, then, and all
that is involved in it, we accept as truth; and all perplexities
must be interpreted by this surety.</p>

<p>In summing up the results to which an examination of the
facts of consciousness conducted him, Mr. Mansel utters the
following psychological error: "But a limit is necessarily
conceived as a relation between something within and something
without itself; and the consciousness of a limit of
thought implies, though it does not directly present to us, the
existence of something of which we do not and cannot
think." Not so; for a limit may be seen to be wholly
within the being to whom it belongs, and so <i>not</i> to be "a
relation between something within and something without
itself." This is precisely the case with the Deity. All relations
and limits spring from within him, and there is nothing
"without" to establish the relation claimed. This absence
of all limit from without is rudely expressed in such
common phrases as this: "It must be so in the <i>nature of
things</i>." This "nature of things" is, in philosophical language,
the system of <i>a priori</i> laws of the Universe, and
these are necessary ideas in the Divine Reason. It appears,
then, that what must be in the nature of things, finds its limits
wholly within, and its relations established by the Deity.</p>

<p>With these remarks the author would close his criticism<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
upon Mr. Mansel's book. We start from entirely different
bases, and these two systems logically follow from their foundations.
If Sir William Hamilton is right in his psychology,
his follower is unquestionably right in his deductions. But
if that psychology is partial, if besides the Understanding
there is the Reason, if above the judgment stands the intuition,
giving the final standard by which to measure that
judgment, then is the philosophical system of the Divine utterly
fallacious. The establishment of the validity of the
Pure Reason is the annihilation of "the Philosophy of the
Unconditioned." On the ground which the author has
adopted, it is seen that "God is a spirit," infinite, absolute,
self-conscious, personal; and a consistent interpretation of
these terms has been given. We have found that certain
objects may be seen as out of all relation, plurality, difference,
or likeness. Consciousness and personality have also
been found to involve no limit, in the proper sense of that
term. On the contrary, the one was ascertained to be the
light in which any or all objects might be seen under conditions
of Time, or at once; and that this seeing was according
to the capacity with which the being was endowed, and
was not determined by any peculiarity of the consciousness;
while the other appeared to be the highest possible form of
existence, and that also in which God had revealed himself.
From such a ground it is possible to go forward and construct
a Rational Theology which shall verify by Reason the
teachings of the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<h2 id="REVIEW_OF_MR_HERBERT_SPENCERS_FIRST_PRINCIPLES">REVIEW OF MR. HERBERT SPENCER'S "FIRST PRINCIPLES."</h2>

<p>In the criticisms heretofore made, some points, held in common
by the three writers named early in this work, have
been, it may be, passed over unnoticed. This was done,
because, being held in common, it was believed that an examination
of them, as presented by the latest writer, would
be most satisfactory. Therefore, what was peculiar in thought
or expression to Sir Wm. Hamilton or Mr. Mansel, we have
intended to notice when speaking of those writers. But where
Mr. Spencer seems to present their very thought as his own,
it has appeared better to remark upon it in his latest form of
expression. Mr. Spencer also holds views peculiar to himself.
These we shall examine in their place. And for convenience'
sake, what we have to say will take the form of a
running commentary upon those chapters entitled, "Ultimate
Religious Ideas," "Ultimate Scientific Ideas," "The Relativity
of all Knowledge," and "The Reconciliation." Before
entering upon this, however, some general remarks will be
pertinent.</p>

<p>1. Like his teachers, Mr. Spencer believes that the Understanding
is the highest faculty of the human intellect. This
is implied in the following sentence: "Those imbecilities of
the understanding that disclose themselves when we try to
answer the highest questions of objective science, subjective
science proves to be necessitated by the laws of that understanding."&mdash;<i>First
Principles</i>, p. 98.</p>

<p>His illustrations, also, are all, or nearly all, taken from
sensuous objects. In speaking of the Universe, evidently the
<i>material</i> Universe is present to his mind. His questions refer
to objects of sense, and he shows plainly enough that any<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
attempt to answer them by the Sense or Understanding is
futile. Hence he concludes that they cannot be answered.
But those who "know of a surety," that man is more than
an animal nature, containing a Sense and an Understanding;
that he is also a spiritual person, having an <i>Eye</i>, the pure
Reason, which can <i>see</i> straight to the central Truth, with a
clearness and in a light which dims and pales the noonday
sun, know also that, and how, these difficulties, insoluble to
the lower faculties, are, in this noble alembic, finally dissolved.</p>

<p>2. As Mr. Spencer follows his teachers in the psychology
of man's faculties, so does he also in the use of terms. Like
them, he employs only such terms as are pertinent to the
Sense and Understanding. So also with them he is at fault,
in that he raises questions which no Sense or Understanding
could suggest even, questions whose very presence are decisive
that a Pure Reason is organic in man; and then is guilty of
applying to them terms entirely impertinent,&mdash;terms belonging
only to those lower tribunals before which these questions
can never come. For instance, he always employs the word
"conceive" to express the effort of the mind in presenting to
itself the subjects now under discussion. In some form of
noun, verb, or adjective, this word seems to have rained upon
his pages; while such terms as "infinite period," "infinitely
divisible," "absolutely incompressible," "infinitesimal," and
the like, dot them repeatedly. Let us revert, then, a moment
to the positions attained in an earlier portion of this work. It
was there found that the word conceive was <i>utterly irrelevant</i>
to any subject except to objects of Sense and the Understanding
in its work of classifying them, or generalizing from
them, so, also, with regard to the other terms quoted, it was
found that they not only presented no object of thought to
the mind, but that the words had no relation to each other,
and could not properly be used together. For instance, infinite
has no more relation to, and can no more qualify period,
than the points of the compass are pertinent to, and can<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
qualify the affections. The phrase, infinite period, is simply
absurd, and so also are the others. The words infinite and
absolute have nothing to do with amount of any sort. They
can be pertinent only to God and his <i>a priori</i> ideas. Many,
perhaps most of the criticisms in detail we shall have to make,
will be based on this single misuse of words; which yet grows
naturally out of that denial and perversion of faculties which
Mr. Spencer, in common with the other Limitist writers, has
attempted. On the other hand, it is to be remembered, that,
if we arrive at the truth at all, we must <i>intuit</i> it; we must
either see it as a simple <i>a priori</i> idea, or as a logical deduction
from such ideas.</p>

<p>3. A third, and graver error on Mr. Spencer's part is, that
he goes on propounding his questions, and asserting that they
are insoluble, apparently as unconscious as a sleeper in an
enchanted castle that they have all been solved, or at least
that the principles on which it would seem that they could
be solved have been stated by a man of no mean ability,&mdash;Dr.
Hickok,&mdash;and that until the proposed solutions are
thoroughly analyzed and shown to be unsound, his own pages
are idle. He implies that there is no cognition higher than
a conception, when some very respectable writers have named
intuitions as incomparably superior. He speaks of the Understanding
as if it were without question the highest faculty
of man's intellect, when no less a person than Coleridge said
it would satisfy his life's labor to have introduced into
English thinking the distinction between the Understanding,
as "the faculty judging according to sense," and the Reason,
as "the power of universal and necessary convictions," which,
being such, must necessarily rank far above the other. And
finally he uses the words and phrases above disallowed, and
the faculties to which they belong, in an attempt to prove, by
the citation of a few items in an experience, what had already
been demonstrated by another in a process of as pure reasoning
as Calculus. No one, it is believed, can master the volume
heretofore alluded to, entitled "Rational Psychology," and so<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
appreciate the <i>demonstration</i> therein contained, of the utter
incompetency of the Sense or Understanding to solve such
questions as Mr. Spencer has raised by his incident of the
partridge, (p. 69,) and the utter irrelevancy to them of the
efforts of those faculties, without feeling how tame and unsatisfactory
in comparison is the evidence drawn from a few
facts in a sensuous experience. One cares not to see a half
dozen proofs, more or less that a theory is fallacious who has
learned that, and why, the theory <i>cannot</i> be true. Let us
now take up in order the chapters heretofore mentioned.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2 id="ULTIMATE_RELIGIOUS_IDEAS">"ULTIMATE RELIGIOUS IDEAS."</h2>

<p>The summing up of certain reflections with which this
chapter opens, concludes thus: "But that when our symbolic
conceptions are such that no cumulative or indirect
processes of thought can enable us to ascertain that there
are corresponding actualities, nor any predictions be made
whose fulfilment can prove this, then they are altogether
vicious and illusive, and in no way distinguishable from pure
fictions,"&mdash;p. 29. So far very good; but his use of it is utterly
unsound. "And now to consider the bearings of this general
truth on our immediate topic&mdash;Ultimate Religious Ideas."
But this "general truth" has <i>no</i> bearings upon "ultimate
religious ideas"; how then can you consider them? <i>No</i> ideas,
and most of all religious ideas, are conceptions, or the results
of conceptions&mdash;or are the products of "cumulative or indirect
processes of thought." They are not results or products
<i>at all</i>. They are organic, are the spontaneous presentation
of what is inborn, and so must be directly seen to be known
at all. Man might pile up "cumulative processes of thought"
for unnumbered ages, and might form most exact conceptions
of objects of Sense,&mdash;conceptions are not possible of others,&mdash;and
he could never creep up to the least and faintest religious
idea.<span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>On the next page, speaking of "suppositions respecting
the origin of the Universe," Mr. Spencer says, "The deeper
question is, whether any one of them is even conceivable in
the true sense of that word. Let us successively test them."
This is not necessary. It has already been <i>demonstrated</i>
that a conception, or any effort of the Understanding, cannot
touch, or have relation to such topics. But it does not follow,
therefore, that no one of them is cognizable at all; which he
implies. Take the abstract notion of self-existence, for example.
No "vague symbolic conceptions," or any conception
at all, of it <i>can be formed</i>. A conception is possible only
"under relation, difference, and plurality." <i>This</i> is a pure,
simple idea, and so can only be known in itself by a seeing&mdash;an
immediate intuition. It is seen by itself, as out of all
relation. It is seen as simple, and so is learned by no difference.
It is seen as a unit, and so out of all plurality.
The discursive faculty cannot pass over it, because there are
in it no various points upon which that faculty may fasten.
It may, perhaps, better be expressed by the words pure independence.
Again, it is <i>not</i> properly "existence without a
beginning," but rather, existence out of all relation to beginning;
and so it is an idea, out of all relation to those faculties
which are confined to objects that did begin. Because we
can "by no mental effort" "form a conception of existence
without a beginning," it does not follow that we cannot <i>see</i>
that a Being existing out of all relation to beginning <i>is</i>. "To
this let us add" that the intuition of such a Being is a complete
"explanation of the Universe," and does make it "easier
to understand" "that it existed an hour ago, a day ago, a
year ago"; for we see that this Being primarily is <i>out of all
relation to time</i>, that there is no such thing as an "infinite
period," the phrase being absurd; but that through all the
procession of events which we call time he <i>is</i>; and that before
that procession began&mdash;when there was no time, he was.
Thus we see that all events are based upon Him who is
independent; and that time, in our general use of it, is but<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
the measure of what He produces. We arrive, then, at the
conclusion that the Universe is not self-existent, not because
self-existence cannot be object to the human mind, and be
clearly seen to be an attribute of one Being, but because the
Universe is primarily object to faculties in that mind, which
cannot entertain such a notion at all; and because this notion
is <i>seen</i> to be a necessary idea in the province of that higher
faculty which entertains as objects both the idea and the
Being to whom it primarily belongs.</p>

<p>The theory that the Universe is self-existent is Pantheism,
and not the theory that it is self-created, though this latter,
in Mr. Spencer's definition of it, seems only a phase of the
other. To say that "self-creation is potential existence
passing into actual existence by some inherent necessity," is
only to remove self-existence one step farther back, as he
himself shows. Potential existence is either no existence at
all, or it is positive existence. If it is no existence, then we
have true self-creation; which is, that out of nothing, and
with no cause, actual existence starts itself. This is not
only unthinkable, but absurd. But if potential existence is
positive, it needs to be accounted for as much as actual.
While, then, there can be no doubt as to the validity of
the conclusions to which Mr. Spencer arrives, respecting the
entire incompetency of the hypotheses of self-existence and
self-creation, to account for the Universe, the distinction
made above between self-existence as a true and self-creation
as a pseudo idea, and the fact that the true idea is a <i>reality</i>,
should never be lost sight of. By failing to discriminate&mdash;as
in the Understanding he could not do&mdash;between them,
and by concluding both as objects alike impossible to the
human intellect, and for the same reasons, he has also decided
that the "commonly received or theistic hypothesis"&mdash;creation
by external agency&mdash;is equally untenable. In his examination
of this, he starts as usual with his ever-present, fallacious
assumption, that this is a "conception"; that it can
be, <i>is</i> founded upon a "cumulative process of thought, or the<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
fulfilment of predictions based on it." These words, phrases,
and notions, are all irrelevant. It is not a conception, process,
or prediction that we want; it is a <i>sight</i>. Hence, no
assumptions have to be made or granted. No "proceedings
of a human artificer" <i>can in the least degree</i> "vaguely symbolize
to us" the "method after which the Universe" was
"shaped." This differed in <i>kind</i> from all possible human
methods, and had not one element in common with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer's remarks at this point upon Space do not
appear to be well grounded. "An immeasurable void"&mdash;Space&mdash;is
not an entity, is <i>no</i> thing, and therefore cannot
"exist," neither is any explanation for it needed. His question,
"how came it so?" takes, then, this form: How came
immeasurable nothing to be nothing? Nothing needs no
"explanation." It is only <i>some</i> thing which must be accounted
for. The theory of creation by external agency being, then,
an adequate one to account for the Universe, supplies the
following statement. That Being who is primarily out of
all relation, produced, from himself, and by his immanent
power, into nothing&mdash;Space, room, the condition of material
existence,&mdash;something, matter and the Universe became.
"The genesis of the universe" having thus been explained
and seen to be "the result of external agency," we are
ready to furnish for the question, "how came there to be an
external agency?" that true answer, which we have already
shadowed forth. That pure spiritual Person who is necessarily
existent, or self-existent, <i>i. e.</i> who possess pure independence
as an essential attribute, whose being is thus
fixed, and is therefore without the province of power, is the
external agency which is needed. This Person, differing in
kind from the Universe, cannot be found in it, nor concluded
from it, but can only be known by being seen, and can only
be seen because man possesses the endowment of a spiritual
<i>Eye</i>, like in kind to His own All-seeing eye, by which spiritual
things may be discerned. This Person, being thus seen
immediately, is known in a far more satisfactory mode than<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
he could be by any generalizations of the Understanding,
could he be represented in these at all. The knowledge of
Him is, like His self, <i>immutable</i>. We <span class="smcap">know</span> that we stand
on the eternal Rock. Our eye is illuminated with the
unwavering Light which radiates from the throne of God.
Nor is this any hallucination of the rhapsodist. It is the
simple experience which every one enjoys who looks at pure
truth in itself. It is the Pure Reason seeing, by an immediate
intuition, God as pure spirit, revealed directly to itself.
It is, then, because self-existence is a pure, simple idea, organic
in man, and seen by him to be an attribute of God,
that God is known to be the Creator of the Universe. Having
attained to this truth, we readily see that the conclusions
which Mr. Spencer states on pages 35, 36, as that "self-existence
is rigorously inconceivable"; that the theistic hypothesis
equally with the others is "literally unthinkable";
that "our conception of self-existence can be formed only
by joining with it the notion of unlimited duration through
past time"; so far as they imply our destitution of knowledge
on these topics, are the opposite of the facts. We <i>see</i>,
though we cannot "conceive," self-existence. The theistic
hypothesis becomes, therefore, literally thinkable. We see,
also, that unlimited duration is an absurdity; that duration
must be limited; and that self-existence involves existence
out of all relation to duration.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer then turns to the nature of the Universe, and
says: "We find ourselves on the one hand obliged to make
certain assumptions, and yet, on the other hand, we find these
assumptions cannot be represented in thought." Upon this
it may be remarked:</p>

<p>1. What are here called assumptions are properly assertions,
which man makes, and cannot help making, except he
deny himself;&mdash;necessary convictions, first truths, first principles,
<i>a priori</i> ideas. They are organic, and so are the
foundation of all knowledge. They are not results learned
from lessons, but are <i>primary</i>, and conditional to an ability<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
to learn. But supposing them to be assumptions, having, at
most, no more groundwork than a vague guess, there devolves
a labor which Mr. Spencer and his coadjutors have
never attempted, and which, we are persuaded, they would
find the most difficult of all, viz., to account for the fact of
these assumptions. For the question is pertinent and urgent;</p>

<p>2. How came these assumptions to suggest themselves?
Where, for instance, did the notion of self come from? Analyze
the rocks, study plants and their growth, become familiar
with animals and their habits, or exhaust the Sense in an
examination of man, and one can find no notion of self.
Yet the notion is, and is peculiar to man. How does it
arise? Is it "created by the slow action of natural causes?"
How comes it to belong, then, to the rudest aboriginal equally
with the most civilized and cultivated? Was it "created"
from nothing or from something? If from something, how
came that something to be? We might ask, Does not the
presentation of any phenomenon involve the actuality of a
somewhat, in which that phenomenon inheres, and of a receptivity
by which it is appreciated? Does not the fact of
this assumption, as a mental phenomenon, involve the higher
fact of some mental ground, some form, some capacity, which
is both organic to the mind, and organized in the mind, in
accordance with which the assumption is, and which determines
what it must be? Or are we to believe that these
assumptions are mere happenings, without law, and for which
no reason can be assigned? Again we press the question,
How came these assumptions to suggest themselves?</p>

<p>3. "These assumptions cannot be represented in thought."
If "thought" is restricted to that mental operation of the
Understanding by which it generalizes in accordance with
the Sense, the statement is true. But if it is meant, as
seems to be implied, that the notions expressed in these assumptions
are not, cannot be, clearly and definitely known at
all by the mind, then it is directly contrary to the truth.
The ideas presented by the phrases are, as was seen above,
clear and definite.<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>Since Mr. Spencer has quoted <i>in extenso</i>, and with entire
approbation, what Mr. Mansel says respecting "the Cause,
the Absolute, and the Infinite," we have placed the full examination
of these topics in our remarks upon Mr. Mansel's
writings, and shall set down only a few brief notes here.</p>

<p>Upon this topic Mr. Spencer admits that "we are obliged
to suppose <i>some</i> cause"; or, in other words, that the notion
of cause is organic. Then we must "inevitably commit ourselves
to the hypothesis of a First Cause." Then, this First
Cause "must be infinite." Then, "it must be independent;"
"or, to use the established word, it must be absolute." One
would almost suppose that a <i>rational</i> man penned these
decisions, instead of one who denies that he has a <i>reason</i>.
The illusion is quickly dispelled, however, by the objections
he lifts out of the dingy ground-room of the Understanding.
It is curious to observe in these pages a fact which we have
noticed before, in speaking of Sir William Hamilton's works,
viz.: how, on the same page, and in the same sentence, the
workings of the Understanding and Reason will run along
side by side, the former all the while befogging and hindering
the latter. Mr. Spencer's conclusions which we have
quoted, and his objections which we are to answer, are a
striking exemplification of this. Frequently in his remarks
he uses the words limited and unlimited, as synonymous with
finite and infinite, when they are not so, and cannot be used
interchangeably with propriety. The former belong wholly
in the Sense and Understanding. The latter belong wholly
in the Pure Reason. The former pertain to material objects,
to mental images of them, or to number. The latter qualify
only spiritual persons, and have no pertinence elsewhere.
Limitation is the conception of an object <i>as bounded</i>. Illimitation
is the conception of an object as without boundaries.
Rigidly, it is a simple negation of boundaries, and gives
nothing positive in the Concept. Finity or finiteness corresponds
in the Reason to limitation in the Sense and Understanding.
It does not refer to boundaries at all. It belongs<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
only to created spiritual persons, and expresses the fact that
they are partial, and must grow and learn. Only by its
place in the antithesis does infinity correspond in the Reason
to illimitation in the lower faculties. It is <i>positive</i>, and is
that quality of the pure spirit which is otherwise known as
<i>universality</i>. It expresses the idea of <i>all possible endowments
in perfect harmony</i>. From his misuse of these terms Mr.
Spencer is led to speak in an irrelevant manner upon the
question, "Is the First Cause finite or infinite?" He uses
words and treats the whole matter as if it were a question of
material substance, which might be "bounded," with a "region
surrounding its boundaries," and the like, which are as
out of place as to say white love or yellow kindness. His
methods of thought on these topics are also gravely erroneous.
He attempts an analysis by the logical Understanding,
where a synthesis by the Reason is required,&mdash;a synthesis
which has already been given by our Creator to man
as an original idea. It is not necessary to examine some
limited thing, or all limited things, and wander around their
boundaries to learn that the First Cause is infinite. We
need to make no discursus, but only to look the idea of first
cause through and through, and thoroughly analyze it, to find
all the truth. By such a process we would find all that Mr.
Spencer concedes that "we are obliged to suppose," and further,
that such a being <i>must be</i> self-existent. And this conviction
would be so strong that the mind would rest itself in
this decision: "A thousand phantasmagoria of the imagination
may be wrong," says the soul, "but this I know must be
true, or there is no truth in the Universe."</p>

<p>One sentence in the paragraph now under consideration
deserves special notice. It is this. "But if we admit that
there can be some thing uncaused, there is no reason to assume
a cause for anything." This "assumes" the truth of
a major premise all <i>things</i> are substantially alike. If the
word "thing" is restricted to its exact limits,&mdash;objects of
sense,&mdash;then the sentence pertains wholly to the Sense and<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
Understanding, and is true. But if, as it would seem, the
implication is meant that there are no other entities which
can be object to the mind except such "things," then it is a
clear <i>petitio principii</i>. For the very question at issue is,
whether, in fact, there is not one entity&mdash;"thing"&mdash;which
so differs in kind from all others, that it is uncaused, <i>i. e.</i>
self-existent; and whether the admission that that entity
is uncaused does not, because of this seen difference, satisfy
the mind, and furnish a reasonable ground on which to
account for the subordinate causes which we observe by the
Sense.</p>

<p>In speaking of the First Cause as "independent," he says,
"but it can have no necessary relation within itself. There
can be nothing in it which determines change, and yet nothing
which prevents change. For if it contains something
which imposes such necessities or restraints, this something
must be a cause higher than the First Cause, which is absurd.
Thus, the First Cause must be in every sense perfect,
complete, total, including within itself all power, and transcending
all law." We cannot criticize this better, and mark
how curiously truth and error are mixed in it, than by so
parodying it that only truth shall be stated. The First
Cause possesses within himself all possible relations as belonging
to his necessary ideals. Hence, change, in the exact
sense of that term, is impossible to him, for there is nothing
for him to <i>change to</i>. This is not invalidated by his passing
from inaction to action; for creation involves no change in
God's nature or attributes, and so no real or essential change,
which is here meant. But he is the permanent, through
whom all changes become. He is not, then, a <i>simple</i> unit,
but is an organized Being, who is ground for, and comprehends
in a unity, all possible laws, forms, and relations, as
necessary elements of his necessary existence,&mdash;as endowments
which necessarily belong to him, and are conditional
of his pure independence. Hence, these restraints are not
"imposed" upon him, except as his existence is imposed<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
upon him. They belong to his Self, and are conditional of
his being. So, then, instead of "transcending all law," he is
the embodiment of all law; and his perfection is, that possessing
this endowment, he accords his conduct thereto. A
being who should "transcend all law" would have no reason
why he should act, and no form how he should act, neither
would he be an organism, but would be pure lawlessness or
pure chaos. Pure chaos cannot organize order; pure lawlessness
cannot establish law; and so could not be the First
Cause. As Mr. Spencer truly says, "we have no alternative
but to regard this First Cause as Infinite and Absolute."</p>

<p>And now having learned, by a true diagnosis of the mental
activities, that the positions we have gained are fixed,
final, irrevocable; and further, that they are not the "results"
of "reasonings," but that first there was a seeing, and then
an analysis of what was seen, and that the seeing is <i>true</i>,
though every other experience be false; we <i>know</i> that our
position is not "illusive," but that we stand on the rock; and
that what we have seen is no "symbolic conception of the
illegitimate order," but is pure truth.</p>

<p>For the further consideration of this subject, the reader is
referred back to our remarks on that passage in Mr. Mansel's
work, which Mr. Spencer has quoted.</p>

<p>A few remarks upon his summing up, p. 43 <i>et seq.</i>, will
complete the review of this chapter. "Passing over the
consideration of credibility, and confining ourselves to that
of" consistency, we would find in any rigorous analysis, that
Atheism and Pantheism are self-contradictory; but we <i>have
found</i> that Theism, "when rigorously analyzed," presents an
absolutely consistent system, in which all the difficulties of
the Understanding are explained to the person by the Reason,
and is entirely thinkable. Such a system, based upon the
necessary convictions of man, and justly commanding that
these shall be the fixed standard, in accordance with which
all doubts and queries shall be dissolved and decided, gives
a rational satisfaction to man, and discloses to him his eternal
<span class="smcap">Rest</span>.<span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>In proceeding to his final fact, which he derives as the
permanent in all religions, Mr. Spencer overlooks another
equally permanent, equally common, and incomparably more
important fact, viz: that Fetishism, Polytheism, Pantheism,
and Monotheism,&mdash;all religions alike assert <i>that a god created
the Universe</i>. In other words, the great common element,
in all the popular modes of accounting for the vast
system of things in which we live is, <i>that it is the product of
an agency external to itself, and that the external agency is
personal</i>. Take the case of the rude aboriginal, who "assumes
a separate personality behind every phenomenon."
He does not attempt to account for all objects. His mind is
too infantile, and he is too degraded to suspect that those
material objects which appear permanent need to be accounted
for. It is only the changes which seem to him to need a
reason. Behind each change he imagines a sort of personal
power, superior to it and man, which produces it, and this
satisfies him. He inquires no further; yet he looks in the
same direction as the Monotheist. In this crude form of
belief, which is named Fetishism, we see that essential idea
which can be readily traced through all forms of religion,
that some <i>personal</i> being, external, and superior to the things
that be, produced them. Nor is Atheism a proper exception
to this law. For Atheism is not a religion, but the denial of
all religion. It is not a doctrine of God, but is a denial that
there is any God; and what is most in point, it never was a
<i>popular</i> belief, but is only a philosophical Sahara over which
a few caravans of speculative doubters and negatists wander.
Neither can Hindu pantheism be quoted against the position
taken: for Brahm is not the Universe; neither are Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva. Brahm does not lose his individuality
because the Universe is evolved from him. <i>Now</i> he is
thought of as one, and the Universe as another, although the
Universe is thought to be a part of his essence, and hereafter
to be reabsorbed by him. <i>Now</i>, this part of his essence
which was <i>produced</i> through Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, is<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
<i>individualized</i>; and so is one, while he is another. Thus,
here also, the idea of a proper external agency is preserved.
The facts, then, are decisively in favor of the proposition
above laid down. "<i>Our</i> investigation" discloses "a fundamental
verity in each religion." And the facts and the
verity find no consistent ground except in a pure Theism,
and there they do find perfect consistency and harmony.</p>

<p>It is required, finally, in closing the discussion of this
chapter, to account for the fact that, upon a single idea so
many theories of God have fastened themselves; or better,
perhaps, that a single idea has developed itself in so many
forms. This cannot better be done than in the language of
that metaphysician, not second to Plato, the apostle Paul.
In his Epistle to the Romans, beginning at the 19th verse
of the 1st chapter, he says: "Because that which may be
known of God is manifest to them; for God hath shewed it
unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation
of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so
that they are without excuse. Because that, when they
knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were
thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened: professing themselves to be wise
they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible
God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things." This
passage, which would be worthy the admiring study of ages,
did it possess no claim to be the teaching of that Being whom
Mr. Spencer asserts it is <i>impossible for us to know</i>, gives us
in a popular form the truth. Man, having organic in his
mind the idea of God, and having in the Universe an ample
manifestation to the Sense, of the eternal power and Godhead
of the Creator of that Universe, corresponding to that
idea, perverted the manifestation to the Sense, and degraded
the idea in the Reason, to the service of base passion. By
this degradation and perversion the organic idea became so<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
bedizened with the finery of fancy formed in the Understanding,
under the direction of the animal nature, as to be
lost to the popular mind,&mdash;the trappings only being seen.
When once the truth was thus lost sight of, and with it all
that restraint which a knowledge of the true God would impose,
men became vain in their imaginations; their fancy
ran riot in all directions. Cutting loose from all law, they
plunged into every excess which could be invented; and out
of such a stimulated and teeming brain all manner of vagaries
were devised. This was the first stage; and of it we
find some historic hints in the biblical account of the times,
during and previous to the life of Abraham. Where secular
history begins the human race had passed into the second
stage. Crystallization had begun. Students were commencing
the search for truth. Religion was taking upon itself
more distinct forms. The organic idea, which could not
be wholly obliterated, formed itself distinctly in the consciousness
of some gifted individuals, and philosophy began.
Philosophy in its purest form, as taught by Socrates and
Plato, presented again the lost idea of pure Theism. But
the spirituality which enabled them to see the truth, lifted
them so far above the common people, that they could affect
only a few. And what was most disheartening, that same
degradation which originally lost to man the truth, now prevented
him from receiving it. Thus it was that by a binding
of the Reason to the wheels of Passion, and discursing
through the world with the Understanding at the beck of
the Sense, the many forms of religion became.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2 id="ULTIMATE_SCIENTIFIC_IDEAS">"ULTIMATE SCIENTIFIC IDEAS."</h2>

<p>On a former page we have already attempted a positive
answer to the question, "What are Space and Time," with
which Mr. Spencer opens this chapter. It was there found<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
that, in general terms, they are <i>a priori</i> conditions of created
being; and, moreover, that they possess characteristics suitable
to what they condition, just as the <i>a priori</i> conditions of
the spiritual person possess characteristics suitable to what
they condition. It was further found that this general law is,
from the necessity of the case, realized both within the mind
and without it; that it is, must be, the form of thought for
the perceiving subject, corresponding to the condition of existence
for the perceived object. It also appeared that the
Universe as object, and the Sense and Understanding as
faculties in the subject, thus corresponded; and further, that
these faculties could never transcend and comprehend Space
and Time, because these were the very conditions of their
being; moreover, that by them all spaces and times must be
considered with reference to the Universe, and apart from it
could not be examined by them at all. Yet it was further
found that the Universe might in the presence of the Reason
be abstracted; and that, then, pure Space and Time still
remained as pure <i>a priori</i> conditions, the one as <i>room</i>, the
other as <i>opportunity</i>, for the coming of created being. Space
and Time being such conditions, <i>and nothing more</i>, are entities
only in the same sense that the multiplication table and the
moral law are entities. They are <i>conditions</i> suited to what
they condition. In the light of this result let us examine
Mr. Spencer's teachings respecting them.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, Space and Time do not "exist." If they
exist (ex sto), they must stand out somewhere and when.
This of course involves the being of a where and a when in
which they can stand out; and that where and when must
needs be accounted for, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Again, Mr.
Spencer would seem to speak, in his usual style, as if they,
in existing "objectively," had a <i>formal</i> objective existence.
Yet this, in the very statement of it, appears absurd. The
mind apprehends many objects, which do not "exist." They
only are. Thus, as has just been said, Space and Time, as
conditions of created being, <i>are</i>. They are entities but not<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
existences. They are <i>a priori</i> entities, and so are <i>necessarily</i>.
By this they stand in the same category with all
pure laws, all first principles.</p>

<p>"Moreover, to deny that Space and Time are things, and
so by implication to call them nothings, involves the absurdity
that there are two kinds of nothings." This sentence "involves
the absurdity" of assuming that "nothing" is an entity.
If I say that Space is nothing, I say that it presents no content
for a concept, and cannot, because there is no content
to be presented. It is then <i>blank</i>. Just so of Time. As
nothings they are, then, both equally blank, and destitute of
meaning. Now if Mr. Spencer wishes to hold that nothing
represented by one word, differs from nothing represented by
another, we would not lay a straw in his way, but yet would
be much surprised if he led a large company.</p>

<p>Again, having decided that they are neither "nonentities
nor the attributes of entities, we have no choice but to consider
them as entities." But he then goes on to speak of
them as "things," evidently using the word in the same sense
as if applying it to a material object, as an apple or stone;
thereby implying that entity and thing in that sense are
synonymous terms. Upon this leap in the dark, this blunder
in the use of language, he proceeds to build up a mountain of
difficulties. But once take away this foundation, once cease
attempting "to represent them in thought as things," and
his difficulties vanish. Space is a condition. Perhaps receptivity,
indivisibility, and illimitability are attributes. If
so, it has attributes, for these certainly belong to it. But
whether these shall be called attributes or not, it is certain
that Space is, is a pure condition, is thus a positive object to
the Reason, is qualified by the characteristics named above;
and all this without any contradiction or other insuperable
difficulty arising thereby. On the ground now established,
we learn that extension and Space are <i>not</i> "convertible
terms." Extension is an attribute of matter. Space is a condition
of phenomena. It is only all <i>physical</i> "entities which<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
we actually know as such" that "are limited." From our
standpoint, that Space is <i>no</i> thing, such remarks as "We
find ourselves totally unable to form any mental image of
unbounded Space," appear painfully absurd. "We find ourselves"
just as "totally unable to form any mental image of
unbounded" love. Such phrases as "mental image" have
<i>no relevancy</i> to either Space or Time. In criticizing Kant's
doctrine, which we have found <i>true</i> as far as it goes, Mr.
Spencer evinces a surprising lack of knowledge of the facts
in question. "In the first place," he says, "to assert that
Space and Time, as we are conscious of them, are subjective
conditions, is by implication to assert that they are not objective
realities." But the conclusion does not follow. If
the reader will take the trouble to construct the syllogism on
which this is based, he will at once perceive the absurdity of
the logic. It may be said in general that all conditions of a
thinking being are both subjective and objective: they are
conditions of his being&mdash;subjective; and they are objects
of his examination and cognizance&mdash;objective. Is not the
multiplication table an objective reality, <i>i. e.</i>, would it not
remain if he be destroyed? And yet is it not also a subjective
law; and so was it not originally discovered by introspection
and reflection? Again he says, "for that consciousness
of Space and Time which we cannot rid ourselves
of, is the consciousness of them as existing objectively." Now
the fact is, that primarily we do not have <i>any</i> consciousness
of Space and Time. <i>Consciousness has to do with phenomena.</i>
When examining the material Universe, the <i>objects</i>, and the
objects as at a distance from each other and as during, are
what we are conscious of. For instance, I view the planets
Jupiter and Saturn. They appear as objects in my consciousness.
There is a distance between them; but this distance
<i>is</i> not, except as they <i>are</i>. If they are not, the word distance
has no meaning with reference to them. Take them away,
and I have no consciousness of distance as remaining. These
planets continue in existence. They endure. This endurance<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
we call time, but if they should cease, one could not think of
endurance in connection with them as remaining. Here we
most freely and willingly agree with Mr. Spencer that "the
question is, What does consciousness directly testify?" but
he will find that consciousness on this side of the water testifies
very differently from his consciousness: as for instance in the
two articles in the "North American Review," heretofore
alluded to. Here, "the direct testimony of consciousness is,"
that spaces and times within the Universe are without the
mind; that Space and Time, as <i>a priori</i> conditions for the
possibility of formal object and during event, are also without
the mind; but the "testimony" is none the less clear and
"direct" that Space and Time are laws of thought in the
mind corresponding to the actualities without the mind. And
the question may be asked, it is believed with great force,
If this last were not so, how could the mind take any cognizance
of the actuality? Again, most truly, Space and Time
"cannot be conceived to become non-existent even were the
mind to become non-existent." Much more strongly than
this should the truth be uttered. They could not become
non-existent if the Universe with every sentient being, yea,
even&mdash;to make an impossible supposition&mdash;if the Deity
himself, should cease to be. In this they differ no whit from
the laws of Mathematics, of Logic, and of Morals. These
too would remain as well. Thus is again enforced the truth,
which has been stated heretofore, that Space and Time, as
<i>a priori</i> conditions of the Universe, stand in precisely the
same relation to material object and during event that the
multiplication table does to intellect, or the moral law to a
spiritual person. It will now be doubtless plain that Mr.
Spencer's remarks sprang directly from the lower faculties.
The Sense in its very organization possesses Space and Time
as void forms into which objects may come. So also the
Understanding possesses the notional as connecting into a
totality. These faculties cannot be in a living man without
acting. Activity is their law. Hence images are ever<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
arising and <i>must</i> arise in the Sense, and be connected in the
Understanding, and all this in the forms and conditions of
Space and Time. He who thinks continually in these conditions
will always <i>imagine</i> that Space and Time are only
without him&mdash;because he will be thinking only in the iron
prison-house of the imagining faculty&mdash;and so cannot transcend
the conditions it imposes. Now how shall one see these
conditions? They do "exist objectively"; or, to phrase it
better, they have a true being independent of our minds. In
this sense, as we have seen, every <i>a priori</i> condition must be
objective to the mind. What is objective to the Sense is not
Space but a space, <i>i. e.</i> a part of Space limited by matter;
and, after all, it is the boundaries which are the true object
rather than the space, which cannot be "conceived" of if
the boundaries be removed. Without further argument, is it
not evident that there Space, like all other <i>a priori</i> conditions,
is object only to the Reason, and that as a condition of
material existence?</p>

<p>At the bottom of page 49 we have another of Mr. Spencer's
psychological errors:&mdash;"For if Space and Time are
forms of thought, they can never be thought of; since it is
impossible for anything to be at once the <i>form</i> of thought
and the matter of thought." Although this topic has been
amply discussed elsewhere, it may not be uninstructive to
recur to it again. Exactly the opposite of Mr. Spencer's
remark is the truth. The question at issue here is one of
those profound and subtile ones which cannot be approached
by argument, but can be decided only by a <i>seeing</i>. It is a
psychological question pertaining to the profoundest depths
of our being. If one says, "I see the forms of thought," and
another, "I cannot see them," neither impeaches the other.
All that is left is to stimulate the dull faculty of the one
until he can see. The following reflections may help us
to see. Mr. Spencer's remark implies that we have no
higher faculty than the Sense and the Understanding. It
implies, also, that we can never have any <i>self</i>-knowledge, in<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
the fundamental signification of that phrase. We can observe
the conduct of the mind, and study and classify the
results; but the laws, the constitution of the activity itself
must forever remain closed to us. As was said, when speaking
of this subject under a different phase, the eye cannot
see and study itself. It is a mechanical organism, capable
only of reaction as acted upon, capable only of seeing results,
but never able to penetrate to the hidden springs which underlie
the event. Just so is it with the Sense and Understanding.
They are mere mechanical faculties capable of
acting as they are acted upon, but never able to go behind
the appearance to its final source. On such a hypothesis as
this all science is impossible, but most of all a science of the
human mind. If man is enclosed by such walls, no knowledge
of his central self can be gained. He may know what
he <i>does</i>; but what he <i>is</i>, is as inscrutable to him as what
God is. As such a being, he is only a higher order of
brute. He has some dim perceptions, some vague feelings,
but he has no <i>knowledge</i>; he is <i>sure</i> of nothing. He can
reach no ground which is ultimate, no <i>Rock</i> which he knows
is <i>immutable</i>. Is man such a being? The longings and
aspirations of the ages roll back an unceasing <span class="smcap">No</span>! He is
capable of placing himself before himself, of analyzing that
self to the very groundwork of his being. All the laws of
his constitution, all the forms of his activity, he can clearly
and amply place before himself and know them. And how
is this? It is because God has endowed him with an EYE
like unto His own, which enables man to be self-comprehending,
as He is self-comprehending,&mdash;the Reason, with
which man may read himself as a child reads a book; that
man can make "the <i>form</i> of thought the <i>matter</i> of thought."
True, the Understanding is shut out from any consideration
of the forms of thought; but man is not simply or mainly
an Understanding. He is, in his highest being, a spiritual
person, whom God has endowed with the faculty of <span class="smcap">Vision</span>;
and the great organic evil, which the fall wrought into the<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
world, was this very denial of the spiritual light, and this
crowding down and out of sight, of the spiritual person beneath
the animal nature, this denial of the essential faculties
of such person, and this elevation of the lower faculties of
the animal nature, the Sense and Understanding, into the
highest place, which is involved in all such teachings as we
are criticizing.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer's remarks upon "Matter" are no nearer the
truth. In almost his first sentence there is a grievous logical
<i>faux pas</i>. He says: "Matter is either infinitely divisible
or it is not; no third possibility can be named." Yet we
will name one, as follows: <i>The divisibility of matter has no
relation to infinity</i>. And this <i>third</i> supposition happens to
be the truth. But it will be said that the question should be
stated thus: Either there is a limit to the divisibility of matter,
or there is no limit. This statement is exhaustive, because
limitation belongs to matter. Of these alternatives
there can be no hesitation which one to choose. There is a
limit to the divisibility of matter. This answer cannot be
given by the physical sense; for no one questions but what
it is incapable of finding a limit. The mental sense could
not give it, because it is a question of actual substance and
not of ideal forms. The Reason gives the answer. Matter
is limited at both extremes. Its amount is definite, as are its
final elements. These "ultimate parts" have "an under and
an upper surface, a right and a left side." When, then, one
of these parts shall be broken, what results? Not <i>pieces</i>, as
the materialist, thinking only in the Sense, would have us
believe. When a final "part" shall be broken, there will
remain <i>no matter</i>,&mdash;to the sense nothing. To it, the result
would be annihilation. But the Reason declares that there
would be left <i>God's power</i> in its simplicity,&mdash;that final Unit
out of which all diversity becomes.</p>

<p>The subsequent difficulties raised respecting the solidity
of Matter may be explained thus. And for convenience
sake, we will limit the term Matter to such substances as are<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
object to the physical sense, like granite, while Force shall
be used to comprise those finer substances, like the Ether,
which are impalpable to the physical sense. Matter is composed
of very minute ultimate particles which do not touch,
but which are held together by Force. The space between
the atoms, which would otherwise be <i>in vacuo</i>, is <i>full</i> of
Force. We might be more exhaustive in our analysis, and
say&mdash;which would be true&mdash;that a space-filling force composes
the Universe; and that Matter is only Force in one
of its modifications. But without this the other statement is
sufficient. When, then, a portion of matter is compressed,
the force which holds the ultimate particles in their places is
overcome by an external force, and these particles are brought
nearer together. Now, how is it with the moving body and
the collision? Bisect a line and see the truth.</p>

<p>A body with a mass of 4 is moving with a velocity of 4 along
the line from A to B. At C it meets another body with a
mass of 4 at rest. From thence the two move on towards B
with a velocity of 2. What has happened? In the body
there was a certain amount of force, which set it in motion
and kept it in motion. And just here let us make a point.
<i>No force is ever lost or destroyed. It is only transferred.</i>
When a bullet is fired from a gun, it possesses at one <i>point</i> a
maximum of force. From that point this force is steadily
<i>transferred</i> to the air and other substances, until all that it
received from the powder is spent. But at any one point in
its flight, the sum of the force which has been transferred
since the maximum, and of the force yet to be transferred,
will always equal the maximum. Now, how is it respecting
the question raised by Mr. Spencer? The instant of contact
is a point in time, <i>not a period</i>, and the transfer of force is
instantaneous. C, then, is a <i>point</i>, not a period, and the
velocity on the one side is 4 and the other side 2, while the<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
momentum or force is exactly equal throughout the line. If
it is said that this proves that a body can pass from one
velocity to another without passing through the intermediate
velocities, we cannot help it. The above are the facts, and
they give the truth. The following sentence of Mr. Spencer
is, at least, careless. "For when, of two such units,
one moving at velocity 4 strikes another at rest, the striking
unit must have its velocity 4 instantaneously reduced to velocity
2; must pass from velocity 4 to velocity 2 without any
lapse of time, and without passing through intermediate velocities;
must be moving with velocities 4 and 2 at the same
instant, which is impossible." If there is any sense in the
remark, "instantaneously" must mean a <i>point</i> of time <i>without
period</i>. For, if any period is allowed, the sentence has
no meaning, since during that period "the striking unit"
passes through all "intermediate velocities." But if by instantaneously
he means <i>without period</i>, then the last clause
of the sentence is illogical, since instant there evidently
means a period. For if it means point, then it contradicts
the first clause. There, it is asserted that 4 was "<i>reduced</i>"
to 2, <i>i. e.</i> that at one point the velocity was 4, and at the
next point it was 2, and that there was <i>no time</i> between. If
4 was instantaneously reduced to 2, then the velocity 2 was
next after the velocity 4, and not coeval with it. Thus it
appears that these two clauses which were meant to be synonymous
are contradictory.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what we have heretofore learned respecting
atoms, we shall not be troubled by the objections to the
Newtonian theory which follow. In reply to the question,
"What is the constitution of these units?" the answer, "We
have no alternative but to regard each of them as a small
piece of matter," would be true if the Sense was the only
faculty which could examine them. But even upon this
theory Mr. Spencer's remarks "respecting the parts of which
each atom consists," are entirely out of place; for the hypothesis
that it is an ultimate atom excludes the supposition<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
of "parts," since that phrase has no meaning except it refers
to a final, indivisible, material unit. All that the Sense
could say, would be, "What this atom is I know not, but
that it is, and <i>is not divisible</i>, I believe." But when we see
by the Reason that the ultimate atom, when dissolved, becomes
God's power, all difficulty in the question vanishes.
Having thus answered the above objections, it is unnecessary
to notice the similar ones raised against Boscovich's theory,
which is a modification of that of Newton.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer next examines certain phenomena of motion.
The fact that he seeks for absolute motion by the <i>physical
sense</i>, a faculty which was only given us to perceive relative&mdash;phenomenal&mdash;motion,
and is, <i>in its kind</i>, incapable of finding
the absolute motion, (for if it should see it, it could not
<i>know</i> it,) is sufficient to condemn all that he has said on this
subject. For the presentations which he has made of the
phenomena given us by the Sense does not exhaust the subject.
The perplexities therein developed are all resolvable,
as will appear further on. The phenomena adduced on page
55 are, then, merely <i>appearances</i> in the physical sense; and
the motion is merely relative. In the first instance, the captain
walks East with reference to the ship and globe. In the
second, he walks East with reference to the ship; the ship
sails West with reference to the globe; while the resultant
motion is, that he is <i>stationary</i> with reference to this larger
object. What, then, can the Sense give us? Only resultant
motion, at the most. So we see that "our ideas of
Motion" are not "illusive," but <i>deficient</i>. The motion is
just what it appears, measured from a given object. It is
<i>relative</i>, and this is all the Sense <i>can</i> give. Our author acknowledges
that "we tacitly assume that there are real
motions"; that "we take for granted that there are fixed
points in space, with respect to which all motions are absolute;
and we find it impossible to rid ourselves of this idea."
A question instantly arises, and it seems to be one which he
is bound to entertain, viz: How comes this idea to be? We<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
press this question upon Mr. Spencer, being persuaded that
he will find it much more perplexing than those he has entertained.
Undoubtedly, "absolute motion cannot even be
imagined." <i>No</i> motion can be imagined, though the moving
body may be. But by no means does it follow, "much less
known." This involves that the knowing faculty is inferior
to, and more circumscribed than, the imagining faculty, when
the very opposite is the fact. Neither does it follow from
what is said in the paragraph beginning with, "For motion
is change of place," that "while we are obliged to think that
there is absolute motion, we find absolute motion incomprehensible."
The Universe is limited and bounded, and is a
sphere. We <i>may</i> assume that the centre of the sphere is at
rest. Instantly absolute motion becomes comprehensible, for
it is motion measured from that point. Surely there can be
no harm in the <i>supposition</i>. The Reason shows us that the
supposition is the truth; and that that centre is the throne
of the eternal God. In this view not only is motion, apart
from the "limitations of space," totally unthinkable, but it is
absolutely impossible. Motion <i>cannot</i> be, except as a formal
body is. Hence, to speak of motion in "unlimited space" is
simply absurd. Formal object <i>cannot</i> be, except as <i>thereby</i> a
limit is established in Space. Hence it is evident that "absolute
motion" is not motion with reference to "unlimited
Space," which would be the same as motion without a moving;
but is motion with reference to that point fixed in
Space, around which all things revolve, but which is itself at
perfect rest.</p>

<p>"Another insuperable difficulty presents itself, when we
contemplate the transfer of Motion." Motion is simply the
moving of a body, and <i>cannot be transferred</i>. The <i>force</i>
which causes the motion is what is transferred. All that can
be said of motion is, that it is, that it increases, that it diminishes,
that it ceases. If the moving body impinges upon
another moving body, and causes it to move, it is not motion
that is transferred, but the force which causes the motion.<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
The motion in the impinging body is diminished, and a new
motion is begun in the body which was at rest. Again it
is asked: "In what respect does a body after impact differ
from itself before impact?" And further on: "The motion
you say has been communicated. But how? What has been
communicated? The striking body has not transferred a
<i>thing</i> to the body struck; and it is equally out of the question
to say that it has transferred an <i>attribute</i>." Observe now
that a somewhat is unquestionably communicated; and the
question is:&mdash;What is it? Query. Does Mr Spencer mean
to comprehend the Universe in "thing" and "attribute"?
He would seem to. If he does, he gives a decision by assertion
without explanation or proof, which involves the very
question at issue, which is, Is the somewhat transferred a
"thing" or an "attribute"; and a decision directly contrary
to the acknowledgment that a somewhat has been communicated?
On the above-named hypothesis his statement
should be as follows: A somewhat has been communicated.
"Thing" and "attribute" comprise all the Universe. Neither
a thing, nor an attribute has been communicated, <i>i. e.</i> no
somewhat has been communicated; which contradicts the
evidence and the acknowledgment. If on the other hand Mr.
Spencer means that "thing" and "attribute" comprise only
a part of the Universe, then the question is not fairly met.
It may be more convenient for the moment to conclude the
Universe in the two terms thing and attribute; and then, as
attribute is essential to the object it qualifies, and so cannot
be communicated, it will follow that a thing has been communicated.
This thing we call force. It is not in hand now
to inquire what force is. It is manifest to the Sense that the
body is in a different state after impact, than it was before.
Something has been put into the body, which, though not
directly appreciable to the Sense, is indirectly appreciable by
the results, and which is as real an addition as water is to a
bowl, when poured in. Before the impact the body was
destitute of that kind of force&mdash;motor force would be a convenient<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
term&mdash;which tended to move it. After the impact
a sufficiency of that force was present to produce the motion.
It may be asked, where does this force go to when the motion
diminishes till the body stops. It passes into the substances
which cause the diminution until there is no surplus in the
moving body, and at the point of equilibrium motion ceases.
If it be now asked, where does this force ultimately go to, it
is to be said that it comes from God, and goes to God, who
is the Final. The Sense gives only subordinate answers, but
the Reason leads us to the Supreme.</p>

<p>If the view adopted be true, Mr. Spencer's halving and
halving again "the rate of movement forever," is irrelevant.
It is not a <i>mental operation</i> but an <i>actual fact</i> which is to be
accounted for. Take a striking illustration. A ball lying on
smooth ice is struck with a hockey. Away it goes skimming
over the glassy surface with a steadily diminishing velocity
till it ceases. It starts, it proceeds, it stops. These are
the facts; and the mental operation must accord with them.
There is put into the ball, at the instant of contact, a certain
amount of motor force. From that instant onward, that force
flows out of the ball into the resisting substances by which
it is surrounded, until none is left. And it is just as pertinent
to ask how all the water can flow out of a pail, as how all the
motor force can flow out of a moving substance. "The
smallest movement is separated" by no more of "an impassable
gap from no movement," <i>than it is from a larger movement
above it</i>. That which will account for a movement four
becoming two, will account for a movement two becoming
zero. The "puzzle," then, may be explained thus. Time is
the procession of events. Let it be represented by a line.
Take a point in that line, which will then mark its division
but represent <i>no period</i>. On one side of that point is rest;
on the other motion. That point is the point of contact, and
occupies no period. At this point the motion is maximum.
The force instantly begins to flow off, and continues in a
steady stream until none is left, and the body is again at rest.<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
Here, also, we take a point. This is the point of zero. It
again divides the line. Before the bisection is motion; after
the bisection is rest. All this cannot be perceived by the
Sense, nor conceived by the Understanding. It is seen by
the Reason. Now observe the actual phenomenon. The
ball starts, proceeds, stops. From maximum to zero there is
a steady diminution, or nearly enough so for the experiment;
at least the diminution can be averaged for the illustration.
Then comparing motion with time, the same difficulty falls
upon the one as the other. If the motion is halved, the time
must be; and so, "mentally," it is impossible to imagine how
a moment of time can pass. To the halving faculty&mdash;the
Sense&mdash;this is true, and so we are compelled to correct our
course of procedure. This it is. The Sense and Understanding
being impotent to discover an absolute unit of any
kind, the Sense <i>assumes</i> for itself what meets all practical
want&mdash;a standard unit, by which it measures parts in Space
and Time. So motion must be measured by some assumed
standard; and as, like time,&mdash;duration,&mdash;it can be represented
by a line, let them have a common standard. Suppose,
then, that the ball's flight occupies ten minutes of time.
The line from m to z will be divided into ten exactly equal
spaces; and it will be no more difficult to account for the
flow of force from 10 to 9, than from 1 to 0. Also let it be
observed that the force, like time, is a unit, which the Sense,
for its convenience, divides into parts; but that neither those
parts, nor any parts, have any real existence. As Time is
an indivisible whole, measured off for convenience, so any
given force is such a whole, and is so measured off. All this
appearing and measuring are phenomenal in the Sense. It
is the Reason which sees that they can be <i>only</i> phenomenal,
and that behind the appearance is pure Spirit&mdash;God, who
is primarily out of all relation.</p>

<p>On page 58, near the close of his illustration of the chair,
Mr. Spencer says: "It suffices to remark that since the force
as known to us is an affection of consciousness, we cannot<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
conceive the force as existing in the chair under the same
form without endowing the chair with consciousness." This
very strange assertion can only be true, provided a major
premiss, No force can be conceived to exist without involving
an affection of consciousness in the object in which
it <i>apparently</i> inheres, is true. Such a premiss seems worse
than absurd; it seems silly. We cannot learn that force
exists, without our consciousness is affected thereby; but this
is a very different thing from our being unable to conceive
of a force as <i>existing</i>, without there is a consciousness in the
object through which it <i>appears</i>. If Mr. Spencer had said
that no force can be, without being exerted, and no force
can be exerted, without an affection of the consciousness of
the exertor, he would have uttered the truth. We would
then have the following result. Primarily all force is exerted
by the Deity; and he is conscious thereof. He draws the
chair down just as really as though the hand were visible.
Secondarily spiritual persons are endowed by their Creator
with the ability to exert his force for their uses, and so I lift
the chair. The great error, which appears on every page of
Mr. Spencer's book and invalidates all his conclusions, shows
itself fully here. He presents images from the Sense, and
then tries to satisfy the Reason&mdash;the faculty which calls for
an absolute account&mdash;by the analyses of that Sense. His
attempt to "halve the rate," his remark that "the smallest
movement is separated by an impassable gap from no movement,"
and many such, are only pertinent to the Sense, can
never be explained by the Sense, and are found by the
Reason to need, and be capable of, no such kind of explanation
as the Sense attempts; but that the phenomena
are appearances in <i>wholes</i>, whose partitions cannot be absolute,
and that these wholes are accounted for by the being
of an absolute and infinite Person&mdash;God, who is utterly
impalpable to the Sense, and can be known only by the
Reason.</p>

<p>The improper use of the Sense mentioned above, is, if possible,<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
more emphatically exemplified in the remarks upon
"the connection between Force and Matter." "Our ultimate
test of Matter is the ability to resist." This is true to the
Sense, but no farther. "Resist" what? Other matter, of
course. Thus is the sensuousness made manifest. In the
Sense, then, we have a material object. But Force is not
object to the Sense directly, but only indirectly by its effects
through Matter. The Sense, in its percept, deems the force
other than the matter. Hence it is really no more difficult
for the Sense to answer the question, How could the Sun
send a force through 95,000,000 of miles of void to the Earth
and hold it, than through solid rock that distance? All that
the Sense <i>can do</i> is to present the phenomena. It is utterly
impotent to account for the least of them.</p>

<p>In the following passage, on page 61, Mr. Spencer seems
to have been unaccountably led astray. He says: "Let the
atoms be twice as far apart, and their attractions and repulsions
will both be reduced to one fourth of their present
amounts. Let them be brought within half the distance, and
then attractions and repulsions will both be quadrupled.
Whence it follows that this matter will as readily as not
assume any other density; and can offer no resistance to any
external agents." Now if this be true, there can be no "external
agents" to which to offer any "resistance." It is
simply to assert that all force neutralizes itself; and that
matter is impossible. But the conclusion does not "follow."
It is evidently based on the supposition that the "attractions
and repulsions" are <i>contra</i>-acting forces which exactly balance
each other, and so the molecules are held in their position by
<i>no</i> force. Instead of this, they are <i>co</i>-acting forces, which
are wholly expended in holding the molecules in their places.
The repulsions, then, are expended in resisting pressure from
without which seeks to crowd the particles in upon themselves
and thus disturb their equilibrium; while the attractions
are expended in holding the particles down to their
natural distance from each other when any disturbing force<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
attempts to separate them. Hence, referring to the two
cases mentioned, in the first instance the power of resistance
is reduced to one fourth, and this corresponds with the fact;
and in the second instance the power of resistance is increased
fourfold, and this corresponds with the fact.</p>

<p>We thus arrive at the end of Mr. Spencer's remarks concerning
the material Universe and of our strictures thereon.
Perhaps the reader's mind cannot better be satisfied as to the
validity of these strictures than by presenting an outline of
the system furnished by the Reason, and upon which they are
based.</p>

<p>The Reason gives, by a direct and immediate intuition,
and as a necessary <i>a priori</i> idea, God. This is a <i>spontaneous</i>,
synthetical act, precisely the same in kind with that which
gives a simple <i>a priori</i> principle, as idea. In it the Reason
intuits, not a single principle seen to be necessary simply, but
the fact that all possible principles <i>must</i> be combined in a
perfectly harmonious unity, in a single Being, who thereby
possesses all possible endowments; and so is utterly independent,
and is seen to be the absolute and infinite Person,
the perfect Spirit. This act is no conclusion of the One from
the many in a synthetical judgment, but is entirely different.
It is the necessary seeing of the many in the One; and so is
not a judgment but an intuition, not a guess but a certainty.
God, then, is known, when known at all, not "by plurality,
difference, and relation," but by an <i>immediate</i> insight into his
unity, and so is directly known as he is. And the whole
Universe is, that creatures might be, to whom this revelation
was possible. Among the other necessary endowments which
this intuition reveals, is that of immanent power commensurate
with his dignity, and adequate to realize in actual creatures
the necessary <i>a priori</i> ideas, which he also possesses as endowments.
Power is, then, a simple idea, incapable of
analysis; and which cannot therefore be defined, except by
synonymous terms; and to which President Hopkins's remark
upon moral obligation is equally pertinent; viz: "that we<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
can only state the occasion on which it arises." From these
data the <i>a priori</i> idea of the Universe may be developed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>God, the absolute and infinite Person, possesses, as inherent
endowment forever immanent in himself, Universal Genius;
which is at once capacity and faculty, in which he sees, and
by which he sees, all possible ideas, and these in all possible
combinations or ideals. Thus has he all possible knowledge.
From the various ideal systems which thus are, he, having
perfect wisdom, and according his choice to the behest of his
own worth, selects that one which is thus seen to be best;
and thereby determines the forms and laws under which the
Universe shall become. He also possesses, as inherent endowment,
all power; <i>i. e.</i> the ability to realize every one of
his ideals; but <i>not</i> the ability to violate the natural laws of
his being, as to make two and two five. The ideal system
is only ideal: the power is simply power; and so long as
the two remain isolated, no-thing will be. Therefore, in
order to the realization of his ideal, it must be combined with
the power; <i>i. e.</i>, the power must be organized according to
the ideal. How, then, can the power, having been sent forth
from God, be organized? Thus. If the power goes forth in
its simplicity, it will be expended uselessly, because there is
no substance upon which it may be exercised. It follows,
then, that, if exercised at all, it must be exercised upon <i>itself</i>.
When, therefore, God would create the Universe, he sent
forth two "pencils," or columns of power, of equal and sufficient
volume, which, acting upon each other from opposite
directions, just held each other in balance, and thus force was.
These two "pencils," thus balancing each other, would result
in a sphere of "space-filling force." The point of contact
would determine the first place in Space, and the first point
in Time; from which, if attainable, an absolute measure of
each could be made. All we have now attained is the single
duality "space-filling force," which is wholly homogeneous,
is of sufficient volume to constitute the Universe, and yet by<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
no means <i>is</i> the Universe. There is only Chaos, "without
form and void, and darkness" is "upon the face of the deep."
Now must "the Spirit of God move upon the face of the
waters"; then through vast and to us immeasurable periods
of time, through cycle and epicycle, the work of organization
will go on. Ever moving under forms laid down in the
<i>a priori</i> ideal, God's power turns upon itself, as out of the
crush of elemental chaos the Universe is being evolved.
During this process, whatever of the force is to act under the
law of heat in the <i>a priori</i> ideal, assumes that form and the
heat force becomes; whatever is to act under the law of
magnetism, assumes that form, and magnetic force becomes;
so of light, and the various forms of matter. At length, in
the revolution of the cycles, the Universe attains that degree
of preparation which fits it for living things to be, and the
life force is organized; and by degrees all its various forms
are brought forth. After another vast period that point is
reached when an animal may be organized, which shall be
the dwelling-place for a time of a being whose life is utterly
different in kind from any animal life, and man appears.
Now in all these vast processes, be it observed that God is
personally present, that the first energy was his, and that
every subsequent energizing act is his special and personal
act. He organized the duality, force. He then organized
this force into heat-force, light-force, magnetic-force,
matter-force, life-force, and soul-force. And so it is that his
personal supervision and energy is actually present in every
atom of the Universe. When we turn from this process of
thought to the sensible facts, and speak of granite, sandstone,
schist, clay, herbage, animals, yes, of the thousand kinds of
substance which appear to the eye, it is to be remembered
that all these are but <i>forms to the Sense</i> of that "reason-conception,"
force,&mdash;that primal duality, which power acting
upon itself becomes. Now as the machine can never carve
any other image than those for which it is specially constructed,
and must work just as it is made to work, so the<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
Sense, which is purely mechanical, can never do any other
than the work for which it was made, can never transcend the
laws of its organization. It can only give forms&mdash;results,
but is impotent to go behind them. It can only say <i>that
things are</i>, but never say <i>what</i> or <i>why</i> they are.</p>

<p>Seen in the light of the theory which has thus been presented,
Mr. Spencer's difficulties vanish. Matter is force.
Motion is matter affected by another form of force. The
"puzzle" of motion and rest is only phenomenal to the Sense;
it is an appearance of force acting through another force. It
may also be said that the Universe is solid force. There is
no void in it. There is no nook, no crevice or cranny, that
is not full of force. To seek, then, for some medium through
which force may traverse vast distances, is the perfection of
superfluity. From centre to circumference it is present, and
controls all things, and is all things. So it is no more difficult
to see how force reaches forth and holds worlds in their
place, than how it draws down the pebble which a boy has
thrown into the air. It is no substance which must travel
over the distance, it is rather an inflexible rod which swings
the worlds round in their orbits. Whether, then, we look at
calcined crags or lilies of the valley, whether astronomy, or
geology, or chemistry be our study, the objects grouped under
those sciences will be found to be equally the results of this
one force, acting under different laws, and taking upon itself
different forms, and becoming different objects.</p>

<p>That faculty and that line of thought, which have given so
readily the solution of the difficulties brought to view by Mr.
Spencer's examination of the outer world, will afford us an
easier solution, if possible, of the difficulties which he has
raised respecting the inner world. That which is not of us,
but is far from us, may perchance be imperfectly known; but
ourselves, what we are, and the laws of our being, may be
certainly and accurately known. And this is the highest
knowledge. It may be important, as an element of culture,
that we become acquainted with many facts respecting the<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
outer world. It cannot but be of the utmost importance, that
we know ourselves; for thus only can we fulfil the behest of
that likeness to God, in which we were originally created.
We seek for, we may obtain, we <i>have obtained</i> knowledge in
the inner world,&mdash;a knowledge sure, steadfast, immutable.</p>

<p>It seems to be more than a mere verbal criticism, rather a
fundamental one, that it is not "our states of consciousness"
which "occur in succession"; but that the modifications in
our consciousness so occur. Consciousness is <i>one</i>, and retains
that oneness throughout all modifications. These occur in
the unity, as items of experience affect it. Is this series of
modifications "of consciousness infinite or finite"? To this
question experience <i>can</i> give no answer. All experiments
are irrelevant; because these can only be after the faculty
of consciousness is. They can go no further back than the
<i>forms</i> of the activity. These they may find, but they cannot
account for. A law lies on all those powers by which an
experiment may be made, which forever estops them from
attaining to the substance of the power which lies back of the
form. The eye cannot examine itself. The Sense, as mental
capacity for the reception of impressions, cannot analyze its
constituents. The Understanding, as connective faculty concluding
in judgments, is impotent to discover why it must
judge one way and not another. It is only when we ascend
to the Reason that we reach the region of true knowledge.
Here, overlooking, analyzing all the conduct of the lower
powers, and holding the self right in the full blaze of the Eye
of self, Man attains a true and fundamental <i>self-knowledge</i>.
From this Mount of Vision we know that infinity and finiteness
have no pertinence to modifications of consciousness, or
in fact to any series. We attain to the further knowledge
that this series is, <i>must be</i>, limited; because the constituted
beings, in whom it in each case inheres, are limited, and had
a beginning. It matters not now to inquire how a self-conscious
person could be created. It is sufficient to know that
one has been created. This fact involves the further fact<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
that consciousness, as an actuality, began in the order of
nature, after the being to whom it belongs as endowment, or,
in other words, an organization must be, before the modifications
which inhere in that organization can become. The
attainment of this as necessary law is far more satisfactory
than any experience could be, were it possible; for we can
never know but that an experience may be modified; but a
law given in the intuition is immutable. The fact, ascertained
many pages back, that the subject and the object are identical
under the final examination of the Reason, enables us to
attain the present end of the chain. The question is one of
fact, and is purely psychological. It cannot be passed upon,
or in any way interfered with, by logical processes. It is
only by examination, by seeing, that the truth can be known.
Faraday ridiculed as preposterous the pretension that a vessel
propelled by steam could cross the ocean, and demonstrated,
to his entire satisfaction, the impossibility of the event. Yet
the Savannah crossed, and laughed at him. Just so here, all
arguing is folly. The question is one of fact in experience.
And upon it the soul gives undoubted answer, as we have
stated. Nor is it so difficult, as some would have us believe,
to see how this may be. Consciousness is an indivisible unity,
and, as we have before seen, may best be defined as the light
in which the person intuits his own acts and activities. This
unity is abiding, and is ground for the modifications. It is,
then, <i>now</i>, and the person now knows what the present
modification <i>is</i>. The person does not need to look to memory
and learn what the former modification was. It immediately
knows what the modification <i>is</i> now. Thus a simple attainment
of the psychological truth through a careful examination
dispels as a morning mist the whole cloud of Mr. Spencer's
difficulties. Well might President Hopkins say, "The only
question is, what is it that consciousness gives? If we say
that it does thus give both the subject and the object, that
simple affirmation sweeps away in a moment the whole basis
of the ideal and skeptical philosophy. It becomes as the spear<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
of Ithuriel, and its simple touch will change what seemed
whole continents of solid speculation into mere banks of
German fog." We have learned, then, that it is not possible,
or necessary, either to "perceive" or "conceive" the terminations
of consciousness, because this involves the discovery,
by <i>mechanical</i> faculties, of their own being and state
before they became activities on the one hand, which is a
contradiction, and on the other an utter transcending of the
sphere of their capability, the attempt to do which would be
a greater folly than would be that of the hand to see Jupiter.
But we have intuited the law, which declares the necessity of
a beginning for us and all creatures; and we ever live in the
light of the present end. When, then, Mr. Spencer says that
"Consciousness implies perpetual change and the perpetual
establishment of relations between its successive phases," we
know that he has uttered a fundamental psychological error,
in fact, that almost the opposite is the truth. Consciousness
is the permanent, the abiding, the changeless. It is the light
of the personal Eye. Into it all changes come; but they are
only <i>incidental</i>. In the finite and partial person, they come,
because such person <i>must grow</i>; and so, because of his partiality
and incompleteness, they become necessary incidents;
but let there be a Person having all knowledge, who therefore
cannot learn, having all perfection, who therefore cannot
change, and it is plain that these facts in no way interfere
with his consciousness. All variety is immanent in its light,
and no change can come into it because <i>there is no change to
come</i>; but this Person sees <i>all</i> his endowments <i>at once</i>, in the
unity of this his light, just as we see <i>some</i> of our endowments
in the unity of this our light. The change is not in the
consciousness, but in the objects which come into it. This
view also disposes of the theory that "any mental affection
must be known as like these foregoing ones or unlike those";
that, "if it is not thought of in connection with others&mdash;not
distinguished or identified by comparison with others, it is not
recognized&mdash;is not a state of consciousness at all." Such<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
comparison we have found only incidental in consciousness,
pertaining to things in the Sense and Understanding and not
essential. Thus does a true psychology dissipate all these
difficulties as a true cosmology explained the perplexities
"of Motion and Rest."</p>

<p>Take another step and we can answer the question "What
is this that thinks?" It is a spiritual person. What, then,
is a spiritual person? A substance&mdash;a kind of force&mdash;the
nature of which we need inquire about no further than to
know that it is suitable to the use which is made of it, which
is organized, according to a set of constituting laws, into such
spiritual person. The substance without the laws would be
simple substance, and nothing more. The laws without the
substance would be only laws, and could give no being having
no ground in which to inhere. But the substance as ground
and the complete set of laws as inhering in the ground, and
being its organization when combined, become a spiritual
person who thinks. The <i>ego</i>, that is the sense of personality,
is only one of the forms of activity of this being, and therefore
cannot be said to think. The pages now before us are all
vitiated by the theory that "successive impressions and
ideas constitute consciousness." Once attain to the true
psychology of the person, and learn that consciousness is as
stated above,&mdash;an abiding light into which modifications come,&mdash;and
there arises no difficulty in believing in the reality of
self, and in entirely justifying that belief by Reason. Yea,
more, from such a standpoint it is utter unreason, the height
of folly, to doubt for an instant, for immanent and central
in the light of Reason lies the solemn fact of man's selfhood.
We arrive, then, directly at Mr. Spencer's conclusion, that
"Clearly, a true cognition of self implies a state in which
the knowing and the known are one&mdash;in which subject and
object are identified," and we <i>know</i> that such a state is an
actuality. Mr. Mansel may hold that such an assertion is
the annihilation of both, but he is wholly wrong. The Savannah
has crossed the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>We attain, then, exactly the opposite result from Mr.
Spencer. We have seen that "Ultimate Scientific Ideas
are all" presentative "of realities" which can "be comprehended."
We have, indeed, found it to be true, that, "after
no matter how great a progress in the colligation of facts and
the establishment of generalizations ever wider and wider,&mdash;after
the merging of limited and derivative truths in truths
that are larger and deeper, has been carried no matter how
far,&mdash;the fundamental truth remains as much beyond reach
as ever." But having learned this, we do not arrive at the
conclusion that "the explanation of that which is explicable
does but bring out into greater clearness the inexplicableness
of that which remains behind." On the other hand we know
that such a conclusion is erroneous, and <i>that the method by
which it is reached is a false method, and utterly irrelevant to
the object sought</i>. Could this lesson but be thoroughly learned,
Mr. Spencer's work, and our work, would not have been in
vain. Only by a method differing from this <span class="smcap">in kind</span>&mdash;a
method in which there is no "colligation of facts," and no
"generalizations" concluded therefrom, but a simple, direct
insight into Pure Truth&mdash;can "the fundamental truth" be
known; and thus it may be known by every human soul.
"<i>God made man in his own image.</i>" In our scheme there
is ample room for the man of Science, with the eye of Sense,
to run through the Universe, and gather facts. With telescope
and microscope, he may pursue them, and capture
innumerable multitudes of them. But having done this, we
count it folly to attempt to generalize truth therefrom. But
holding up the facts in the clear light of Reason, and searching
them through and through, we <i>see</i> in them the immutable
principle, known by a spontaneous, immediate, intuitive knowledge
to be immutable, and thus we "<i>know the truth</i>."</p>

<h2 id="THE_RELATIVITY_OF_ALL_KNOWLEDGE">"THE RELATIVITY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE."</h2>

<p>In the opening of this chapter, Mr. Spencer states the
result, which, in his opinion, philosophy has attained as
follows: "All possible conceptions have been one by one
tried and found wanting; and so the entire field of speculation
has been gradually exhausted without positive result;
the only result arrived at being the negative one above stated&mdash;that
the reality existing behind all appearances is, and
must ever be, unknown." He then sets down a considerable
list of names of philosophers, who are claimed by Sir William
Hamilton as supporters of that position. Such a parade of
names may be grateful to the feelings of the Limitists, but
it is no support to their cause. The questions at issue are of
such a nature that no array of dignities, of learning, of profound
<i>opinions</i>, can have a feather's weight in the decision.
For instance, take Problem XLVII, of the first book of
Euclid. What weight have human opinion with reference
to its validity? Though a thousand mathematicians should
deny its truth, it would be just as convincing as now; and when
a thousand mathematicians assert its truth, they add no item to
the vividness of the conviction. The school-boy, who never
heard of one of them, when he first reads it, knows it must be
so, and that this is an inevitable necessity, beyond the possibility
of any power or will to change. On principles simple,
fixed, and final, just like those of mathematics, seen by the
same Eye and known with the same intellectual certainty,
and by logical processes just as pure, conclusive, <i>demonstrative</i>
as those of geometry, <i>and by such alone</i>, can the questions
now before us be settled. But though names and opinions
have no weight in the final decision, though a demonstration is
demanded and must be given, still it is interesting to note the
absence of two names, representatives of a class, which
must ever awaken, among the devout and pure-hearted, attention<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
and love, and whose teachings, however unnoticed
by Mr. Spencer, are a leaven working in the minds and hearts
of men, which develop with continually increasing distinctness
the solemn and sublime truth, that the human mind is
capable of absolute knowledge. Plato, with serious, yea, sad
countenance, the butt of jeer and scoff from the wits and
comedians of his day, went about teaching those who hung
upon his lips, that in every human soul were Ideas which
God had implanted, and which were final truth. And Jesus
Christ, with a countenance more beautifully serious, more
sweetly sad, said to those Jews which believed on him, "If
ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
<i>and ye shall know the truth</i>, and the truth shall make you
free." It may seem to men who grope about in the dismal
cavern of the animal nature&mdash;the Sense and Understanding&mdash;wise
to refuse the light, and reject the truths of the
Pure Reason and the God-man, and to call the motley
conglomeration of facts which they gather, but cannot explain,
philosophy; but no soul which craves "the Higher Life"
will, can be satisfied with such attainments. It yearns for, it
cries after, yea, with ceaseless iteration it urges its supplication
for the highest truth; and it shall attain to it, because
God, in giving the tongue to cry, gave also the Eye to see.
The Spiritual person in man, made in the very image of God,
can never be satisfied till, stripped of the weight of the
animal nature, it sees with its own Eye the Pure Reason,
God as the Highest Truth. And to bring it by culture, by
every possible manifestation of his wondrous nature, up to
this high Mount of Vision, is one object of God in his system
of the Universe.</p>

<p>The teaching of the Word&mdash;that august personage, "who
came forth from God, and went to God," has been alluded to
above. It deserves more than an allusion, more than any
notice which can be given it here. It is astonishing, though
perhaps not wholly unaccountable, that the writings of the<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
apostles John and Paul have received so little attention from
the metaphysicians of the world, as declarations of metaphysical
truths. Even the most devout students of them do
not seem to have appreciated their inestimable value in this
regard. The reason for this undoubtedly is, that their transcendent
importance as declarations of religious truth has
shone with such dazzling effulgence upon the eyes of those
who have loved them, that the lesser, but harmoniously combining
beams of a true spiritual philosophy have been unnoticed
in the glory of the nobler light. It will not, therefore,
we trust, be deemed irreverent to say that, laying aside
all questions of the Divinity of Christ, or of the inspiration
of the Bible, and considering the writings of John and Paul
merely as human productions, written at some time nobody
knows when, and by some men nobody knows who, they are
the most wonderful revelations, the profoundest metaphysical
treatises the world has ever seen. In them the highest
truths, those most difficult of attainment by processes of reflection,
are stated in simple, clear language, and <i>they answer
exactly to the teachings of the Reason</i>. Upon this, President
Hopkins says: "The identity which we found in the last
lecture between the teaching of the constitution of man and
the law of God, was not sought. The result was reached
because the analysis would go there. I was myself surprised
at the exactness of the coincidence." Nor is this coincidence
to be observed simply in the statement of the moral law. In
all questions pertaining to man's nature and state, the two
will be found in exact accord. No law is affirmed by either,
but is accorded to by the other. In fine, whoever wrote the
Book must have had an accurate and exhaustive knowledge
of Man, about whom he wrote. Without any reference then
to their religious bearings, but simply as expositions of metaphysical
truths, the writings of the two authors named deserve
our most careful attention. What we seek for are laws,
final, fixed laws, which are seen by a direct intuition to be<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
such; and these writings are of great value, because they
cultivate and assist the Reason in its search for these highest
Truths.</p>

<p>One need have no hesitation, then, in rejecting the authority
of Mr. Spencer's names, aye, even if they were a thousand
more. We seek for, and can obtain, that which he cannot
give us&mdash;a demonstration; which he cannot give us because
he denies the very existence of that faculty by which alone
a demonstration is possible. As his empiricism is worthless,
so is his rationality. No "deduction" from any "<i>product</i> of
thought, or process of thought," is in any way applicable to
the question in hand. Intuitions are the mental actions
needed. Light is neither product nor process. We pass
over, then, his whole illustration of the partridge. It proves
nothing. He leads us through an interminable series of
questions to no goal; and says there is none. He gives the
soul a stone, when it cries for bread. One sentence of his is
doubtless true. "Manifestly, as the <i>most</i> general cognition
at which we arrive cannot be reduced to a more general one,
it cannot be understood." Of course not. When the Understanding
has attained to the last generalization <i>by these very
terms</i>, it cannot go any farther. But by no means does his
conclusion follow, that "Of necessity, therefore, explanation
must eventually bring us down to the inexplicable. The
deepest truth which we can get at must be unaccountable.
Comprehension must become something other than comprehension,
before the ultimate fact can be comprehended."
How shall we account for the last generalization, and show
this conclusion to be false? Thus. Hitherto there have
been, properly speaking, no comprehensions, only perceptions
in the Sense and connections in the Understanding. "The
sense <i>distinguishes</i> quality and <i>conjoins</i> quantity; the understanding
<i>connects</i> phenomena; the reason <i>comprehends</i> the
whole operation of both." The Reason, then, overseeing the
operations of the lower faculties, and possessing within itself<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
the <i>a priori</i> laws in accordance with which they are, <i>sees</i> directly
and immediately why they are, and thus comprehends
and accounts for them. It sees that there is an end to every
process of generalization; and it then sees, what the Understanding
could never guess, that <i>after</i>&mdash;in the order of our
procedure&mdash;the last generalization there is an eternal truth,
in accordance with which process and conclusion were and
must be. There remains, then, no inexplicable, for the final
truth is seen and known in its very self.</p>

<p>The passages quoted at this point from Hamilton and
Mansel have been heretofore examined, and need no further
notice. We will pass on then to his subsequent reflections
upon them. It is worthy of remark, as a general criticism
upon these comments, that there is scarcely one, if there is a
single expression in the remainder of this chapter, which does
not refer to the animal nature and its functions. The illustrations
are from the material world, and the terms and expressions
are suited thereto. With reference to objects in
the Sense, and connections in the Understanding, the "fundamental
condition of thought," which Mr. Spencer supplies,
is unquestionably valuable. There is "likeness" as well as
"relation, plurality, and difference." But observe that both
these laws alike are pertinent only to the Sense and Understanding,
that they belong to <i>things in nature</i>, and consequently
have no pertinence to the questions now before us.
We are discussing <i>ideas</i>, not <i>things</i>; and those are simple,
and can only be seen, while these are complex, and may be
perceived, distinguished, and conceived. If any one shall
doubt that Mr. Spencer is wholly occupied with things in
nature, it would seem that after having read p. 80, he could
doubt no longer. "Animals," "species or genus," "mammals,
birds, reptiles, or fishes," are objects by which he illustrates
his subject. And one is forced to exclaim, "How can
he speak of such things when they have nothing to do with
the matter in hand? What have God and infinity and absoluteness
to do with 'mammals, birds, reptiles, or fishes'?<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
If we can know only these, why speak of those?" It would
seem that the instant they are thus set together and contrasted,
the soul must cry out with an irrepressible cry, "It
is by an utterly different faculty, and in entirely other modes,
that I dwell upon God and the questions concerning him.
These modes of the animal nature, by which I know 'mammals,'
are different in kind from those of the spiritual person,
by which I know God and the eternal truth." And when
this distinction becomes clearly appreciated and fixed in one's
mind, and the query arises, how could a man so confound
the two, and make utter confusion of the subject, as the
Limitists have done, he can hardly refrain from quoting
Romans I. 20 <i>et seq.</i> against them.</p>

<p>Let us observe now Mr. Spencer's corollary. "A cognition
of the Real as distinguished from the Phenomenal must,
if it exists, conform to this law of cognition in general. The
First Cause, the Infinite, the Absolute, to be known at all,
must be classed. To be positively thought of, it must be
thought of as such or such&mdash;as of this or that kind." To
begin with the law which is here asserted, is <i>not</i> a "general"
law, and so does not lie upon all cognition. It is only a special
law, and lies only upon a particular kind of cognition. This
has been already abundantly shown; yet we reproduce one
line of proof. No mathematical law comes under his law of
cognition; neither can he, nor any other Limitist, make it
appear that it does so come. His law is law only for things
in nature, and not for principles. Since then all ideas are
known in themselves&mdash;are <i>self-evident</i>, and since God, infinity,
and absoluteness are ideas, they are known in themselves,
and need not be classed. So his corollary falls to the
ground. Can we have any "sensible experience" of God?
Most certainly not. Yet we can have just as much a sensible
experience of him as of any other person&mdash;of parent, wife,
or child. Did you ever see a person&mdash;a soul? No. Can
you see&mdash;"have sensible experience of"&mdash;a soul? No.
What is it, then, that we have such experience of? Plainly<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
the body&mdash;that material frame through which the soul
manifests itself. The Universe is that material system
through which God manifests himself to those spiritual persons
whom he has made; and that manifestation is the same
in kind as that of a created soul through the body which is
given it. It follows then,&mdash;and not only from this, but it
may be shown by further illustration,&mdash;that every other
person is just as really inscrutable to us as God is; and
further, that, if we can study and comprehend the soul of our
wife or child, we can with equal certainty study, and to some
extent comprehend, the soul of God. Or, in other words, if
man is only an animal nature, having a Sense and Understanding,
all personality is an insoluble mystery; all spiritual
persons are alike utterly inscrutable. And this is so, because,
upon the hypothesis taken, man is destitute of any
faculty which can catch a glimpse of such object. A
Sense and Understanding can no more see, or in any possible
manner take cognizance of, a spiritual person than a man
born blind can see the sun. Again, we say he is destitute of
the faculty. Will Mr. Spencer deny the fact of the idea of
personality? Will he assert that man has no such notion?
Let him once admit that he has, and in that admission is involved
the admission of the reality of that faculty by which
we know God, for the faculty which cognizes personality,
and cognizes God, is one and the same.</p>

<p>Although we do not like certain of Mr. Spencer's terms,
yet, to please him, we will use them. Some conclusions,
then, may be expressed thus: God as the Deity cannot be
"classed"; he is unique. This is involved in the very terms
by which we designate him. Yet we cognize him, but this
is by an immediate intuition, in which we know him as he is
in himself. "We shall see him as he is," says the apostle;
and some foretastes of that transcendent revelation are vouchsafed
us here on earth. But the infinite Person, <i>as person</i>,
must be "assimilated" with other persons. Yet his infinity
and absoluteness, <i>as such</i>, cannot be "grouped." And yet<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
again, <i>as qualities</i>, they can be "grouped" with other qualities.
Unquestionably between the Creator, <i>as such</i>, and the created,
<i>as such</i>, "there must be a distinction transcending any of
the distinctions existing between different divisions of the
created." God as self-existent differs in kind from man
as dependent, and this difference continues irrevocable;
while that same God and that same man are <i>alike</i> in kind
<i>as persons</i>. This is true, because all spiritual persons are
composite beings; and while the essential elements of a
spiritual person are common to created persons and the uncreated
Person, there are <i>other</i> characteristics, <i>not essential</i>
to personality, which belong some to the created, and some
to the uncreated, and differentiate them. Or, in other words,
God as person, and man as person, are alike. Yet they are
diverse in kind, and so diverse in kind that it is out of the
range of possibility for that diversity to be removed. How
can this be explained? Evidently thus. There are <i>qualities</i>
transfusing the personality which cannot be interchangeable,
and which constitute the diversity. Personality is <i>form</i> of
being. Qualities transfuse the form. Absoluteness and infinity
are qualities which belong to one Person, and are such
that they thereby exclude the possibility of their belonging
to any other person; and so they constitute that one to whom
they belong, unique and supreme. Dependence and partiality
are also qualities of a spiritual person, but are qualities of
the created spiritual person, and are such as must always
subordinate that person to the other. In each instance it is,
"<i>in the nature of things</i>," impossible for either to pass over
and become the other. Each is what he is by the terms of
his being, and must stay so.</p>

<p>But from all this it by no means follows that the dependent
spiritual person can have no knowledge of the independent
spiritual Person. On the other hand, it is the high glory of
the independent spiritual Person, that he can create another
being "in his own image," to whom he can communicate a
knowledge of himself. "Like as a father pitieth his children,<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him." Out of the
fact of his Father-hood and our childhood, comes that solemn,
and, to the loving soul, joyful fact, that he teaches us the
highest knowledge just as really as our earthly parents teach
us earthly knowledge. This he could not do if we had not
the capacity to receive the knowledge; and we could not
have had the capacity, except he had been able, in "the
nature of things," and willing to bestow it upon us. While,
then, God as "the Unconditioned cannot be classed," and so
as unconditioned we do not know him "as of such or such
kind," after the manner of the Understanding, yet we may,
do, "see him as he is," do know that he is, and is unconditioned,
through the insight of the Reason, the eye of the
spiritual person, and what it is to be unconditioned.</p>

<p>We now reach a passage which has filled us with unqualified
amazement. As much as we had familiarized ourselves
with the materialistic teachings of the Limitists, we
confess that we were utterly unprepared to meet, even in
Mr. Spencer's writings, a theory of man so ineffably degrading,
and uttered with so calm and na&iuml;ve an unconsciousness
of the degradation it involved, as the following. Although
for want of room his illustrations are omitted, it is believed
that the following extracts give a fair and ample presentation
of his doctrine.</p>

<p>"All vital actions, considered not separately but in their
ensemble, have for their final purpose the balancing of certain
outer processes by certain inner processes.</p>

<p>"There are unceasing external forces, tending to bring the
matter of which organic bodies consist, into that state of
stable equilibrium displayed by inorganic bodies; there are
internal forces by which this tendency is constantly antagonized;
and the perpetual changes which constitute Life
may be regarded as incidental to the maintenance of the
antagonism....</p>

<p>"When we contemplate the lower kinds of life, we see that
the correspondences thus maintained are direct and simple;<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
as in a plant, the vitality of which mainly consists in osmotic
and chemical actions responding to the coexistence of light,
heat, water, and carbonic acid around it. But in animals,
and especially in the higher orders of them, the correspondences
become extremely complex. Materials for growth
and repair not being, like those which plants require, everywhere
present, but being widely dispersed and under special
forms, have to be formed, to be secured, and to be reduced to
a fit state for assimilation....</p>

<p>"What is that process by which food when swallowed is
reduced to a fit form for assimilation, but a set of mechanical
and chemical actions responding to the mechanical and
chemical actions which distinguish the food? Whence it
becomes manifest, that, while Life in its simplest form is the
correspondence of certain inner physico-chemical actions with
certain outer physico-chemical actions, each advance to a
higher form of Life consists in a better preservation of this
primary correspondence by the establishment of other correspondences.
Divesting this conception of all superfluities,
and reducing it to its most abstract shape, we see that Life
is definable as the continuous adjustment of internal relations
to external relations. And when we so define it, we
discover that the physical and the psychial life are equally
comprehended by the definition. We perceive that this,
which we call intelligence, shows itself when the external
relations to which the internal ones are adjusted begin to be
numerous, complex, and remote in time and space; that every
advance in Intelligence essentially consists in the establishment
of more varied, more complete, and more involved adjustments;
and that even the highest achievements of science
are resolvable into mental relations of coexistence and
sequence, so co&ouml;rdinated as exactly to tally with certain relations
of coexistence and sequence that occur externally....</p>

<p>"And lastly let it be noted that what we call <i>truth</i>, guiding
us to successful action and the consequent maintenance
of life, is simply the accurate correspondence of subjective<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
to objective relations; while <i>error</i>, leading to failure and
therefore towards death, is the absence of such accurate correspondence.</p>

<p>"If, then, Life in all its manifestations, inclusive of Intelligence
in its highest forms, consists in the continuous adjustment
of internal relations to external relations, the necessarily
relative character of our knowledge becomes obvious.
The simplest cognition being the establishment of some connection
between subjective states, answering to some connection
between objective agencies; and each successively more
complex cognition being the establishment of some more
involved connection of such states, answering to some more
involved connection of such agencies; it is clear that the
process, no matter how far it be carried, can never bring
within the reach of Intelligence either the states themselves
or the agencies themselves."</p>

<p>Or, to condense Mr. Spencer's whole teaching into a few
plain every-day words, Man is an animal, and only an
animal, differing nowhat from the dog and chimpanzee,
except in the fact that his life "consists in the establishment
of more varied, more complete, and more involved adjustments,"
than the life of said dog and chimpanzee. Mark
particularly the sententious diction of this newly arisen sage.
Forget not one syllable of the profound and most important
knowledge he would impart. "Life in all its manifestations,
inclusive of Intelligence in its highest forms, consists in the
continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations."
See, there is not a limit, not a qualification to the
assertion! Now turn back a page or two, reader, if thou
hast this wonderful philosophy by thee, and gazing, as into
a cage in a menagerie, see the being its author would teach
thee that thou art. From the highest to the lowest forms,
life is one. In its lower forms, life is a set of "direct and
simple" "correspondences." "But in animals, <i>and especially
in the higher orders of them</i>," and, of course, most especially
in the human animal as the highest order, "the correspondences<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
become extremely complex." As much as to
say, reader, you are not exactly a plant, nor are you yet of
quite so low a type as the chimpanzee aforesaid; but the
difference is no serious matter. You do not differ half as
much from the chimpanzee as the chimpanzee does from the
forest he roves in. All the difference there is between you
and him is, that the machinery by which "the continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations" is carried
on, is more "complex" in you than in the chimpanzee.
He roams the forest, inhabits some cave or hollow tree, and
lives on the food which nature spontaneously offers to his
hairy hand. You cut down the forest, construct a house,
and live on the food which some degree of skill has prepared.
He constructs no clothing, nor any covering to shield him from
the inclemency of the weather, but is satisfied with tawny,
shaggy covering, which nature has provided. You on the
contrary are destitute of such a covering, and rob the sheep,
and kill the silk-worm, to supply the lack. But in all this
there is no <i>difference in kind</i>. The mechanism by which
life is sustained in you is more "complex," it is true, than
that by which life is sustained in him; there arise, therefore,
larger needs, and the corresponding "intelligence" to supply
those needs. But sweet thought, cheering thought, oh how
it supports the soul! Your life in its highest form is only
this animal life,&mdash;is only the constructive force by which
that "extremely complex" machinery carries on "the continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations."
All other notions of life are "superfluities."</p>

<p>Reader, in view of the teaching of this new and widely
heralded sage, how many "superfluities" must you and I
strip off from our "conception" of life! And with what
bitter disappointment and deep sadness should we take up
our lamentation for man, and say: How art thou fallen, oh
man! thou noblest denizen of earth; yea, how art thou cast
down to the ground. But a little ago we believed thee a
spiritual being; that thou hadst a nature too noble to rot<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
with the beasts among the clods; that thou wast made fit to
live with angels and thy Creator, God. But a little ago we
believed thee possessed of a psychical life&mdash;a soul; that thou
wouldst live forever beyond the stars; and that this soul's
life was wholly occupied in the consideration of "heavenly
and divine things." A little ago we believed in holiness, and
that thou, consecrating thyself to pure and loving employments,
shouldst become purer and more beautiful, nobler and
more lovely, until perfect love should cast out all fear, and
thou shouldst then see God face to face, and rejoice in the
sunlight of his smiling countenance. But all this is changed
now. Our belief has been found to be a cheat, a bitter
mockery to the soul. We have sat at the feet of the English
sage, and learned how dismally different is our destiny.
Painful is it, oh reader, to listen; and the words of our
teacher sweep like a sirocco over the heart; yet we cannot
choose but hear.</p>

<p>"The pyschical life"&mdash;the life of the soul, "the immortal
spark of fire,"&mdash;and the physical life "are <i>equally</i> definable
as the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external
relations." We had supposed that intelligence in its highest
forms was wholly occupied with the contemplation of God
and his laws, and the great end of being, and all those tremendous
questions which we had thought fitted to occupy the
activities of a spiritual person. We are undeceived now.
We find we have shot towards the pole opposite to the truth.
Now "we perceive that this which we call Intelligence shows
itself when the external relations to which the internal ones
are adjusted begin to be numerous, complex, and remote in
time or space; that <i>every advance in Intelligence essentially
consists in the establishment of more varied, more complete,
and more involved adjustments; and that even the highest
achievements of science</i> are resolvable into mental relations
of coexistence and sequence, so co&ouml;rdinated as <i>exactly to tally</i>
with certain relations of coexistence and sequence that occur
externally." In such relations consists the life of the "caterpillar."<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
In such relations, <i>only a little "more complex,"</i> consists
the life of "the sparrow." Such relations only does
"the fowler" observe; such only does "the chemist" know.
This is the path by which we are led to the last, the highest
"truth" which man can attain. Thus do we learn "that what
we call <i>truth</i>, guiding us to successful action, and the consequent
maintenance of life, is <i>simply</i> the accurate correspondence
of subjective to objective relations; while error, leading
to failure and therefore towards death, is the absence
of such accurate correspondence." What a noble life, oh,
reader, what an exalted destiny thine is here declared to
be! The largest effort of thine intelligence, "the highest
achievement of science," yea, the total object of the life of
thy soul,&mdash;thy "psychial" life,&mdash;is to attain such exceeding
skill in the construction of a shelter, in the fitting of apparel,
in the preparation of food, in a word, in securing "the accurate
correspondence of subjective to objective relations,"
and thus in attaining the "<i>truth</i>" which shall guide "us to
successful action and the consequent maintenance of life,"
that we shall secure forever our animal existence on earth.
Study patiently thy lesson, oh human animal! Con it o'er
and o'er. Who knows but thou mayest yet attain to this
acme of the perfection of thy nature, though it be far below
what thou hadst once fondly expected,&mdash;mayest attain a
perfect knowledge of the "<i>truth</i>," and a perfect skill in the
application of that truth, <i>i. e.</i> in "the continuous adjustment
of internal relations to external relations"; and so be guided
"to successful action, and the consequent maintenance of
life," whereby thou shalt elude forever that merciless hunter
who pursues thee,&mdash;the grim man-stalker, the skeleton Death.
But when bending all thy energies, yea, all the powers of
thy soul, to this task, thou mayest recur at some unfortunate
moment to the dreams and aspirations which have hitherto
lain like golden sunlight on thy pathway. Let no vain regret
for what seemed thy nobler destiny ever sadden thy day,
or deepen the darkness of thy night. True, thou didst deem<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
thyself capable of something higher than "the continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations"; didst
often occupy thyself with contemplating those "things which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard"; didst deem thyself a son
of God, and "a joint-heir with Jesus Christ," "of things incorruptible
and undefiled, and which fade not away, eternal
in the heavens"; didst sometimes seem to see, with faith's
triumphant gaze, those glorious scenes which thou wouldst
traverse when in the spirit-land thou shouldst lead a pure
spiritual life with other spirits, where all earthliness had been
stripped off, all tears had been wiped away, and perfect holiness
was thine through all eternity. But all these visions
were only dreams; they wholly deluded thee. We have
learned from the lips of this latest English sage that thy god
is thy belly, and that thou must mind earthly things, so as
to keep up "the continuous adjustment of internal relations to
external relations." Such being thy lot, and to fulfil such a
lot being "the highest achievement of science," permit not
thyself to be disturbed by those old-fashioned and sometimes
troublesome notions that "<i>truth</i>" and those "achievements"
pertained to a spiritual person in spiritual relations to God as
the moral Governor of the Universe; that man was bound to
know the truth and obey it; that his "errors" were violations
of perfect law,&mdash;the truth he knew,&mdash;were <i>crimes</i> against
Him who is "of too pure eyes to behold iniquity, and cannot
look upon sin with the least degree of allowance"; that for
these crimes there impended a just penalty&mdash;an appalling
punishment; and that the only real "failure" was the failure
to repent of and forsake the crimes, and thus escape the
penalty. Far other is the fact, as thou wilt learn from this
wise man's book. As he teaches us, the only "error" we
can make, is, to miss in maintaining perfectly "the continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations,"&mdash;is
to eat too much roast beef and plum-pudding at dinner, or to
wear too scanty or too thick clothing, or to expose one's self
imprudently in a storm, or by some other carelessness which<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
may produce "the absence of such accurate correspondence"
as shall secure unending life, and so lead to his only "failure"&mdash;the
advance "towards death." When, then, oh reader! by
some unfortunate mischance, some "error" into which thine
ignorance hath led thee, thou hast rendered thy "failure" inevitable,
and art surely descending "towards death," hesitate
not to sing with heedless hilarity the old Epicurean
song, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sing and be gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The livelong day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking no whit of to-morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy while you may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All pleasure and play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after death is no sorrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thou hast committed thine only "error" in not maintaining
"the accurate correspondence"; thou hast fallen upon
thine only "failure," the inevitable advance "towards death."
Than death no greater evil can befall thee, and that is already
sure. Then let "dance and song," and "women and wine,"
bestow some snatches of pleasure upon thy fleeting days.</p>

<p>Delightful philosophy, is it not, reader? Poor unfortunate
man, and especially poor, befooled, cheated, hopeless Christian
man, who has these many years cherished those vain, deceitful
dreams of which we spoke a little ago! To be brought
down from such lofty aspirations; to be made to know that
he is only an animal; that "Life in all its manifestations,
inclusive of Intelligence in its highest forms, consists in the
continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations."
Do you not join with me in pitying him?</p>

<p>And such is the philosophy which is heralded to us from
over the sea as the newly found and wonderful truth, which
is to satisfy the hungering soul of man and still its persistent
cry for bread. And this is the teacher, mocking that painful
cry with such chaff, whom newspaper after newspaper, and
periodical after periodical on this side the water, even to those
we love best and cherish most, have pronounced one of the<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
profoundest essayists of the day. Perhaps he can give us
some sage remarks upon "laughter," as it is observed in the
human animal, and on that point compare therewith other
animals. But, speaking in all sincerity after the manner of
the Book of Common Prayer, we can but say, "From all
such philosophers and philosophies, good Lord deliver us."</p>

<p>Few, perhaps none of our readers, will desire to see a
denial in terms of such a theory. When a man, aspiring to
be a philosopher, advances the doctrine that not only is "Life
in its simplest form"&mdash;the animal life&mdash;"the correspondence
of certain inner physico-chemical actions with certain outer
physico-chemical actions," but that "<i>each advance to a higher
form of Life</i> consists in a better preservation of this primary
correspondence"; and when, proceeding further, and to be
explicit, he asserts that not only "the physical," <i>but also "the
psychical life</i> are <i>equally</i>" but "the continuous adjustment
of internal relations to external relations"; and when, still
further to insult man, and to utter his insult in the most
positive, extreme, and unmistakable terms, he asserts "that
even the highest achievements of science are resolvable into
mental relations of coexistence and sequence, so co&ouml;rdinated
as exactly to tally with certain relations of coexistence and
sequence that occur externally,"&mdash;that is, that the highest
science is the attainment of a perfect cuisine; in a word,
when a human being in this nineteenth century offers to his
fellows as the loftiest attainment of philosophy the tenet that
the highest form of life cognizable by man is an animal life,
and that man can have no other knowledge of himself than as
an animal, of a little higher grade, it is true, than other animals,
but not different in kind, then the healthy soul, when such a
doctrine is presented to it, will reject it as instantaneously as
a healthy stomach rejects a roll of tobacco.</p>

<p>With what a sense of relief does one turn from a system
of philosophy which, when stripped of its garb of well-chosen
words and large sounding, plausible phrases, appears in such
vile shape and hideous proportions, to the teachings of that<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
pure and noble instructor of our youth, that man who, by his
gentle, benignant mien, so beautifully illustrates the spirit
and life of the Apostle John,&mdash;Rev. Mark Hopkins, D. D.,
President of Williams College. No one who has read his
"Lectures on Moral Science," and no lover of truth should
fail to do so, will desire an apology for inserting the following
extract, wherein is presented a theory upon which the soul
of man can rest, as at home the soldier rests, who has just
been released from the Libby or Salisbury charnel-house.</p>

<p>"And here, again, we have three great forces with their
products. These are the vegetable, the animal, and the
rational life.</p>

<p>"Of these, vegetable life is the lowest. Its products are as
strictly conditional for animal life as chemical affinity is for
vegetable, for the animal is nourished by nothing that has
not been previously elaborated by the vegetable. 'The profit
of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the
field.'</p>

<p>"Again, we have the animal and sensitive life, capable of
enjoyment and suffering, and having the instincts necessary
to its preservation. <i>This</i>, as man is now constituted, <i>is conditional
for his rational life</i>. The rational has its roots in
that, and manifests itself only through the organization which
that builds up.</p>

<p>"<i>We have, then, finally and highest of all, this rational and
moral life, by which man is made in the image of God.</i> In
man, as thus constituted, we first find a being who is capable
of choosing his own end, or, rather, of choosing or rejecting
the end indicated by his whole nature. This is moral freedom,
<i>and in this is the precise point of transition from all
that is below to that which is highest</i>. For everything below
man the end is necessitated. Whatever choice there may be
in the agency of animals of means for the attainment of their
end,&mdash;and they have one somewhat wide,&mdash;they have none
in respect to the end itself. This, for our purpose, and for
all purposes, is the characteristic distinction, so long sought,<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
between man and the brute. Man determines his own end;
the end of the brute is necessitated. Up to man everything
is driven to its end by a force working from without or from
behind; but for him the pillar of cloud and of fire puts itself
in front, and he follows it or not, as he chooses.</p>

<p>"In the above cases it will be seen that the process is one
of the addition of new forces, with a constant limitation of
the field within which the forces act.... It is to
be noticed, however, that while the field of each added and
superior force is narrowed, yet nothing is dropped. Each
lower force shoots through, and combines itself with all that
is higher. Because he is rational, man is not the less subject
to gravitation and cohesion and chemical affinity. He has
also the organic life that belongs to the animal. In him none
of these are dropped; <i>but the rational life is united with and
superinduced upon all these</i>, so that man is not only a
microcosm, but is the natural head and ruler of the world.
He partakes of all that is below him, <i>and becomes man by
the addition of something higher</i>.... Here, then, is our
model and law. Have we a lower sensitive and animal
nature? Let that nature be cherished and expanded by all
its innocent and legitimate enjoyments, for it is an end.
But&mdash;and here we find the limit&mdash;let it be cherished <i>only
as subservient to the higher intellectual life</i>, for it is also a
means." The italics are ours.</p>

<p>Satisfactory, true, and self-sustained as is this theory,&mdash;and
it is one which like a granite Gothic spire lifts itself high and
calm into the atmosphere, standing firm and immovable in
its own clear and self-evident truth, unshaken by a thousand
assaulting materialistic storms,&mdash;we would buttress it with
the utterances of other of the earth's noble ones; and this
we do not because it is in any degree needful, but because
our mind loves to linger round the theme, and to gather the
concurrent thought of various rarely endowed minds upon
this subject. Exactly in point is the following&mdash;one of
many passages which might be selected from the works of<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
that profoundest of English metaphysicians and theologians,
S. T. Coleridge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And here let me observe that the difficulty and delicacy
of this investigation are greatly increased by our not considering
the understanding (even our own) in itself, and as
it would be were it not accompanied with and modified by
the co&ouml;peration of the will, the moral feeling, and that faculty,
perhaps best distinguished by the name of Reason, of determining
that which is universal and necessary, of fixing laws
and principles whether speculative or practical, and of contemplating
a final purpose or end. This intelligent will&mdash;having
a self-conscious purpose, under the guidance and light
of the reason, by which its acts are made to bear as a whole
upon some end in and for itself, and to which the understanding
is subservient as an organ or the faculty of selecting and
appropriating the means&mdash;seems best to account for that
progressiveness of the human race, <i>which so evidently marks
an insurmountable distinction and impassable barrier between
man and the inferior animals, but which would be inexplicable,
were there no other difference than in the degree of their intellectual
faculties</i>."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, Vol. I. p. 371. The italics are ours.</p>

<p>The attention of the reader may with profit be also directed
to the words of another metaphysician, who has been much
longer known, and has enjoyed a wider fame than either of
those just mentioned; and whose teachings, however little
weight they may seem to have with Mr. Spencer, have been
these many years, and still are received and studied with
profound respect and loving carefulness by multitudes of
persons. We refer to the apostle Paul, "There is, therefore,
now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit." That is,
who do not walk after the law of the animal nature, but who
do walk after the law of the spiritual person, for it is of this
great psychological distinction that the apostle so fully and
continually speaks. "For they that are after the flesh do
mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
spirit, the things of the spirit. For the minding of the flesh
is death, but the minding of the spirit is life and peace; because
the minding of the flesh as enmity against God, for it
is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
<i>Romans</i> VIII. 1, 5, 6, 7. This I say, then, "Walk in the
spirit and fulfil not the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth
against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these
are contrary the one to the other."&mdash;<i>Galatians</i> V. 16, 17.</p>

<p>Upon these passages it should be remarked, by way of explanation,
that our translators in writing the word spirit with
a capital, and thus intimating that it is the Holy Spirit of
God which is meant, have led their readers astray. The
apostle's repeated use of that term, in contrasting the flesh
with the spirit, appears decisive of the fact that he is contrasting,
in all such passages, the animal nature with the
spiritual person. But if any one is startled by this position
and thinks to reject it, let him bear in mind that the law of
the spiritual person in man and of the Holy Spirit of God is
<i>identical</i>.</p>

<p>The reader will hardly desire from us what his own mind
will have already accomplished&mdash;the construction in our own
terms, and the contrasting of the system above embodied
with that presented by Mr. Spencer. The human being,
Man, is a twofold being, "flesh" and "spirit," an animal
nature and a spiritual person. In the animal nature are the
Sense and the Understanding. In the spiritual person are
the Reason, the spiritual Sensibilities, and the Will. The animal
nature is common to man and the brutes. The spiritual
person is common to man and God. It is manifest, then, that
there is "an insurmountable distinction and impassable barrier"
not only "between man and the inferior animals," but
between man as spiritual person, and man as animal nature,
and that this is a greater distinction than any other in the
Universe, except that which exists between the Creator and
the created. What relation, then, do these so widely diverse
natures bear to each other? Evidently that which President<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
Hopkins has assigned. "Because he is rational, man is not
the less subject to gravitation and cohesion and chemical affinity.
He has also the organic life that belongs to the plant, and
the sensitive and instinctive life that belongs to the animal."
Thus far his life "is the correspondence of certain inner physico-chemical
actions with certain outer physico-chemical actions,"&mdash;undoubtedly
"consists in the continuous adjustment of
internal relations to external relations"; and being the highest
order of animal, his life "consists in the establishment of more
varied, more complete, and more involved adjustments" than
that of any other animal. What, then, is this life for? "This,
as man is now constituted, is <i>conditional for his rational life</i>."
"The rational life is united with and <i>superinduced upon all
these</i>." As God made man, and in the natural order, the
"flesh," the animal life, is wholly subordinate to the "spirit,"
the spiritual life. And the spirit, or spiritual person of which
Paul writes so much,&mdash;does this also, this "Intelligence in its
highest form," consist "in the continuous adjustment of internal
relations to external relations"? Are the words of
the apostle a cheat, a lie, when he says, "For if ye live
after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the spirit"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
by living with the help of the Holy Spirit, in accordance
with the law of the spiritual person&mdash;"do mortify the deeds
of the body, ye shall live?" And are Mr. Spencer's words, in
which he teaches exactly the opposite doctrine, true? wherein
he says: "And lastly let it be noted that what we call truth,"
&amp;c., (see <i>ante</i>, p. 168,) wherein he teaches that "if ye live after
the flesh," if you are guided by "<i>truth</i>," if you are able perfectly
to maintain "the accurate correspondence of subjective
to objective relations," "ye shall not surely die," you will
attain to what is <i>successful action</i>, the preservation of "life,"
of "the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external
relations," of the animal life, and thus your bodies will live
forever&mdash;the highest good for man; but if you "mortify the
deeds of the body," if you pay little heed to "the continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations," you<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
will meet with "<i>error</i>, leading to failure and therefore towards
death,"&mdash;the death of the body, the highest evil which can
befall man,&mdash;and so "ye shall" not "live." Proceeding in
the direction already taken, we find that in his normal condition
the spiritual person would not be chiefly, much less
exclusively, occupied with attending to "the continuous adjustment
of internal relations to external relations," but would
only regard these in so far as is necessary to preserve the
body as the ground through which, in accordance with the
present dispensation of God's providence, that person may
exert himself and employ his energies upon those objects
which belong to his peculiar sphere, even the laws and duties
of spiritual beings. The person would indeed employ his
superior faculties to assist the lower nature in the preservation
of its animal life, but this only as a means. God has ordained
that through this means that person shall develop
and manifest himself; yet the life, continuance in being, of
the soul, is in no way dependent on this means. Strip away
the whole animal nature, take from man his body, his Sense
and Understanding, leave him&mdash;as he would then be&mdash;with
no possible medium of communication with the Universe, and
he, the I am, the spiritual person, would remain intact, as
active as ever. He would have lost none of his capacity to
see laws and appreciate their force; he would feel the <i>bindingness</i>
of obligation just as before; and finally, he would be just
as able as in the earlier state to make a choice of an ultimate
end, though he would be unable to make a single motion
towards putting that choice into effect. The spiritual person,
then, being such that he has in himself no element of decomposition,
has no need, for the preservation of his own existence,
to be continually occupied with efforts to maintain "the accurate
correspondence of subjective to objective relations."
Yet activity is his law, and, moreover, an activity having
objects which accord with this his indestructible nature. With
what then will such a being naturally occupy himself? There
is for him no danger of decay. He possesses within himself<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
the laws and ideals of his action. As such, and created, he
is near of kin to that august Being in whoso image he was
created. His laws are the created person's laws. The end
of the Creator should be that also of the created. But God
is infinite, while the soul starts a babe, an undeveloped germ,
and must begin to learn at the alphabet of knowledge. What
nobler, what more sublime and satisfactory occupation could
this being, endowed with the faculties of a God, find, than to
employ all his power in the contemplation of the eternal laws
of the Universe, <i>i. e.</i> to the acquisition of an intimate acquaintance
with himself and God; and to bend all his energies
to the realization by his own efforts of that part in the
Universe which God had assigned him, <i>i. e.</i>, to accord his
will entirely with God's will. This course of life, a spiritual
person standing in his normal relation to an animal nature,
would pursue as spontaneously as if it were the law of his
being. But this which we have portrayed is not the course
which human beings do pursue. By no means. One great
evil, at least, that "the Fall" brought upon the race of man,
is, that human beings are born into the world with the
spiritual person all submerged by the animal nature; or, to
use Paul's figure, the spirit is enslaved by the flesh; and such
is the extent of this that many, perhaps most, men are born
and grow up and die, and never know that they have any
souls; and finally there arise, as there have arisen through all
the ages, just such philosophers as Sir William Hamilton and
Mr. Spencer, who in substance deny that men are spiritual
persons at all, who say that the highest knowledge is a
generalization in the Understanding, a form of a knowledge
common to man and the brutes, and that "the highest achievements
of science are resolvable into mental relations of coexistence
and sequence, so co&ouml;rdinated as exactly to tally
with certain relations of coexistence and sequence that occur
externally." It is this evil, organic in man, that Paul portrays
so vividly; and it is against men who teach such doctrines
that he thunders his maledictions.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>We have spoken above of the spiritual person as diverse
from, superior to, and superinduced upon, the animal nature.
This is his <i>position</i> in the logical order. We have also spoken
of him as submerged under the animal nature, as enslaved
to the flesh. By such figures do we strive to express the
awfully degraded <i>condition</i> in which every human being is
born into the world. And mark, this is simply a natural
degradation. Let us then, as philosophers, carry our examination
one step farther and ask: In this state of things
what would be the fitting occupation of the spiritual person.
Is it that "continuous adjustment"? He turns from it with
loathing. Already he has served the "flesh" a long and
grievous bondage. Manifestly, then, he should struggle with
all his might to regain his normal condition to become naturally
good as well as morally good,&mdash;he should fill his soul
with thoughts of God, and then he should make every rational
exertion to induce others to follow in his footsteps.</p>

<p>We attain, then, a far different result from Mr. Spencer.
"The highest achievements of science" for us, our "truth,"
guiding us "to successful action," is that pure <i>a priori</i> truth,
the eternal law of God which is written in us, and given to
us for our guidance to what is truly "successful action,"&mdash;the
accordance of our wills with the will of God.</p>

<p>What we now reach, and what yet remains to be considered
of this chapter, is that passage in which Mr. Spencer enounces,
as he believes, a new principle of philosophy, a principle
which will symmetrize and complete the Hamiltonian system,
and thus establish it as the true and final science for mankind.
Since we do not view this principle in the same light
with Mr. Spencer, and especially since it is our intention to
turn it upon what he has heretofore written, and demolish
that with it, there might arise a feeling in many minds that
the whole passage should be quoted, that there might be no
doubt as to his meaning. This we should willingly do, did
our space permit. Yet it seems not in the least necessary.
That part of the passage which contains the gist of the subject,<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
followed by a candid epitome of his arguments and illustrations,
would appear to be ample for a fair and sufficiently
full presentation of his theory, and for a basis upon which
we might safely build our criticism. These then will be
given.</p>

<p>"There still remains the final question&mdash;What must we say
concerning that which transcends knowledge? Are we to
rest wholly in the consciousness of phenomena? Is the result
of inquiry to exclude utterly from our minds everything
but the relative; or must we also believe in something beyond
the relative?</p>

<p>"The answer of pure logic is held to be, that by the limits
of our intelligence we are rigorously confined within the
relative; and that anything transcending the relative can be
thought of only as a pure negation, or as a non-existence.
'The <i>absolute</i> is conceived merely by a negation of conceivability,'
writes Sir William Hamilton. 'The <i>Absolute</i>
and the <i>Infinite</i>,' says Mr. Mansel, 'are thus, like the <i>Inconceivable</i>
and the <i>Imperceptible</i>, names indicating, not an
object of thought or of consciousness at all, but the mere
absence of the conditions under which consciousness is possible.'
From each of which extracts may be deduced the conclusion,
that, since reason cannot warrant us in affirming the
positive existence of what is cognizable only as a negation,
we cannot rationally affirm the positive existence of anything
beyond phenomena.</p>

<p>"Unavoidable as this conclusion seems, it involves, I think,
a grave error. If the premiss be granted, the inference must
doubtless be admitted; but the premiss, in the form presented
by Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Mansel, is not strictly
true. Though, in the foregoing pages, the arguments used
by these writers to show that the Absolute is unknowable,
have been approvingly quoted; and though these arguments
have been enforced by others equally thoroughgoing, yet
there remains to be stated a qualification, which saves us
from that scepticism otherwise necessitated. It is not to be<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
denied that so long as we confine ourselves to the purely
logical aspect of the question, the propositions quoted above
must be accepted in their entirety; but when we contemplate
its more general, or psychological aspect, we find that these
propositions are imperfect statements of the truth; omitting,
or rather excluding, as they do, an all-important fact. To
speak specifically:&mdash;Besides that <i>definite</i> consciousness of
which Logic formulates the laws, there is also an <i>indefinite</i>
consciousness which cannot be formulated. Besides complete
thoughts, and besides the thoughts which, though incomplete,
admit of completion, there are thoughts which it is impossible
to complete, and yet which are still real, in the sense that
they are normal affections of the intellect.</p>

<p>"Observe in the first place, that every one of the arguments
by which the relativity of our knowledge is demonstrated,
distinctly postulates the positive existence of something beyond
the relative. To say that we cannot know the Absolute,
is, by implication, to affirm that there <i>is</i> an Absolute. In
the very denial of our power to learn <i>what</i> the Absolute is,
there lies hidden the assumption <i>that</i> it is; and the making
of this assumption proves that the Absolute has been present
to the mind, not as a nothing but as a something. Similarly
with every step in the reasoning by which this doctrine is
upheld. The Noumenon, everywhere named as the antithesis
of the Phenomenon, is throughout necessarily thought of as
an actuality. It is rigorously impossible to conceive that
our knowledge is a knowledge of Appearances only, without
at the same time conceiving a Reality of which they are
appearances; for appearance without reality is unthinkable."
After carrying on this train of argument a little further, he
reaches this just and decisive result. "Clearly, then, the
very demonstration that a <i>definite</i> consciousness of the Absolute
is impossible to us, unavoidably presupposes an indefinite
consciousness of it." Carrying the argument further,
he says: "Perhaps the best way of showing that, by the
necessary conditions of thought, we are obliged to form a<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
positive though vague consciousness of this which transcends
distinct consciousness, is to analyze our conception of the
antithesis between Relative and Absolute." He follows the
presentation of certain "antinomies of thought" with an extract
from Sir William Hamilton's words, in which the logician
enounces his doctrine that in "correlatives" "the positive
alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other";
or, in other words, the one gives a substance of some kind in
the mind, the other gives simply nothingness, void, absolute
negation. Criticizing this, Mr. Spencer is unquestionably
right in saying: "Now the assertion that of such contradictories
'the negative is <i>only</i> an abstraction of the other'&mdash;'is
<i>nothing else</i> than its negation'&mdash;is not true. In such
correlatives as Equal and Unequal, it is obvious enough that
the negative concept contains something besides the negation
of the positive one; for the things of which equality is denied
are not abolished from consciousness by the denial. And the
fact overlooked by Sir William Hamilton is, that the like
holds, even with those correlatives of which the negative is inconceivable,
in the strict sense of the word." Proceeding with
his argument, he establishes, by ample illustration, the fact
that a "something constitutes our consciousness of the Non-relative
or Absolute." He afterwards shows plainly by quotations,
"that both Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Mansel
do," in certain places, "distinctly imply that our consciousness
of the Absolute, indefinite though it is, is positive not
negative." Further on he argues thus: "Though Philosophy
condemns successively each attempted conception of the Absolute;
though it proves to us that the Absolute is not this,
nor that, nor that; though in obedience to it we negative,
one after another, each idea as it arises; yet as we cannot
expel the entire contents of consciousness, there ever remains
behind an element which passes into new shapes. The continual
negation of each particular form and limit simply results
in the more or less complete abstraction of all forms and
limits, and so ends in an indefinite consciousness of the unformed<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
and unlimited." Thus he brings us to "the ultimate
difficulty&mdash;How can there possibly be constituted a consciousness
of the unformed and unlimited, when, by its very nature,
consciousness is possible only under forms and limits?" This
he accounts for by by hypostatizing a "raw material" in consciousness
which is, must be, present. He presents his conclusion
as follows: "By its very nature, therefore, this ultimate
mental element is at once necessarily indefinite and
necessarily indestructible. Our consciousness of the unconditioned
being literally the unconditioned consciousness, or
raw material of thought, to which in thinking we give definite
forms, it follows that an ever-present sense of real existence
is the very basis of our intelligence." ...</p>

<p>"To sum up this somewhat too elaborate argument:&mdash;We
have seen how, in the very assertion that all our knowledge,
properly so called, is Relative, there is involved the assertion
that there exists a Non-relative. We have seen how, in each
step of the argument by which this doctrine is established,
the same assumption is made. We have seen how, from the
very necessity of thinking in relations, it follows that the
Relative itself is inconceivable, except as related to a real
Non-relative. We have seen that, unless a real Non-relative
or Absolute be postulated, the Relative itself becomes absolute,
and so brings the argument to a contradiction. And
on contemplating the process of thought, we have equally
seen how impossible it is to get rid of the consciousness of an
actuality lying behind appearances; and how, from this impossibility,
results our indestructible belief in that actuality."</p>

<p>The approval which has been accorded to certain of the
arguments adduced by Mr. Spencer in favor of his especial
point, that the Absolute is a positive somewhat in consciousness,
and to that point as established, must not be supposed
to apply also to that hypothesis of "indefinite consciousness"
by which he attempts to reconcile this position with his former
teachings. On the contrary, it will be our purpose hereafter
to show that this hypothesis is a complete fallacy.<span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>As against the positions taken by Sir William Hamilton
and Mr. Mansel, Mr. Spencer's argument may unquestionably
be deemed decisive. Admitting the logical accuracy of their
reasoning, he very justly turns from the logical to the psychological
aspect of the subject, takes exception to their
premiss, shows conclusively that it is fallacious, and gives
an approximate, though unfortunately a very partial and
defective presentation of the truth. Indeed, the main issue
which must now be made with him is whether the position
he has here taken, and which he puts forth as that peculiar
element in his philosophical system, that new truth, which
shall harmonize Hamiltonian Limitism with the facts of
human nature, is not, when carried to its logical results, in
diametrical and irreconcilable antagonism to that whole system,
and all that he has before written, and so does not
annihilate them. It will be our present endeavor to show
that such is the result.</p>

<p>Perhaps we cannot better examine Mr. Spencer's theory
than, first, to take up what we believe to be the element of
truth in it, and carry out this to its logical results; and afterwards
to present what seem to be the elements of error, and
show them to be such.</p>

<p>1. "We are obliged to form a positive though vague consciousness
of" "the Absolute." Without criticizing his use
here of consciousness as if it were a faculty of knowledge,
and remembering that we cannot have a consciousness of
anything without having a knowledge commensurate with
that consciousness, we will see that Mr. Spencer's assertion
is tantamount to saying, We have a positive knowledge that
the Absolute is. It does not seem that he himself can disallow
this. Grant this, and our whole system follows, as does
also the fallacy of his own. Our argument will proceed
thus. Logic is the science of the pure laws of thought, and
is mathematically accurate, and is absolute. Being such, it
is law for all intellect, for God as well as man. But three
positions can be taken. Either it is true for the Deity, or<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
else it is false for him, or else it has no reference to him. In
the last instance God is Chaos; in the second he and man
are in organic contradiction, and he created man so; the first
is the one now advocated. The second and third hypotheses
refute themselves in the statement of them. Nothing remains
but the position taken that the laws of Logic lie equally on
God and man. One of those laws is, that, if any assertion is
true, all that is logically involved in it is true; in other words,
all truth is in absolute and perfect harmony. This is fundamental
to the possibility of Logic. Now apply this law to
the psychological premiss of Mr. Spencer, that we have a
positive knowledge that the Absolute is. A better form of
expression would be, The absolute Being is. It follows then
that he is in a <i>mode</i>, has a <i>formal</i> being. But three hypotheses
are possible. He is in no mode, he is in one mode;
he is in all modes. If he is in no mode, there is no form, no
order, no law for his being; which is to say, he is Chaos.
Chaos is not God, for Chaos cannot organize an orderly being,
and men are orderly beings, and were created. If he is in
all modes, he is in a state of utter contradiction. God "is all
in every part." He is then all infinite, and all finite. Infinity
and finiteness are contradictory and mutually exclusive qualities.
God is wholly possessed of contradictory and mutually
exclusive qualities, which is more than unthinkable&mdash;it is
absurd. He is, must be, then, in one mode. Let us pause
here for a moment and observe that we have clearly established,
from Mr. Spencer's own premiss, the fact that God <i>is
limited</i>. He must be in one mode to the exclusion of all
other modes. He is limited then by the necessity to be what
he is; and if he could become what he is not, he would not
have been absolute. Since he is absolute, he is, to the exclusion
of the possibility of any other independent Being.
Other beings are, and must therefore be, dependent on and
subordinate to him. Since he is superior to all other beings
he must be in the highest possible mode of being. Personality
is the highest possible mode of being. This will appear<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
from the following considerations. A person, possesses the
reason and law of his action, and the capacity to act, within
himself, and is thus a <i>final cause</i>. No higher form of being
than this can be needed, and so by the law of parsimony
a hypothesis of any other must be excluded. God is then a
person.</p>

<p>We have now brought the argument to that point where
its connection with the system advocated in this treatise is
manifest. If the links are well wrought, and the chain complete,
not only is this system firmly grounded upon Mr.
Spencer's premiss, but, as was intimated on an early page,
he has in this his special point given partial utterance to
what, once established, involves the fallacy not only of all
he has written before, but as well of the whole Limitist
Philosophy. It remains now to remark upon the errors in
his form of expressing the truth.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Spencer's error is twofold. He treats of consciousness
as a faculty of knowledge. He speaks of a "vague,"
an "indefinite consciousness." Let us examine these in their
order.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> He treats of consciousness as a faculty of knowledge.
In this he uses the term in the inexact, careless,
popular manner, rather than with due precision. As has
been observed on a former page, consciousness is the light in
which the person sees his faculties act. Thus some feeling
is affected. This feeling is cognized by the intellectual faculty,
and of this the person is conscious. Hence it is an elliptical
expression to say "I am conscious of the feeling." The full
form being "I am conscious that I know the feeling." Thus
is it with all man's activities. Applying this to the case in
hand, it appears, not that we are conscious of the Absolute,
but that we are conscious that the proper intellectual faculty,
the Pure Reason, presents what absoluteness is, and that the
absolute Person is, and through this presentation&mdash;intuition&mdash;the
spiritual person knows these facts. We repeat, then,
our position: consciousness is the indivisible unity, the light<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
in which the person sees all his faculties and capacities act;
and so is to be considered as different in kind from them all
as the peculiar and unique endowment of a spiritual person.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Mr. Spencer speaks of a "vague," an "indefinite consciousness."
The expression "vague consciousness" being a
popular and very common one, deserves a careful examination,
and this we hope to give it, keeping in mind meantime the
position already attained.</p>

<p>The phrase is used in some such connection as this, "I
have a vague or undefined consciousness of impending evil."
Let us analyze this experience. In doing so it will be
observed that the consciousness, or rather the seeing by the
person in the light of consciousness, is positive, clear, and
definite, and is the apprehension of a feeling. Again, the feeling
is positive and distinct; it is a feeling of dread, of threatening
danger. What, then, is vague&mdash;is undefined? This.
That cause which produces the feeling lies without the reach
of the cognitive faculties, and of course cannot be known;
because what produces the feeling is unknown, the intellectual
apprehension experiences a sense of vagueness; and this
it instinctively carries over and applies to the feeling. Yet
really the sense of vagueness arises from an ignorance of the
cause of the feeling. Strictly speaking, then, it is not consciousness
that is vague; and so Mr. Spencer's "<i>indefinite</i>
consciousness, which cannot be formulated," has no foundation
in fact. But this may be shown by another line of thought.
Consciousness is commensurate with knowledge, <i>i. e.</i>, man
can have no knowledge except he is conscious of that knowledge;
neither can he have any consciousness except he knows
that the consciousness is, and what the consciousness is, <i>i. e.</i>,
what he is conscious of. Now all knowledge is definite; it
is only ignorance that is indefinite. When we say that our
knowledge of an object is indefinite, we mean that we partly
know its characteristics, and are partly ignorant of them.
Thus then also the result above stated follows; and what
Mr. Spencer calls "<i>indefinite</i> consciousness" is a "<i>definite</i><span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
consciousness" that we partly know, and are partly ignorant
of the object under consideration.</p>

<p>In the last paragraph but one, of the chapter now under
consideration, Mr. Spencer makes a most extraordinary assertion
respecting consciousness, which, when examined in the
light of the positions we have advocated, affords another
decisive evidence of the fallacy of his theory. We quote it
again, that the reader may not miss of giving it full attention.
"By its very nature, therefore, this ultimate mental element
is at once necessarily indefinite and necessarily indestructible.
Our consciousness of the unconditioned being literally <i>the
unconditioned consciousness</i>, or <i>raw material of thought</i>, to
which in thinking we give definite forms, it follows that an
ever-present sense of real existence is the very basis of our
intelligence." Upon reading this passage, the question spontaneously
arises, What does the writer mean? and it is a
question which is not so easily answered. More than one
interpretation may be assigned, as will appear upon examination.
A problem is given. To find what the "raw material
of thought" is. Since man has thoughts, there must be in
him the "raw material of thought"&mdash;the crude thought-ore
which he smelts down in the blast-furnace of the Understanding,
giving forth in its stead the refined metal&mdash;exact
thought. We must then proceed to attain our answer by
analyzing man's natural organization.</p>

<p>Since man is a complex, constituted being, there is necessarily
a logical order to the parts which are combined in the
complexity. He may be considered as a substance in which
a constitution inheres, <i>i. e.</i>, which is organized according to
a <i>set</i> of fixed laws, and that set of laws may be stated in their
logical order. It is sufficient, however, for our purpose to
consider him as an organized substance, the organization
being such that he is a person&mdash;a selfhood, <i>self-active</i> and
capable of self-examination. The raw material of <i>all</i> the
activities of such a person is this organized substance. Take
away the substance, and there remains only the set of laws<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
as <i>abstract</i> ideas. Again, take away the set of laws, and the
substance is simple, unorganized substance. In the combining
of the two the person becomes. These, then, are all
there is of the person, and therefore in these must the raw
material be. From this position it follows directly that any
capacity or faculty, or, in general, every activity of the person,
is the substance acting in accordance with the law which
determines that form of the activity. To explain the term,
form of activity. There is a <i>set</i> of laws. Each law, by itself,
is a simple law, and is incapable of organizing a substance
into a being. But when these laws are considered, as they
naturally stand in the Divine Reason, in relation to each
other, it is seen that this, their standing together, constitutes
ideals, or forms of being and activity. To illustrate from
an earthly object. The law of gravitation alone could not
organize a Universe; neither could the law of cohesion, nor of
centripetal, nor centrifugal force, nor any other one law. All
these laws must be acting together,&mdash;or rather all these
laws must stand together in perfect harmony, according to
their own nature, thus constituting an ideal form, in accordance
with which God may create this Universe. For an
illustration of our topic in its highest form, the reader is
referred to those pages of Dr. Hickok's "Rational Psychology,"
where he analyzes personality into its elements of Spontaneity,
Autonomy, and Liberty. From that examination it is sufficiently
evident that either of these alone cannot organize a
person, but that all three must be present in order to constitute
such a being. There are, then, various forms of activity
in the person, as Reason, Sensibility, and Will, in each
of which the organized substance acts in a mode or form, and
this form is determined by the set of organizing laws. Consciousness
also is such a form. The "raw material of
thought," then, must be this substance considered under the
peculiar form of activity which we call consciousness, but
<i>before the substance thus formulated has been awakened into
activity by those circumstances which are naturally suited to</i><span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
<i>it, for bringing it into action</i>. Now, by the very terms of
the statement it is evident that the substance thus organized
in this form, or, to use the common term, consciousness considered
apart from and prior to its activity, can never be
known <i>by experience</i>, i. e., <i>we can never be conscious of an
unconscious state</i>. "Unconditioned consciousness" is consciousness
considered as quiescent because in it have been
awakened no "definite forms"&mdash;no "thinking." "In the
nature of things," then, it is impossible to be conscious of an
"unconditioned consciousness." Yet Mr. Spencer says that
"our consciousness of the unconditioned," which he has already
asserted and proved, is a "positive," and therefore an
active state; is identical with, is "literally the unconditioned
consciousness," or consciousness in its quiescent state, considered
before it had been awakened into activity, which is
far more absurd than what was just above shown to be a
contradiction.</p>

<p>To escape such a result, a less objectionable interpretation
may be given to the dictum in hand. It may be said that
it looks upon consciousness only as an activity, and in the
logical order after its action has begun. We are, then, conscious,
and in this is positive action, but no definite object is
present which gives a form in consciousness, and so consciousness
<i>returns upon itself</i>. We are conscious that we are conscious,
which is an awkward way of saying that we are self-conscious,
or, more concisely yet, that we are conscious; for
accurately this is all, and this is the same as to say that the
subject and object are identical in this act. The conclusion
from this hypothesis is one which we judge Mr. Spencer will
be very loath to accept, and yet it seems logically to follow.
Indeed, in a sentence we are about to quote, he seems to
make a most marked distinction between self-consciousness
and this "consciousness of the unconditioned," which he calls
its "obverse."</p>

<p>But whatever Mr. Spencer's notion of the "raw material
of thought" is, what more especially claims our attention and<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
is most strange, is his application of that notion. To present
this more clearly, we will quote further from the passage
already under examination. "As we can in successive mental
acts get rid of all particular conditions, and replace them by
others, but cannot get rid of that undifferentiated substance
of consciousness, which is conditioned anew in every thought,
there ever remains with us a sense of that which exists persistently
and independently of conditions. At the same time
that by the laws of thought we are rigorously prevented from
forming a conception of absolute existence, we are by the
laws of thought equally prevented from ridding ourselves
of the consciousness of absolute existence: this consciousness
being, as we here see, the obverse of our self-consciousness."
Now, by comparing this extract with the other, which it immediately
follows, it seems plain that Mr. Spencer uses as
synonymous the phrases "consciousness of the unconditioned,"
"unconditioned consciousness," "raw material of
thought," "undifferentiated substance of consciousness," and
"consciousness of absolute existence." Let us note, now,
certain conclusions, which seem to follow from this use of
language. We are conscious "of absolute existence." No
person can be conscious except he is conscious of some state
or condition of his being. Absolute existence is, therefore,
a state or condition of our being. Also this "consciousness
of absolute existence"&mdash;as it seems <i>our</i> absolute existence&mdash;is
the "raw material of thought." But, again, as was
shown above, this "raw material," this "undifferentiated
substance of consciousness," if it is anything, is consciousness
considered as capacity, and in the logical order before it
becomes, or is, active; and it further appeared that of this
quiescent state we could have no knowledge by experience.
But since the above phrases are synonymous, it follows that
"consciousness of absolute existence" is the "undifferentiated
substance of consciousness," is a consciousness of which we
can have no knowledge by experience, is a consciousness of
which we can have no consciousness. Is this philosophy?<span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>It would be but fair to suppose that there is some fact
which Mr. Spencer has endeavored to express in the language
we are criticizing. There is such a fact, a statement of which
will complete this criticism. Unquestionably, in self-examination,
a man may abstract all "successive mental acts," may
consider himself as he is, in the logical order before he <i>has
experiences</i>. In this he will find "that an ever-present sense
of real existence is the very basis of our intelligence"; or, in
other words, that it is an organic law of our being that there
cannot be an experience without a being to entertain the
experience; and hence that it is impossible for a man to
think or act, except on the assumption that he is. But all
this has nothing to do with a "consciousness of the unconditioned,"
or of "absolute existence"; for our existence is
not absolute, and it is <i>our</i> existence of which we are conscious.
The reality and abidingness of <i>our</i> existence is
ground for <i>our</i> experience, nothing more. Even if it were
possible for us to have a consciousness of our state before
any experience, or to actually now abstract all experience,
and be conscious of our consciousness unmodified by any
object, <i>i. e.</i> to be conscious of unconsciousness, this would
not be a "consciousness of absolute existence." We could
find no more in it, and deduce no more from it, than that our
existence was involved in our experience. Such a consciousness
would indeed appear "unconditioned" by the coming
into it of any activity, which would give a form in it; but
this would give us no notion of true unconditionedness&mdash;true
"absolute existence." This consciousness, though undisturbed
by any experience, would yet be conditioned, would
have been created, and be dependent upon God for continuance
in existence, and for a chance to come into circumstances,
where it could be modified by experiences, and so
could grow. While, then, Mr. Spencer's theory gives us the
fact of the notion of the necessity of our existence to our
experience, it in no way accounts for the fact of our consciousness
of the unconditioned, be that what it may.<span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>But to return from this considerable digression to the result
which was attained a few pages back, viz: that what Mr.
Spencer calls "<i>indefinite</i> consciousness" is a "<i>definite</i> consciousness"
that we partly know, and are partly ignorant
of the object under consideration. Let this conclusion be
applied to the topic which immediately concerns us,&mdash;the
character of God.</p>

<p>But three suppositions are possible. Either we know
nothing of God, not even that he is; or we have a partial
knowledge of him, we know that he is, and all which we can
logically deduce from this; or we know him exhaustively.
The latter, no one pretends, and therefore it needs no notice.
The first, even if our own arguments are not deemed satisfactory,
has been thoroughly refuted by Mr. Spencer, and so is
to be set aside. Only the second remains. Respecting this,
his position is that we know that God is and no more. Admit
this for a moment. We are conscious then of a positive, certain,
inalienable knowledge that God is; but that with reference
to any and all questions which may arise concerning
him we are in total ignorance. Here, again, it is apparent
that it is not our consciousness or knowledge that is vague;
it is our ignorance.</p>

<p>We might suggest the question&mdash;of what use can it be to
man to know that God is, and be utterly and necessarily, yea,
organically ignorant of what he is? Let the reader answer
the question to his own mind. It is required to show how
the theory advocated in this book will appear in the light of
the second hypothesis above stated.</p>

<p>Man knows that God is, and what God is so far as he can
logically deduce it from this premiss; but, in so far as God
is such, that he cannot be thus known, except wherein he
makes a direct revelation to us, he must be forever inscrutable.
To illustrate. If the fact that God is, be admitted, it
logically follows that he must be self-existent. Self-existence
is a positive idea in the Reason, and so here is a second
element of knowledge respecting the Deity. Thus we may<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
go on through all that it is possible to deduce, and the system
thus wrought will be The Science of Natural Theology, a
science as pure and sure as pure equations. Its results will
be what God must be. Looking into the Universe we will
find what must be corresponding with what is, and our knowledge
will be complete. Again, in many regards God may be
utterly inscrutable to us, since he may possess characteristics
which we cannot attain by logical deductions. For instance,
let it be granted that the doctrine of the Trinity is true&mdash;that
there are three persons in one Godhead. This would be a
fact which man could never attain, could never make the
faintest guess at. He might, unaided, attain to the belief that
God would forgive; he might, with the profound and sad-eyed
man of Greece, become convinced that some god must
come from heaven to lead men to the truth; but the notion
of the Trinity could never come to him, except God himself
with carefulness revealed it. Respecting those matters of
which we cannot know except by revelation, this only can
be demanded; and this by inherent endowment man has a
right to demand; viz: that what is revealed shall not contradict
the law already "written in the heart." Yet, once
more, there are certain characteristics of God that must forever
be utterly inscrutable to every created being, and this,
because such is their nature and relation to the Deity, that
one cannot be endowed with a faculty capable of attaining
the knowledge in question. Such for instance are the questions,
How is God self-existent, how could he be eternal,
how exercise his power, and the like? These are questions
respecting which no possible reason can arise why we should
know them, except the gratification of curiosity, which in
reality is no reason at all, and therefore the inability in
question is no detriment to man.</p>

<p>By the discussion which may now be brought to a close,
two positions seem to be established. 1. That we have, as
Mr. Spencer affirms, a positive consciousness that the absolute
Being is, and that this and all which we can logically deduce<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
from this are objects of knowledge to us; in other words,
that the system advocated in this volume directly follows
from that premiss. 2. That any doctrine of "indefinite
consciousness" is erroneous, that the vagueness is not in
consciousness, but in our knowledge; and further, that
the hypothesis of a consciousness of the "raw material of
thought" is absurd.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2 id="THE_RECONCILIATION">"THE RECONCILIATION."</h2>

<p>It would naturally seem, that, after what is believed to be
the thorough refutation of the limitist scheme, which has been
given in the preceding comments on Mr. Spencer's three
philosophical chapters, the one named in our heading would
need scarce more than a notice. But so far is this from being
the case, that some of the worst features in the results of his
system stand out in clearest relief here. Before proceeding
to consider these, let us note a most important admission.
He speaks of his conclusion as bringing "the results of
speculation into harmony with those of common sense," and
then makes the, for him, extraordinary statement, "Common
Sense asserts the existence of reality." In these two remarks
it would appear to be implied that Common Sense is a final
standard with which any position most be reconciled. The
question instantly arises, What is Common Sense? The
writer has never seen a definition, and would submit for the
reader's consideration the following.</p>

<p>Common Sense <i>is the practical Pure Reason</i>; it is that
faculty by which the spiritual person sees in the light of consciousness
the <i>a priori</i> law as inherent in the fact presented
by the Sense.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness its complement may be
defined thus:</p>

<p>Judgment is the practical Understanding; it is that faculty<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
by which the spiritual person selects such means as he thinks
so conformed to that law thus intuited, as to be best suited to
accomplish the object in view.</p>

<p>A man has good Common Sense, who quickly sees the
informing law in the fact; and good judgment, who skilfully
selects and adapts his means to the circumstances of the case,
and the end sought. Of course it will not be understood
that it is herein implied that every person who exercises
this faculty has a defined and systematic knowledge of it.</p>

<p>The reader will readily see the results which directly follow
from Mr. Spencer's premiss. It is true that "Common Sense
asserts the existence of a reality," and this assertion is true;
but with equal truth does it assert the law of logic; that, if
a premiss is true, <i>all that is logically involved in it is true</i>.
It appears, then, that Mr. Spencer has unwittingly acknowledged
the fundamental principle of what may be called the
Coleridgian system, the psychological fact of the Pure Reason,
and thus again has furnished a basis for the demolition of his
own.</p>

<p>It was said above that some of the evil results of Mr.
Spencer's system assumed in this chapter their worst phases.
This remark is illustrated in the following extract: "We are
obliged to regard every phenomenon as a manifestation of
some Power by which we are acted upon; phenomena being,
so far as we can ascertain, unlimited in their diffusion, we are
obliged to regard this Power as omnipresent; and criticism
teaches us that this Power is wholly incomprehensible. In this
consciousness of an Incomprehensible Omnipresent Power
we have just that consciousness on which Religion dwells.
And so we arrive at the point where Religion and Science
coalesce." The evils referred to may be developed as follows:
"We are obliged to regard every phenomenon as a
manifestation of some Power by which we are acted upon."
This may be expressed in another form thus: Every phenomenon
is a manifestation of some Power by which we are
acted upon. Some doubt may arise respecting the precise<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
meaning of this sentence, unless the exact signification of the
term phenomenon be ascertained. It might be confined to
material appearances, appreciable by one of the five senses.
But the context seems to leave no doubt but that Mr. Spencer
uses it in the wider sense of every somewhat in the Universe,
since he speaks of "phenomena" as "unlimited." Putting
the definition for the term, the sentence stands: Every somewhat
in the Universe is "a manifestation of some Power
by which we are acted upon." It follows, then, that there is
no somewhat in the Universe, except we are acted upon by
it. Our being arises to be accounted for. Either we began
to be, and were created, or the ground of our being is in
ourselves, our being is pure independence, and nothing further
is to be asked. This latter will be rejected. Then we were
created. But we were not created by Mr. Spencer's "some
Power," because it only <i>acts upon us</i>. In his creation, man
was not acted upon, because there was no man to be acted
upon; but in that act a being was originated <i>who might be
acted upon</i>. Then, however, we came into being, another
than "some Power" was the cause of us. But the act of
creating man was a somewhat. Every somewhat <i>in</i> the
Universe is "a manifestation of some Power." This is not
such a manifestation. Therefore the creation of man took
place outside the Universe. Or does Mr. Spencer prefer to
say that the creation of man is "a manifestation of some
Power acting upon" him!</p>

<p>The position above taken seems the more favorable one
for Mr. Spencer. If, to avoid the difficulties which spring
from it, he limits the term phenomenon, as for instance to
material appearances, then his assertion that phenomena are
unlimited is a contradiction, and he has no ground on which
to establish the omnipresence of his Power.</p>

<p>But another line of criticism may be pursued. Strictly
speaking, all events are phenomena. Let there be named an
event which is universally known and acknowledged, and
which, in the nature of the case, cannot be "a manifestation<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
of some Power by which we are acted upon," and in that
statement also will the errors of the passage under consideration
be established. The experience by the human
soul of a sense of guilt, of a consciousness of ill-desert, is
such an event. No "Power" can make a sinless soul feel
guilty; no "Power" <i>can relieve a sinful soul from feeling
guilty</i>. The feeling of guilt does not arise from the defiance
of Power, <i>it arises from the violation of Law</i>. And not only
may this experience be named, but every other experience
of the moral nature of man. In this connection let it be
observed that Mr. Spencer always elsewhere uses the term
phenomenon to represent material phenomena in the material
universe. Throughout all his pages the reader is challenged
to find a single instance in which he attempts to account for
any other phenomena than these and their concomitants, the
affections of the intellect in the animal nature. Indeed, so
thoroughly is his philosophy vitiated by this omission, that
one could never learn from anything he has said in these
pages, that man had a moral nature at all, that there were
any phenomena of sin and repentance which needed to be
accounted for. In this, Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Mansel
are just as bad as he. Yet in this the Limitists have done
well; it is impossible, on the basis of their system, to render
such an account. To test the matter, the following problem
is presented.</p>

<p>To account, on the basis of the Limitist Philosophy, for the
fact that the nations of men have universally made public
acknowledgment of their guilt, in having violated the law of
a superior being; and that they have offered propitiatory
sacrifices therefor, except in the case of those persons and
nations who have received the Bible, or have learned through
the Koran one of its leading features, that there is but one
God, and who in either case believe that the needful sacrifice
has already been made.</p>

<p>Another pernicious result of the system under examination
is, that it affords no better ground for the doctrine of Deity's<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
omnipresence than <i>experience</i>. Mr. Spencer's words are:
"phenomena being, <i>so far as we can ascertain</i>, unlimited in
their diffusion, we are obliged to regard this Power as omnipresent."
Now, if he, or one of his friends, should happen to
get wings some day, and should just take a turn through space,
and should happen also to find a limit to phenomena, and,
skirting in astonishment along that boundary, should happen
to light upon an open place and a bridge, which invited them
to pass across to another sphere or system of phenomena, made
by another "Power,"&mdash;said bridge being constructed "'alf
and 'alf" by the two aforesaid Powers,&mdash;then there would
be nothing to do but for the said explorer to fly back again
to England, as fast as ever he could, and relate to all the
other Limitists his new experience; and they, having no
ground on which to argue against or above experience, must
needs receive the declaration of their colaborator, with its
inevitable conclusion, that the Power by which we are here
acted upon is limited, and so is not omnipresent. But when,
instead of such a fallacious philosophy, men shall receive the
doctrine, based not upon human experience, but upon God's
inborn ideas that phenomena are limited and God is omnipresent,
and that upon these facts experience can afford no
decision, we shall begin to eliminate the real difficulties of
philosophy, and to approach the attainment of the unison
between human philosophy and the Divine Philosophy.</p>

<p>Attached to the above is the conclusion reached by Mr.
Spencer in an earlier part of his work, that "criticism teaches
us that this Power is wholly incomprehensible." We might,
it is believed, ask with pertinence, What better, then, is man
than the brute? But the subject is recurred to at this time,
only to quote against this position a sentence from a somewhat
older book than "First Principles," a book which, did
it deserve no other regard than as a human production, would
seem, from its perfect agreement with the facts of human
nature, to be the true basis for all philosophy. The sentence
is this: "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
God; and every one that loveth, is born of God, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">knoweth God</span>."</p>

<p>But the gross materialism of Mr. Spencer's philosophy presents
its worst phase in his completed doctrine of God. Mark.
A "phenomenon" is "a manifestation of some Power." "In
this consciousness of an Incomprehensible Omnipresent Power
we have just that consciousness on which Religion dwells.
And so we arrive at the point where Religion and Science
coalesce." An "Incomprehensible Omnipresent Power" is
all the Deity Mr. Spencer allows to mankind. This Power
is omnipresent, so that we can never escape it; and incomprehensible,
so that we can never know the law of its
action, or even if it have a law. At any moment it may
fall on us and crush us. At any moment this globe may
become one vast Vesuvius, and all its cities Herculaneums
and Pompeiis. Of such a Deity the children of men may
either live in continual dread, or in continual disregard; they
may either spend their lives clad in sackcloth, or purple and
fine linen; bread and water may be their fare, or their table
may be spread like that of Dives; by merciless mortification
of the flesh, by scourges and iron chains, they may seek to
propitiate, if possible, this incomprehensible, omnipresent
Power; or, reckless of consequences, they may laugh and
dance and be gay, saying, we know nothing of this Power,
he may crush us any moment, let us take the good of life
while we can. The symbols of such a Deity are the "rough
and ragged rocks," the hills, the snow-crowned mountains
Titan-piled; the avalanche starting with ominous thunder, to
rush with crash and roar and terrible destruction upon the
hapless village beneath it; the flood gathering its waters
from vast ranges of hills into a single valley, spreading into
great lakes, drowning cattle, carrying off houses and their
agonized inhabitants, sweeping away dams, rending bridges
from their foundations, in fine, ruthlessly destroying the little
gatherings of man, and leaving the country, over which its
devastating waters flowed, a mournful desolation; and finally,<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
perhaps the completest symbol of all may be found in that
collection of the united streams and lakes of tens upon tens
of thousands of miles of the earth's surface, into the aorta of
the world, over the rough, rocky bed of which the crowded
waters rush and roar, with rage and foam, until they come
suddenly to the swift tremendous plunge of Niagara.</p>

<p>It should be further noticed, that this philosophy is in direct
antagonism with that of the Bible,&mdash;that, if Spencerianism
is true, the Bible is a falsehood and cheat. Instead of Mr.
Spencer's "Power," the Bible presents us a doctrine of God
as follows: "And God said unto Moses, <span class="smcap">I am that I am</span>.
And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
<span class="smcap">I am</span> hath sent me unto you."&mdash;<i>Exodus</i> IV. 14. This
declaration, the most highly metaphysical of any but one
man ever heard, all the Limitists, even devout Mr. Mansel,
either in distinct terms, or by implication, deny. That other
declaration is this: "Beloved, let us love one another: for
love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God,
and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God;
<i>for God is love</i>."&mdash;1 <i>John</i> IV. 7, 8. Direct as is the antagonism
between the two philosophies now presented, the
later one appears in an especially bad light from the fact,
that, being very recent and supported by a mere handful of
men, its advocates have utterly neglected to take any notice
of the other and elder one, although the adherents of this
may be numbered by millions, and among them have been and
are many of the ablest of earth's thinkers. True, the great
majority of Bible readers do not study it as a philosophical
treatise, but rather as a book of religious and spiritual instruction;
yet, since it is the most profoundly philosophical
book which has ever been in the hands of man, and professedly
teaches us not only the philosophy of man, but also
the philosophy of God, it certainly would seem that the advocates
of the new and innovating system should have taken
up that one which it sought to supplant, and have made an
attempt, commensurate with the magnitude of the work before<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
them, to show its position to be fallacious and unworthy
of regard. Instead of this they have nowhere recognized the
existence even of this philosophy except in the single instance
of a quotation by Mr. Mansel, in which he seems tacitly to acknowledge
the antagonism we have noted. In Mr. Spencer's
volume this neglect is especially noteworthy. Judging from
internal evidence, one would much sooner conclude that it
was written by a Hindu pundit, in a temple of Buddha, than
by an Englishman, in a land of Bibles and Christian churches.
Now, although the Bible may stand in his estimation no
higher than the Bahgavat-Gita, yet the mere fact that it is,
and that it presents a most profound philosophy, which is so
largely received in his own and neighboring nations, made it
imperative upon him not only to take some notice of it, but
to meet and answer it, as we have indicated above.</p>

<p>Another fault in Mr. Spencer's philosophy, one which he
will be less willing to admit, perhaps, than the above, and,
at the same time, one which will be more likely forcibly to
move a certain class of mind, is, that it is in direct antagonism
to human nature. Not only is the Bible a falsehood and a
cheat, if Mr. Spencer's philosophical system is true, but human
nature is equally a falsehood and a cheat. To specify.
Human nature universally considers God, or its gods, as
persons; or, in other words, all human beings, or at least
with very rare exceptions, spontaneously ascribe personality
to Deity. This position is in no wise negatived by the fact of
the Buddhist priesthood of India, or of a class of philosophical
atheists in any other country. Man is endowed with the
power of self-education; and if an individual sees, in the
religion in which he is brought up, some inconsistency, which
he, thinking it, as it may be, integral, for philosophical reasons
rejects, and all religion with it, he may educate himself into
speculative atheism. But no child is an atheist. Not even
Shelley became such, until he had dashed against some of the
distorted and monstrous <i>human</i> theologies of his day. But
counting all the Buddhists, and all the German atheists, and<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
all the English atheists, and all the American atheists, and
all other atheists wherever they may be found, they will not
number one tenth of the human race. On what ground can
the unanimity of the other nine tenths be accounted for?
There appears none possible, but that the notion that God is
a person, <i>is organic in human nature</i>. Another equally
universal and spontaneous utterance of mankind is, that there
is a likeness, in some way, between God and man. There
are the grossest, and in many instances most degrading modes
of representing this; but under them all, and through them
all, the indelible notion appears. The unanimity and pertinacity
of this notion, appearing in every part of the globe,
and under every variety of circumstance, and reappearing
after every revolution, which, tearing down old customs and
worships, established new ones, can without doubt only be
accounted for on the precise ground of the other,&mdash;that the
notion <i>is organic in man</i>. A third utterance of the human
race, standing in the same category with these two, is, that
the Deity can be propitiated by sacrifice. This also has had
revolting, yea most hideous and unrighteous forms of expression,
even to human sacrifices. But the notion has remained
indestructible through all ages, and must therefore
be accounted for, as have been the others. Over against the
<span class="smcap">I am</span>, which human nature presents and the Bible supports;
over against Him in whose image man and the Bible say
man was created; and over against Him who, those two
still agreeing witnesses also affirm, is moved by his great
heart of Love to have mercy on those creatures who come
to him with repentance, Mr. Spencer gives us, as the result
of <i>Science</i>, an incomprehensible omnipresent <i>Power</i>; only a
Power, nothing more; and that "utterly inscrutable." For
our part, whatever others may do, we will believe in human
nature and the Bible. On the truthfulness of these two
witnesses, as on the Central Rock in the Universe, we plant
ourselves. Here do we find our Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer further says that on the consciousness of this<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
Power "Religion dwells." Now, so far is this assertion from
according with the fact, that on his hypothesis it is impossible
to account for the presence of religion as a constitutive element
of the human race. Religion was primarily worship,
the reverential acknowledgment, by the sinless creature, of
the authority of the Creator, combined with the adoration of
His absolute Holiness; but since sin has marred the race, it
has been coupled with the offering in some forms of a propitiatory
sacrifice. But if the Deity is only Power; or
equally, if this is all the notion we can form of him, we are
utterly at a loss to find aught in him to worship, much less
can we account for the fact of the religious nature in us, and
most of all are we confounded by the persistent assertion, by
this religions nature, of the personality and mercy of God,
for Power can be neither personal nor merciful.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer proceeds to strengthen as well as he can his
position by stating that "from age to age Science has continually
defeated it (Religion) wherever they have come into
collision, and has obliged it to relinquish one or more of its
positions." In this assertion, also, he manifests either a want
of acquaintance with the facts or a failure to comprehend
their significance. Religion may properly be divided into
two classes.</p>

<p>1. Those religions which have appeared to grow up spontaneously
among men, having all the errors and deformities
which a fleshly imagination would produce.</p>

<p>2. The religion of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1. From the three great ideas mentioned above, no Science
has ever driven even the religions of this class. It has,
indeed, corrected many <i>forms of expression</i>, and has sometimes
driven <i>individuals</i>, who failed to distinguish between
the form, and the idea which the form overlies, into a
rejection of the truth itself.</p>

<p>2. Respecting the religion of Jesus Christ, Mr. Spencer's
remark has no shadow of foundation. Since the beginning
of its promulgation by Jehovah, and especially since the completion<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
of that promulgation by our Saviour and his apostles,
not one whit of its practical law or its philosophy has been
abated; nay, more, to-day, in these American States, there
may be found a more widespread, thoroughly believed, firmly
held, and intelligent conviction of God's personality, and
personal supervision of the affairs of men, of his Fatherhood,
and of that fatherhood exercised in bringing "order out of
confusion," in so conducting the most terrible of conflicts, that
it shall manifestly redound, not only to the glory of himself,
but to the very best good of man, so manifestly to so great a
good, that all the loss of life, and all the suffering, is felt to
be not worthy to be compared to the good achieved, and that
too <i>most strongly by the sufferers</i>, than was ever before
manifested by any nation under heaven. The truth is, that,
in spite of all its efforts to the contrary, criticism has ever
been utterly impotent to eliminate from human thinking the
elements we have presented. Its utmost triumph has been
to force a change in the form of expression; and in the Bible
it meets with forms of expression which it ever has been, is
now, and ever shall be, as helpless to change as a paralytic
would be to overturn the Himalaya.</p>

<p>The discussion of the topic immediately in hand may
perhaps be now properly closed with the simple allusion to
a single fact. Just as far as a race of human beings descends
in the gradations of degradation, just so far does it come to
look upon Deity simply as power. African Fetishism is the
doctrine that Deity is an incomprehensible power, rendered
into the form of a popular religion; only the religion stands
one step higher than the philosophy, in that it assumes a sort
of personality for the Power.</p>

<p>On page 102 the following extract will be found: "And
now observe that all along, the agent which has effected the
purification has been Science. We habitually overlook the
fact that this has been one of its functions. Religion ignores
its immense debt to Science; and Science is scarcely at all
conscious how much Religion owes it. Yet it is demonstrable<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
that every step by which Religion has progressed from its
first low conception to the comparatively high one it has now
reached, Science has helped it, or rather forced it to take;
and that even now, Science is urging further steps in the
same direction." In this passage half truths are so sweepingly
asserted as universal that it becomes simply untrue.
The evil may be stand under two heads.</p>

<p>1. It is too philosophical. Mr. Spencer undertakes to be
altogether too profound. Since he has observed that certain
changes for the better have been made in some human
religions, by the study of the natural sciences, he jumps to
the conclusion that religion has been under a state of steady
growth; and of course readily assumes&mdash;for there is not a
shadow of other basis for his assertion&mdash;that the "first"
"conception" of religion was very "low." This assumption
we utterly deny, and demand of Mr. Spencer his proof. For
ourselves we are willing to come down from the impregnable
fortresses of the Bible upon the common ground of the
Grecian Mythology, and on this do battle against him. In
this we are taught that the Golden Age came <i>first</i>, in which
was a life of spotless purity; after which were the silver and
brazen ages, and the Iron Age in which was crime, and the
"low conception" of religion came <i>last</i>. How marked is the
general agreement of this with the Bible account!</p>

<p>2. But more and worse may be charged on this passage
than that it is too philosophical. Mr. Spencer constructs his
philosophy first and cuts his facts to match it. This is a
common mistake among men, and which they are unconscious
of. Now the fact is, Science was <i>not</i> "the agent which effected
the purification." Religion owes a very small debt to Science.
Science can never be more than a supplement, "a handmaid"
to Religion. Religion's first position was not a low
one, but nearly the highest. Afterwards it sunk very low;
but men sunk it there. Science never "helped it" or "forced
it" one atom upwards. Science alone only degrades Religion
and gives new wings and hands to crime. This will be<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
especially manifest to those who remember what Mr. Spencer's
doctrine of Science is. He says: "That even the <i>highest</i>
achievements of Science are resolvable into mental relations
of coexistence and sequence, so co&ouml;rdinated as exactly to
tally with certain relations of coexistence and sequence that
occur externally." Of course the highest <i>object</i> of Science
will be "<i>truth</i>"; and this, our teacher tells us, "is simply the
accurate correspondence of subjective to objective relations."
To interpret. A science of medicine, a science of ablutions, a
science of clothing, a science of ventilation, a science of temperature,
and to some largely, to many chiefly, a science of
<i>cookery</i> do, combined, constitute Science, and the preservation
of the body is its highest attainment. Is this Science "the
agent which has effected the purification of Religion?" What
then is the truth?</p>

<p>"Lo this have I found, that God hath made man upright;
but they have sought out many inventions."&mdash;<i>Eccl.</i> VII. 29.
The first religion was a communion with God. The Creator
taught man, as a father would his children. But when man
sinned, he began to seek out many inventions, and sank to
that awful state of degradation hinted at in the fragmentary
sketches of the popular manners and customs of the times of
Abraham,&mdash;<i>Gen.</i> XII. XXV.; which Paul epitomizes with
such fiery vigor in the first chapter of Romans, and which
may be found fully paralleled in our own day. At the proper
time, God took mankind in hand, and began to develop his
great plan for giving purity to religion. So he raised up
Moses, and gave to Israel the Levitical law. Or if Mr.
Spencer shall deny the biblical account of the origin of the
five books of Moses, he at least cannot deny that they have
a being; and, placing them on the same ground of examination
and criticism as Herodotus, that they were written more
than a thousand years before the Christian era. Now mark.
Whoever wrote them, they remained as they were first framed,
and no one of the prophets, who came after, added one new
idea. They only emphasized and amplified "The Law."<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
So far then as this part of Religion was concerned, Science
never helped a particle. Yea, more, the words to Moses in
the wilderness were never paralleled in the utterances of man
before the Christian era.</p>

<p>"In the fulness of time God sent his own Son." However
defective was the former dispensation, he, who appeared to
most of the men of his day as only a carpenter's son, declared
to mankind the final and perfect truth. As the system taught
by Moses was not the result of any philosophical developments,
but was incomparably superior to the religion of the
most civilized people of the world, at whose court Moses was
brought up, and was manifestly constructed <i>de novo</i>, and from
some kind of revelation, so this, which the carpenter's son
taught, was incomparably superior to any utterance which
the human soul had up to that time, or has since, made.
It comes forth at once complete and pure. It utters the
highest principles in the simplest language. Indeed, nothing
new was left to say when John finished his writing; and the
canon might well be closed. And since that day, has Religion
advanced? Not a syllable. The purest water is drank at the
old fountain. But it will be said that the cause of Religion
among men has advanced. Very true, but Science did not
advance it. You can yet count the years on your fingers
since men of Science generally ceased to be strenuously hostile
to Religion. Religion, in every instance, has advanced just
where it has gone back, and drank at the old fountains. Who,
then, has purified Religion? God is "the agent which has
effected the purification." God is he to whom Religion owes
"its immense debt," not Science. He it is who has brought
her up to her present high position.</p>

<p>When, now, we see how completely Mr. Spencer&mdash;to use
a commonplace but very forcible phrase&mdash;has "ruled God
out of the ring," how impertinent seems his rebuke, administered
a few pages further on, in the passage beginning,
"Volumes might be written upon the impiety of the pious,"
to those who believe that God means what he says, and that<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
men may know him. These men at least stand on a far
higher plane than he who teaches that an "incomprehensible
omnipresent Power" is all there is for us to worship, and his
words will sound to them like the crackling of thorns under
a pot.</p>

<p>There does not appear in this chapter any further topic
that has not already been touched upon. With these remarks,
then, the examination of this chapter, and of Mr. Spencer's
First Principles, may be closed.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>If it has ever been the reader's lot to examine Paley's
"Evidences of Christianity," or the "Sermons of President
Dwight on the Existence of God"; and if he has risen from
their perusal with a feeling of utter unsatisfaction, enduring
the same craving for a sure truth harassing as before, he will
have partly shared the experience which drove the author
forward, until he arrived at the foundation principles of this
treatise. Those works, and all of that class are, for the object
they have in view, worthless; not because the various statements
they make are untrue, not because elegant language and
beauty of style are wanting; but because they are radically
defective in that, their <i>method</i> is irrelevant to the subject in
hand; because in all the arguments that have been or can be
brought forward there is nothing decisive and final; because
the skeptic can thrust the sharp sword of his criticism through
every one of them; because, in fine, the very root of the matter,
their method itself is false, and men have attempted to
establish by a series of arguments what must be ground for
the possibility of an argument, and can only be established by
the opposite, the <i>a priori</i> method. Though the Limitist Philosophy
has no positive value, it has this negative one, that it
has established, by the most thorough-going criticism, the
worthlessness of the <i>a posteriori</i> processes of thought on the
matter in hand. Yea, more, the existence of <i>any</i> spiritual
person cannot be proved in that way. You can prove that
the boy's body climbs the tree; but never that he has a soul.
This is always taken for granted. Lest the author should
appear singular in this view, he would call the attention of
the reader to a passage in Coleridge's writings in which he
at once sets forth the beauty of the style and incompetency<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
of the logic of Dr. Paley's book. "I have, I am aware, in
this present work, furnished occasion for a charge of having
expressed myself with slight and irreverence of celebrated
names, especially of the late Dr. Paley. O, if I were fond
and ambitious of literary honor, of public applause, how well
content should I be to excite but one third of the admiration
which, in my inmost being, I feel for the head and heart of
Paley! And how gladly would I surrender all hope of contemporary
praise, could I even approach to the incomparable
grace, propriety, and persuasive facility of his writings! But
on this very account, I feel myself bound in conscience <i>to throw
the whole force of my intellect in the way of this triumphal car</i>,
on which the tutelary genius of modern idolatry is borne,
even at the risk of being crushed under the wheels."</p>

<p>Instead of the method now condemned, there is one taught
us in the Book, and the only one taught us there, which is
open to every human being, for which every human being
has the faculty, and respecting which all that is needed is,
that the person exercise what he already has. The boy could
not learn his arithmetic, except he set himself resolutely to
his task; and no man can learn of God, except he also fulfils
the conditions, except he consecrate himself wholly to the
acquisition of this knowledge, except his soul is poured out
in love to God; "for every one that <i>loveth, is born of God,
and knoweth God</i>." We come then to the knowledge of God
by a direct and immediate act of the soul. The Reason, the
Sensibility, and the Will, give forth their combined and
highest action in the attainment of this knowledge. As an
intellectual achievement, this is the highest possible to the
Reason. She attains then, to the Ultima Thule of all effort,
and of this she is fully conscious. Nor is there awakened
any feverish complaining that there are no more worlds to
conquer. In the contemplation of the ineffable Goodness
she finds her everlasting occupation, and her eternal rest.
Plainly, then, both Reason and Revelation teach but a single,
and that the <i>a priori</i> method, by which to establish for man<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
the fact of the being of God. Let us buttress this conclusion
with other lines of thought.</p>

<p>Reader, now that it is suggested to you, does it not seem in
the highest degree improbable, that the most important truths
which can pertain to man, truths which do not concern
primarily the affairs of this life, but of his most exalted life,
the life of the spiritual person as the companion of its Creator,
should be based upon an inferior, less satisfactory, and less
adequate foundation of knowledge, than those of our childhood's
studies, of the arithmetic and the algebra? The boy
who cons the first pages of his arithmetical text-book, soon
learns what he knows to be <i>self-evident</i> truths. He who
should offer to <i>prove</i> the truth of the multiplication-table,
would only expose himself to ridicule. When the boy has
attained to youth, and advanced in his studies, the pages of
the algebra and geometry are laid before him, and he finds
new and higher orders of self-evident truths. Would any
evidence, any argument, strengthen his conviction of the
validity of the axioms? Yea, rather, if one should begin to
offer arguments, would he not instinctively and rightfully
feel that the confession was thereby tacitly made, that self-evidence
was not satisfactory; and would he not, finding his
spontaneous impulse, and his education, so contradictory, be
<i>liable</i> to fall into complete skepticism? If now there be this
spontaneous, yea, abiding, yea, unalterable, yea, universal
conviction respecting matters of subordinate importance, can
it be possible,&mdash;I repeat the question, for it seems to carry
with it irresistibly its own and the decisive answer,&mdash;can it be
possible that the decisions of questions of the highest moment,
that the knowledge of the principles of our moral being and
of the moral government to which we are amenable, and
most of all of the Governor who is at once Creator, Lawgiver,
and Judge, is not based on at least equally spontaneous,
yea, abiding, yea, unalterable, yea, universal convictions?
And when the teacher seemingly, and may it not with truth
be said <i>actually</i>, distrusting the reliability of such a conviction,<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
goes about to bolster up his belief, and the belief of his pupil,
in the existence of God, and thereto rakes together, with
painstaking labor, many sticks and straws of evidence, instead
of looking up to the truth which shines directly down upon
him with steady ineffable effulgence, is it at all strange that
the sharper-eyed pupil, keenly appreciating the contradiction
between his spontaneous conviction and his teaching, should
become uncertain which to follow, a doubter, and finally a
confirmed skeptic? If, then, it is incredible that the fundamental
principles of man's moral nature&mdash;that to which all
the other elements of his being are subordinate, and for which
they were created&mdash;are established on inferior grounds, and
those less satisfactory than the grounds of other principles;
and if, on the other hand, the conviction is irresistible, that
they are established on the highest grounds, and since the
truths of mathematics are also based on the highest ground,
self-evidence, and since there can be none higher than the
highest, it follows that the moral principles of the Universe,
so far as they can be known by man, have <i>precisely the same
foundation of truthfulness as the principles of mathematics&mdash;they
are</i> <span class="smcap">self-evident</span>.</p>

<p>But some good Reader will check at the result now attained
because it involves the position that the human Reason is the
final standard of truth for man. Good reader, this position
is involved, and is true; and for the sake of Christ's religion
it must be taken. The only possible ground for a thoroughly
satisfactory and thoroughly unanswerable Christian Philosophy,
is the principle that <i>The human Reason is the final
standard of truth for man</i>.</p>

<p>It has been customary for the devout Bible-reader to esteem
that book as his final standard; and to such an extent in
many instances has his reverential regard for it been carried,
that the expression will hardly be too strong for truth, that
it has become an object of worship; and upon the mind of
such a one the above assertion will produce a shock. While
the author would treat with respect every religious feeling,<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
he would still remind such a person that the Bible is the
moral school-book of the spiritual person in man, which God
himself prepared for man's use, and must in every case be
inferior and subordinate to the being whom it was meant to
educate; and furthermore, that, by the very fact of making
man, God established in him the standard, and the right to
require that this fact be recognized. Mark, God made the
standard and thus established the right. This principle may
be supported by the following considerations:</p>

<p>1. The church universally has acted upon it; and none
have employed it more vigorously than those who have in
terms most bitterly opposed it. One of the class just referred
to affirms that the Bible is the standard of truth. "Admit,"
says a friend standing by, "that it would be if it were what
it purports to be; but what evidence is there that this is the
case." Thereupon the champion presents evidence from the
fathers, and evidence from the book itself; and finally closes
by saying, that such an array of evidence is ample to satisfy
any <i>reasonable</i> man of its truth and validity. His argument
is undoubtedly satisfactory; but if he has not appealed to
a reasonable man, <i>i. e.</i> to the Reason, <i>i. e.</i>, if he has not
acknowledged a standard for <i>the</i> standard, and thus has not
tacitly, unconsciously and yet decisively employed the Reason
as the highest standard of truth, then his conduct has for us
no adequate expression.</p>

<p>2. Nicodemus and Christ, in express terms, recognized the
validity of this standard. Said the ruler to Christ, "We
know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man
can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with
him."&mdash;<i>John</i> III. 2. In these words, he both recognized
the validity of the standard, and the fact that its requirements
had been met. But decisively emphatic are the words of
our Saviour: "If I had not done among them the works
which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now
have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."&mdash;<i>John</i>
XV. 24. As if he had said, "While I appeared among<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
them simply as a man, I had no right to claim from them a
belief in my mission; but when I had given them adequate
and ample evidence of my heavenly character, when, in a
word, I had by my works satisfied all the rational demands
for evidence which they could make, then no excuse remained
for their rejection of me."</p>

<p>The doctrine of this treatise, that man may know the truth,
and know God, is one which will never be too largely reflected
upon by the human mind, or too fully illustrated in human
thought. In no better strain can we bring our work to a close
than by offering some reflections on those words of Jesus
Christ which have formed the title of our book.</p>

<p>"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,
'If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed;
and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free.'"&mdash;<i>John</i> VIII. 31, 32. Throughout all the acts of
Christ, as recorded in John and especially during the last
days of his life, there may be traced the marks of a super-human
effort to express to the Jews, in the most skilful manner,
the nature and purport of his mission. He appeared to
them a man; and yet it would seem as if the Godhead in
him struggled with language to overcome its infirmities, and
express with perfectest skill his extraordinary character and
work. But "he came unto his own, and his own received
him not." Being then such, even the Divine Man, Jesus
Christ possessed in his own right <i>an absolute and exhaustive
metaphysic</i>. We study out some laws in some of their applications;
he knew all laws in all their applications. In these
his last days he was engaged in making the most profound
and highly philosophical revelations to his followers that one
being ever made to another. Or does the reader prefer to call
them religious? Very well: for here Religion and Philosophy
are identical. Being engaged in such a labor, it is certain
that no merely human teacher ever used words with the careful
balancing, the skilful selection, the certain exactitude,
that Jesus did. Hence in the most emphatic sense may it be<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
said, that, whether he used figurative or literal language, he
meant just what he said. The terms used in the text quoted
are literal terms, and undoubtedly the passage is to be taken
in its most literal signification. In these words then, in this
passage of the highest philosophical import, is to be found the
basis of the whole <i>a priori</i> philosophy. They were spoken
of the most important truths, those which pertain to the soul's
everlasting welfare; but as the greater includes the less, so
do they include all lesser science. In positive and unmistakable
terms has Christ declared the fact of knowledge.
God knows all truth. In so far as we also know the truth,
in so far are we like him. And mark, this is knowledge, a
purely intellectual act. Love is indeed a <i>condition</i> of the act,
but it is not the very act itself.</p>

<p>On this subject it is believed that the Christian church has
failed to assert the most accurate doctrine. Too generally
has this knowledge been termed a spiritual knowledge, meaning
thereby, a sort of an impression of happiness made upon
the spiritual sensibility; and this state of bliss has been
represented as in the highest degree desirable. Beyond all
question it is true, that, when the spiritual person, with the
eye of Reason, sees, and thus knows the truth, seeing it and
knowing it because his whole being, will, and intellect is consecrated
to, wrapt in the effort, and he is searching for it as
for hid treasures, there will roll over his soul some ripples of
that ineffable Delight which is a boundless ocean in Deity.
But this state of the Sensibility follows after, and is dependent
upon, the act of love, and the act of knowledge. There should
be, there was made in Christ's mind, a distinction in the
various psychical modifications of him who had sold all that
he had to buy the one pearl. The words of Christ are to be
taken, then, as the words of the perfect philosopher, and the
perfect religionist. Bearing, as he did, the destiny of a world
on his heart, and burdened beyond all utterance by the mighty
load, his soul was full of the theme for which he was suffering,
he could speak to man only of his highest needs and his<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
highest capabilities. The truth which man may know, then,
is not only eternal,&mdash;all truth is eternal,&mdash;but it is that
eternal truth most important to him, the <i>a priori</i> laws of the
spiritual person and of all his relations. The what he is, the
why he is, and the what he ought to become, are the objects
of his examination. When, then, a spiritual person has performed
his highest act, the act of unconditional and entire
consecration to the search after the truth, <i>i. e.</i> to God; and
when, having done this he ever after puts away all lusts of
the flesh, he shall in this condition become absorbed, wrapt
away in the contemplation of the truth; then his spiritual eye
will be open, and will dart with its far-glancing, searching
gaze throughout the mysteries of the Universe, and he will
know the truth. Before, when he was absorbed in the pursuit
of the things of Sense, he could see almost no <i>a priori</i> principles
at all, and what he did see, only in their practical
bearing upon those material and transitory things which
perish with their using; but now balancing himself on tireless
pinion in the upper ether, anon he stoops to notice the
largest and highest and most important of those objects which
formerly with so much painful and painstaking labor he
climbed the rugged heights of sense to examine, and having
touched upon them cursorily, to supply the need of the hour,
he again spreads his powerful God-given wings of faith and
love, and soars upward, upward, upward, towards the eternal
Sun, the infinite Person, the final Truth, God. Then does
he come to comprehend, "to <span class="smcap">know</span>, with all saints, what is
the height and depth and length and breadth of the love of
God." Then do the pure <i>a priori</i> laws, especially those of
the relations of spiritual persons, <i>i. e.</i> of the moral government
of God, come full into the field of his vision. Then in
the clear blaze, in the noonday effulgence of the ineffable,
eternal Sun, does he see the Law which binds God as it
binds man,&mdash;that Law so terrible in its demands upon him
who had violated it, that the infinite Person himself could
find no other way of escape for sinning man but in sending<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
"his only-begotten Son into the world." And he who is
lifted up to this knowledge needs no other revelation. All
other knowledge is a child's lesson-book to him. All lower
study is tasteless; all lower life is neglected, forgotten. He
studies forever the pure equations of truth; he lives in the
bosom of God. Such an one may all his life-long have been
utterly ignorant of books. A poor negro on some rice plantation,
he may have learned of God only by the hearing of
the ear, but by one act, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, he has passed all the gradations of earthly knowledge,
and taken his seat on the topmost form in heaven. He
received little instruction from men; but forevermore God
is his teacher.</p>

<p>This of which we have been speaking is, be it remembered,
no rhapsody of the imagination. It is a simple literal fact
respecting man's intellect. It is the same in kind, though
of far nobler import, as if upon this act of consecration
there should be revealed to every consecrated one, in a sudden
overwhelming burst of light, the whole <i>a priori</i> system of the
physical Universe. This is not so revealed because it is not
essential, and so would only gratify curiosity. The other and
the higher is revealed, because it is essential to man's spiritual
life.</p>

<p>In the culminating act, then, of a spiritual person, in the
unreserved, the absolute consecration of the whole being to
the search after truth, do we find that common goal to which
an <i>a priori</i> philosophy inevitably leads us, and which the
purest, Christ's, religion teaches us. Thus does it appear that
in their highest idea Philosophy and Religion are identical.
The Rock upon which both alike are grounded is eternal.
The principles of both have the highest possible evidence,
for they are self-evident; and, having them given by the
intuition of the Reason, a man can cipher out the whole
natural scheme of the Universe as he would cipher out a
problem in equations. He has not done it, because he is
wicked; and God has given him the Bible, as the mathematical<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
astronomy of the moral heavens, as a school-book to
lead him back to the goal of his lost purity.</p>

<p>How beautiful, then, art thou, O Religion, supernal daughter
of the Deity! how noble in thy magnificent pre&euml;minence!
how dazzling in thy transcendent loveliness! Thou sittest
afar on a throne of pearl; thy diadem the Morning Stars, thy
robe the glory of God. Founded is thy throne on Eternity;
and from eternity to eternity all thy laws are enduring truth.
Sitting thus, O Queen, more firmly throned than the snow-capped
mountains, calmer than the ocean's depths, in the
surety of thy self-conscious integrity and truth, thou mayest,
with mien of noblest dignity, in unwavering confidence, throw
down the gauntlet of thy challenge to the assembled doubters
of the Universe.</p>

<p>It may be that to some minds, unaccustomed to venturing
out fearlessly on the ocean of thought, with an unwavering
trust in the pole-star truth in the human soul, certain of the
positions attained and maintained in this volume will seem to
involve the destruction of all essential distinction between the
Creator and the created. If the universe is a definite and
limited object, some created being may, at some period, come
to know every atom of it. Moreover, if there is a definite
number of the qualities and attributes&mdash;the endowments of
Deity, some one may learn the number, and what they are,
and come at length to have a knowledge equal to God's knowledge.
Even if this possibility should be admitted,&mdash;which
it is not, for a reason to appear further on,&mdash;yet it would in
no way involve that the creature had, in any the least degree,
reduced the difference in <i>kind</i> which subsists between him
and the Creator. A consideration of the following distinctive
marks will, it would seem, be decisive upon this point.</p>

<p>God is self-existent. His creatures are dependent upon
him. Self-existence is an essential, inherent, untransferable
attribute of Deity; and so is not a possible attainment for
any creature. Every creature is necessarily dependent upon
the Creator every moment, for his continuance in being.<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
Let him attain ever so high a state of knowledge; let him, if
the supposition were rational, acquire a knowledge equal to
that of Deity; let him be endowed with all the power he could
use, and he would not have made, nor could he make an effort
even, in the direction of removing his dependence upon his
Creator. In the very height of his glory, in the acme of his
attainment, it would need only that God rest an instant, cease
to sustain him, and he would not be, he would have gone out,
as the light goes out on a burner when one turns the faucet.</p>

<p>Again, the mode by which their knowledge is attained is
different in kind; and the creature never can acquire the
Creator's mode. The Deity possesses his knowledge as a
necessary endowment, given to him at once, by a spontaneous
intuition. Hence he could never learn, for there was no
knowledge which he did not already possess. Thus he is out
of all relation to Time. The creature, on the other hand,
can never acquire any knowledge except through processes;
and, what is more, can never review the knowledge already
acquired, except by a process which occupies a time. This
relation of the creature to Time is organic; and this distinction
between the creature and Creator is thus also irremovable.</p>

<p>Another organic distinction is that observed in the mode
of seeing ideals. The Divine Reason not only gives ideas,
<i>a priori</i> laws, but it gives all possible images, which those
laws, standing in their natural relations to each other, can
become. Thus all ideals are realized to him, whether the
creative energy goes forth, and power is organized in accordance
therewith, or not. Here again the creature is of the
opposite kind. The creature can never have an idea until he
has been educated by contact with a material universe; and
then can never construct an ideal, except he have first seen
the elements of that ideal realized in material forms. To
illustrate: The infant has no ideas; and there is no radical
difference between the beginning of a human being and any
other created spiritual person. He has a rudimentary Reason,<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
but it must grow before it can make its presentations,
and the means of its education must be a material system.
Let a spiritual person be created, and set in the Universe,
utterly isolated, with no medium of communication, and it
would stay forever just what it was at the beginning, a dry
seed. The necessity of alliance with a material Universe is
equally apparent in the mature spiritual person. Such a
one cannot construct a single ideal, except he have seen all
the elements already in material forms. He who will attempt
to construct an ideal of any <i>thing</i>, which never has been, as a
griffin, and not put into it any form of animals which have
been on earth, will immediately appreciate the unquestionableness
of this position. Therefore it is that no one can,
"by searching, find out God." The creature can only learn
what the Creator declares to him.</p>

<p>Still another element of distinction, equally marked and
decisive as those just named, may be mentioned. The Deity
possesses as inherent and immanent endowment Power, or
the ability of himself to realize his ideals in objects. Thus
is he the Creator. If this were not so, there could have
been no Universe, for there was no substance and no one to
furnish a substance but he. The creature, on the other hand,
cannot receive as a gift, neither attain by culture the power
to create. Hence he can only realize his ideals in materials
furnished to his hand. Pigments and brushes and chisels and
marble must be before painters and sculptors can become.</p>

<p>Each and every one of the distinctions above made is
<i>organic</i>. They cannot be eliminated. In fact their removal
is not a possible object of effort. The creature may <i>wish</i>
them removed; but no line of thought can be studied out by
which a movement can be made towards the attainment of
that wish. It would seem, then, that, such being the facts, the
fullest scope might fearlessly be allowed to the legitimate use
of every power of the creature. Such, it is believed, is God's
design.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
