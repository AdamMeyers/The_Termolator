CHAPTER I
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
MRS. WIGGS'S PHILOSOPHY
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "In the mud and scum of things<BR>
    Something always always sings!"<BR>
</P>

<P>
"MY, but it's nice an' cold this mornin'! The thermometer's done
fell up to zero!"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs made the statement as cheerfully as if her elbows were
not sticking out through the boy's coat that she wore, or her teeth
chattering in her head like a pair of castanets. But, then, Mrs.
Wiggs was a philosopher, and the sum and substance of her philosophy
lay in keeping the dust off her rose-colored spectacles. When Mr.
Wiggs traveled to eternity by the alcohol route, she buried his
faults with him, and for want of better virtues to extol she always
laid stress on the fine hand he wrote. It was the same way when
their little country home burned and she had to come to the city to
seek work; her one comment was: "Thank God, it was the pig instid of
the baby that was burned!"
</P>

<P>
So this bleak morning in December she pinned the bed-clothes around
the children and made them sit up close to the stove, while she
pasted brown paper over the broken window-pane and made sprightly
comments on the change in the weather.
</P>

<P>
The Wiggses lived in the Cabbage Patch. It was not a real cabbage
patch, but a queer neighborhood, where ramshackle cottages played
hop-scotch over the railroad tracks. There were no streets, so when
a new house was built the owner faced it any way his fancy prompted.
Mr. Bagby's grocery, it is true, conformed to convention, and
presented a solid front to the railroad track, but Miss Hazy's
cottage shied off sidewise into the Wiggses' yard, as if it were
afraid of the big freight-trains that went thundering past so many
times a day; and Mrs. Schultz's front room looked directly into the
Eichorns' kitchen. The latter was not a bad arrangement, however,
for Mrs. Schultz had been confined to her bed for ten years, and her
sole interest in life consisted in watching what took place in her
neighbor's family.
</P>

<P>
The Wiggses' house was the most imposing in the neighborhood. This
was probably due to the fact that it had two front doors and a tin
roof. One door was nailed up, and the other opened outdoors, but you
would never guess it from the street. When the country house burned,
one door had been saved. So Mrs. Wiggs and the boys brought it to
the new home and skilfully placed it at the front end of the side
porch. But the roof gave the house its chief distinction; it was the
only tin roof in the Cabbage Patch. Jim and Billy had made it of old
cans which they picked up on the commons.
</P>

<P>
Jim was fifteen and head of the family; his shoulders were those of
a man, and were bent with work, but his body dwindled away to a pair
of thin legs that seemed incapable of supporting the burden imposed
upon them. In his anxious eyes was the look of a bread-winner who
had begun the struggle too soon. Life had been a tragedy to Jim: the
tragedy that comes when a child's sensitive soul is forced to meet
the responsibilities of manhood, yet lacks the wisdom that only
experience can bring.
</P>

<P>
Billy Wiggs was differently constituted; responsibilities rested
upon him as lightly as the freckles on his nose. When occasion or
his mother demanded he worked to good purposes with a tenacity that
argued well for his future success, but for the most part he played
and fought and got into trouble with the aptitude characteristic of
the average small boy.
</P>

<P>
It was Mrs. Wiggs's boast that her three little girls had geography
names; first came Asia, then Australia. When the last baby arrived,
Billy had stood looking down at the small bundle and asked
anxiously: "Are you goin' to have it fer a boy or a girl, ma?" Mrs.
Wiggs had answered: "A girl, Billy, an' her name's Europena!"
</P>

<P>
On this particular Sunday morning Mrs. Wiggs bustled about the
kitchen in unusual haste.
</P>

<P>
"I am goin' to make you all some nice Irish pertater soup fer
dinner," she said, as she came in from the parlor, where she kept
her potatoes and onions. "The boys'll be in soon, an' we'll have
to hurry and git through 'fore the childern begin to come to
Sunday-school."
</P>

<P>
For many years Sunday afternoon had been a trying time in the
neighborhood, so Mrs. Wiggs had organized a Sunday-school class at
which she presided.
</P>

<P>
"If there don't come Chris an' Pete a'ready!" said Asia, from her
post by the stove; "I bet they've had their dinner, an' jes' come
early to git some of ours!"
</P>

<P>
"Why, Asia!" exclaimed Mrs. Wiggs, "that ain't hospit'le, an' Chris
with one leg, too! 'T ain't no trouble at all. All I got to do is to
put a little more water in the soup, an' me and Jim won't take but
one piece of bread."
</P>

<P>
When Jim and Billy came in they found their places at the table
taken, so they sat on the floor and drank their soup out of
tea-cups.
</P>

<P>
"Gee!" said Billy, after the third help, "I've drinken so much that
when I swallers a piece er bread I can hear it splash!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, you boys git up now, an' go out and bring me in a couple of
planks to put acrost the cheers fer the childern to set on."
</P>

<P>
By two o 'clock the Sunday-school had begun; every seat in the
kitchen, available and otherwise, was occupied. The boys sat in the
windows and on the table, and the girls squeezed together on the
improvised benches. Mrs. Wiggs stood before them with a dilapidated
hymn-book in her hand.
</P>

<P>
"Now, you all must hush talking so we kin all sing a hymn; I'll
read it over, then we'll all sing it together.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    'When upon life's billers you are tempest tossed,<BR>
    When you are discouraged thinking all is lost,<BR>
    Count yer many blessin's, name 'em one by one,<BR>
    An' it will surprise you what the Lord hath done!'"<BR>
</P>

<P>
Clear and strong rose the childish voices in different keys and
regardless of time, but with a genuine enthusiasm that was in itself
a blessing. When they had sung through the three stanzas Mrs. Wiggs
began the lesson.
</P>

<P>
"What did we study 'bout last Sunday?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
No response, save a smothered giggle from two of the little girls.
</P>

<P>
"Don't you all remember what the Lord give Moses up on the
mountain?"
</P>

<P>
A hand went up in the corner, and an eager voice cried:
</P>

<P>
"Yas'm, I know! Lord give Moses ten tallers, an' he duveled 'em."
</P>

<P>
Before Mrs. Wiggs could enter into an argument concerning this new
version of sacred history, she was hit in the eye with a paper wad.
It was aimed at Billy, but when he dodged she became the victim.
This caused some delay, for she had to bathe the injured member, and
during the interval the Sunday-school became riotous.
</P>

<P>
"Mith Wiggs, make Tommy thop thpittin' terbaccer juice in my hat!"
</P>

<P>
"Miss Wiggs, I know who hit you!"
</P>

<P>
"Teacher, kin I git a drink?"
</P>

<P>
It was not until Mrs. Wiggs, with a stocking tied over her eye,
emerged from the bedroom and again took command that order was
restored.
</P>

<P>
"Where is Bethlehem?" she began, reading from an old lesson-paper.
</P>

<P>
"You kin search me!" promptly answered Chris.
</P>

<P>
She ignored his remark, and passed to the next, who said, half
doubtfully:
</P>

<P>
"Ain't it in Alabama?"
</P>

<P>
"No, it's in the Holy Land," she said.
</P>

<P>
A sudden commotion arose in the back of the room. Billy, by a series
of skilful manoeuvers, had succeeded in removing the chair that held
one of the planks, and a cascade of small, indignant girls were
tobogganing sidewise down the incline. A fight was imminent, but
before any further trouble occurred Mrs. Wiggs locked Billy in the
bedroom, and became mistress of the situation.
</P>

<P>
"What I think you childern need is a talk about fussin' an'
fightin'. There ain't no use in me teachin' what they done a
thousand years ago, when you ain't got manners enough to listen at
what I am sayin'. I recollect one time durin' the war, when the
soldiers was layin' 'round the camp, tryin' they best to keep from
freezin' to death, a preacher come 'long to hold a service. An' when
he got up to preach he sez, 'Friends,' sez he, 'my tex' is
Chillblains. They ain't no use a-preachin' religion to men whose
whole thought is set on their feet. Now, you fellows git some
soft-soap an' pour it in yer shoes, an' jes' keep them shoes on till
yer feet gits well, an' the nex' time I come 'round yer minds'll be
better prepared to receive the word of the Lord.' Now, that's the
way I feel 'bout this here Sunday-school. First an' fo'most, I am
goin' to learn you all manners. Jes' one thought I want you to take
away, an' that is, it's sinful to fuss. Ma use' to say livin' was
like quiltin'&mdash;you orter keep the peace an' do 'way with the
scraps. Now, what do I want you all to remember?"
</P>

<P>
"Don't fuss!" came the prompt answer.
</P>

<P>
"That's right; now we'll sing 'Pull fer the shore.'"
</P>

<P>
When the windows had ceased to rattle from the vibrations of the
lusty chorus, Mrs. Wiggs lifted her hands for silence.
</P>

<P>
"O Lord!" she prayed earnestly, "help these here childern to be good
an' kind to each other, an' to their mas an' their pas. Make 'em
thankful fer whatever they 'are got, even if it ain't but a little.
Show us all how to live like you want us to live, an' praise God
from whom all blessin's flow. Amen."
</P>

<P>
As the last youngster scampered out of the yard, Mrs. Wiggs turned
to the window where Jim was standing. He had taken no part in the
singing, and was silent and preoccupied. "Jim," said his mother,
trying to look into his face, "you never had on yer overcoat when
you come in. You ain't gone an' sold it?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," said the boy, heavily; "but 't ain't 'nough fer the rent. I
got to figger it out some other way."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs put her arm about his shoulder, and together they looked
out across the dreary commons.
</P>

<P>
"Don't you worry so, Jimmy," said she. "Mebbe I kin git work
to-morrow, or you'll git a raise, or somethin'; they'll be some
way."
</P>

<P>
Little she guessed what the way was to be.

WAYS AND MEANS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "Ah! well may the children weep before you!<BR>
    They are weary ere they run;<BR>
    They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory<BR>
    Which is brighter than the Sun."<BR>
</P>

<P>
THE cold wave that was ushered in that December morning was the
beginning of a long series of days that vied with each other as to
which could induce the mercury to drop the lowest. The descent of
the temperature seemed to have a like effect on the barrel of
potatoes and the load of coal in the Wiggses' parlor.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs's untiring efforts to find employment had met with no
success, and Jim's exertions were redoubled; day by day his scanty
earnings became less sufficient to meet the demands of the family.
</P>

<P>
On Christmas eve they sat over the stove, after the little ones had
gone to bed, and discussed the situation. The wind hurled itself
against the house in a very frenzy of rage, shaking the icicles from
the window-ledge and hissing through the patched panes. The snow
that sifted in through the loose sash lay unmelted on the sill. Jim
had a piece of old carpet about him, and coughed with almost every
breath. Mrs. Wiggs's head was in her hands, and the tears that
trickled through her crooked fingers hissed as they fell on the
stove. It was the first time Jim had ever seen her give up.
</P>

<P>
"Seems like we'll have to ast fer help, Jim," she said. "I can't
ast fer credit at Mr. Bagby's; seems like I'd never have the
courage to pull agin a debt. What do you think? I guess&mdash;it looks
like mebbe we'll have to apply to the organization."
</P>

<P>
Jim's eyes flashed. "Not yet, ma!" he said, firmly. "It 'ud be with
us like it was with the Hornbys; they didn't have nothin' to eat,
and they went to the organization ant the man asted 'em if they had
a bed or a table, an' when they said yes, he said, 'Well, why don't
you sell 'em?' No, ma! As long as we've got coal I'll git the
vittles some way!" He had to pause, for a violent attack of coughing
shook him from head to foot. "I think I can git a night job next
week; one of the market-men comes in from the country ever' night to
git a early start next morning an' he ast me if I'd sleep in his
wagon from three to six an' keep his vegetables from bein' stole.
That 'ud gimme time to git home an' git breakfast, an' be down to
the fact'ry by seven."
</P>

<P>
"But, Jimmy boy," cried his mother, her voice quivering with
anxiety, "you never could stan' it night an' day too! No, I'll
watch the wagon; I'll&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
A knock on the parlor door interrupted her. She hastily dried her
eyes and smoothed her hair. Jim went to the door.
</P>

<P>
"I've a Christmas basket for you!" cried a cheery voice.
</P>

<P>
"Is this Christmas?" Jim asked dully.
</P>

<P>
The girl in the doorway laughed. She was tall and slender, but Jim
could only see a pair of sparkling eyes between the brim of the hat
and her high fur collar. It was nice to hear her laugh, though; it
made things seem warmer somehow. The colored man behind her
deposited a large basket on the doorstep.
</P>

<P>
"It's from the church," she explained; "a crowd of us are out in
the omnibus distributing baskets."
</P>

<P>
"Well, how'd you ever happen to come here?" cried Mrs. Wiggs, who
had come to the door.
</P>

<P>
"There is one for each of the mission-school families; just a little
Christmas greeting, you know."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs's spirits were rising every minute. "Well, that certainly
is kind an' thoughtful like," she said. "Won't you&mdash;" she hesitated;
the room she had just left was not in a condition to receive guests,
but Mrs. Wiggs was a Kentuckian. "Come right in an' git warm," she
said cordially; "the stove's died down some, but you could git
thawed out."
</P>

<P>
"No, thank you, I can't come in," said the young lady, with a side
glance at Jim, who was leaning against the door. "Have you plenty of
coal?" she asked, in an undertone.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes'm, thank you," said Mrs. Wiggs, smiling reassuringly. Her
tone might have been less confident, but for Jim's warning glance.
Every fiber of his sensitive nature shrank from asking help.
</P>

<P>
The girl was puzzled; she noticed the stamp of poverty on everything
in sight except the bright face of the little woman before her.
</P>

<P>
"Well," she said doubtfully, "if you ever want&mdash;to come to see me,
ask for Miss Lucy Olcott at Terrace Park. Good night, and a happy
Christmas!"
</P>

<P>
She was gone, and the doorway looked very black and lonesome in
consequence. But there was the big basket to prove she was not
merely an apparition, and it took both Jim and his mother to carry
it in. Sitting on the floor, they unpacked it. There were
vegetables, oatmeal, fruit, and even tea and coffee. But the
surprise was at the very bottom! A big turkey, looking so comical
with his legs stuck in his body that Jim laughed outright.
</P>

<P>
"It's the first turkey that's been in this house fer many a day!"
said Mrs. Wiggs, delightedly, as she pinched the fat fowl. "I 'spect
Europena'll be skeered of it, it's so big. My, but we'll have a
good dinner to-morrow! I'll git Miss Hazy an' Chris to come over
an' spend the day, and I'll carry a plate over to Mrs. Schultz, an'
take a little o' this here tea to ole Mrs. Lawson."
</P>

<P>
The cloud had turned inside out for Mrs. Wiggs, and only the silver
lining was visible. Jim was doing a sum on the brown paper that came
over the basket, and presently he looked up and said slowly:
</P>

<P>
"Ma, I guess we can't have the turkey this year. I kin sell it fer a
dollar seventy-five, and that would buy us hog-meat fer a good
while."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs's face fell, and she twisted her apron-string in silence.
She had pictured the joy of a real Christmas dinner, the first the
youngest children had ever known; she had already thought of half a
dozen neighbors to whom she wanted to send "a little snack." But one
look at Jim's anxious face recalled their circumstances.
</P>

<P>
"Of course we'll sell it," she said brightly. "You have got the
longest head fer a boy! We'll sell it in the mornin', an' buy
sausage fer dinner, an' I'll cook some of these here nice
vegetables an' put a orange an' some candy at each plate, an' the
childern'll never know nothin' 'bout it. Besides," she added, "if
you ain't never et turkey meat you don't know how good it is."
</P>

<P>
But in spite of her philosophy, after Jim had gone to bed she
slipped over and took one more look at the turkey.
</P>

<P>
"I think I wouldn't 'a' minded so much," she said, wistfully, "ef
they hadn't 'a' sent the cramberries, too!"
</P>

<P>
For ten days the basket of provisions and the extra money made by
Jim's night work and Mrs. Wiggs's washing supplied the demands of
the family; but by the end of January the clouds had gathered
thicker than before.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs's heart was heavy, one night, as she tramped home through
the snow after a hard day's work. The rent was due, the coal was
out, and only a few potatoes were left in the barrel. But these were
mere shadow troubles, compared to Jim's illness; he had been too
sick to go to the factory that morning, and she dared not think what
changes the day may have brought. As she lifted the latch of her
rickety door the sobbing of a child greeted her; it was little
Europena, crying for food. For three days there had been no bread in
the house, and a scanty supply of potatoes and beans had been their
only nourishment.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs hastened to where Jim lay on a cot in the corner; his
cheeks were flushed, and his thin, nervous fingers picked at the old
shawl that covered him.
</P>

<P>
"Jim," she said, kneeling beside him and pressing his hot hand to
her cheek, "Jim, darling lemme go fer the doctor. You're worser
than you was this mornin', an'&mdash;an'&mdash;I'm so skeered!" Her voice
broke in a sob.
</P>

<P>
Jim tried to put his arm around her, but something hurt him in his
chest when he moved, so he patted her hand instead.
</P>

<P>
"Never mind, ma," he said, his breath coming short; "we ain't got no
money to buy the medicine, even if the doctor did come. You go git
some supper, now; an', ma, don't worry; I'm goin' to take keer of
you all! Only&mdash;only," he added, wearily, "I guess I can't sleep in
the wagon to-night."
</P>

<P>
Slowly the hours passed until midnight. Mrs. Wiggs had pulled Jim's
cot close to the stove, and applied vigorous measures to relieve
him. Her efforts were unceasing, and one after another the homely
country remedies were faithfully administered. At twelve o'clock he
grew restless.
</P>

<P>
"Seems like I'm hot, then agin I'm cold," he said, speaking with
difficulty. "Could you find a little somethin' more to put over me,
ma?"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs got up and went toward the bed. The three little girls
lay huddled under one old quilt, their faces pale and sunken. She
turned away abruptly, and looked toward the corner where Billy slept
on a pallet. The blankets on his bed were insufficient even for him.
She put her hands over her face, and for a moment dry sobs convulsed
her. The hardest grief is often that which leaves no trace. When she
went back to the stove she had a smile ready for the sick boy.
</P>

<P>
"Here's the very thing," she said; "it's my dress skirt. I don't
need it a mite, settin' up here so clost to the fire. See how nice
it tucks in all 'round!"
</P>

<P>
For a while he lay silent, then he said: "Ma, are you 'wake?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Jim."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I bin thinking it over. If I ain't better in the morning I
guess&mdash;" the words came reluctantly&mdash;"I guess you'd better go
see the Christmas lady. I wouldn't mind her knowin' so much. 'T
won't be fer long, nohow, cause I kin take keer of you all
soon&mdash;soon 's I kin git up."
</P>

<P>
The talking brought on severe coughing, and he sank back exhausted.
</P>

<P>
"Can't you go to sleep, honey?" asked his mother.
</P>

<P>
"No, it's them ole wheels," he said fretfully, "them wheels at the
fact'ry; when I git to sleep they keep on wakin' me up."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs's hands were rough and knotted, but love taught them to
be gentle as she smoothed his hot head.
</P>

<P>
"Want me to tell you 'bout the country, Jim?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
Since he was a little boy he had loved to hear of their old home in
the valley. His dim recollection of it all formed his one conception
of heaven.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, ma; mebbe it will make me fergit the wheels," he said.
</P>

<P>
"Well," she began, putting her head beside his on the pillow, so he
could not watch her face, "it was all jes' like a big front yard
without no fences, an' the flowers didn't belong to folks like they
do over on the avenue, where you dassent pick a one; but they was
God's, an' you was welcome to all you could pull. An' there was
trees, Jim, where you could climb up an' git big red apples, an'
when the frost 'ud come they'd be persimmons that 'ud jes' melt in
yer mouth. An' you could look 'way off 'crost the meaders, an' see
the trees a-wavin' in the sunshine, an' up over yer head the birds
'ud be singin' like they was never goin' to stop. An' yer pa an' me
'ud take you out at the harvestin' time, an' you 'ud play on the
hay-stacks. I kin remember jes' how you looked, Jim&mdash;a fat little
boy, with red cheeks a-laughin' all the time."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs could tell no more, for the old memories were too much
for her. Jim scarcely knew when she stopped; his eyes were half
closed, and a sweet drowsiness was upon him.
</P>

<P>
"It's nice an' warm in the sunshine," he murmured; "the meaders an'
trees&mdash;laughin' all the time! Birds singin', singin', singin'."
</P>

<P>
Then Jim began to sing too, softly and monotonously, and the sorrow
that had not come with years left his tired face, and he fearlessly
drifted away into the Shadowy Valley where his lost childhood lay.

THE "CHRISTMAS LADY"
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "The rosy glow of summer<BR>
    Is on thy dimpled cheek,<BR>
    While in thy heart the winter<BR>
    Is lying cold and bleak.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "But this shall change hereafter,<BR>

</P>

<P>
LATE the next afternoon a man and a girl were standing in the Olcott
reception hall. The lamps had not been lighted, but the blaze from
the back-log threw a cozy glow of comfort over the crimson curtains
and on the mass of bright-hued pillows in the window-seat.
</P>

<P>
Robert Redding, standing with his hat in his hand, would have been
gone long ago if the "Christmas Lady" had not worn her violet gown.
He said it always took him half an hour to say good-by when she wore
a rose in her hair, and a full hour when she had on the violet
dress.
</P>

<P>
"By Jove, stand there a minute just as you are! The fire-light
shining through your hair makes you look like a saint. Little Saint
Lucinda!" he said teasingly, as he tried to catch her hand. She put
it behind her for safe-keeping.
</P>

<P>
"Not a saint at all?" he went on, in mock surprise; "then an
iceberg&mdash;a nice, proper little iceberg."
</P>

<P>
Lucy Olcott looked up at him for a moment in silence; he was very
tall and straight, and his face retained much of its boyishness, in
spite of the firm, square jaw.
</P>

<P>
"Robert," she said, suddenly grown serious, "I wish you would do
something for me."
</P>

<P>
"All right; what is it?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
She timidly put her hand on his, and looked up at him earnestly.
</P>

<P>
"It's about Dick Harris," she said. "I wish you would not be with
him so much."
</P>

<P>
Redding's face clouded. "You aren't afraid to trust me?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no; it isn't that," she said hurriedly; "but, Robert, it makes
people think such wrong things about you; I can't bear to have you
misjudged."
</P>

<P>
Redding put his arm around her, and together they stood looking down
into the glowing embers.
</P>

<P>
"Tell me about it, little girl; what have you heard?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
She hesitated. "It wasn't true what they said. I knew it wasn't
true, but they had no right to say it."
</P>

<P>
"Well, let's hear it, anyway. What was it?"
</P>

<P>
"Some people were here last night from New Orleans; they asked if I
knew you&mdash;said they knew you and Dick the year you spent there."
</P>

<P>
"Well?" said Redding.
</P>

<P>
Lucy evidently found it difficult to continue. "They said some
horrid things then, just because you were Dick's friend."
</P>

<P>
"What were they, Lucy?"
</P>

<P>
"They told me that you were both as wild as could be; that your
reputation was no better than his; that&mdash;forgive me, Robert, for
even repeating it. It made me very angry, and I told them it was not
true&mdash;not a word of it; that it was all Dick's fault; that he&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Lucy," interrupted Redding, peremptorily, "wait until you hear me!
I have never lied to you about anything, and I will not stoop to it
now. Four years ago, when those people knew me, I was just what they
said. Dick Harris and I went to New Orleans straight from college.
Neither of us had a home or people to care about us, so we went in
for a good time. At the end of the year I was sick of it all, braced
up, and came here. Poor Dick, he kept on."
</P>

<P>
At his first words the color had left Lucy's face, and she had
slipped to the opposite side of the fire, and stood watching him
with horrified eyes.
</P>

<P>
"But you were never like Dick!" she protested.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," he continued passionately, "and but for God's help I should
be like him still. It was an awful pull, and Heaven only knows how I
struggled. I never quite saw the use of it all, until I met you six
months ago; then I realized that the past four years had been given
me in which to make a man of myself."
</P>

<P>
As he finished speaking he saw, for the first time, that Lucy was
crying. He sprang forward, but she shrank away. "No, no, don't touch
me! I'm so terribly disappointed, and hurt, and&mdash;stunned."
</P>

<P>
"But you surely don't love me the less for having conquered these
things in the past?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know, I don't know," she said, with a sob. "I honored and
idealized you, Robert I can never think of you as being other than
you are now."
</P>

<P>
"But why should you?" he pleaded. "It was only one year out of my
life; too much, it's true, but I have atoned for it with all my
might."
</P>

<P>
The intensity and earnestness of his voice were beginning to
influence her. She was very young, with the stern, uncompromising
standards of girlhood; life was black or white to her, and time had
not yet filled in the canvas with the myriad grays that blend into
one another until all lines are effaced, and only the Master Artist
knows the boundaries.
</P>

<P>
She looked up through her tears. "I'll try to forgive you," she
said, tremulously; "but you must promise to give up your friendship
for Dick Harris."
</P>

<P>
Redding frowned and bit his lip. "That's not fair!" he said. "You
know Dick's my chum; that he hasn't the least influence over me;
that I am about the only one to stand by him."
</P>

<P>
"I am not afraid of his influence, but I don't want people to see
you together; it makes them say things."
</P>

<P>
"But, Lucy, you wouldn't have me go back on him? Dick has a big
heart; he's trying to brace up&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, nonsense!" cried Lucy, impatiently. The fire in her eyes had
dried the tears. "He could straighten up if he wanted to. He likes
to drink and gamble, so he does it, and you keep him in countenance
by your friendship. Are you hesitating between us?" she demanded
angrily.
</P>

<P>
Redding's face was clouded, and he spoke slowly: "You wouldn't ask
this of me, Lucy, if you understood. Dick and I have been chums
since we were boys. He came to Kentucky three months ago, sick and
miserable. One day he came into the office and said, 'Bob, you 've
pulled through all right; do you think it's too late for me to
try?' What would you have said?"
</P>

<P>
"What you did, probably," answered Lucy; "but I would have profited
by the one experience, for he has hardly drawn a sober breath
since." She looked out of the window across the snowy landscape, and
in her face was something of the passionless purity of the scene
upon which her eyes rested.
</P>

<P>
"You are mistaken," he cried fiercely. "Because you have seen him
several times in that condition, you have no right to draw such a
conclusion. He is weak, nobody denies it; but what can you know of
the struggle he makes, of his eagerness to do better, of the fight
that he is constantly making with himself?"
</P>

<P>
His words fell on deaf ears.
</P>

<P>
"Then you choose Mr. Harris?"
</P>

<P>
"Lucy, this is madness; it is not like you in the least!"
</P>

<P>
The girl was cold with anger and excitement. "It is bad enough," she
said, "to know that my defense of you last night was worse than
useless, but to have you persist in a friendship with a man who is
beneath you in every way is more than I can stand." She slipped a
ring from her finger, and held it toward him. "I could never marry a
man of whom I was ashamed."
</P>

<P>
The shot went home; there was a white line about Redding's mouth as
he turned away.
</P>

<P>
"I would not ask you to," he said, with simple dignity, as he opened
the door.
</P>

<P>
"Please, ma'am, is this Miss Olcott's?" asked a trembling voice on
the piazza. A shabby woman stood looking at them with wild eyes; her
gray hair had escaped from the torn shawl that was pinned over her
head, and stray locks blew across her face.
</P>

<P>
Lucy did not recognize her. "I will speak to you in a moment," she
said.
</P>

<P>
An awkward pause followed, each waiting for the other to speak.
</P>

<P>
"I will come when you send for me," said Redding, without looking at
her, and, turning abruptly, he strode down the steps and out into
the dusk.
</P>

<P>
Lucy caught her breath and started forward, then she remembered the
woman.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" she asked listlessly.
</P>

<P>
The woman stepped forward, and put out a hand to steady herself
against the door; her face was distorted, and her voice came in
gasps.
</P>

<P>
"You said I was to come if I needed you. It's Jimmy, ma'am&mdash;he's
dead!"
</P>

<P>
IT may be experience of suffering makes one especially tender to the
heart-aches of others; at any rate, the article that Lucy Olcott
wrote for the paper that night held the one touch of nature that
makes the whole world kin. She had taken Aunt Chloe, the old colored
servant, and gone home with Mrs. Wiggs, relieving as far as possible
the immediate need of the family. Then she had come home and written
their story, telling it simply, but with the passionate earnestness
of one who, for the first time, has come into contact with poverty
and starvation. She told of the plucky struggle made by the boy, of
his indomitable courage, of his final defeat, and she ended by
asking help of any kind for the destitute family.
</P>

<P>
A week later she sat at her desk bewildered. Her article, written on
the impulse of the moment, with the one thought of making people
understand, had fulfilled its mission. For seven days she had done
nothing but answer questions and notes, and receive contributions
for the Wiggs family. Money had arrived from all over the State, and
from every class of society. Eichenstine Bros. sent fifty dollars,
and six ragged newsboys came to present thirty cents. A lavender
note, with huge monogram and written in white ink, stated that some
of the girls of the "Gay Burlesque Troupe" sent a few dimes to the
"kid's" mother. The few dimes amounted to fifteen dollars. Mrs. Van
Larkin's coachman had to wait with her note while Lucy answered the
questions of a lame old negro who had brought a quarter.
</P>

<P>
"Maria done tole me what was writ in de papah 'bout dat pore Chile,"
he was saying. "I sutenly do feel sorry fer he's maw. I ain't got
much, but I tole Maria I guess we could do without somethin' to gib
a quahter."
</P>

<P>
So it continued. Old and young, rich and poor, paid their
substantial tribute of respect to Jimmy Wiggs.
</P>

<P>
Lucy counted up the long line of figures. "Three hundred and
sixty-five dollars!" she exclaimed; "and food, clothes, and coal
enough to last them a year!"
</P>

<P>
It was like a direct answer to her prayer, and yet this poor little
suppliant, instead of being duly exalted, put her head on the desk
and wept bitterly. Now that the need of the Wiggs family had been
met, another appeal, silent and potent, was troubling her heart.
</P>

<P>
Redding had neither come nor written, and she was beginning to
realize the seriousness of their misunderstanding.

CHAPTER IV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE ANNEXATION OF CUBY
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "They well deserve to have,<BR>
    That know the strongest and surest way to get."<BR>
</P>

<P>
ALMOST a year rolled over the Cabbage Patch, and it was nearing
Christmas again. The void left in Mrs. Wiggs's heart by Jim's death
could never be filled, but time was beginning to soften her grief,
and the necessity for steady employment kept her from brooding over
her trouble.
</P>

<P>
It was still needful to maintain the strictest economy, for half the
money which had been given them was in Miss Olcott's keeping as a
safeguard against another rainy day. Mrs. Wiggs had got as much
washing as she could do; Asia helped about the house, and Billy did
odd jobs wherever he could find them.
</P>

<P>
The direct road to fortune, however, according to Billy's ideas,
could best be traveled in a kindling-wagon, and, while he was the
proud possessor of a dilapidated wagon, sole relic of the late Mr.
Wiggs, he had nothing to hitch to it. Scarcely a week passed that he
did not agitate the question, and, as Mrs. Wiggs often said, "When
Billy Wiggs done set his head to a thing, he's as good as got it!"
</P>

<P>
So she was not surprised when he rushed breathlessly into the
kitchen one evening, about supper-time, and exclaimed in excited
tones: "Ma, I 've got a horse! He was havin' a fit on the commons
an' they was goin' to shoot him, an' I ast the man to give him to
me!"
</P>

<P>
"My land, Billy! What do you want with a fit-horse?" asked his
mother.
</P>

<P>
"'Cause I knowed you could cure him. The man said if I took him I'd
have to pay fer cartin' away his carcass, but I said, 'All right, I
'll take him, anyway.' Come on, ma, an' see him!" and Billy hurried
back to his new possession.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs pinned a shawl over her head and ran across the commons.
A group of men stood around the writhing animal, but the late owner
had departed.
</P>

<P>
"He's 'most gone," said one of the men, as she came up. "I tole
Billy you'd beat him fer takin' that ole nag offen the man's
han's."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I won't," said Mrs. Wiggs, stoutly. "Billy Wiggs's got more
sense than most men I know. That hoss's carcass is worth something I
'spect he'd bring 'bout two dollars dead, an' mebbe more living.
Anyway, I'm goin' to save him if there's any save to him!"
</P>

<P>
She stood with her arms on her hips, and critically surveyed her
patient. "I'll tell you what's the matter with him," was her final
diagnosis; "his lights is riz. Billy, I'm goin' home fer some
medicine; you set on his head so's he can't git up, an' ma'll be
right back in a minute."
</P>

<P>
The crowd which had collected to see the horse shot began to
disperse, for it was supper-time, and there was nothing to see now
but the poor suffering animal, with Billy Wiggs patiently sitting on
its head.
</P>

<P>
When Mrs. Wiggs returned she carried a bottle, and what appeared to
be a large marble. "This here is a calomel pill," she explained. "I
jes' rolled the calomel in with some soft, light bread. Now, you
prop his jaw open with a little stick, an' I'll shove it in, an'
then hole his head back, while I pour down some water an' turkentine
outen this bottle."
</P>

<P>
It was with great difficulty that this was accomplished, for the old
horse had evidently seen a vision of the happy hunting-ground, and
was loath to return to the sordid earth. His limbs were already
stiffening in death, and the whites of his eyes only were visible.
Mrs. Wiggs noted these discouraging symptoms, and saw that violent
measures were necessary.
</P>

<P>
"Gether some sticks an' build a fire quick as you kin. I 've got to
run over home. Build it right up clost to him, Billy; we 've got to
git him het up."
</P>

<P>
She rushed into the kitchen, and, taking several cakes of tallow
from the shelf, threw them into a tin bucket. Then she hesitated for
a moment. The kettle of soup was steaming away on the stove ready
for supper. Mrs. Wiggs did not believe in sacrificing the present
need to the future comfort. She threw in a liberal portion of
pepper, and, seizing the kettle in one hand and the bucket of tallow
in the other, staggered back to the bonfire.
</P>

<P>
"Now, Billy," she commanded, "put this bucket of tallow down there
in the hottest part of the fire. Look out; don't tip it&mdash;there!
Now, you come here an' help me pour this soup into the bottle. I'm
goin' to git that ole hoss so het up he'll think he's havin' a
sunstroke! Seems sorter bad to keep on pestering him when he's so
near gone, but this here soup'll feel good when it once gits inside
him."
</P>

<P>
When the kettle was empty, the soup was impartially distributed over
Mrs. Wiggs and the patient, but a goodly amount had "got inside,"
and already the horse was losing his rigidity.
</P>

<P>
Only once did Billy pause in his work, and that was to ask:
</P>

<P>
"Ma, what do you think I'd better name him?"
</P>

<P>
Giving names was one of Mrs. Wiggs's chief accomplishments, and
usually required much thoughtful consideration; but in this case if
there was to be a christening it must be at once.
</P>

<P>
"I'd like a jography name," suggested Billy, feeling that nothing
was too good to bestow upon his treasure.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs stood with the soup dripping from her hands, and
earnestly contemplated the horse. Babies, pigs, goats, and puppies
had drawn largely on her supply of late, and geography names
especially were scarce. Suddenly a thought struck her.
</P>

<P>
"I'll tell you what, Billy! We'll call him Cuby! It's a town I
heared 'em talkin' 'bout at the grocery."
</P>

<P>
By this time the tallow was melted, and Mrs. Wiggs carried it over
by the horse, and put each of his hoofs into the hot liquid, while
Billy rubbed the legs with all the strength of his young arms.
</P>

<P>
"That's right," she said; "now you run home an' git that piece of
carpet by my bed, an' we'll kiver him up. I am goin' to git them
fence rails over yonder to keep the fire goin'."
</P>

<P>
Through the long night they worked with their patient, and when the
first glow of morning appeared in the east, a triumphant procession
wended its way across the Cabbage Patch. First came an old woman,
bearing sundry pails, kettles, and bottles; next came a very sleepy
little boy, leading a trembling old horse, with soup all over its
head, tallow on its feet, and a strip of rag-carpet tied about its
middle.
</P>

<P>
And thus Cuba, like his geographical namesake, emerged from the
violent ordeal of reconstruction with a mangled constitution,
internal dissension, a decided preponderance of foreign element, but
a firm and abiding trust in the new power with which his fortunes
had been irrevocably cast.

</P>

<P>
WHEN Miss Hazy was awakened early that morning by a resonant neigh
at the head of her bed, she mistook it for the trump of doom. Miss
Hazy's cottage, as has been said, was built on the bias in the
Wiggses' side yard, and the little lean-to, immediately behind Miss
Hazy's bedroom, had been pressed into service as Cuba's temporary
abiding-place.
</P>

<P>
After her first agonized fright, the old woman ventured to push the
door open a crack and peep out.
</P>

<P>
"Chris," she said, in a tense whisper, to her sleeping nephew&mdash;"Chris,
what on airth is this here hitched to our shutter?"
</P>

<P>
Chris, usually deaf to all calls less emphatic than cold water and a
broomstick, raised a rumpled head from the bed-clothes.
</P>

<P>
"Where at?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Right here!" said Miss Hazy, still in a terrified whisper, and
holding fast the door, as if the specter might attempt an entrance.
Chris did not stop to adjust his wooden leg, but hopped over to the
door, and cautiously put an eye to the opening.
</P>

<P>
"Why, shucks, 't ain't nothin' but a hoss!" he said, in disgust,
having nerved himself for nothing less than a rhinoceros, such as he
had seen in the circus.
</P>

<P>
"How'd he git there?" demanded Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
Chris was not prepared to say.
</P>

<P>
All through breakfast Miss Hazy was in a flutter of excitement. She
had once heard of a baby being left on a doorstep, but never a
horse. When the limit of her curiosity was about reached, she saw
Mrs. Wiggs coming across the yard carrying a bucket. She hastened to
meet her.
</P>

<P>
"Mornin'," called Mrs. Wiggs, brightly, in spite of her night's
vigil; "ain't we got a fine hoss?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Hazy put the ash-barrel between herself and the animal, and
hazarded a timid inspection, while Mrs. Wiggs made explanations, and
called attention to Cuba's fine points.
</P>

<P>
"Can't you come in an' take a warm?" asked Miss Hazy, as she
concluded.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I b'lieve I will," said Mrs. Wiggs. "I ain't been over fer
quite a spell. The childern kin clean up, bein' it's Saturday."
From seven to nine in the morning were the favorite calling-hours in
the Cabbage Patch.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs chose the chair which had the least on it, and leaned
back, smiling affably as she remarked: "We 're used to hosses; this
here's the second one we 've had."
</P>

<P>
"My!" said Miss Hazy, "you muster been well to do!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," continued Mrs. Wiggs, "we was&mdash;up to the time of the fire.
Did I ever tell you 'bout how Jim brought our other hoss to town?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Hazy had heard the story a number of times, but she knew the
duties of a hostess.
</P>

<P>
"It was this a-way," went on Mrs. Wiggs, drawing her chair closer to
the fire, and preparing for a good, long talk. "You see, me an' the
childern was comin' on the steam-car train, but ther' wasn't no way
to git the hoss here, 'ceptin' fer somebody to ride him. Course Jim
said he'd do it. Poor Jim, always ready to do the hard part!" She
paused to wipe her eyes on her apron, and Miss Hazy wept in
sympathy.
</P>

<P>
"Never min', Miss Wiggs; don't cry. Go on an' tell me what you done
next."
</P>

<P>
"Well," said Mrs. Wiggs, swallowing the lump in her throat, "Jim
said he'd go. He never had been to the city, an' he was jes' a
little shaver, but I knowed I could trust him."
</P>

<P>
"I don't see how you could stand to risk it!" exclaimed Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I reckon whatever you got to do, you kin do. I didn't see no
other way; so one mornin' I put a old fo-patch quilt over the hoss,
tied a bucket of oats on behin' it an' fixed some vittles fer Jim,
an' started 'em off. It was a forty-mile ride to the city, so I
calkerlated to start Jim so's he'd git to Dr. White's 'bout
nightfall."
</P>

<P>
"Dr. White was your old doctor, wasn't he?" prompted Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
"Yes'm. He used to tend Mr. Wiggs before we moved over into Bullitt
County. You know Mr. Wiggs was a widow man when I married him. He
had head trouble. Looked like all his inflictions gethered together
in that head of hisn. He uster go into reg'lar transoms!"
</P>

<P>
Miss Hazy was awe-struck, but more dreadful revelations were to
follow.
</P>

<P>
"I guess you knew I killed him," continued Mrs. Wiggs, calmly. "The
doctor an' ever'body said so. He was jes' gitten over typhoid, an' I
give him pork an' beans. He was a wonderful man! Kept his senses
plumb to the end. I remember his very las' words. I was settin' by
him, waitin' fer the doctor to git there, an' I kep' saying 'Oh, Mr.
Wiggs! You don't think you are dying do you?' an' he answered up
jes' as natural an' fretful-like, 'Good lan', Nancy! How do I know?
I ain't never died before.' An' them was the very las' words he ever
spoke."
</P>

<P>
"Was he a church member, Miss Wiggs?" inquired Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
"Well, no, not exactly," admitted Mrs. Wiggs, reluctantly. "But he
was what you might say a well-wisher. But, as I was tellin' you, Dr.
White was a old friend, an' I pinned a note on Jim's coat tellin'
who he was an' where he was going an' knowed the doctor would have a
eye on him when he got as fur as Smithville. As fer the rest of the
trip, I wasn't so certain. The only person I knowed in the city was
Pete Jenkins, an' if there was one man in the world I didn't have
no use fer, it was Pete. But when I don't like folks I try to do
somethin' nice fer 'em. Seems like that's the only way I kin weed
out my meanness. So I jes' sez to Jim, 'You keep on astin' till you
git to No. 6 Injun House, an' then you ast fer Pete Jenkins. You
tell him,' sez I, 'you are Hiram Wiggs's boy, an' as long as he done
so much harm to yer pa, mebbe he'd be glad to do a good turn by
you, an' keep you an' the hoss fer the night, till yer ma comes fer
you.' Well, Jim started off, lookin' mighty little settin' up on
that big hoss, an' I waved my apron long as I could; then I hid
behin' a tree to keep him from seein' me cry. He rode all that day,
an' 'bout sundown he come to Dr. White's. Pore little feller, he was
so tired an' stiff he couldn't hardly walk, but he tied the hoss to
the post an' went 'round to the back door an' knocked real easy.
Mrs. White come to the door an' sez, real cross, 'No, doctor ain't
here,' an' slammed it shut agin. I ain't meanin' to blame her; mebbe
her bread was in the oven, or her baby crying or somethin', but
seems to me I couldn't have treated a dog that a-way!
</P>

<P>
"Pore Jim, he dragged out to the road agin, an' set there beside the
hoss, not knowin' what to do nex'. Night was a-comin' on, he hadn't
had no supper, an' he was dead beat. By an' by he went to sleep, an'
didn't know nothin' till somebody shuck his shoulder an' sez, 'Git
up from here! What you doin' sleepin' here in the road?' Then he
went stumblin' 'long, with somebody holdin' his arm, an' he was took
into a big, bright room, an' the doctor was lookin' at him an'
astin' him questions. An' Jim said he never did know what he
answered, but it must 'a' been right, fer the doctor grabbed holt of
his hand, an' sez: 'Bless my soul! It's little Jimmy Wiggs, all the
way from Curryville!'
</P>

<P>
"Then they give him his supper, an' Mrs. White sez: 'Where'll he
sleep at, Doctor? There ain't no spare bed.' Then Jim sez the doctor
frowned like ever'thin', an' sez: 'Sleep? Why, he'll sleep in the
bed with my boys, an' they orter be proud to have sech a plucky
bedfeller!'
</P>

<P>
"Jim never did fergit them words; they meant a good deal more to him
than his supper.
</P>

<P>
"Early the nex' mornin' he started out agin, the doctor pointin' him
on the way. He didn't git into the city till 'long 'bout four
o'clock, an' he sez he never was so mixed in all his life. All my
childern was green about town; it made ever' one of 'em sick when
they first rode on the street-cars, an' Europena was skeered to
death of the newsboys, 'cause she thought they called 'Babies,'
'stid of 'Papers.' Jim kep' right on the main road, like he was tole
to, but things kep' a-happenin' 'round him so fast, he said he
couldn't do no more 'n jes' keep out the way. All of a suddint a
ice-wagon come rattlin' up behin' him. It was runnin' off, an' 'fore
he knowed it a man hit it in the head an' veered it 'round towards
him; Jim said his hoss turned a clean somerset, an' he was th'owed
up in the air, an'&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Ma!" called a shrill voice from the Wiggses' porch, "Australia's
in the rain-barrel!"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs looked exasperated. "I never was havin' a good time in my
life that one of my childern didn't git in that rain-barrel!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, go on an' finish," said Miss Hazy, to whom the story had lost
nothing by repetition.
</P>

<P>
"Ther' ain't much more," said Mrs. Wiggs, picking up her bucket.
"Our hoss had two legs an' his neck broke, but Jim never had a
scratch. A policeman took him to No. 6 Injun House, an' Pete Jenkins
jes' treated him like he'd been his own son. I was done cured then
an' there fer my feelin' aginst Pete."
</P>

<P>
"Ma!" again came the warning cry across the yard.
</P>

<P>
"All right, I'm comin'! Good-by, Miss Hazy; you have a eye to Cuby
till we git our shed ready. He ain't as sperited as he looks."
</P>

<P>
And, with a cordial hand-shake, Mrs. Wiggs went cheerfully away to
administer chastisement to her erring offspring.

CHAPTER VI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A THEATER PARTY
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "The play, the play's the thing!"<BR>
</P>

<P>
BILLY'S foreign policy proved most satisfactory, and after the
annexation of Cuba many additional dimes found their way into the
tin box on top of the wardrobe. But it took them all, besides Mrs.
Wiggs's earnings, to keep the family from the awful calamity of
"pulling agin a debt."
</P>

<P>
One cold December day Billy came in and found his mother leaning
wearily on the table. Her face brightened as he entered, but he
caught the tired look in her eyes.
</P>

<P>
"What's the matter?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Ain't nothin' the matter, Billy," she said, trying to speak
cheerfully; "I'm jes' wore out, that's all. It'll be with me like
it was with Uncle Ned's ole ox, I reckon; he kep' a-goin' an'
a-goin' till he died a-standin' up, an' even then they had to push
him over."
</P>

<P>
She walked to the window, and stood gazing absently across the
commons. "Do you know, Billy," she said suddenly, "I 've got the
craziest notion in my head. I'd jes' give anythin' to see the show
at the Opery House this week."
</P>

<P>
If she had expressed a wish for a diamond necklace, Billy could not
have been more amazed, and his countenance expressed his state of
mind. Mrs. Wiggs hastened to explain:
</P>

<P>
"Course, I ain't really thinkin' 'bout goin', but them show-bills
started me to studyin' about it, an' I got to wishin' me an' you
could go."
</P>

<P>
"I don't 'spect it's much when you git inside," said Billy, trying
the effects of negative consolation.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, 't is, Billy Wiggs," answered his mother, impressively. "You
ain't never been inside a theayter, an' I have. I was there twict,
an' it was grand! You orter see the lights an' fixin's, an' all the
fine ladies an' their beaus. First time I went they was a man in
skin-tights a-walkin' on a rope h'isted 'way up over ever'body's
head."
</P>

<P>
"What's skin-tights?" asked Billy, thrilled in spite of himself.
</P>

<P>
"It's spangles 'round yer waist, an' shoes without no heels to 'em.
You see, the man couldn't wear many clothes, 'cause it would make
him too heavy to stay up there in the air. The band plays all the
time, an' folks sing an' speechify, an' ever'body laughs an' has a
good time. It's jes' grand, I tell you!"
</P>

<P>
Billy's brows were puckered, and he sat unusually quiet for a while,
looking at his mother. Finally he said: "You might take my
snow-money from las' week."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs was indignant. "Why, Billy Wiggs!" she exclaimed, "do you
think I'd take an' go to a show, when Asia an' Australia ain't got
a good shoe to their backs?"
</P>

<P>
Billy said no more about the theater, but that afternoon, when he
was out with the kindling, he pondered the matter deeply. It was
quite cold, and sometimes he had to put the reins between his knees
and shove his hands deep into his pockets to get the stiffness out
of them. It really seemed as if everybody had just laid in a supply
of kindling, and the shadowy little plan he had been forming was
growing more shadowy all the time.
</P>

<P>
"I 'spect the tickets cost a heap," he thought ruefully, as he drew
himself up into a regular pretzel of a boy; "but, then, she never
does have no fun, an' never gits a thing fer herself." And because
Billy knew of his mother's many sacrifices, and because he found it
very hard to take Jim's place, a lump lodged in his throat, and gave
him so much trouble that he forgot for a while how cold he was.
</P>

<P>
About this time he came within sight of the Opera House, and
tantalizing posters appeared of the "Greatest Extravaganza of the
Century." He pulled Cuba into a walk, and sat there absorbing the
wonders depicted; among the marvels were crowds of children dressed
as butterflies, beautiful ladies marching in line, a man balancing a
barrel on his feet, and&mdash;yes, there was the man in "skin-tights"
walking on the rope!
</P>

<P>
A keen puff of wind brought Billy back to his senses, and as his
longing eyes turned from the gorgeous show-bills they encountered
the amused look of a gentleman who had just come out from the Opera
House. He was so tall and fine-looking that Billy thought he must
own the show.
</P>

<P>
"Some kindlin', sir?"
</P>

<P>
The gentleman shook his head. The posters still danced before
Billy's eyes; if his mother could only see the show! The last chance
seemed slipping away. Suddenly a bold idea presented itself. He got
out of the wagon, and came up on the step.
</P>

<P>
"Couldn't you use a whole load, if I was to take it out in
tickets?"
</P>

<P>
The man looked puzzled. "Take it out in tickets?" he repeated.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir," said Billy, "theayter tickets. Don't you own the show?"
</P>

<P>
The gentleman laughed. "Well, hardly," he said. "What do you want
with more than one ticket?"
</P>

<P>
There was a certain sympathy in his voice, in spite of the fact that
he was still laughing, and before Billy knew it he had told him all
about it.
</P>

<P>
"How many tickets could yer gimme fer the load?" he asked, in
conclusion.
</P>

<P>
The gentleman made a hurried calculation. "You say you have three
sisters?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Yep," said Billy.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I should say that load was worth about five tickets."
</P>

<P>
"Gee whiz!" cried the boy; "that 'ud take us all!"
</P>

<P>
He followed the gentleman back to the ticket-office, and eagerly
watched the man behind the little window count out five tickets and
put them in a pink envelope.
</P>

<P>
"One for you, one for your mother, and three for the kids," said his
friend, as Billy buttoned the treasure in the inside pocket of his
ragged coat.
</P>

<P>
He was so excited that he almost forgot his part of the bargain, but
as the gentleman was turning away he remembered.
</P>

<P>
"Say, mister, where must I take the kindlin' to?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, that's all right; you can sell it to-morrow," answered the
other.
</P>

<P>
Billy's face fell instantly. "If you don't take the kindlin', I'll
have to give you back the tickets. Ma don't 'low us to take nothin'
that way."
</P>

<P>
"But I don't need the kindling; haven't any place to put it."
</P>

<P>
"Ain't you got no home?" asked Billy, incredulously.
</P>

<P>
"No," answered the man, shortly.
</P>

<P>
The idea of any one, in any walk of life, not having use for
kindling was a new one to Billy. But he had no time to dwell on it,
for this new complication demanded all his attention.
</P>

<P>
"Ain't there nobody you could give it to?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
The gentleman was growing impatient. "No, no; go along; that's all
right."
</P>

<P>
But Billy knew it would not be all right when he got home, so he
made one more effort. "How'd you like to send it out to Miss Hazy?"
he inquired.
</P>

<P>
"Well, Miss Hazy, not having the pleasure of my acquaintance, might
object to the delicate attention. Who is she?"
</P>

<P>
"She's Chris's aunt; they ain't had no fire fer two days."
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" said the man, heartily, "take it to Miss Hazy, by all means.
Tell her it's from Mr. Bob, who is worse off than she is, for he
hasn't even a home."
</P>

<P>
An hour later there was wild excitement under the only tin roof in
the Cabbage Patch. Such scrubbing and brushing as was taking place!
</P>

<P>
"It's jes' like a peetrified air-castle," said Mrs. Wiggs, as she
pressed out Asia's best dress; "here I been thinkin' 'bout it, an'
wantin' to go, an' here I am actually gittin' ready to go! Come
here, child, and let me iron out yer plaits while the iron's good
an' hot."
</P>

<P>
This painful operation was performed only on state occasions; each
little Wiggs laid her head on the ironing-board, a willing sacrifice
on the altar of vanity, while Mrs. Wiggs carefully ironed out five
plaits on each head. Europena was the only one who objected to being
a burnt-offering, but when she saw the frizzled locks of the others,
her pride conquered her fear, and, holding tight to Billy's hand,
she bent her chubby head to the trying ordeal.
</P>

<P>
"Now, Billy, you run over to Mrs. Eichorn's an' ast her to loan me
her black crepe veil. Mrs. Krasmier borrowed it yesterday to wear to
her pa's funeral, but I guess she's sent it back by this time. An',
Billy&mdash;Billy, wait a minute; you be sure to tell 'em we are goin'
to the show." Mrs. Wiggs vigorously brushed her hair with the
clothes-brush as she spoke. Australia had thrown the hair-brush down
the cistern the summer before.
</P>

<P>
"Asia, you go git the alpaca from behind the chest, an' sorter shake
it out on the bed."
</P>

<P>
"Who's goin' to wear it, ma?" The question came in anxious tones,
for the blue alpaca had been sent them in a bundle of old clothes,
and though it failed to fit either of the girls, the wearing of it
was a much coveted privilege.
</P>

<P>
"Well, now, I don't know," said Mrs. Wiggs, critically surveying the
children; "it won't button good on you, and swags in the back on
Australia."
</P>

<P>
"Lemme wear it, ma!"
</P>

<P>
"No, lemme!" came in excited tones.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs had seen trouble before over the blue alpaca; she knew
what anguish her decision must bring to one or the other.
</P>

<P>
"It really looks best on Asia," she thought; "but if I let her wear
it Austry'll have a cryin' spell an' git to holdin' her breath, an'
that'll take up so much time." So she added aloud: "I'll tell you
what we'll do. Asia, you kin wear the skirt, an' Austry kin wear
the waist."
</P>

<P>
But when she had pinned the skirt over one little girl's red calico
dress, and buttoned the blue waist over the clean apron of the
other, she looked at them dubiously. "They do look kinder mixed,"
she admitted to herself, "but I reckon it don't matter, so long as
they 're both happy."
</P>

<P>
Just here Billy came in, with the veil in one hand and a bunch of
faded carnations in the other.
</P>

<P>
"Look, ma!" he exclaimed, holding up his trophy, "I swapped 'em with
Pete fer a top an' a agate. He got 'em outen a ash-barrel over on
the avenue."
</P>

<P>
"Well, now, ain't that nice?" said Mrs. Wiggs; "I'll jes' clip the
stems an' put 'em in a bottle of water, an' they'll pick up right
smart by the time we go. I wisht you had something to fix up in,
Billy," she added; "you look as seedy as a raspberry."
</P>

<P>
Billy did look rather shabby; his elbows were out, and two of the
holes in his pants were patched and two were not. Mrs. Wiggs was
rummaging in the table drawer.
</P>

<P>
"I wisht I could find somethin' of yer pa's that would do. Here's
his white gloves he wore that time he was pallbearer to ole Mr.
Bender. Seems to me they do wear white gloves to the theayter, but I
disremember."
</P>

<P>
"Naw! I ain't a-goin' to wear no gloves," said Billy, firmly.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs continued her search. "Here's yer grandpa's watch-fob,
but I'm skeered fer you to wear it, you might lose it. It's a
family remnant&mdash;been handed down two generations. What about this
here red comforter? It would sorter spruce you up, an' keep you
warm, besides; you know you 've had a cold fer a week, an' yer pipes
is all stopped up." So it was decided, and Billy wore the comforter.
</P>

<P>
At seven o 'clock they were ready, and, the news having spread
abroad that the Wiggses were going to a show, many of the neighbors
came in to see how they looked and to hear how it happened.
</P>

<P>
"Some of you all shake down the stove an' pull the door to fer me. I
am jes' that skeered of hurtin' Mrs. Eichorn's veil I'm 'fraid to
turn my head," Mrs. Wiggs said nervously, as she stepped off the
porch.
</P>

<P>
The little procession had left the railroad tracks far behind, when
Mrs. Wiggs stopped suddenly.
</P>

<P>
"Fer the land's sakes alive! Do you know what we 've gone an' done?
We have left the theayter tickets to home!"
</P>

<P>
At this Australia began to cry, and a gloom settled upon the party.
</P>

<P>
"Billy, you run back, fast as yer legs kin carry you, an' look in
that tin can behind the clock, an' we'll wait right here fer you."
Mrs. Wiggs wrapped Europena in her shawl, and tried to keep up the
spirits of the party as they huddled on the curbing to await Billy's
return.
</P>

<P>
"Look how pretty it looks, all the lights a-streamin' out the
winders on the snow. Looks like a chromo ma used to have."
</P>

<P>
But the young Wiggses were in no frame of mind to appreciate the
picturesqueness of the scene.
</P>

<P>
It was very cold, and even the prospect of the show was dimmed by
the present discomfort. By and by Australia's sobs began anew.
</P>

<P>
"What's the matter, honey? Don't cry; Billy'll be back in a little
while, an' then we'll git in where it's good an' warm."
</P>

<P>
"I want my supper!" wailed Australia.
</P>

<P>
Then it dawned on Mrs. Wiggs for the first time that, in the
excitement of preparation, supper had been entirely overlooked.
</P>

<P>
"Well, if that don't beat all!" said she. "I had jes' 'bout as much
idea of supper as a goat has of kid gloves!"
</P>

<P>
But when Billy came flying back with the tickets, and the party had
started once more on the long walk to the Opera House, the enticing
posters began to appear, and supper and the cold were forgotten.

CHAPTER VII

"MR. BOB"

<P CLASS="poem">
    "If his heart at high floods<BR>
    Swamped his brain now and then,<BR>
    'T was but richer for that<BR>
    When the tide ebbed again."<BR>
</P>

<P>
A LARGE audience assembled that night to witness "The Greatest
Extravaganza of the Century." The Opera House was a blaze of light
and color.
</P>

<P>
From the recesses of one of the boxes, Redding made a careful survey
of the faces beneath him. First nights usually found him there, with
the same restless, eager look in his eyes. Tonight he evidently
failed to find what he sought, and was turning listlessly away when
he stopped suddenly, bent forward, then smiled broadly. He had
caught sight of Billy's red comforter.
</P>

<P>
The boy's hair was plastered close to his head, and his face was
transformed by soap and happiness. Redding glanced quizzically at
the rest of the party&mdash;at the mother's radiant countenance beaming
from the dusk of her crepe veil, at the three little girls in their
composite costumes, at the carnations pinned on each bosom. Then he
deliberately turned his back on "The Greatest Extravaganza of the
Century," and centered his attention on the parquet group.
</P>

<P>
It was a singularly enthusiastic theater party, oblivious of
surroundings, and lost in wonder at the strange sights. Billy's
laugh rang out frequently, with refreshing spontaneity. Their
enjoyment was so evident that Redding was surprised, at the close of
the first act, to see them put on their wraps and march solemnly out
of the theater. He hastened to the lobby, and touched Billy on the
shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"Didn't you like the show?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"You bet!" said Billy, his eyes shining and his cheeks flushed.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs was hopelessly entangled in the crepe veil, but her ideas
of etiquette were rigid. She disengaged one hand and said, with
dignity: "I 'low this is Mr. Bob, Billy's friend. Happy to meet yer
acquaintance. Asia, speak to the gentleman&mdash;Australia&mdash;Europena!"
with a commanding nod at each.
</P>

<P>
Three small hands were thrust at Redding simultaneously, and he
accommodated them all in his broad palm.
</P>

<P>
"But why are you going home?" he asked, looking from one to the
other.
</P>

<P>
"Where else would we go to?" asked Mrs. Wiggs, in amazement.
</P>

<P>
"Why not stay and see the play out? That was only the first act."
</P>

<P>
"Is there some more, ma?" asked Asia, eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course," explained Redding, "lots more. Now, go back, and
stay until everybody has left the theater, and then you will be
certain it's over."
</P>

<P>
So back they went, furnishing an amusing entr'acte for the impatient
audience.
</P>

<P>
After the curtain descended on the final tableau, Redding waited in
the lobby while the stream of people passed. The Wiggses had obeyed
instructions, and were the very last to come out. They seemed dazed
by their recent glimpse into fairy-land. Something in their thin
bodies and pinched faces made Redding form a sudden resolve.
</P>

<P>
"Billy," he said gravely, "can't you and your family take supper
with me?"
</P>

<P>
Billy and his mother exchanged doubtful glances; for the past three
hours everything had been so strange and unusual that they were
bewildered.
</P>

<P>
"You see, we will go right over to Bond's and have something to eat
before you go home," urged Redding.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs was in great doubt, but one of the little girls pulled
her skirt and said, in pleading tones: "Ma, let's do!" and Billy
was already casting longing eyes at the big restaurant across the
way. She had not the heart to refuse. As they were crossing the
street, Asia stopped suddenly and cried:
</P>

<P>
"Ma, there's the 'Christmas Lady' gittin' in that hack! She seen
us! Look!"
</P>

<P>
But before they could turn the carriage door had slammed.
</P>

<P>
Redding took them into a small apartment, curtained off from the
rest of the cafe, so that only the waiters commented on the strange
party. At first there was oppressive silence; then the host turned
to Europena and asked her what she liked best to eat. A moment of
torture ensued for the small lady, during which she nearly twisted
her thumb from its socket, then she managed to gasp:
</P>

<P>
"Green pups!"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bob laughed. "Why, you little cannibal!" he said. "What on earth
does she mean?"
</P>

<P>
"Cream puffs," explained Mrs. Wiggs, airily. "She et 'em onct at
Mrs. Reed's, the Bourbon Stock Yard's wife, an' she's been talkin'
'bout 'em ever sence."
</P>

<P>
After this the ice, while not broken, at least had a crack in it,
and by the time the first course was served Redding was telling them
a funny story, and three of the audience were able to smile. It had
pleased him to order an elaborate supper, and he experienced the
keenest enjoyment over the novelty of the situation. The Wiggses ate
as he had never seen people eat before. "For speed and durability
they break the record," was his mental comment. He sat by and, with
consummate tact, made them forget everything but the good time they
were having.
</P>

<P>
As the supper progressed, Mrs. Wiggs became communicative. She still
wore her black cotton gloves, and gesticulated with a chicken
croquette as she talked.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," she was saying, "Jim was one of these handy childern; when he
was eight years old he could peddle as good as you could! I guess
you heard 'bout our roof; ever'body was talkin' 'bout it. Billy is
takin' right after him; do you know what that boy has gone an' done?
He's built his pa a monumint!"
</P>

<P>
"A monument!" exclaimed Redding.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir, a tombstun monumint! I was allers a-wishin' that Mr.
Wiggs could have a monumint, and Billy never said a word, but he set
his head to it. One day he come home with a lot of these here tiles
what they had throwed out from the tile fact'ry; some of 'em was
jes' a little nicked, an' the others was jes' as good as new. Well,
he kep' on gittin' 'em ever' day or two, till he had a consider'ble
pile. Ever' night he used to set on the floor an' fool with them
things, a-fittin' 'em here an' crackin' 'em off there, but I never
paid no 'tention to him. One night, when I come in from Mrs.
Eichorn's, what did I see on the floor but a sure-'nough
tombstun-slab, an' spelt out in little blue tiles down the middle
was:
</P>

<P>
"'Pa. Gone, but not forgotten.'
</P>

<P>
"I was jes' that pleased I set down an' bust out cryin'. We made a
sorter box to hold it, an' chinked it up with cement, an' las'
Sunday me an' the childern took it out an' fixed it up on Mr.
Wiggs's grave. Some day we are going to make Jimmy one; you know
Jimmy's my boy that's dead." Her eyes filled and her lips
trembled; even the sunshine of her buoyant nature could not dispel
one shadow that always lay across her heart.
</P>

<P>
At this moment Billy, doubtless thrilled at being the topic of
conversation, upset his glass of water, and the deluge descended
full upon Australia, drenching the waist of the blue alpaca. Such a
wail as arose! Threats and persuasion were alike unavailing; she
even refused to be mopped off, but slid in a disconsolate heap under
the table. Redding attempted to invade the citadel with an orange as
a flag of truce, but his overtures were ineffectual, and he was
compelled to retreat under fire.
</P>

<P>
"I'd leave her be, Mr. Bob," advised Mrs. Wiggs, placidly, as she
spread her salad on a piece of bread. "She'll git to holdin' her
breath if you notice her."
</P>

<P>
The shrieks gradually diminished to spasmodic sobs, which in turn
gave place to ominous silence.
</P>

<P>
"Billy," said Redding, taking Mrs. Wiggs's advice and ignoring the
flood sufferer, "how would you like to be my office-boy?"
</P>

<P>
"I'd like it a heap," answered Billy, promptly.
</P>

<P>
Redding turned to Mrs. Wiggs. "You see, it's a newspaper office,
and while the pay isn't much at first, still it's better than
peddling kindling, and there would be a chance for promotion as he
got older."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes," answered Mrs. Wiggs, complacently; "there wouldn't be no
trouble 'bout Billy promotin'. I 'spect he could take to writin'
newspapers right away, if you could hold him down to it. He's jes'
like his pa&mdash;the very spittin' image of him! Mr. Wiggs was so
educated&mdash;the most fluent man in jography I ever seen!"
</P>

<P>
"I'm goin' to be like Mr. Bob when I grow up," said Billy, stoutly.
His recollection of his paternal parent was not the sort ideals are
made of.
</P>

<P>
Just here the waiter appeared with the final course, and Asia lifted
the tablecloth and whispered, "Say, 'Straly, we 've got ice-cream."
No answer. Then little Europena, with baby wisdom, put her tow head
under the cloth, and said, "'Traly, it's pink!" and Australia
emerged, tear-stained but smiling, and finished her supper on Mr.
Bob's knee.
</P>

<P>
When the limit of capacity had been tested to the fullest, and Billy
had declared that "he couldn't swaller no more, he was jes'
chawin'," Redding filled their pockets with candy and, when Mrs.
Wiggs was not looking, put a quarter in each hand. Then he rang for
a carriage, and, in spite of Mrs. Wiggs's protestations, he put them
in, and repeated Billy's directions as to the exact location of the
Cabbage Patch.
</P>

<P>
"My, my, ain't this nice!" said Mrs. Wiggs, leaning back against
carriage cushions for the first time in her life, while Redding
lifted Europena in beside her.
</P>

<P>
"We 've seed a good time fer onct in our lives," said Asia. It was
the first time she had spoken since they left the theater.
</P>

<P>
"Lemme ride up on top, ma!" demanded Billy, eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Lemme, too, lemme!" came from the sleepy Australia, who did not
know what new attraction was being offered, but was resolved not to
miss anything.
</P>

<P>
"All right, Billy; but, Austry, you must stay with ma. Good-by, Mr.
Bob, and thanks&mdash;thanks fer one an' all!"
</P>

<P>
Redding stood on the corner where they had left him, and the smile
died out of his face. Within a block was a jolly crowd and a hearty
welcome; across the street was the big apartment house where his
dark and cheerless window promised him nothing. For a moment he
stood irresolute. "There is certainly nobody to care where I go," he
thought gloomily; then suddenly the smile came back. "But if I'm to
be Billy Wiggs's model, I guess I'd better go to bed." He ran
lightly across the street, and up the broad stone steps.

MRS. WIGGS AT HOME
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "She had a sunny nature that sought, like<BR>
    a flower in a dark place, for the light."<BR>
</P>

<P>
ON Christmas day Lucy Olcott stood by the library window, and idly
scratched initials on the frosty pane. A table full of beautiful
gifts stood near, and a great bunch of long-stemmed roses on the
piano filled the room with fragrance. But Lucy evidently found
something more congenial in the dreary view outside. She was deep in
thought when the door opened and Aunt Chloe came in with a basket
and a note.
</P>

<P>
The old darky grinned as she put the basket on the floor. "You might
'a' knowed, it wuz fum dem Wiggses," she said.
</P>

<P>
Lucy opened the note and read: "Dear miss Lucy the basket of cloths
and vittles come. We or so mutch obliged, and asia wore the read
dress to the soshul and enjoyed her selph so. Much I wish you could
a went. Billy liked his hock and ladar and romcandons. Me and the
childern want to send you a crismas mess of some of all we lade in
for to live on. They is pertaters 2 kines, onions, termaters, a jar
vineger and a jar perservs. I boughten the peeches last sumer, they
was gitting a little rotting so I got them cheep. Hope you will
Enjoy them. I send some of all we got but Cole and Flower. Thankes
thankes to you for your kind fealings. "From yours no more "MRS.
WIGGS."
</P>

<P>
"Bless her old heart!" cried Lucy; "that's the biggest widow's mite
I ever saw. Put the basket there with my other presents, Aunt Chloe;
it's worth them all."
</P>

<P>
She went over to the fire, and held her hands to the friendly blaze;
there was a restless, discontented look in her eyes that proved only
too plainly that her Christmas was not a happy one.
</P>

<P>
"I wish it was night," she said. "I hate Christmas afternoon! Mother
is asleep; it's too early for callers. I believe I'll go down to
the Cabbage Patch."
</P>

<P>
Aunt Chloe stuck out her lip and rolled her eyes in deprecation.
</P>

<P>
"Don' you do it, honey. What you wanter be foolin' 'round wif dat
po' white trash fer? Why don' you set heah by de fiah an' bleach yer
han's fer de party to-might?"
</P>

<P>
"Bother the old party!" said Lucy, impatiently. She had begun
disobeying Aunt Chloe when she was a very little girl.
</P>

<P>
Fifteen minutes later she was tramping through the snow, her cheeks
glowing and her spirits rising. The Wiggses, while always
interesting, had of late acquired a new significance. Since seeing
them in the theater lobby with Robert Redding she had found it
necessary to make several visits to the Cabbage Patch, and the chief
topic of conversation had been Mr. Bob: how he had taken them to the
show; had made Billy his office-boy; had sent them a barrel of
apples, and was coming to see them some day. To which deluge of
information Lucy had listened with outward calmness and inward
thrills.
</P>

<P>
To-day, as she entered the Wiggses' gate a shout greeted her. Billy
let himself down from the chicken-coop roof, and ran forward.
</P>

<P>
"Them Roman candles wasn't no good!" he cried. "One of 'em busted
too soon, and 'most blowed my hand off."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no, it didn't, Miss Lucy!" said Mrs. Wiggs, who had hastened
out to meet her. "Them Roman candons was fine. Billy's hand wasn't
so bad hurt he couldn't shoot his gum-bow shooter and break Miss
Krasmier's winder-pane. I'll be glad when to-morrow comes, an' he
goes back to the office! Come right in," she continued. "Asia, dust
off a cheer fer Miss Lucy. That's right; now, lemme help you off
with yer things."
</P>

<P>
"Lemme hold the muff!" cried Australia.
</P>

<P>
"No, me&mdash;me!" shrieked Europena.
</P>

<P>
A center rush ensued, during which the muff was threatened with
immediate annihilation. The umpire interfered.
</P>

<P>
"Australia Wiggs, you go set in the corner with yer face to the
wall. Europena, come here!" She lifted the wailing little girl to
her lap, and looked her sternly in the eye. "If you don't hush this
minute, I'll spank your doll!"
</P>

<P>
The awful threat was sufficient. Mrs. Wiggs had long ago discovered
the most effectual way of punishing Europena.
</P>

<P>
When peace was restored, Lucy looked about her. In each window was a
piece of holly tied with a bit of red calico, and on the partly
cleared table she saw the remains of a real Christmas dinner.
</P>

<P>
"We had a grand dinner to-day," said Mrs. Wiggs, following her
glance. "Mr. Bob sent the turkey; we et all we wanted, an' got
'nough left fer the rest of the week, countin' hash an' soup an'
all. Asia says she's goin' to hide it, so as I can't give no more
away. By the way, do you notice what Asia's doin'?"
</P>

<P>
Lucy went to the window, where Asia was busily working. This
taciturn little girl, with her old, solemn face and clever fingers,
was her favorite of the children.
</P>

<P>
"What are you making?" she asked, as the child dipped a brush into
one of three cans which stood before her.
</P>

<P>
"She's paintin' a picture," announced Mrs. Wiggs, proudly. "Looked
like she was jes' crazy 'bout picture painting, an' I said, 'Well,
Asia, if you have made up yer mind to be a artist, guess you'll
have to be one.' Seems like when folks kin do pianner playin' an'
picture paintin' it ain't right to let 'em wash dishes an' clean up
all the time. So I went to a store an' ast fer some paint to make
pictures with, and they wanted seventy cents fer a little box full.
Ain't that a mighty heap, Miss Lucy, jes' fer plain paint, 'fore it
's made up into flowers an' trees an' things? Well, anyway, I couldn't
git it, but I come home an' got me three tin cans an' took 'em
'round to Mr. Becker's paint-shop, an' he poured me a little red an'
yaller an' blue, an' only charged me a nickel, an' throwed in a
brush. Asia's painted a heap with it. I'll show you some of her
things."
</P>

<P>
It was not necessary, for in every direction Lucy looked her eyes
were greeted with specimens of Asia's handiwork. Across the
foot-board of the bed was a spray of what might have passed for
cauliflower, the tin boiler was encircled by a wreath of
impressionistic roses, and on the window-pane a piece of exceedingly
golden goldenrod bent in an obliging curve in order to cover the
crack in the glass.
</P>

<P>
"It's perfectly wonderful!" said Lucy, with entire truthfulness.
</P>

<P>
"Ain't it?" said Mrs. Wiggs, with the awed tone one uses in the
presence of genius. "Sometimes I jes' can't believe my eyes, when I
see what my childern kin do! They inherit their education after Mr.
Wiggs; he was so smart, an' b'longed to such a fine fambly. Why, Mr.
Wiggs had real Injun blood in his veins; his grandpa was a squaw&mdash;a
full-blood Injun squaw!"
</P>

<P>
Lucy made a heroic effort to keep a solemn face, as she asked if
Asia looked like him.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, my, no!" continued Mrs. Wiggs. "He was a blunette, real dark
complected. I remember when he fus' come a-courtin' me folks thought
he was a Dago. Pa wasn't to say well off in those days." Mrs. Wiggs
never applied superlatives to misfortunes. "He had a good many of us
to take keer of, an' after Mr. Wiggs had been keepin' company with
me fer 'bout two weeks he drove up one night with a load of coal an'
kindlin', an' called pa out to the fence. 'Mr. Smoot,' sez he, 'as
long as I am courtin' your daughter, I think I orter furnish the
fire to do it by. Ef you don't mind,' sez he, 'I'll jes' put this
wagon-load of fuel in the coal-house. I 'spect by the time it's
used up Nance'll be of my way of think-in'.' An' I was!" added Mrs.
Wiggs, laughing.
</P>

<P>
Ordinarily Lucy found endless diversion in listening to the family
reminiscences, but to-day another subject was on her mind.
</P>

<P>
"How is Billy getting along?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
"Jes' fine!" said Mrs. Wiggs; "only he comes home at night 'most
dead. I give him money to ride, but ever' day last week he et up his
nickel."
</P>

<P>
"Who&mdash;who has charge of him now?" Lucy blushed at her subterfuge.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Bob," said Mrs. Wiggs; "he's the gentleman that took us to
supper. He's got money. Asia said he give the nigger waiter a
quarter. Billy is jes' crazy 'bout Mr. Bob; says he's goin' to be
jes' like him when he grows up. He will, too, if he sets his head to
it! Only he never kin have them big brown eyes an' white teeth Mr.
Bob's got. Why, when Mr. Bob smiles it jes' sort of breaks up his
whole face."
</P>

<P>
Lucy's eyes were fixed on the mammoth butterfly upon whose
iridescent wings Asia was putting the finishing touches, but her
thoughts were far away.
</P>

<P>
"I jes' wish you could see him!" went on Mrs. Wiggs,
enthusiastically.
</P>

<P>
"I wish I could!" said Lucy, with such fervor that Mrs. Wiggs paused
on her way to answer a knock at the outside door.
</P>

<P>
There was a scraping of feet in the passage.
</P>

<P>
"I have been driving all over the country looking for you," said a
man's voice. "I have some Christmas traps for the kids."
</P>

<P>
Lucy rose hastily, and turned just as Redding entered.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Bob, this is Miss Lucy," announced Mrs. Wiggs, triumphantly;
"she was jes' 'lowin' she'd like to see you."
</P>

<P>
If a blue-eyed angel straight from the peaks of paradise had been
presented to him, Redding could not have been more astounded nor
more enraptured.
</P>

<P>
But to Lucy it was a moment of intense chagrin and embarrassment.
During the long silence of the past year she had persuaded herself
that Redding no longer cared for her. To be thrust upon him in this
way was intolerable. All the blood in her veins rushed to her face.
</P>

<P>
"Do you know where my muff is, Mrs. Wiggs?" she asked, after a
formal greeting.
</P>

<P>
"Oh! you ain't a-goin'?" asked the hostess, anxiously. "I wanted you
all to git acquainted."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I must go," said Lucy, hurriedly, "if you will find my muff."
</P>

<P>
She stood nervously pulling on her gloves, while Mrs. Wiggs searched
for the lost property. There was a deafening tumult in her heart,
and though she bit her lips to keep from laughing, the tears stood
in her eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Austry's under the bed," announced Europena, who had joined in the
quest.
</P>

<P>
"I ain't!" came in shrill, indignant tones, as Mrs. Wiggs dragged
forth the culprit, and restored the muff.
</P>

<P>
"May I drive you over to the avenue? I am going that way." It was
Redding's voice, but it sounded queer and unnatural.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no! No, thank you," gasped Lucy, hardly knowing what she said.
Her one idea was to get away before she broke down completely.
</P>

<P>
Redding held the door open as she passed out. His face was cold,
calm, inscrutable; not a quiver of the mouth, not a flutter of the
lids, but the light went out of his eyes and hope died in his heart.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs stood watching the scene in perplexity.
</P>

<P>
"I dunno what ailed Miss Lucy," she said, apologetically; "hope it
wasn't the toothache."
</P>

CHAPTER IX
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
HOW SPRING CAME TO THE CABBAGE PATCH
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "The roads, the woods, the heavens, the hills<BR>
    Are not a world to-day&mdash;<BR>
    But just a place God made for us<BR>
    In which to play."<BR>
</P>

<P>
WHEN the last snow of the winter had melted, and the water was no
longer frozen about the corner pump, the commons lost their hard,
brown look, and a soft green tinge appeared instead. There were not
many ways of telling when spring came to the Cabbage Patch; no trees
shook forth their glad little leaves of welcome, no anemones and
snow-drops brought the gentle message, even the birds that winged
their way from the South-land hurried by, without so much as a chirp
of greeting.
</P>

<P>
But the Cabbage Patch knew it was spring, nevertheless; something
whispered it in the air, a dozen little signs gave the secret away;
weeds were springing up in the fence corners, the puddles which a
few months ago were covered with ice now reflected bits of blue sky,
and the best token of all was the bright, warm sunshine that clung
to the earth as if to love it back into beauty and life again.
</P>

<P>
One afternoon Mrs. Wiggs stood at her gate talking to Redding. It
was the first time he had been there since Christmas day, for his
first visit had been too painful for him to desire to repeat it.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, indeed, Billy kin go," Mrs. Wiggs was saying. "I'm mighty
glad you drove him by home to git on his good coat. He never was to
the fair grounds before; it'll be a big treat. How's Mr. Dick
to-day?"
</P>

<P>
"No better," said Redding; "he coughed all night."
</P>

<P>
"He was takin' a nap o' sleep when I went to clean up this mornin',"
said Mrs. Wiggs, "so I didn't disturb him. He ain't fer long, pore
feller!"
</P>

<P>
"No, poor chap," said Redding, sadly.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs saw the shadow on his face, and hastened to change the
subject. "What do you think of Asia's fence?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
"What about it?"
</P>

<P>
"She done it herself," said Mrs. Wiggs. "That an' the pavement, too.
Mrs. Krasmier's goat et up her flowers las' year, an' this year she
'lowed she'd fix it different. Chris Hazy, that boy over yonder
with the peg-stick, helped her dig the post-boles, but she done the
rest herself."
</P>

<P>
"Well, she is pretty clever!" said Redding, almost incredulously, as
he examined the fence and sidewalk. "How old is she?"
</P>

<P>
"Fourteen, goin' on to fifteen. Asia, come here."
</P>

<P>
The girl left the flower-bed she was digging, and came forward.
</P>

<P>
"Not a very big girl, are you?" said Redding, smiling at her. "How
would you like to go up to the tile factory, and learn to do
decorating?"
</P>

<P>
Her serious face lit up with great enthusiasm; she forgot her
shyness, and said, eagerly: "Oh, yes, sir! Could I?"
</P>

<P>
Before Redding could answer, Mrs. Wiggs broke in:
</P>

<P>
"You'd be gittin' a artist, Mr. Bob! Them fingers of hers kin do
anything. Last fall she built that there little greenhouse out of
ole planks, an' kep' it full of flowers all winter; put a lamp in
durin' the cold spell. You orter see the things she's painted. And
talk about mud pictures! She could jes' take some of that there mud
under that hoss's feet, an' make it look so much like you, you
wouldn't know which was which."
</P>

<P>
Billy's appearance at this moment saved Redding from immediate
disgrace.
</P>

<P>
"You come to the office with Billy in the morning," he called to
Asia, as they started off; "we'll see what can be done."
</P>

<P>
Asia went back to her digging with a will; the prospect of work, of
learning how to do things right, and, above all, of learning how to
paint, filled her with happiness.
</P>

<P>
"If I was you I'd make that bed in the shape of a star," said her
mother, breaking in on her rejections. "Why don't you make it a
mason star? Yer pa was a fine mason; it would be a sort of
compliment to him."
</P>

<P>
"What is a mason star like?" asked Asia.
</P>

<P>
"Well, now I ain't right sure whether it 'a got five points or six.
Either way will do. Lands alive, I do believe there comes Miss
Lucy!"
</P>

<P>
Lucy Olcott had been a frequent visitor of late. Through Mrs. Wiggs
she had gotten interested in Mrs. Schultz, and often stopped in to
read to the bedridden old lady. Here, of course, she heard a great
deal about the Eichorns, the elite of the Cabbage Patch, whose
domestic infelicities furnished the chief interest in Mrs. Schultz's
life. Lucy had even stood on a chair, at the invalid's earnest
request, to count the jars of preserves in the Eichorn pantry. Later
she had become acquainted with Miss Hazy, the patient little woman
in monochrome, whose whole pitiful existence was an apology when it
might have been a protest.
</P>

<P>
In fact, Lucy became an important personage in the neighborhood. She
was sought for advice, called upon for comfort, and asked to share
many joys. Her approach was usually heralded by a shout, "That's
her a-comin'!" and she was invariably escorted across the commons by
a guard of ragged but devoted youngsters. And the friendship of
these simple people opened her eyes to the great problems of
humanity, and as she worked among them and knew life as it was, the
hard little bud of her girlhood blossomed into the great soft rose
of womanhood.
</P>

<P>
"Didn't you meet Mr. Bob up the street?" asked Mrs. Wiggs, as she
led the way into the kitchen. "Him an' Billy have jes' left, goin'
out to the fair grounds. Mr. Bob's jes' naturally the best man I
ever set eyes on, Miss Lucy! Got the biggest heart, an' always doin'
something kind fer folks. Jes' now talkin' 'bout gittin' Asia a
place at the tile fact'ry. I don't see how you missed 'em! If he'd
a sawn you with them vi'lets in yer belt, an' them roses in yer
cheeks, I bet he wouldn't 'a' went."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, he would!" said Lucy, emphatically. "My roses don't appeal
to Mr. Bob."
</P>

<P>
"Well, he likes yer eyes, anyway," said Mrs. Wiggs, determined to
carry her point.
</P>

<P>
"Who said so?" demanded Lucy.
</P>

<P>
"He did. I ast him. I said they was regular star-eyes, jes' shining
blue with them black eyelashes rayin' out all 'round, an' he said
yes, that was the right name fer 'em&mdash;star-eyes."
</P>

<P>
There was a mist over the star-eyes as Lucy turned away.
</P>

<P>
"That's right; set right down there by the winder. It's so pretty
out today it makes you feel good clean down yer back."
</P>

<P>
"I believe you always feel that way," said Lucy, pulling off her
gloves. "Don't you ever worry over things?"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs grew serious. "I'm lonesome fer Jimmy all the time," she
said simply. "Some folks goes right under when trouble comes, but I
carry mine fur an' easy."
</P>

<P>
"I don't mean grieving," said Lucy; "I mean worrying and fretting."
</P>

<P>
"Well, yes," admitted Mrs. Wiggs, taking a hot iron from the stove,
"I 've done that, too. I remember onct last winter I was tooken
sick, an' I got to pesterin' 'bout what the childern 'ud do if I
died. They wasn't no money in the house, an' they didn't know
where to git none. All one night I laid there with my head 'most
bustin', jes' worryin' 'bout it. By an' by I was so miserable I ast
the Lord what I mus' do, an' he tole me." There was absolute
conviction in her tone and manner. "Nex' mornin'," she went on,
"soon's I could I went over to the 'spensary an' ast fer the chief
doctor.
</P>

<P>
"'Doctor,' I sez, 'don't you buy corpses?'
</P>

<P>
"'Yes,' sez he, lookin' kinder funny.
</P>

<P>
"'Well,' sez I, 'I want to sell mine.'
</P>

<P>
"Then I tole him all 'bout it, an' ast him if he wouldn't take my
body after I was gone, an' give the money to the childern.
</P>

<P>
"'Will you put it in writin',' sez he.
</P>

<P>
"'Yes,' sez I, 'if you'll do the same.'
</P>

<P>
"So he drawed up the papers, an' we both signed, an' a man with a
spine in his back an' a lady with the rheumatiz witnessed it. So you
see," concluded Mrs. Wiggs, "I didn't die; you mark my words, it
ain't never no use puttin' up yer umbrell' till it rains!"
</P>

<P>
Lucy laughed. "Well, you certainly practise what you preach."
</P>

<P>
"Not always," said Mrs. Wiggs. "I'm 'feared I use' to worry some
over Mr. Wiggs. T'words the last he uster pretty often&mdash;" Here
Mrs. Wiggs tipped an imaginary bottle to her lips, and gave Lucy a
significant wink. Even in the strictest confidence, she could not
bear to speak of the weakness of the late lamented.
</P>

<P>
"But no matter how bad he done, he always tried to do better. Mr.
Dick sorter puts me in mind of him 'bout that."
</P>

<P>
"Who is Mr. Dick?"
</P>

<P>
"He's Mr. Bob's friend. Stays at his rooms sence he was took down."
</P>

<P>
"Is Mr. Redding sick?" asked Lucy, the color suddenly leaving her
face.
</P>

<P>
"No, it's Mr. Dick; he's consumpted. I clean up his room ever'
mornin' He coughs all the time, jes' like Mr. Wiggs done. Other day
he had a orful spell while I was there. I wanted to git him some
whisky, but he shuck his head. 'I'm on the water-cart,' sez he.
'Bob's drivin' it.' He ain't no fatter 'n a knittin'-needle, an'
weaker 'n water. You orter see him watch fer Mr. Bob! He sets by the
winder, all propped up with pillars, an' never tecks his eyes offen
that corner. An' when Mr. Bob comes in an' sets down by him an'
tells him what's goin' on, an' sorter fools with him a spell, looks
like he picks up right off. He ain't got no folks nor nothin'&mdash;jes,
Mr. Bob. He shorely does set store by him&mdash;jes' shows it
ever' way. That's right, too. I hold that it's wrong to keep
ever'thing bottled up inside you. Yer feelin's is like ras'berry
vineger: if you 're skeered to use 'em an' keep on savin' 'em, first
thing you know they 've done 'vaporated!"
</P>

<P>
Lucy's experience had proved the contrary, but she smiled bravely
back at Mrs. Wiggs, with a new tenderness in her face.
</P>

<P>
"You have taught me lots of things!" she said impulsively. "You are
one of the best and happiest women I know."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I guess I ain't the best by a long sight, but I may be the
happiest. An' I got cause to be: four of the smartest childern that
ever lived, a nice house, fair to middlin' health when I ain't got
the rheumatiz, and folks always goin' clean out of the way to be
good to one! Ain't that 'nough to make a person happy? I'll be
fifty years old on the Fourth of July, but I hold there ain't no use
in dyin' 'fore yer time. Lots of folks is walkin' 'round jes' as
dead as they'll ever be. I believe in gittin' as much good outen
life as you kin&mdash;not that I ever set out to look fer happiness;
seems like the folks that does that never finds it. I jes' do the
best I kin where the good Lord put me at, an' it looks like I got a
happy feelin' in me 'most all the time."
</P>

<P>
Lucy sat silent for a while, gazing out of the window. Mrs. Wiggs's
philosophy was having its effect. Presently she rose and untied the
bundle she held.
</P>

<P>
"Here is a dress I brought for Asia," she said, shaking out the
folds of a soft crepon.
</P>

<P>
"Umph, umph! Ain't that grand?" exclaimed Mrs. Wiggs, coming from
behind the ironing-board to examine it. "It does seem lucky that
your leavin's jes' fits Asia, an' Asia's jes' fits Austry; there
ain't no symptoms of them bein' handed down, neither! We all model
right after you, but it looks like Asia's the only one that ketches
yer style. Oh, must you go?" she added, as Lucy picked up her
gloves.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; I promised Mrs. Schultz to read to her this afternoon."
</P>

<P>
"Well, stop in on yer way back&mdash;I'll have a little present ready
for you." It was an unwritten law that no guest should depart
without a gift of some kind. Sometimes it was one of Asia's
paintings, again it was a package of sunflower seed, or a bottle of
vinegar, and once Lucy had taken home four gourds and a bunch of
paper roses.
</P>

<P>
"I declare I never will git no work done if this weather keeps up!"
said Mrs. Wiggs, as she held the gate open. "If I wasn't so stove
up, an' nobody wasn't lookin', I'd jes' skitter 'round this here
yard like a colt!"

CHAPTER X

<H3 ALIGN="center">
AUSTRALIA'S MISHAP
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "'T is one thing to be tempted,<BR>
    Another thing to fall."<BR>
</P>

<P>
THROUGH the long, sunny afternoon Mrs. Wiggs sang over her ironing,
and Asia worked diligently in her flower-bed. Around the corner of
the shed which served as Cuba's dwelling-place, Australia and
Europena made mud-pies. Peace and harmony reigned in this shabby
Garden of Eden until temptation entered, and the weakest fell.
</P>

<P>
"'T ain't no fun jes' keepin' on makin' mud-pies," announced
Australia, after enough pastry had been manufactured to start a
miniature bakery.
</P>

<P>
"Wish we could make some white cakes, like they have at Mr.
Bagby's," said Europena.
</P>

<P>
"Could if we had some whitewash. I'll tell you what's let do! Let
's take some of Asia's paint she's goin' to paint the fence with,
an' make 'em green on top."
</P>

<P>
"Ma wouldn't like it," protested Europena; "besides, I don't want
my little pies green."
</P>

<P>
"I'm goin' to," said Australia, beginning her search for the
paint-can. "It won't take but a little teeny bit; they'll never
miss it."
</P>

<P>
After some time the desired object was discovered on a shelf in the
shed. Its high position enhanced its value, giving it the cruel
fascination of the unattainable.
</P>

<P>
"Could you stand up on my soldiers, like the man at the show?"
demanded Australia.
</P>

<P>
"I'd fall off," said Europena.
</P>

<P>
"'Fraid-cat!" taunted her sister, in disgust. "Do you reckon you
could hol' the chair while I climbed up on the back?"
</P>

<P>
"It ain't got no bottom."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it don't need to have no bottom if I'm goin' to stand on its
back," said Australia, sharply. Leaders of great enterprises must of
necessity turn deaf ears to words of discouragement.
</P>

<P>
"You might git killed," persisted Europena.
</P>

<P>
"'T wouldn't matter," said Australia, loftily; "'t wouldn't be but
the seventh time. I got three more times to die. 'Fore you was
borned I was drowned out in the country, that was one time; then I
fell in the ash-bar'l and was dead, that's two times; an'&mdash;an'
then I et the stove-polish, that's four times; an' I can't 'member,
but the nex' time will be seven. I don't keer how much I git killed,
till it's eight times, then I'm goin' to be good all the time,
'cause when you are dead nine times they put you in a hole an' throw
dirt on you!"
</P>

<P>
Australia had become so absorbed in her theory of reincarnation that
she had forgotten the paint, but the bottomless chair recalled it.
</P>

<P>
"Now, you lay 'crost the chair, Europena, an' I'll climb up," she
commanded.
</P>

<P>
Europena, though violently opposed to the undertaking, would not
forsake her leader at a critical moment. She had uttered her
protest, had tried in vain to stem the current of events; nothing
was left her now but to do or die. She valiantly braced her small
body across the frame of the chair, and Australia began her perilous
ascent.
</P>

<P>
Cuba looked mildly astonished as the plump figure of the little girl
appeared above his feed-box.
</P>

<P>
"I 've 'most got it!" cried Australia, reaching as high as possible,
and getting her forefinger over the edge of the big can.
</P>

<P>
At this juncture Cuba, whose nose had doubtless been tickled by
Australia's apron-string, gave a prodigious sneeze. Europena,
feeling that retribution was upon them, fled in terror. The ballast
being removed from the chair, the result was inevitable. A crash, a
heterogeneous combination of small girl, green paint, and shattered
chair, then a series of shrieks that resembled the whistles on New
Year's eve!
</P>

<P>
Redding was the first to the rescue. He had just driven Billy to the
gate when the screams began, and with a bound he was out of the
buggy and rushing to the scene of disaster. The picture that met his
eyes staggered him. Australia, screaming wildly, lay in what
appeared to his excited vision to be a pool of green blood; Europena
was jumping up and down beside her, calling wildly for her mother,
while Cuba, with ears erect and a green liquid trickling down his
nose, sternly surveyed the wreck. In a moment Redding had Australia
in his arms, and was mopping the paint from her face and hair.
</P>

<P>
"There, there, little sister, you aren't much hurt!" he was saying,
as Mrs. Wiggs and Asia rushed in.
</P>

<P>
The damage done proved external rather than internal, so after
assuring herself that no bones were broken Mrs. Wiggs constituted
herself a salvage corps.
</P>

<P>
"Take off yer coat out here, Mr. Bob, an' I'll take off Austry's
dress. Them's the worst, 'ceptin' her plaits. Now, we'll all go up
to the kitchen, an' see what kin be did."
</P>

<P>
Now, Fate, or it may have been the buggy at the gate, decreed that
just as they turned the corner of the house, Lucy Olcott should be
coming up the walk. For a moment she stood bewildered at the sight
that greeted her. Redding, in his shirt sleeves, was leading
Australia by the hand; the little girl wore a red-flannel petticoat,
and over her face and hands and to the full length of her flaxen
braids ran sticky streams of bright green paint.
</P>

<P>
Involuntarily, Lucy looked at Redding for explanation, and they both
laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Ain't it lucky it was the back of her head 'stid of the front?"
said Mrs. Wiggs, coming up; "it might 'a' put her eyes out. Pore
chile, she looks like a Mollygraw! Come right in, an' let's git to
work."
</P>

<P>
Billy was despatched for turpentine; Lucy, with an apron pinned
about her, began operations on Australia's hair, while Redding sat
helplessly by, waiting for Mrs. Wiggs to make his coat presentable.
</P>

<P>
"I am afraid her hair will have to be cut," said Lucy, ruefully, as
she held up a tangled snarl of yellow and green.
</P>

<P>
"All right," Mrs. Wiggs said promptly. "Whatever you say is all
right."
</P>

<P>
But Australia felt differently; her sobs, suppressed for a time,
broke forth afresh.
</P>

<P>
"I ain't goin' to have my hair cut off!" she wept. "Jes' leave it on
this a-way."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs commanded and Lucy entreated in vain. Finally Redding
drew his chair up in front of the small girl.
</P>

<P>
"Australia, listen to me just a moment, won't you? Please!"
</P>

<P>
She uncovered one eye.
</P>

<P>
"You wouldn't want green hair, would you?"
</P>

<P>
A violent shake of the head.
</P>

<P>
"Well, if you will let Miss Olcott cut off all that ugly green hair,
and give the pretty curls a chance to grow back, I'll give you&mdash;let's
see, what shall I give you?"
</P>

<P>
"A doll-buggy an' dishes," suggested Europena, who was standing by.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," he said, "doll-buggy and dishes, and a dollar besides!"
</P>

<P>
Such munificence was not to be withstood. Australia suffered herself
to be shorn, in view of the future tempering of the wind.
</P>

<P>
"You orter been a hoss-trainer, Mr. Bob," said Mrs. Wiggs,
admiringly, when the deed was accomplished; "yer voice jes' makes
folks do things!"
</P>

<P>
"Not everybody, Mrs. Wiggs," he said grimly.
</P>

<P>
"Where do you suppose Billy's went with the turkentine? I declare
that boy would be a good one to send after trouble! Oh, you ain't
goin' to try an' wear it this a-way?" she said, as Redding insisted
on putting on his coat.
</P>

<P>
As he turned to the door, a light hand touched his arm. Lucy
unfastened the violets at her belt, and timidly held them toward
him.
</P>

<P>
"Will you take them&mdash;to Dick?" she faltered.
</P>

<P>
He looked at her in amazement. For a moment neither spoke, but her
eyes made the silence eloquent; they told the secret that her lips
dared not utter. There are times when explanations are superfluous.
Redding threw discretion to the winds, and, regardless of Wiggses
and consequences, took the "Christmas Lady" in his arms, and kissed
away the year of grief and separation.
</P>

<P>
It was not until Mrs. Wiggs saw their trap disappear in the twilight
that she recovered her speech.
</P>

<P>
"Well, it certainly do beat me!" she exclaimed, after a fruitless
effort to reconstruct her standard of propriety. "I 've heard of
'painters' colic,' but I never knowed it to go to the head before!"

THE BENEFIT DANCE
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "Those there are whose hearts have a slope southward, <BR>
    and are open to the whole noon of Nature."<BR>
</P>

<P>
NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that calamities seldom come singly, it was
not until the Fourth of July that the Cabbage Patch was again the
scene of an accident.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs had been hanging out clothes, and was turning to pick up
the empty basket, when Billy precipitated himself into the yard,
yelling wildly:
</P>

<P>
"Chris Hazy's broke his leg!"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs threw up her hands in horror. "Good lands, Billy!
Where's he at?"
</P>

<P>
"They 're bringin' him up the railroad track."
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs rushed into the house. "Don't let on to Miss Hazy till we
git him in," she cautioned, snatching up a bundle of rags and a
bottle of liniment. "Pore chile! How it must hurt him! I'll run
down the track an' meet 'em."
</P>

<P>
She was breathless and trembling from excitement as she turned the
corner at Mrs. Schultz's. A crowd of boys were coming up the track,
trundling a wheelbarrow, in which sat Chris Hazy, the merriest of
the lot, waving a piece of his wooden leg in the air.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs turned upon Billy;
</P>

<P>
"I never lied, ma! I said he broke his leg," the boy gasped out as
best he could for laughing, "an' you never ast which one. Oh, boys!
Git on to the rags an' arniky!"
</P>

<P>
Such a shout went up that Mrs. Wiggs laughed with the rest, but only
for a moment, for she spied Miss Hazy tottering toward them, and she
hastened forward to relieve her anxiety.
</P>

<P>
"It's his peg-stick!" she shouted. "P-e-g-stick!"
</P>

<P>
This information, instead of bringing relief to Miss Hazy, caused a
fresh burst of tears. She sat down on the track, with her apron over
her face, and swayed backward and forward.
</P>

<P>
"Don't make much difference which one 't was," she sobbed; "it would
be 'bout as easy to git another sure-'nough leg as to git a new
wooden one. That las' one cost seven dollars. I jes' sewed an' saved
an' scrimped to git it, an' now it's&mdash;busted!"
</P>

<P>
The boys stood around in silent sympathy, and when nobody was
looking Chris wiped his eyes on his coat sleeve. Miss Hazy's
arrival had changed their point of view.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs rose to the occasion.
</P>

<P>
"Boys," she said, and her voice had an inspiring ring, "I'll tell
you what let's do! Let's give a benefit dance to-night, an' buy
Chris Hazy a new peg-stick. Every feller that's willin' to help,
hol' up his hand."
</P>

<P>
A dozen grimy hands were waved on high, and offers of assistance
came from all sides. Mrs. Wiggs saw that now was the time to utilize
their enthusiasm.
</P>

<P>
"I'll go right back to the house, an' git Asia to write out the
tickets, an' all you boys kin sell ten apiece. Miss Hazy, you kin
come over an' help me git the house ready, an' we'll put Chris to
cleanin' lamp-chimbleys."
</P>

<P>
Under this able generalship, the work was soon under way; the boys
were despatched with the tickets, and the house was being put
straight&mdash;at least the parlor was. It would have required many
days to restore order to the chaos that habitually existed in the
house of Wiggs.
</P>

<P>
"Asia, you help me roll these here barrels out on the porch, an' I
'll mop up the floor," said Mrs. Wiggs. "Miss Hazy, you look 'round
in the kitchen, an' see if you can't find a taller candle. Seems
like I put one in the sugar-bowl&mdash;that's it! Now, if you'll jes'
cut it up right fine it'll be all ready to put on the floor when I
git done."
</P>

<P>
When the floor was dry and the candle sprinkled over it, Australia
and Europena were detailed to slide upon it until it became slick.
</P>

<P>
"Would you ast ever'body to bring a cheer, or would you have 'em
already here?" asked Mrs. Wiggs.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, le' 's bring 'em ourselves!" insisted Asia, who had been to a
church social.
</P>

<P>
So a raid was made on the neighborhood, and every available chair
borrowed and ranged against the parlor wall.
</P>

<P>
By noon the boys reported most of the tickets sold, and Mrs. Wiggs
received the funds, which amounted to six dollars.
</P>

<P>
It being a holiday, everybody was glad to come to the dance,
especially as the proceeds were to help little Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
At one time there threatened to be trouble about the music; some
wanted Uncle Tom, the old negro who usually fiddled at the dances,
and others preferred to patronize home talent and have Jake Schultz,
whose accordion could be heard at all hours in the Cabbage Patch.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs effected a compromise. "They kin take turn about," she
argued; "when one gits tired, the other kin pick up right where he
left oft, an' the young folks kin shake the'r feet till they shoes
drop off. Uncle Tom an' Jake, too, is a heap sight better than them
mud-gutter bands that play 'round the streets."
</P>

<P>
"Wisht we could fix the yard up some," said Asia, when there was
nothing more to be done in the parlor.
</P>

<P>
"I got a Japanee lantern," suggested Miss Hazy, doubtfully.
</P>

<P>
"The very thing!" said Mrs. Wiggs. "We'll hang it in the front
door. Billy's makin' a Jack o' lantern to set on the fence. Fer the
land's sake! what's John Bagby a-bringing' in here?"
</P>

<P>
The grocery boy, staggering under the weight of an ice-cream freezer
and carrying something wrapped in white paper, came up the path.
</P>

<P>
"It's fer you," he said, grinning broadly. John was cross-eyed, so
Miss Hazy thought he looked at Mrs. Wiggs, and Mrs. Wiggs thought he
looked at Miss Hazy.
</P>

<P>
However, the card on the freezer dispelled all doubt: "Fer mrs Wiggs
on her 50 Birthday compelments of The Naybors."
</P>

<P>
Under the white paper was a large, white iced cake, with a "W" in
cinnamon drops on top.
</P>

<P>
"How'd they ever know it was my birthday?" exclaimed Mrs. Wiggs, in
delight. "Why, I'd even forgot it myself! We'll have the cake fer
the party to-night. Somehow, I never feel like good things b'long to
me till I pass 'em on to somebody else."
</P>

<P>
This necessitated a supply of saucers and spoons, and friends were
again called upon to provide as many as possible.
</P>

<P>
The Wiggses were quite busy until seven o'clock, when they stopped
to make their toilets.
</P>

<P>
"Where's Europena?" asked Asia.
</P>

<P>
Nobody had seen her for some time. Search was made, and she was
discovered standing on a chair in a corner of the parlor, calmly
eating the cinnamon drops off the birthday cake. Fingers and mouth
were crimson, and the first stroke of the "W" was missing. Billy was
so indignant that he insisted on immediate punishment.
</P>

<P>
"No, I ain't a-goin' to whip her on my birthday, Billy. She's
sorry; she says she is. Besides, the cake ain't spoiled; it's jes'
a 'N' now, 'stid of a 'W,' an' N stands fer Nancy jes' as good as W
stands fer Wiggs!"
</P>

<P>
The first guest to arrive was Mr. Krasmier; he had paid ten cents
toward the refreshments, and proposed to get his money's worth. Mrs.
Eichorn came early, too, but for a different reason; she was very
stout, and her happiness for the evening depended largely upon the
size of the chair she secured.
</P>

<P>
Half the spectators had arrived before the hostess appeared. Her
delay was caused by the loss of her false curls, which she had not
worn since the memorable night at the Opera House. They were very
black and very frizzled, and had been bought at a reduced price from
a traveling salesman some ten years before. Mrs. Wiggs considered
them absolutely necessary to her toilet on state occasions. Hence
consternation prevailed when they could not be found. Drawers were
upset and boxes emptied, but with no success.
</P>

<P>
When hope was about abandoned, Asia suddenly darted out to the shed
where the children kept their play-things. When she returned she
triumphantly displayed a battered doll, armless and footless, but
with a magnificent crowning glory of black, frizzed hair.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Wiggs waited until all the guests assembled before she made her
speech of thanks for the cake and cream. It was a very fine speech,
having been written out beforehand by Mr. Bagby. It began, "Ladies
and gents, it gives me pleasure&mdash;" but before Mrs. Wiggs got half
through she forgot it, and had to tell them in her own way how
grateful she was. In conclusion she said: "Couldn't nobody be more
obliged than what I am! Looks like nice things is always comin' my
way. Hope God'll bless you all! The musicianers have come, so we
'll begin the party with a Virginer reel."
</P>

<P>
The young people scampered to their places, and when Mr. Eichorn
made a bow to Mrs. Wiggs she laughingly took her place at the head
of the line, and at the first strains of "Old Dan Tucker" she went
down the middle with a grace and spirit that flatly contradicted the
little red fifty on the birthday cake.
</P>

<P>
"Swing yer pahtners, balance all, Swing dat gal wid a water-fall.
Skip light, ladies, de cake's all dough, Nebber min' de weather, so
de win' don't blow."
</P>

<P>
Old Uncle Tom was warming up to his work, and the fun waxed furious.
Asia, looking very pretty in her new crepon, cast shy glances at Joe
Eichorn, who had been "keeping company" of late. Billy, for whom
there was no room in the reel, let off his energy in the corner by a
noisy execution of the "Mobile Buck." Australia and Europena sat in
the window with Chris Hazy, and delightedly clapped time to the
music.
</P>

<P>
When the dance ended, Mrs. Wiggs went to the door to get cool. She
was completely out of breath, and her false front had worked its way
down over her eyebrows.
</P>

<P>
"Look&mdash;comin', ma!" called Billy.
</P>

<P>
When Mrs. Wiggs saw who it was she hastened down to the gate.
</P>

<P>
"Howdy, Mr. Bob; howdy, Miss Lucy! Can't you git right out an' come
in? We 're havin' a birthday party an' a benefit dance fer Chris
Hazy's leg."
</P>

<P>
"No, thanks," said Redding, trying in vain not to look at Mrs.
Wiggs's head. "We just stopped by to tell you the good news."
</P>

<P>
"'Bout Asia's position?" asked Mrs. Wiggs, eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, about that, and something else besides. What would you say if
I told you that I was going to marry the prettiest, sweetest,
dearest girl in the world?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, that's Miss Lucy!" gasped Mrs. Wiggs, more breathless than
ever. Then the truth flashed upon her, and she laughed with them.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sure 'nough! Sure 'nough! I'm jes' pleased to death!" She did
not have to tell them; her eyes, though suffering a partial eclipse,
fairly beamed with joy and satisfaction. "An' so," she added, "it
wasn't the paint, after all!"
</P>

<P>
When they had driven away, she lingered a moment at the gate. Music
and laughter came from the house behind her, as she stood smiling
out across the moonlit Cabbage Patch. Her face still held the
reflected happiness of the departed lovers, as the sky holds the
rose-tints after the sun has gone.
</P>

<P>
"An' they 're goin' to git married," she whispered softly to
herself; "an' Billy's got promoted, an' Asia's got a place, an'
Chris'll have a new peg-stick. Looks like ever'thing in the world
comes right, if we jes' wait long enough!"
</P>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
