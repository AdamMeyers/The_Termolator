    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Russian literature, so full of enigmas, contains no greater creative
      mystery than Nikolai Vasil'evich Gogol (1809-1852), who has done for the
      Russian novel and Russian prose what Pushkin has done for Russian poetry.
      Before these two men came Russian literature can hardly have been said to
      exist. It was pompous and effete with pseudo-classicism; foreign
      influences were strong; in the speech of the upper circles there was an
      over-fondness for German, French, and English words. Between them the two
      friends, by force of their great genius, cleared away the debris which
      made for sterility and erected in their stead a new structure out of
      living Russian words. The spoken word, born of the people, gave soul and
      wing to literature; only by coming to earth, the native earth, was it
      enabled to soar. Coming up from Little Russia, the Ukraine, with Cossack
      blood in his veins, Gogol injected his own healthy virus into an effete
      body, blew his own virile spirit, the spirit of his race, into its
      nostrils, and gave the Russian novel its direction to this very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that. The nomad and romantic in him, troubled and restless with
      Ukrainian myth, legend, and song, impressed upon Russian literature, faced
      with the realities of modern life, a spirit titanic and in clash with its
      material, and produced in the mastery of this every-day material, commonly
      called sordid, a phantasmagoria intense with beauty. A clue to all Russian
      realism may be found in a Russian critic's observation about Gogol:
      "Seldom has nature created a man so romantic in bent, yet so masterly in
      portraying all that is unromantic in life." But this statement does not
      cover the whole ground, for it is easy to see in almost all of Gogol's
      work his "free Cossack soul" trying to break through the shell of sordid
      to-day like some ancient demon, essentially Dionysian. So that his works,
      true though they are to our life, are at once a reproach, a protest, and a
      challenge, ever calling for joy, ancient joy, that is no more with us. And
      they have all the joy and sadness of the Ukrainian songs he loved so much.
      Ukrainian was to Gogol "the language of the soul," and it was in Ukrainian
      songs rather than in old chronicles, of which he was not a little
      contemptuous, that he read the history of his people. Time and again, in
      his essays and in his letters to friends, he expresses his boundless joy
      in these songs: "O songs, you are my joy and my life! How I love you. What
      are the bloodless chronicles I pore over beside those clear, live
      chronicles! I cannot live without songs; they... reveal everything more
      and more clearly, oh, how clearly, gone-by life and gone-by men.... The
      songs of Little Russia are her everything, her poetry, her history, and
      her ancestral grave. He who has not penetrated them deeply knows nothing
      of the past of this blooming region of Russia."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, so great was his enthusiasm for his own land that after collecting
      material for many years, the year 1833 finds him at work on a history of
      "poor Ukraine," a work planned to take up six volumes; and writing to a
      friend at this time he promises to say much in it that has not been said
      before him. Furthermore, he intended to follow this work with a universal
      history in eight volumes with a view to establishing, as far as may be
      gathered, Little Russia and the world in proper relation, connecting the
      two; a quixotic task, surely. A poet, passionate, religious, loving the
      heroic, we find him constantly impatient and fuming at the lifeless
      chronicles, which leave him cold as he seeks in vain for what he cannot
      find. "Nowhere," he writes in 1834, "can I find anything of the time which
      ought to be richer than any other in events. Here was a people whose whole
      existence was passed in activity, and which, even if nature had made it
      inactive, was compelled to go forward to great affairs and deeds because
      of its neighbours, its geographic situation, the constant danger to its
      existence.... If the Crimeans and the Turks had had a literature I am
      convinced that no history of an independent nation in Europe would prove
      so interesting as that of the Cossacks." Again he complains of the
      "withered chronicles"; it is only the wealth of his country's song that
      encourages him to go on with its history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much a visionary and a poet to be an impartial historian, it is hardly
      astonishing to note the judgment he passes on his own work, during that
      same year, 1834: "My history of Little Russia's past is an extraordinarily
      made thing, and it could not be otherwise." The deeper he goes into Little
      Russia's past the more fanatically he dreams of Little Russia's future.
      St. Petersburg wearies him, Moscow awakens no emotion in him, he yearns
      for Kieff, the mother of Russian cities, which in his vision he sees
      becoming "the Russian Athens." Russian history gives him no pleasure, and
      he separates it definitely from Ukrainian history. He is "ready to cast
      everything aside rather than read Russian history," he writes to Pushkin.
      During his seven-year stay in St. Petersburg (1829-36) Gogol zealously
      gathered historical material and, in the words of Professor Kotlyarevsky,
      "lived in the dream of becoming the Thucydides of Little Russia." How
      completely he disassociated Ukrainia from Northern Russia may be judged by
      the conspectus of his lectures written in 1832. He says in it, speaking of
      the conquest of Southern Russia in the fourteenth century by Prince
      Guedimin at the head of his Lithuanian host, still dressed in the skins of
      wild beasts, still worshipping the ancient fire and practising pagan
      rites: "Then Southern Russia, under the mighty protection of Lithuanian
      princes, completely separated itself from the North. Every bond between
      them was broken; two kingdoms were established under a single name&mdash;Russia&mdash;one
      under the Tatar yoke, the other under the same rule with Lithuanians. But
      actually they had no relation with one another; different laws, different
      customs, different aims, different bonds, and different activities gave
      them wholly different characters."
    </p>
    <p>
      This same Prince Guedimin freed Kieff from the Tatar yoke. This city had
      been laid waste by the golden hordes of Ghengis Khan and hidden for a very
      long time from the Slavonic chronicler as behind an impenetrable curtain.
      A shrewd man, Guedimin appointed a Slavonic prince to rule over the city
      and permitted the inhabitants to practise their own faith, Greek
      Christianity. Prior to the Mongol invasion, which brought conflagration
      and ruin, and subjected Russia to a two-century bondage, cutting her off
      from Europe, a state of chaos existed and the separate tribes fought with
      one another constantly and for the most petty reasons. Mutual depredations
      were possible owing to the absence of mountain ranges; there were no
      natural barriers against sudden attack. The openness of the steppe made
      the people war-like. But this very openness made it possible later for
      Guedimin's pagan hosts, fresh from the fir forests of what is now White
      Russia, to make a clean sweep of the whole country between Lithuania and
      Poland, and thus give the scattered princedoms a much-needed cohesion. In
      this way Ukrainia was formed. Except for some forests, infested with
      bears, the country was one vast plain, marked by an occasional hillock.
      Whole herds of wild horses and deer stampeded the country, overgrown with
      tall grass, while flocks of wild goats wandered among the rocks of the
      Dnieper. Apart from the Dnieper, and in some measure the Desna, emptying
      into it, there were no navigable rivers and so there was little
      opportunity for a commercial people. Several tributaries cut across, but
      made no real boundary line. Whether you looked to the north towards
      Russia, to the east towards the Tatars, to the south towards the Crimean
      Tatars, to the west towards Poland, everywhere the country bordered on a
      field, everywhere on a plain, which left it open to the invader from every
      side. Had there been here, suggests Gogol in his introduction to his
      never-written history of Little Russia, if upon one side only, a real
      frontier of mountain or sea, the people who settled here might have formed
      a definite political body. Without this natural protection it became a
      land subject to constant attack and despoliation. "There where three
      hostile nations came in contact it was manured with bones, wetted with
      blood. A single Tatar invasion destroyed the whole labour of the
      soil-tiller; the meadows and the cornfields were trodden down by horses or
      destroyed by flame, the lightly-built habitations reduced to the ground,
      the inhabitants scattered or driven off into captivity together with
      cattle. It was a land of terror, and for this reason there could develop
      in it only a warlike people, strong in its unity and desperate, a people
      whose whole existence was bound to be trained and confined to war."
    </p>
    <p>
      This constant menace, this perpetual pressure of foes on all sides, acted
      at last like a fierce hammer shaping and hardening resistance against
      itself. The fugitive from Poland, the fugitive from the Tatar and the
      Turk, homeless, with nothing to lose, their lives ever exposed to danger,
      forsook their peaceful occupations and became transformed into a warlike
      people, known as the Cossacks, whose appearance towards the end of the
      thirteenth century or at the beginning of the fourteenth was a remarkable
      event which possibly alone (suggests Gogol) prevented any further inroads
      by the two Mohammedan nations into Europe. The appearance of the Cossacks
      was coincident with the appearance in Europe of brotherhoods and
      knighthood-orders, and this new race, in spite of its living the life of
      marauders, in spite of turnings its foes' tactics upon its foes, was not
      free of the religious spirit of its time; if it warred for its existence
      it warred not less for its faith, which was Greek. Indeed, as the nation
      grew stronger and became conscious of its strength, the struggle began to
      partake something of the nature of a religious war, not alone defensive
      but aggressive also, against the unbeliever. While any man was free to
      join the brotherhood it was obligatory to believe in the Greek faith. It
      was this religious unity, blazed into activity by the presence across the
      borders of unbelieving nations, that alone indicated the germ of a
      political body in this gathering of men, who otherwise lived the audacious
      lives of a band of highway robbers. "There was, however," says Gogol,
      "none of the austerity of the Catholic knight in them; they bound
      themselves to no vows or fasts; they put no self-restraint upon themselves
      or mortified their flesh, but were indomitable like the rocks of the
      Dnieper among which they lived, and in their furious feasts and revels
      they forgot the whole world. That same intimate brotherhood, maintained in
      robber communities, bound them together. They had everything in common&mdash;wine,
      food, dwelling. A perpetual fear, a perpetual danger, inspired them with a
      contempt towards life. The Cossack worried more about a good measure of
      wine than about his fate. One has to see this denizen of the frontier in
      his half-Tatar, half-Polish costume&mdash;which so sharply outlined the
      spirit of the borderland&mdash;galloping in Asiatic fashion on his horse,
      now lost in thick grass, now leaping with the speed of a tiger from
      ambush, or emerging suddenly from the river or swamp, all clinging with
      mud, and appearing an image of terror to the Tatar...."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the community grew and with its growing it began to
      assume a general character. The beginning of the sixteenth century found
      whole villages settled with families, enjoying the protection of the
      Cossacks, who exacted certain obligations, chiefly military, so that these
      settlements bore a military character. The sword and the plough were
      friends which fraternised at every settler's. On the other hand, Gogol
      tells us, the gay bachelors began to make depredations across the border
      to sweep down on Tatars' wives and their daughters and to marry them.
      "Owing to this co-mingling, their facial features, so different from one
      another's, received a common impress, tending towards the Asiatic. And so
      there came into being a nation in faith and place belonging to Europe; on
      the other hand, in ways of life, customs, and dress quite Asiatic. It was
      a nation in which the world's two extremes came in contact; European
      caution and Asiatic indifference, niavete and cunning, an intense activity
      and the greatest laziness and indulgence, an aspiration to development and
      perfection, and again a desire to appear indifferent to perfection."
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Ukraine took on its colour from the Cossack, and if I have drawn
      largely on Gogol's own account of the origins of this race, it was because
      it seemed to me that Gogol's emphasis on the heroic rather than on the
      historical&mdash;Gogol is generally discounted as an historian&mdash;would
      give the reader a proper approach to the mood in which he created "Taras
      Bulba," the finest epic in Russian literature. Gogol never wrote either
      his history of Little Russia or his universal history. Apart from several
      brief studies, not always reliable, the net result of his many years'
      application to his scholarly projects was this brief epic in prose,
      Homeric in mood. The sense of intense living, "living dangerously"&mdash;to
      use a phrase of Nietzsche's, the recognition of courage as the greatest of
      all virtues&mdash;the God in man, inspired Gogol, living in an age which
      tended toward grey tedium, with admiration for his more fortunate
      forefathers, who lived in "a poetic time, when everything was won with the
      sword, when every one in his turn strove to be an active being and not a
      spectator." Into this short work he poured all his love of the heroic, all
      his romanticism, all his poetry, all his joy. Its abundance of life bears
      one along like a fast-flowing river. And it is not without humour, a calm,
      detached humour, which, as the critic Bolinsky puts it, is not there
      merely "because Gogol has a tendency to see the comic in everything, but
      because it is true to life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet "Taras Bulba" was in a sense an accident, just as many other works of
      great men are accidents. It often requires a happy combination of
      circumstances to produce a masterpiece. I have already told in my
      introduction to "Dead Souls" (1) how Gogol created his great realistic
      masterpiece, which was to influence Russian literature for generations to
      come, under the influence of models so remote in time or place as "Don
      Quixote" or "Pickwick Papers"; and how this combination of influences
      joined to his own genius produced a work quite new and original in effect
      and only remotely reminiscent of the models which have inspired it. And
      just as "Dead Souls" might never have been written if "Don Quixote" had
      not existed, so there is every reason to believe that "Taras Bulba" could
      not have been written without the "Odyssey." Once more ancient fire gave
      life to new beauty. And yet at the time Gogol could not have had more than
      a smattering of the "Odyssey." The magnificent translation made by his
      friend Zhukovsky had not yet appeared and Gogol, in spite of his ambition
      to become a historian, was not equipped as a scholar. But it is evident
      from his dithyrambic letter on the appearance of Zhukovsky's version,
      forming one of the famous series of letters known as "Correspondence with
      Friends," that he was better acquainted with the spirit of Homer than any
      mere scholar could be. That letter, unfortunately unknown to the English
      reader, would make every lover of the classics in this day of their
      disparagement dance with joy. He describes the "Odyssey" as the forgotten
      source of all that is beautiful and harmonious in life, and he greets its
      appearance in Russian dress at a time when life is sordid and discordant
      as a thing inevitable, "cooling" in effect upon a too hectic world. He
      sees in its perfect grace, its calm and almost childlike simplicity, a
      power for individual and general good. "It combines all the fascination of
      a fairy tale and all the simple truth of human adventure, holding out the
      same allurement to every being, whether he is a noble, a commoner, a
      merchant, a literate or illiterate person, a private soldier, a lackey,
      children of both sexes, beginning at an age when a child begins to love a
      fairy tale&mdash;all might read it or listen to it, without tedium." Every
      one will draw from it what he most needs. Not less than upon these he sees
      its wholesome effect on the creative writer, its refreshing influence on
      the critic. But most of all he dwells on its heroic qualities, inseparable
      to him from what is religious in the "Odyssey"; and, says Gogol, this book
      contains the idea that a human being, "wherever he might be, whatever
      pursuit he might follow, is threatened by many woes, that he must need
      wrestle with them&mdash;for that very purpose was life given to him&mdash;that
      never for a single instant must he despair, just as Odysseus did not
      despair, who in every hard and oppressive moment turned to his own heart,
      unaware that with this inner scrutiny of himself he had already said that
      hidden prayer uttered in a moment of distress by every man having no
      understanding whatever of God." Then he goes on to compare the ancient
      harmony, perfect down to every detail of dress, to the slightest action,
      with our slovenliness and confusion and pettiness, a sad result&mdash;considering
      our knowledge of past experience, our possession of superior weapons, our
      religion given to make us holy and superior beings. And in conclusion he
      asks: Is not the "Odyssey" in every sense a deep reproach to our
      nineteenth century?

      An understanding of Gogol's point of view gives the key to "Taras Bulba."
      For in this panoramic canvas of the Setch, the military brotherhood of the
      Cossacks, living under open skies, picturesquely and heroically, he has
      drawn a picture of his romantic ideal, which if far from perfect at any
      rate seemed to him preferable to the grey tedium of a city peopled with
      government officials. Gogol has written in "Taras Bulba" his own reproach
      to the nineteenth century. It is sad and joyous like one of those
      Ukrainian songs which have helped to inspire him to write it. And then, as
      he cut himself off more and more from the world of the past, life became a
      sadder and still sadder thing to him; modern life, with all its gigantic
      pettiness, closed in around him, he began to write of petty officials and
      of petty scoundrels, "commonplace heroes" he called them. But nothing is
      ever lost in this world. Gogol's romanticism, shut in within himself,
      finding no outlet, became a flame. It was a flame of pity. He was like a
      man walking in hell, pitying. And that was the miracle, the
      transfiguration. Out of that flame of pity the Russian novel was born.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Turn round, my boy! How ridiculous you look! What sort of a priest's
      cassock have you got on? Does everybody at the academy dress like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With such words did old Bulba greet his two sons, who had been absent for
      their education at the Royal Seminary of Kief, and had now returned home
      to their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sons had but just dismounted from their horses. They were a couple of
      stout lads who still looked bashful, as became youths recently released
      from the seminary. Their firm healthy faces were covered with the first
      down of manhood, down which had, as yet, never known a razor. They were
      greatly discomfited by such a reception from their father, and stood
      motionless with eyes fixed upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand still, stand still! let me have a good look at you," he continued,
      turning them around. "How long your gaberdines are! What gaberdines! There
      never were such gaberdines in the world before. Just run, one of you! I
      want to see whether you will not get entangled in the skirts, and fall
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't laugh, don't laugh, father!" said the eldest lad at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How touchy we are! Why shouldn't I laugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, although you are my father, if you laugh, by heavens, I will
      strike you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of son are you? what, strike your father!" exclaimed Taras
      Bulba, retreating several paces in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, even my father. I don't stop to consider persons when an insult is
      in question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you want to fight me? with your fist, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let it be fisticuffs," said Taras Bulba, turning up his sleeves.
      "I'll see what sort of a man you are with your fists."
    </p>
    <p>
      And father and son, in lieu of a pleasant greeting after long separation,
      began to deal each other heavy blows on ribs, back, and chest, now
      retreating and looking at each other, now attacking afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, good people! the old man has gone man! he has lost his senses
      completely!" screamed their pale, ugly, kindly mother, who was standing on
      the threshold, and had not yet succeeded in embracing her darling
      children. "The children have come home, we have not seen them for over a
      year; and now he has taken some strange freak&mdash;he's pommelling them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he fights well," said Bulba, pausing; "well, by heavens!" he
      continued, rather as if excusing himself, "although he has never tried his
      hand at it before, he will make a good Cossack! Now, welcome, son! embrace
      me," and father and son began to kiss each other. "Good lad! see that you
      hit every one as you pommelled me; don't let any one escape. Nevertheless
      your clothes are ridiculous all the same. What rope is this hanging there?&mdash;And
      you, you lout, why are you standing there with your hands hanging beside
      you?" he added, turning to the youngest. "Why don't you fight me? you son
      of a dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an idea!" said the mother, who had managed in the meantime to
      embrace her youngest. "Who ever heard of children fighting their own
      father? That's enough for the present; the child is young, he has had a
      long journey, he is tired." The child was over twenty, and about six feet
      high. "He ought to rest, and eat something; and you set him to fighting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a gabbler!" said Bulba. "Don't listen to your mother, my lad; she
      is a woman, and knows nothing. What sort of petting do you need? A clear
      field and a good horse, that's the kind of petting for you! And do you see
      this sword? that's your mother! All the rest people stuff your heads with
      is rubbish; the academy, books, primers, philosophy, and all that, I spit
      upon it all!" Here Bulba added a word which is not used in print. "But
      I'll tell you what is best: I'll take you to Zaporozhe (1) this very week.
      That's where there's science for you! There's your school; there alone
      will you gain sense."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (1) The Cossack country beyond (za) the falls (porozhe) of the
    Dnieper.
</pre>
    <p>
      "And are they only to remain home a week?" said the worn old mother sadly
      and with tears in her eyes. "The poor boys will have no chance of looking
      around, no chance of getting acquainted with the home where they were
      born; there will be no chance for me to get a look at them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, you've howled quite enough, old woman! A Cossack is not born to
      run around after women. You would like to hide them both under your
      petticoat, and sit upon them as a hen sits on eggs. Go, go, and let us
      have everything there is on the table in a trice. We don't want any
      dumplings, honey-cakes, poppy-cakes, or any other such messes: give us a
      whole sheep, a goat, mead forty years old, and as much corn-brandy as
      possible, not with raisins and all sorts of stuff, but plain scorching
      corn-brandy, which foams and hisses like mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba led his sons into the principal room of the hut; and two pretty
      servant girls wearing coin necklaces, who were arranging the apartment,
      ran out quickly. They were either frightened at the arrival of the young
      men, who did not care to be familiar with anyone; or else they merely
      wanted to keep up their feminine custom of screaming and rushing away
      headlong at the sight of a man, and then screening their blushes for some
      time with their sleeves. The hut was furnished according to the fashion of
      that period&mdash;a fashion concerning which hints linger only in the
      songs and lyrics, no longer sung, alas! in the Ukraine as of yore by blind
      old men, to the soft tinkling of the native guitar, to the people
      thronging round them&mdash;according to the taste of that warlike and
      troublous time, of leagues and battles prevailing in the Ukraine after the
      union. Everything was cleanly smeared with coloured clay. On the walls
      hung sabres, hunting-whips, nets for birds, fishing-nets, guns,
      elaborately carved powder-horns, gilded bits for horses, and tether-ropes
      with silver plates. The small window had round dull panes, through which
      it was impossible to see except by opening the one moveable one. Around
      the windows and doors red bands were painted. On shelves in one corner
      stood jugs, bottles, and flasks of green and blue glass, carved silver
      cups, and gilded drinking vessels of various makes&mdash;Venetian,
      Turkish, Tscherkessian, which had reached Bulba's cabin by various roads,
      at third and fourth hand, a thing common enough in those bold days. There
      were birch-wood benches all around the room, a huge table under the holy
      pictures in one corner, and a huge stove covered with particoloured
      patterns in relief, with spaces between it and the wall. All this was
      quite familiar to the two young men, who were wont to come home every year
      during the dog-days, since they had no horses, and it was not customary to
      allow students to ride afield on horseback. The only distinctive things
      permitted them were long locks of hair on the temples, which every Cossack
      who bore weapons was entitled to pull. It was only at the end of their
      course of study that Bulba had sent them a couple of young stallions from
      his stud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba, on the occasion of his sons' arrival, ordered all the sotniks or
      captains of hundreds, and all the officers of the band who were of any
      consequence, to be summoned; and when two of them arrived with his old
      comrade, the Osaul or sub-chief, Dmitro Tovkatch, he immediately presented
      the lads, saying, "See what fine young fellows they are! I shall send them
      to the Setch (2) shortly." The guests congratulated Bulba and the young
      men, telling them they would do well and that there was no better
      knowledge for a young man than a knowledge of that same Zaporozhian Setch.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) The village or, rather, permanent camp of the Zaporozhian
    Cossacks.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Come, brothers, seat yourselves, each where he likes best, at the table;
      come, my sons. First of all, let's take some corn-brandy," said Bulba.
      "God bless you! Welcome, lads; you, Ostap, and you, Andrii. God grant that
      you may always be successful in war, that you may beat the Musselmans and
      the Turks and the Tatars; and that when the Poles undertake any expedition
      against our faith, you may beat the Poles. Come, clink your glasses. How
      now? Is the brandy good? What's corn-brandy in Latin? The Latins were
      stupid: they did not know there was such a thing in the world as
      corn-brandy. What was the name of the man who wrote Latin verses? I don't
      know much about reading and writing, so I don't quite know. Wasn't it
      Horace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dad!" thought the elder son Ostap. "The old dog knows everything,
      but he always pretends the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe the archimandrite allowed you so much as a smell of
      corn-brandy," continued Taras. "Confess, my boys, they thrashed you well
      with fresh birch-twigs on your backs and all over your Cossack bodies; and
      perhaps, when you grew too sharp, they beat you with whips. And not on
      Saturday only, I fancy, but on Wednesday and Thursday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is past, father, need not be recalled; it is done with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them try it know," said Andrii. "Let anybody just touch me, let any
      Tatar risk it now, and he'll soon learn what a Cossack's sword is like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, my son, by heavens, good! And when it comes to that, I'll go with
      you; by heavens, I'll go too! What should I wait here for? To become a
      buckwheat-reaper and housekeeper, to look after the sheep and swine, and
      loaf around with my wife? Away with such nonsense! I am a Cossack; I'll
      have none of it! What's left but war? I'll go with you to Zaporozhe to
      carouse; I'll go, by heavens!" And old Bulba, growing warm by degrees and
      finally quite angry, rose from the table, and, assuming a dignified
      attitude, stamped his foot. "We will go to-morrow! Wherefore delay? What
      enemy can we besiege here? What is this hut to us? What do we want with
      all these things? What are pots and pans to us?" So saying, he began to
      knock over the pots and flasks, and to throw them about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old woman, well used to such freaks on the part of her husband,
      looked sadly on from her seat on the wall-bench. She did not dare say a
      word; but when she heard the decision which was so terrible for her, she
      could not refrain from tears. As she looked at her children, from whom so
      speedy a separation was threatened, it is impossible to describe the full
      force of her speechless grief, which seemed to quiver in her eyes and on
      her lips convulsively pressed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba was terribly headstrong. He was one of those characters which could
      only exist in that fierce fifteenth century, and in that half-nomadic
      corner of Europe, when the whole of Southern Russia, deserted by its
      princes, was laid waste and burned to the quick by pitiless troops of
      Mongolian robbers; when men deprived of house and home grew brave there;
      when, amid conflagrations, threatening neighbours, and eternal terrors,
      they settled down, and growing accustomed to looking these things straight
      in the face, trained themselves not to know that there was such a thing as
      fear in the world; when the old, peacable Slav spirit was fired with
      warlike flame, and the Cossack state was instituted&mdash;a free, wild
      outbreak of Russian nature&mdash;and when all the river-banks, fords, and
      like suitable places were peopled by Cossacks, whose number no man knew.
      Their bold comrades had a right to reply to the Sultan when he asked how
      many they were, "Who knows? We are scattered all over the steppes;
      wherever there is a hillock, there is a Cossack."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, a most remarkable exhibition of Russian strength, forced
      by dire necessity from the bosom of the people. In place of the original
      provinces with their petty towns, in place of the warring and bartering
      petty princes ruling in their cities, there arose great colonies, kurens
      (3), and districts, bound together by one common danger and hatred against
      the heathen robbers. The story is well known how their incessant warfare
      and restless existence saved Europe from the merciless hordes which
      threatened to overwhelm her. The Polish kings, who now found themselves
      sovereigns, in place of the provincial princes, over these extensive
      tracts of territory, fully understood, despite the weakness and remoteness
      of their own rule, the value of the Cossacks, and the advantages of the
      warlike, untrammelled life led by them. They encouraged them and flattered
      this disposition of mind. Under their distant rule, the hetmans or chiefs,
      chosen from among the Cossacks themselves, redistributed the territory
      into military districts. It was not a standing army, no one saw it; but in
      case of war and general uprising, it required a week, and no more, for
      every man to appear on horseback, fully armed, receiving only one ducat
      from the king; and in two weeks such a force had assembled as no
      recruiting officers would ever have been able to collect. When the
      expedition was ended, the army dispersed among the fields and meadows and
      the fords of the Dnieper; each man fished, wrought at his trade, brewed
      his beer, and was once more a free Cossack. Their foreign contemporaries
      rightly marvelled at their wonderful qualities. There was no handicraft
      which the Cossack was not expert at: he could distil brandy, build a
      waggon, make powder, and do blacksmith's and gunsmith's work, in addition
      to committing wild excesses, drinking and carousing as only a Russian can&mdash;all
      this he was equal to. Besides the registered Cossacks, who considered
      themselves bound to appear in arms in time of war, it was possible to
      collect at any time, in case of dire need, a whole army of volunteers. All
      that was required was for the Osaul or sub-chief to traverse the
      market-places and squares of the villages and hamlets, and shout at the
      top of his voice, as he stood in his waggon, "Hey, you distillers and
      beer-brewers! you have brewed enough beer, and lolled on your stoves, and
      stuffed your fat carcasses with flour, long enough! Rise, win glory and
      warlike honours! You ploughmen, you reapers of buckwheat, you tenders of
      sheep, you danglers after women, enough of following the plough, and
      soiling your yellow shoes in the earth, and courting women, and wasting
      your warlike strength! The hour has come to win glory for the Cossacks!"
      These words were like sparks falling on dry wood. The husbandman broke his
      plough; the brewers and distillers threw away their casks and destroyed
      their barrels; the mechanics and merchants sent their trade and their shop
      to the devil, broke pots and everything else in their homes, and mounted
      their horses. In short, the Russian character here received a profound
      development, and manifested a powerful outwards expression.

    <p>
      Taras was one of the band of old-fashioned leaders; he was born for
      warlike emotions, and was distinguished for his uprightness of character.
      At that epoch the influence of Poland had already begun to make itself
      felt upon the Russian nobility. Many had adopted Polish customs, and began
      to display luxury in splendid staffs of servants, hawks, huntsmen,
      dinners, and palaces. This was not to Taras's taste. He liked the simple
      life of the Cossacks, and quarrelled with those of his comrades who were
      inclined to the Warsaw party, calling them serfs of the Polish nobles.
      Ever on the alert, he regarded himself as the legal protector of the
      orthodox faith. He entered despotically into any village where there was a
      general complaint of oppression by the revenue farmers and of the addition
      of fresh taxes on necessaries. He and his Cossacks executed justice, and
      made it a rule that in three cases it was absolutely necessary to resort
      to the sword. Namely, when the commissioners did not respect the superior
      officers and stood before them covered; when any one made light of the
      faith and did not observe the customs of his ancestors; and, finally, when
      the enemy were Mussulmans or Turks, against whom he considered it
      permissible, in every case, to draw the sword for the glory of
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he rejoiced beforehand at the thought of how he would present himself
      with his two sons at the Setch, and say, "See what fine young fellows I
      have brought you!" how he would introduce them to all his old comrades,
      steeled in warfare; how he would observe their first exploits in the
      sciences of war and of drinking, which was also regarded as one of the
      principal warlike qualities. At first he had intended to send them forth
      alone; but at the sight of their freshness, stature, and manly personal
      beauty his martial spirit flamed up and he resolved to go with them
      himself the very next day, although there was no necessity for this except
      his obstinate self-will. He began at once to hurry about and give orders;
      selected horses and trappings for his sons, looked through the stables and
      storehouses, and chose servants to accompany them on the morrow. He
      delegated his power to Osaul Tovkatch, and gave with it a strict command
      to appear with his whole force at the Setch the very instant he should
      receive a message from him. Although he was jolly, and the effects of his
      drinking bout still lingered in his brain, he forgot nothing. He even gave
      orders that the horses should be watered, their cribs filled, and that
      they should be fed with the finest corn; and then he retired, fatigued
      with all his labours.

      "Now, children, we must sleep, but to-morrow we shall do what God wills.
      Don't prepare us a bed: we need no bed; we will sleep in the courtyard."

      Night had but just stole over the heavens, but Bulba always went to bed
      early. He lay down on a rug and covered himself with a sheepskin pelisse,
      for the night air was quite sharp and he liked to lie warm when he was at
      home. He was soon snoring, and the whole household speedily followed his
      example. All snored and groaned as they lay in different corners. The
      watchman went to sleep the first of all, he had drunk so much in honour of
      the young masters' home-coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother alone did not sleep. She bent over the pillow of her beloved
      sons, as they lay side by side; she smoothed with a comb their carelessly
      tangled locks, and moistened them with her tears. She gazed at them with
      her whole soul, with every sense; she was wholly merged in the gaze, and
      yet she could not gaze enough. She had fed them at her own breast, she had
      tended them and brought them up; and now to see them only for an instant!
      "My sons, my darling sons! what will become of you! what fate awaits you?"
      she said, and tears stood in the wrinkles which disfigured her once
      beautiful face. In truth, she was to be pitied, as was every woman of that
      period. She had lived only for a moment of love, only during the first
      ardour of passion, only during the first flush of youth; and then her grim
      betrayer had deserted her for the sword, for his comrades and his
      carouses. She saw her husband two or three days in a year, and then, for
      several years, heard nothing of him. And when she did see him, when they
      did live together, what a life was hers! She endured insult, even blows;
      she felt caresses bestowed only in pity; she was a misplaced object in
      that community of unmarried warriors, upon which wandering Zaporozhe cast
      a colouring of its own. Her pleasureless youth flitted by; her ripe cheeks
      and bosom withered away unkissed and became covered with premature
      wrinkles. Love, feeling, everything that is tender and passionate in a
      woman, was converted in her into maternal love. She hovered around her
      children with anxiety, passion, tears, like the gull of the steppes. They
      were taking her sons, her darling sons, from her&mdash;taking them from
      her, so that she should never see them again! Who knew? Perhaps a Tatar
      would cut off their heads in the very first skirmish, and she would never
      know where their deserted bodies might lie, torn by birds of prey; and yet
      for each single drop of their blood she would have given all hers.
      Sobbing, she gazed into their eyes, and thought, "Perhaps Bulba, when he
      wakes, will put off their departure for a day or two; perhaps it occurred
      to him to go so soon because he had been drinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon from the summit of the heavens had long since lit up the whole
      courtyard filled with sleepers, the thick clump of willows, and the tall
      steppe-grass, which hid the palisade surrounding the court. She still sat
      at her sons' pillow, never removing her eyes from them for a moment, nor
      thinking of sleep. Already the horses, divining the approach of dawn, had
      ceased eating and lain down upon the grass; the topmost leaves of the
      willows began to rustle softly, and little by little the rippling rustle
      descended to their bases. She sat there until daylight, unwearied, and
      wishing in her heart that the night might prolong itself indefinitely.
      From the steppes came the ringing neigh of the horses, and red streaks
      shone brightly in the sky. Bulba suddenly awoke, and sprang to his feet.
      He remembered quite well what he had ordered the night before. "Now, my
      men, you've slept enough! 'tis time, 'tis time! Water the horses! And
      where is the old woman?" He generally called his wife so. "Be quick, old
      woman, get us something to eat; the way is long."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old woman, deprived of her last hope, slipped sadly into the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she, with tears, prepared what was needed for breakfast, Bulba gave
      his orders, went to the stable, and selected his best trappings for his
      children with his own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scholars were suddenly transformed. Red morocco boots with silver
      heels took the place of their dirty old ones; trousers wide as the Black
      Sea, with countless folds and plaits, were kept up by golden girdles from
      which hung long slender thongs, with tassles and other tinkling things,
      for pipes. Their jackets of scarlet cloth were girt by flowered sashes
      into which were thrust engraved Turkish pistols; their swords clanked at
      their heels. Their faces, already a little sunburnt, seemed to have grown
      handsomer and whiter; their slight black moustaches now cast a more
      distinct shadow on this pallor and set off their healthy youthful
      complexions. They looked very handsome in their black sheepskin caps, with
      cloth-of-gold crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their poor mother saw them, she could not utter a word, and tears
      stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my lads, all is ready; no delay!" said Bulba at last. "But we must
      first all sit down together, in accordance with Christian custom before a
      journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      All sat down, not excepting the servants, who had been standing
      respectfully at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, mother, bless your children," said Bulba. "Pray God that they may
      fight bravely, always defend their warlike honour, always defend the faith
      of Christ; and, if not, that they may die, so that their breath may not be
      longer in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to your mother, children; a mother's prayer protects on land and
      sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, weak as mothers are, embraced them, drew out two small holy
      pictures, and hung them, sobbing, around their necks. "May God's mother&mdash;keep
      you! Children, do not forget your mother&mdash;send some little word of
      yourselves&mdash;" She could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, children, let us go," said Bulba.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door stood the horses, ready saddled. Bulba sprang upon his
      "Devil," which bounded wildly, on feeling on his back a load of over
      thirty stone, for Taras was extremely stout and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the mother saw that her sons were also mounted, she rushed towards
      the younger, whose features expressed somewhat more gentleness than those
      of his brother. She grasped his stirrup, clung to his saddle, and with
      despair in her eyes, refused to loose her hold. Two stout Cossacks seized
      her carefully, and bore her back into the hut. But before the cavalcade
      had passed out of the courtyard, she rushed with the speed of a wild goat,
      disproportionate to her years, to the gate, stopped a horse with
      irresistible strength, and embraced one of her sons with mad, unconscious
      violence. Then they led her away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Cossacks rode on sadly, repressing their tears out of fear of
      their father, who, on his side, was somewhat moved, although he strove not
      to show it. The morning was grey, the green sward bright, the birds
      twittered rather discordantly. They glanced back as they rode. Their
      paternal farm seemed to have sunk into the earth. All that was visible
      above the surface were the two chimneys of their modest hut and the tops
      of the trees up whose trunks they had been used to climb like squirrels.
      Before them still stretched the field by which they could recall the whole
      story of their lives, from the years when they rolled in its dewy grass
      down to the years when they awaited in it the dark-browed Cossack maiden,
      running timidly across it on quick young feet. There is the pole above the
      well, with the waggon wheel fastened to its top, rising solitary against
      the sky; already the level which they have traversed appears a hill in the
      distance, and now all has disappeared. Farewell, childhood, games, all,
      all, farewell!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      All three horsemen rode in silence. Old Taras's thoughts were far away:
      before him passed his youth, his years&mdash;the swift-flying years, over
      which the Cossack always weeps, wishing that his life might be all youth.
      He wondered whom of his former comrades he should meet at the Setch. He
      reckoned up how many had already died, how many were still alive. Tears
      formed slowly in his eyes, and his grey head bent sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sons were occupied with other thoughts. But we must speak further of
      his sons. They had been sent, when twelve years old, to the academy at
      Kief, because all leaders of that day considered it indispensable to give
      their children an education, although it was afterwards utterly forgotten.
      Like all who entered the academy, they were wild, having been brought up
      in unrestrained freedom; and whilst there they had acquired some polish,
      and pursued some common branches of knowledge which gave them a certain
      resemblance to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder, Ostap, began his scholastic career by running away in the
      course of the first year. They brought him back, whipped him well, and set
      him down to his books. Four times did he bury his primer in the earth; and
      four times, after giving him a sound thrashing, did they buy him a new
      one. But he would no doubt have repeated this feat for the fifth time, had
      not his father given him a solemn assurance that he would keep him at
      monastic work for twenty years, and sworn in advance that he should never
      behold Zaporozhe all his life long, unless he learned all the sciences
      taught in the academy. It was odd that the man who said this was that very
      Taras Bulba who condemned all learning, and counselled his children, as we
      have seen, not to trouble themselves at all about it. From that moment,
      Ostap began to pore over his tiresome books with exemplary diligence, and
      quickly stood on a level with the best. The style of education in that age
      differed widely from the manner of life. The scholastic, grammatical,
      rhetorical, and logical subtle ties in vogue were decidedly out of
      consonance with the times, never having any connection with, and never
      being encountered in, actual life. Those who studied them, even the least
      scholastic, could not apply their knowledge to anything whatever. The
      learned men of those days were even more incapable than the rest, because
      farther removed from all experience. Moreover, the republican constitution
      of the academy, the fearful multitude of young, healthy, strong fellows,
      inspired the students with an activity quite outside the limits of their
      learning. Poor fare, or frequent punishments of fasting, with the numerous
      requirements arising in fresh, strong, healthy youth, combined to arouse
      in them that spirit of enterprise which was afterwards further developed
      among the Zaporozhians. The hungry student running about the streets of
      Kief forced every one to be on his guard. Dealers sitting in the bazaar
      covered their pies, their cakes, and their pumpkin-rolls with their hands,
      like eagles protecting their young, if they but caught sight of a passing
      student. The consul or monitor, who was bound by his duty to look after
      the comrades entrusted to his care, had such frightfully wide pockets to
      his trousers that he could stow away the whole contents of the gaping
      dealer's stall in them. These students constituted an entirely separate
      world, for they were not admitted to the higher circles, composed of
      Polish and Russian nobles. Even the Waiwode, Adam Kisel, in spite of the
      patronage he bestowed upon the academy, did not seek to introduce them
      into society, and ordered them to be kept more strictly in supervision.
      This command was quite superfluous, for neither the rector nor the monkish
      professors spared rod or whip; and the lictors sometimes, by their orders,
      lashed their consuls so severely that the latter rubbed their trousers for
      weeks afterwards. This was to many of them a trifle, only a little more
      stinging than good vodka with pepper: others at length grew tired of such
      constant blisters, and ran away to Zaporozhe if they could find the road
      and were not caught on the way. Ostap Bulba, although he began to study
      logic, and even theology, with much zeal, did not escape the merciless
      rod. Naturally, all this tended to harden his character, and give him that
      firmness which distinguishes the Cossacks. He always held himself aloof
      from his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rarely led others into such hazardous enterprises as robbing a strange
      garden or orchard; but, on the other hand, he was always among the first
      to join the standard of an adventurous student. And never, under any
      circumstances, did he betray his comrades; neither imprisonment nor
      beatings could make him do so. He was unassailable by any temptations save
      those of war and revelry; at least, he scarcely ever dreamt of others. He
      was upright with his equals. He was kind-hearted, after the only fashion
      that kind-heartedness could exist in such a character and at such a time.
      He was touched to his very heart by his poor mother's tears; but this only
      vexed him, and caused him to hang his head in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His younger brother, Andrii, had livelier and more fully developed
      feelings. He learned more willingly and without the effort with which
      strong and weighty characters generally have to make in order to apply
      themselves to study. He was more inventive-minded than his brother, and
      frequently appeared as the leader of dangerous expeditions; sometimes,
      thanks to the quickness of his mind, contriving to escape punishment when
      his brother Ostap, abandoning all efforts, stripped off his gaberdine and
      lay down upon the floor without a thought of begging for mercy. He too
      thirsted for action; but, at the same time, his soul was accessible to
      other sentiments. The need of love burned ardently within him. When he had
      passed his eighteenth year, woman began to present herself more frequently
      in his dreams; listening to philosophical discussions, he still beheld
      her, fresh, black-eyed, tender; before him constantly flitted her elastic
      bosom, her soft, bare arms; the very gown which clung about her youthful
      yet well-rounded limbs breathed into his visions a certain inexpressible
      sensuousness. He carefully concealed this impulse of his passionate young
      soul from his comrades, because in that age it was held shameful and
      dishonourable for a Cossack to think of love and a wife before he had
      tasted battle. On the whole, during the last year, he had acted more
      rarely as leader to the bands of students, but had roamed more frequently
      alone, in remote corners of Kief, among low-roofed houses, buried in
      cherry orchards, peeping alluringly at the street. Sometimes he betook
      himself to the more aristocratic streets, in the old Kief of to-day, where
      dwelt Little Russian and Polish nobles, and where houses were built in
      more fanciful style. Once, as he was gaping along, an old-fashioned
      carriage belonging to some Polish noble almost drove over him; and the
      heavily moustached coachman, who sat on the box, gave him a smart cut with
      his whip. The young student fired up; with thoughtless daring he seized
      the hind-wheel with his powerful hands and stopped the carriage. But the
      coachman, fearing a drubbing, lashed his horses; they sprang forward, and
      Andrii, succeeding happily in freeing his hands, was flung full length on
      the ground with his face flat in the mud. The most ringing and harmonious
      of laughs resounded above him. He raised his eyes and saw, standing at a
      window, a beauty such as he had never beheld in all his life, black-eyed,
      and with skin white as snow illumined by the dawning flush of the sun. She
      was laughing heartily, and her laugh enhanced her dazzling loveliness.
      Taken aback he gazed at her in confusion, abstractedly wiping the mud from
      his face, by which means it became still further smeared. Who could this
      beauty be? He sought to find out from the servants, who, in rich liveries,
      stood at the gate in a crowd surrounding a young guitar-player; but they
      only laughed when they saw his besmeared face and deigned him no reply. At
      length he learned that she was the daughter of the Waiwode of Koven, who
      had come thither for a time. The following night, with the daring
      characteristic of the student, he crept through the palings into the
      garden and climbed a tree which spread its branches upon the very roof of
      the house. From the tree he gained the roof, and made his way down the
      chimney straight into the bedroom of the beauty, who at that moment was
      seated before a lamp, engaged in removing the costly earrings from her
      ears. The beautiful Pole was so alarmed on suddenly beholding an unknown
      man that she could not utter a single word; but when she perceived that
      the student stood before her with downcast eyes, not daring to move a hand
      through timidity, when she recognised in him the one who had fallen in the
      street, laughter again overpowered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there was nothing terrible about Andrii's features; he was very
      handsome. She laughed heartily, and amused herself over him for a long
      time. The lady was giddy, like all Poles; but her eyes&mdash;her wondrous
      clear, piercing eyes&mdash;shot one glance, a long glance. The student
      could not move hand or foot, but stood bound as in a sack, when the
      Waiwode's daughter approached him boldly, placed upon his head her
      glittering diadem, hung her earrings on his lips, and flung over him a
      transparent muslin chemisette with gold-embroidered garlands. She adorned
      him, and played a thousand foolish pranks, with the childish carelessness
      which distinguishes the giddy Poles, and which threw the poor student into
      still greater confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut a ridiculous feature, gazing immovably, and with open mouth, into
      her dazzling eyes. A knock at the door startled her. She ordered him to
      hide himself under the bed, and, as soon as the disturber was gone, called
      her maid, a Tatar prisoner, and gave her orders to conduct him to the
      garden with caution, and thence show him through the fence. But our
      student this time did not pass the fence so successfully. The watchman
      awoke, and caught him firmly by the foot; and the servants, assembling,
      beat him in the street, until his swift legs rescued him. After that it
      became very dangerous to pass the house, for the Waiwode's domestics were
      numerous. He met her once again at church. She saw him, and smiled
      pleasantly, as at an old acquaintance. He saw her once more, by chance;
      but shortly afterwards the Waiwode departed, and, instead of the beautiful
      black-eyed Pole, some fat face or other gazed from the window. This was
      what Andrii was thinking about, as he hung his head and kept his eyes on
      his horse's mane.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the steppe had long since received them all into its green
      embrace; and the high grass, closing round, concealed them, till only
      their black Cossack caps appeared above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, eh, why are you so quiet, lads?" said Bulba at length, waking from
      his own reverie. "You're like monks. Now, all thinking to the Evil One,
      once for all! Take your pipes in your teeth, and let us smoke, and spur on
      our horses so swiftly that no bird can overtake us."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Cossacks, bending low on their horses' necks, disappeared in the
      grass. Their black caps were no longer to be seen; a streak of trodden
      grass alone showed the trace of their swift flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had long since looked forth from the clear heavens and inundated
      the steppe with his quickening, warming light. All that was dim and drowsy
      in the Cossacks' minds flew away in a twinkling: their hearts fluttered
      like birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farther they penetrated the steppe, the more beautiful it became. Then
      all the South, all that region which now constitutes New Russia, even as
      far as the Black Sea, was a green, virgin wilderness. No plough had ever
      passed over the immeasurable waves of wild growth; horses alone, hidden in
      it as in a forest, trod it down. Nothing in nature could be finer. The
      whole surface resembled a golden-green ocean, upon which were sprinkled
      millions of different flowers. Through the tall, slender stems of the
      grass peeped light-blue, dark-blue, and lilac star-thistles; the yellow
      broom thrust up its pyramidal head; the parasol-shaped white flower of the
      false flax shimmered on high. A wheat-ear, brought God knows whence, was
      filling out to ripening. Amongst the roots of this luxuriant vegetation
      ran partridges with outstretched necks. The air was filled with the notes
      of a thousand different birds. On high hovered the hawks, their wings
      outspread, and their eyes fixed intently on the grass. The cries of a
      flock of wild ducks, ascending from one side, were echoed from God knows
      what distant lake. From the grass arose, with measured sweep, a gull, and
      skimmed wantonly through blue waves of air. And now she has vanished on
      high, and appears only as a black dot: now she has turned her wings, and
      shines in the sunlight. Oh, steppes, how beautiful you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our travellers halted only a few minutes for dinner. Their escort of ten
      Cossacks sprang from their horses and undid the wooden casks of brandy,
      and the gourds which were used instead of drinking vessels. They ate only
      cakes of bread and dripping; they drank but one cup apiece to strengthen
      them, for Taras Bulba never permitted intoxication upon the road, and then
      continued their journey until evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the whole steppe changed its aspect. All its varied expanse
      was bathed in the last bright glow of the sun; and as it grew dark
      gradually, it could be seen how the shadow flitted across it and it became
      dark green. The mist rose more densely; each flower, each blade of grass,
      emitted a fragrance as of ambergris, and the whole steppe distilled
      perfume. Broad bands of rosy gold were streaked across the dark blue
      heaven, as with a gigantic brush; here and there gleamed, in white tufts,
      light and transparent clouds: and the freshest, most enchanting of gentle
      breezes barely stirred the tops of the grass-blades, like sea-waves, and
      caressed the cheek. The music which had resounded through the day had died
      away, and given place to another. The striped marmots crept out of their
      holes, stood erect on their hind legs, and filled the steppe with their
      whistle. The whirr of the grasshoppers had become more distinctly audible.
      Sometimes the cry of the swan was heard from some distant lake, ringing
      through the air like a silver trumpet. The travellers, halting in the
      midst of the plain, selected a spot for their night encampment, made a
      fire, and hung over it the kettle in which they cooked their oatmeal; the
      steam rising and floating aslant in the air. Having supped, the Cossacks
      lay down to sleep, after hobbling their horses and turning them out to
      graze. They lay down in their gaberdines. The stars of night gazed
      directly down upon them. They could hear the countless myriads of insects
      which filled the grass; their rasping, whistling, and chirping, softened
      by the fresh air, resounded clearly through the night, and lulled the
      drowsy ear. If one of them rose and stood for a time, the steppe presented
      itself to him strewn with the sparks of glow-worms. At times the night sky
      was illumined in spots by the glare of burning reeds along pools or
      river-bank; and dark flights of swans flying to the north were suddenly
      lit up by the silvery, rose-coloured gleam, till it seemed as though red
      kerchiefs were floating in the dark heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers proceeded onward without any adventure. They came across no
      villages. It was ever the same boundless, waving, beautiful steppe. Only
      at intervals the summits of distant forests shone blue, on one hand,
      stretching along the banks of the Dnieper. Once only did Taras point out
      to his sons a small black speck far away amongst the grass, saying, "Look,
      children! yonder gallops a Tatar." The little head with its long
      moustaches fixed its narrow eyes upon them from afar, its nostrils
      snuffing the air like a greyhound's, and then disappeared like an antelope
      on its owner perceiving that the Cossacks were thirteen strong. "And now,
      children, don't try to overtake the Tatar! You would never catch him to
      all eternity; he has a horse swifter than my Devil." But Bulba took
      precautions, fearing hidden ambushes. They galloped along the course of a
      small stream, called the Tatarka, which falls into the Dnieper; rode into
      the water and swam with their horses some distance in order to conceal
      their trail. Then, scrambling out on the bank, they continued their road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later they were not far from the goal of their journey. The air
      suddenly grew colder: they could feel the vicinity of the Dnieper. And
      there it gleamed afar, distinguishable on the horizon as a dark band. It
      sent forth cold waves, spreading nearer, nearer, and finally seeming to
      embrace half the entire surface of the earth. This was that section of its
      course where the river, hitherto confined by the rapids, finally makes its
      own away and, roaring like the sea, rushes on at will; where the islands,
      flung into its midst, have pressed it farther from their shores, and its
      waves have spread widely over the earth, encountering neither cliffs nor
      hills. The Cossacks, alighting from their horses, entered the ferry-boat,
      and after a three hours' sail reached the shores of the island of
      Khortitz, where at that time stood the Setch, which so often changed its
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A throng of people hastened to the shore with boats. The Cossacks arranged
      the horses' trappings. Taras assumed a stately air, pulled his belt
      tighter, and proudly stroked his moustache. His sons also inspected
      themselves from head to foot, with some apprehension and an undefined
      feeling of satisfaction; and all set out together for the suburb, which
      was half a verst from the Setch. On their arrival, they were deafened by
      the clang of fifty blacksmiths' hammers beating upon twenty-five anvils
      sunk in the earth. Stout tanners seated beneath awnings were scraping
      ox-hides with their strong hands; shop-keepers sat in their booths, with
      piles of flints, steels, and powder before them; Armenians spread out
      their rich handkerchiefs; Tatars turned their kabobs upon spits; a Jew,
      with his head thrust forward, was filtering some corn-brandy from a cask.
      But the first man they encountered was a Zaporozhetz (1) who was sleeping
      in the very middle of the road with legs and arms outstretched. Taras
      Bulba could not refrain from halting to admire him. "How splendidly
      developed he is; phew, what a magnificent figure!" he said, stopping his
      horse. It was, in fact, a striking picture. This Zaporozhetz had stretched
      himself out in the road like a lion; his scalp-lock, thrown proudly behind
      him, extended over upwards of a foot of ground; his trousers of rich red
      cloth were spotted with tar, to show his utter disdain for them. Having
      admired to his heart's content, Bulba passed on through the narrow street,
      crowded with mechanics exercising their trades, and with people of all
      nationalities who thronged this suburb of the Setch, resembling a fair,
      and fed and clothed the Setch itself, which knew only how to revel and
      burn powder.

    <p>
      At length they left the suburb behind them, and perceived some scattered
      kurens (2), covered with turf, or in Tatar fashion with felt. Some were
      furnished with cannon. Nowhere were any fences visible, or any of those
      low-roofed houses with verandahs supported upon low wooden pillars, such
      as were seen in the suburb. A low wall and a ditch, totally unguarded,
      betokened a terrible degree of recklessness. Some sturdy Zaporozhtzi
      lying, pipe in mouth, in the very road, glanced indifferently at them, but
      never moved from their places. Taras threaded his way carefully among
      them, with his sons, saying, "Good-day, gentles."&mdash;"Good-day to you,"
      answered the Zaporozhtzi. Scattered over the plain were picturesque
      groups. From their weatherbeaten faces, it was plain that all were steeled
      in battle, and had faced every sort of bad weather. And there it was, the
      Setch! There was the lair from whence all those men, proud and strong as
      lions, issued forth! There was the spot whence poured forth liberty and
      Cossacks all over the Ukraine.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) Enormous wooden sheds, each inhabited by a troop or kuren.
</pre>
    <p>
      The travellers entered the great square where the council generally met.
      On a huge overturned cask sat a Zaporozhetz without his shirt; he was
      holding it in his hands, and slowly sewing up the holes in it. Again their
      way was stopped by a whole crowd of musicians, in the midst of whom a
      young Zaporozhetz was dancing, with head thrown back and arms
      outstretched. He kept shouting, "Play faster, musicians! Begrudge not,
      Thoma, brandy to these orthodox Christians!" And Thoma, with his blackened
      eye, went on measuring out without stint, to every one who presented
      himself, a huge jugful.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the youthful Zaporozhetz four old men, moving their feet quite
      briskly, leaped like a whirlwind to one side, almost upon the musicians'
      heads, and, suddenly, retreating, squatted down and drummed the hard earth
      vigorously with their silver heels. The earth hummed dully all about, and
      afar the air resounded with national dance tunes beaten by the clanging
      heels of their boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one shouted more loudly than all the rest, and flew after the others
      in the dance. His scalp-lock streamed in the wind, his muscular chest was
      bare, his warm, winter fur jacket was hanging by the sleeves, and the
      perspiration poured from him as from a pig. "Take off your jacket!" said
      Taras at length: "see how he steams!"&mdash;"I can't," shouted the
      Cossack. "Why?"&mdash;"I can't: I have such a disposition that whatever I
      take off, I drink up." And indeed, the young fellow had not had a cap for
      a long time, nor a belt to his caftan, nor an embroidered neckerchief: all
      had gone the proper road. The throng increased; more folk joined the
      dancer: and it was impossible to observe without emotion how all yielded
      to the impulse of the dance, the freest, the wildest, the world has ever
      seen, still called from its mighty originators, the Kosachka.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if I had no horse to hold," exclaimed Taras, "I would join the dance
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there began to appear among the throng men who were respected
      for their prowess throughout all the Setch&mdash;old greyheads who had
      been leaders more than once. Taras soon found a number of familiar faces.
      Ostap and Andrii heard nothing but greetings. "Ah, it is you, Petcheritza!
      Good day, Kozolup!"&mdash;"Whence has God brought you, Taras?"&mdash;"How
      did you come here, Doloto? Health to you, Kirdyaga! Hail to you, Gustui!
      Did I ever think of seeing you, Remen?" And these heroes, gathered from
      all the roving population of Eastern Russia, kissed each other and began
      to ask questions. "But what has become of Kasyan? Where is Borodavka? and
      Koloper? and Pidsuitok?" And in reply, Taras Bulba learned that Borodavka
      had been hung at Tolopan, that Koloper had been flayed alive at
      Kizikirmen, that Pidsuitok's head had been salted and sent in a cask to
      Constantinople. Old Bulba hung his head and said thoughtfully, "They were
      good Cossacks."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Taras Bulba and his sons had been in the Setch about a week. Ostap and
      Andrii occupied themselves but little with the science of war. The Setch
      was not fond of wasting time in warlike exercises. The young generation
      learned these by experience alone, in the very heat of battles, which were
      therefore incessant. The Cossacks thought it a nuisance to fill up the
      intervals of this instruction with any kind of drill, except perhaps
      shooting at a mark, and on rare occasions with horse-racing and wild-beast
      hunts on the steppes and in the forests. All the rest of the time was
      devoted to revelry&mdash;a sign of the wide diffusion of moral liberty.
      The whole of the Setch presented an unusual scene: it was one unbroken
      revel; a ball noisily begun, which had no end. Some busied themselves with
      handicrafts; others kept little shops and traded; but the majority
      caroused from morning till night, if the wherewithal jingled in their
      pockets, and if the booty they had captured had not already passed into
      the hands of the shopkeepers and spirit-sellers. This universal revelry
      had something fascinating about it. It was not an assemblage of topers,
      who drank to drown sorrow, but simply a wild revelry of joy. Every one who
      came thither forgot everything, abandoned everything which had hitherto
      interested him. He, so to speak, spat upon his past and gave himself
      recklessly up to freedom and the good-fellowship of men of the same stamp
      as himself&mdash;idlers having neither relatives nor home nor family,
      nothing, in short, save the free sky and the eternal revel of their souls.
      This gave rise to that wild gaiety which could not have sprung from any
      other source. The tales and talk current among the assembled crowd,
      reposing lazily on the ground, were often so droll, and breathed such
      power of vivid narration, that it required all the nonchalance of a
      Zaporozhetz to retain his immovable expression, without even a twitch of
      the moustache&mdash;a feature which to this day distinguishes the Southern
      Russian from his northern brethren. It was drunken, noisy mirth; but there
      was no dark ale-house where a man drowns thought in stupefying
      intoxication: it was a dense throng of schoolboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only difference as regarded the students was that, instead of sitting
      under the pointer and listening to the worn-out doctrines of a teacher,
      they practised racing with five thousand horses; instead of the field
      where they had played ball, they had the boundless borderlands, where at
      the sight of them the Tatar showed his keen face and the Turk frowned
      grimly from under his green turban. The difference was that, instead of
      being forced to the companionship of school, they themselves had deserted
      their fathers and mothers and fled from their homes; that here were those
      about whose neck a rope had already been wound, and who, instead of pale
      death, had seen life, and life in all its intensity; those who, from
      generous habits, could never keep a coin in their pockets; those who had
      thitherto regarded a ducat as wealth, and whose pockets, thanks to the Jew
      revenue-farmers, could have been turned wrong side out without any danger
      of anything falling from them. Here were students who could not endure the
      academic rod, and had not carried away a single letter from the schools;
      but with them were also some who knew about Horace, Cicero, and the Roman
      Republic. There were many leaders who afterwards distinguished themselves
      in the king's armies; and there were numerous clever partisans who
      cherished a magnanimous conviction that it was of no consequence where
      they fought, so long as they did fight, since it was a disgrace to an
      honourable man to live without fighting. There were many who had come to
      the Setch for the sake of being able to say afterwards that they had been
      there and were therefore hardened warriors. But who was not there? This
      strange republic was a necessary outgrowth of the epoch. Lovers of a
      warlike life, of golden beakers and rich brocades, of ducats and gold
      pieces, could always find employment there. The lovers of women alone
      could find naught, for no woman dared show herself even in the suburbs of
      the Setch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed exceedingly strange to Ostap and Andrii that, although a crowd
      of people had come to the Setch with them, not a soul inquired, "Whence
      come these men? who are they? and what are their names?" They had come
      thither as though returning to a home whence they had departed only an
      hour before. The new-comer merely presented himself to the Koschevoi, or
      head chief of the Setch, who generally said, "Welcome! Do you believe in
      Christ?"&mdash;"I do," replied the new-comer. "And do you believe in the
      Holy Trinity?"&mdash;"I do."&mdash;"And do you go to church?"&mdash;"I
      do." "Now cross yourself." The new-comer crossed himself. "Very good,"
      replied the Koschevoi; "enter the kuren where you have most
      acquaintances." This concluded the ceremony. And all the Setch prayed in
      one church, and were willing to defend it to their last drop of blood,
      although they would not hearken to aught about fasting or abstinence.
      Jews, Armenians, and Tatars, inspired by strong avarice, took the liberty
      of living and trading in the suburbs; for the Zaporozhtzi never cared for
      bargaining, and paid whatever money their hand chanced to grasp in their
      pocket. Moreover, the lot of these gain-loving traders was pitiable in the
      extreme. They resembled people settled at the foot of Vesuvius; for when
      the Zaporozhtzi lacked money, these bold adventurers broke down their
      booths and took everything gratis. The Setch consisted of over sixty
      kurens, each of which greatly resembled a separate independent republic,
      but still more a school or seminary of children, always ready for
      anything. No one had any occupation; no one retained anything for himself;
      everything was in the hands of the hetman of the kuren, who, on that
      account, generally bore the title of "father." In his hands were deposited
      the money, clothes, all the provisions, oatmeal, grain, even the firewood.
      They gave him money to take care of. Quarrels amongst the inhabitants of
      the kuren were not unfrequent; and in such cases they proceeded at once to
      blows. The inhabitants of the kuren swarmed into the square, and smote
      each other with their fists, until one side had finally gained the upper
      hand, when the revelry began. Such was the Setch, which had such an
      attraction for young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ostap and Andrii flung themselves into this sea of dissipation with all
      the ardour of youth, forgot in a trice their father's house, the seminary,
      and all which had hitherto exercised their minds, and gave themselves
      wholly up to their new life. Everything interested them&mdash;the jovial
      habits of the Setch, and its chaotic morals and laws, which even seemed to
      them too strict for such a free republic. If a Cossack stole the smallest
      trifle, it was considered a disgrace to the whole Cossack community. He
      was bound to the pillar of shame, and a club was laid beside him, with
      which each passer-by was bound to deal him a blow until in this manner he
      was beaten to death. He who did not pay his debts was chained to a cannon,
      until some one of his comrades should decide to ransom him by paying his
      debts for him. But what made the deepest impression on Andrii was the
      terrible punishment decreed for murder. A hole was dug in his presence,
      the murderer was lowered alive into it, and over him was placed a coffin
      containing the body of the man he had killed, after which the earth was
      thrown upon both. Long afterwards the fearful ceremony of this horrible
      execution haunted his mind, and the man who had been buried alive appeared
      to him with his terrible coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the young Cossacks soon took a good standing among their fellows.
      They often sallied out upon the steppe with comrades from their kuren, and
      sometimes too with the whole kuren or with neighbouring kurens, to shoot
      the innumerable steppe-birds of every sort, deer, and goats. Or they went
      out upon the lakes, the river, and its tributaries allotted to each kuren,
      to throw their nets and draw out rich prey for the enjoyment of the whole
      kuren. Although unversed in any trade exercised by a Cossack, they were
      soon remarked among the other youths for their obstinate bravery and
      daring in everything. Skilfully and accurately they fired at the mark, and
      swam the Dnieper against the current&mdash;a deed for which the novice was
      triumphantly received into the circle of Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But old Taras was planning a different sphere of activity for them. Such
      an idle life was not to his mind; he wanted active employment. He
      reflected incessantly how to stir up the Setch to some bold enterprise,
      wherein a man could revel as became a warrior. At length he went one day
      to the Koschevoi, and said plainly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Koschevoi, it is time for the Zaporozhtzi to set out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nowhere for them to go," replied the Koschevoi, removing his
      short pipe from his mouth and spitting to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by nowhere? We can go to Turkey or Tatary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible to go either to Turkey or Tatary," replied the Koschevoi,
      putting his pipe coolly into his mouth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why impossible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so; we have promised the Sultan peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is a Mussulman; and God and the Holy Scriptures command us to slay
      Mussulmans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no right. If we had not sworn by our faith, it might be done; but
      now it is impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it impossible? How can you say that we have no right? Here are my
      two sons, both young men. Neither has been to war; and you say that we
      have no right, and that there is no need for the Zaporozhtzi to set out on
      an expedition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is not fitting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it must be fitting that Cossack strength should be wasted in vain,
      that a man should disappear like a dog without having done a single good
      deed, that he should be of no use to his country or to Christianity! Why,
      then, do we live? What the deuce do we live for? just tell me that. You
      are a sensible man, you were not chosen as Koschevoi without reason: so
      just tell me what we live for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Koschevoi made no reply to this question. He was an obstinate Cossack.
      He was silent for a while, and then said, "Anyway, there will not be war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will not be war?" Taras asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is no use thinking about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not to be thought of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, you devil's limb!" said Taras to himself; "you shall learn to know
      me!" and he at once resolved to have his revenge on the Koschevoi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made an agreement with several others, he gave them liquor; and the
      drunken Cossacks staggered into the square, where on a post hung the
      kettledrums which were generally beaten to assemble the people. Not
      finding the sticks, which were kept by the drummer, they seized a piece of
      wood and began to beat. The first to respond to the drum-beat was the
      drummer, a tall man with but one eye, but a frightfully sleepy one for all
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who dares to beat the drum?" he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue! take your sticks, and beat when you are ordered!"
      replied the drunken men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drummer at once took from his pocket the sticks which he had brought
      with him, well knowing the result of such proceedings. The drum rattled,
      and soon black swarms of Cossacks began to collect like bees in the
      square. All formed in a ring; and at length, after the third summons, the
      chiefs began to arrive&mdash;the Koschevoi with staff in hand, the symbol
      of his office; the judge with the army-seal; the secretary with his
      ink-bottle; and the osaul with his staff. The Koschevoi and the chiefs
      took off their caps and bowed on all sides to the Cossacks, who stood
      proudly with their arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What means this assemblage? what do you wish, gentles?" said the
      Koschevoi. Shouts and exclamations interrupted his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resign your staff! resign your staff this moment, you son of Satan! we
      will have you no longer!" shouted some of the Cossacks in the crowd. Some
      of the sober ones appeared to wish to oppose this, but both sober and
      drunken fell to blows. The shouting and uproar became universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Koschevoi attempted to speak; but knowing that the self-willed
      multitude, if enraged, might beat him to death, as almost always happened
      in such cases, he bowed very low, laid down his staff, and hid himself in
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you command us, gentles, to resign our insignia of office?" said the
      judge, the secretary, and the osaul, as they prepared to give up the
      ink-horn, army-seal, and staff, upon the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you are to remain!" was shouted from the crowd. "We only wanted to
      drive out the Koschevoi because he is a woman, and we want a man for
      Koschevoi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you now elect as Koschevoi?" asked the chiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We choose Kukubenko," shouted some.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't have Kukubenko!" screamed another party: "he is too young; the
      milk has not dried off his lips yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Schilo be hetman!" shouted some: "make Schilo our Koschevoi!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away with your Schilo!" yelled the crowd; "what kind of a Cossack is he
      who is as thievish as a Tatar? To the devil in a sack with your drunken
      Schilo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Borodaty! let us make Borodaty our Koschevoi!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't have Borodaty! To the evil one's mother with Borodaty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shout Kirdyanga!" whispered Taras Bulba to several.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kirdyanga, Kirdyanga!" shouted the crowd. "Borodaty, Borodaty! Kirdyanga,
      Kirdyanga! Schilo! Away with Schilo! Kirdyanga!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the candidates, on hearing their names mentioned, quitted the crowd,
      in order not to give any one a chance of supposing that they were
      personally assisting in their election.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kirdyanga, Kirdyanga!" echoed more strongly than the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Borodaty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to decide the matter by a show of hands, and Kirdyanga won.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fetch Kirdyanga!" they shouted. Half a score of Cossacks immediately left
      the crowd&mdash;some of them hardly able to keep their feet, to such an
      extent had they drunk&mdash;and went directly to Kirdyanga to inform him
      of his election.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirdyanga, a very old but wise Cossack, had been sitting for some time in
      his kuren, as if he knew nothing of what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, gentles? What do you wish?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, they have chosen you for Koschevoi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have mercy, gentles!" said Kirdyanga. "How can I be worthy of such
      honour? Why should I be made Koschevoi? I have not sufficient capacity to
      fill such a post. Could no better person be found in all the army?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, I say!" shouted the Zaporozhtzi. Two of them seized him by the
      arms; and in spite of his planting his feet firmly they finally dragged
      him to the square, accompanying his progress with shouts, blows from
      behind with their fists, kicks, and exhortations. "Don't hold back, you
      son of Satan! Accept the honour, you dog, when it is given!" In this
      manner Kirdyanga was conducted into the ring of Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, gentles?" announced those who had brought him, "are you agreed
      that this Cossack shall be your Koschevoi?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all agreed!" shouted the throng, and the whole plain trembled for
      a long time afterwards from the shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the chiefs took the staff and brought it to the newly elected
      Koschevoi. Kirdyanga, in accordance with custom, immediately refused it.
      The chief offered it a second time; Kirdyanga again refused it, and then,
      at the third offer, accepted the staff. A cry of approbation rang out from
      the crowd, and again the whole plain resounded afar with the Cossacks'
      shout. Then there stepped out from among the people the four oldest of
      them all, white-bearded, white-haired Cossacks; though there were no very
      old men in the Setch, for none of the Zaporozhtzi ever died in their beds.
      Taking each a handful of earth, which recent rain had converted into mud,
      they laid it on Kirdyanga's head. The wet earth trickled down from his
      head on to his moustache and cheeks and smeared his whole face. But
      Kirdyanga stood immovable in his place, and thanked the Cossacks for the
      honour shown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the noisy election, concerning which we cannot say whether it
      was as pleasing to the others as it was to Bulba; by means of it he had
      revenged himself on the former Koschevoi. Moreover, Kirdyanga was an old
      comrade, and had been with him on the same expeditions by sea and land,
      sharing the toils and hardships of war. The crowd immediately dispersed to
      celebrate the election, and such revelry ensued as Ostap and Andrii had
      not yet beheld. The taverns were attacked and mead, corn-brandy, and beer
      seized without payment, the owners being only too glad to escape with
      whole skins themselves. The whole night passed amid shouts, songs, and
      rejoicings; and the rising moon gazed long at troops of musicians
      traversing the streets with guitars, flutes, tambourines, and the church
      choir, who were kept in the Setch to sing in church and glorify the deeds
      of the Zaporozhtzi. At length drunkenness and fatigue began to overpower
      even these strong heads, and here and there a Cossack could be seen to
      fall to the ground, embracing a comrade in fraternal fashion; whilst
      maudlin, and even weeping, the latter rolled upon the earth with him. Here
      a whole group would lie down in a heap; there a man would choose the most
      comfortable position and stretch himself out on a log of wood. The last,
      and strongest, still uttered some incoherent speeches; finally even they,
      yielding to the power of intoxication, flung themselves down and all the
      Setch slept.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      But next day Taras Bulba had a conference with the new Koschevoi as to the
      method of exciting the Cossacks to some enterprise. The Koschevoi, a
      shrewd and sensible Cossack, who knew the Zaporozhtzi thoroughly, said at
      first, "Oaths cannot be violated by any means"; but after a pause added,
      "No matter, it can be done. We will not violate them, but let us devise
      something. Let the people assemble, not at my summons, but of their own
      accord. You know how to manage that; and I will hasten to the square with
      the chiefs, as though we know nothing about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not an hour had elapsed after their conversation, when the drums again
      thundered. The drunken and senseless Cossacks assembled. A myriad Cossack
      caps were sprinkled over the square. A murmur arose, "Why? What? Why was
      the assembly beaten?" No one answered. At length, in one quarter and
      another, it began to be rumoured about, "Behold, the Cossack strength is
      being vainly wasted: there is no war! Behold, our leaders have become as
      marmots, every one; their eyes swim in fat! Plainly, there is no justice
      in the world!" The other Cossacks listened at first, and then began
      themselves to say, "In truth, there is no justice in the world!" Their
      leaders seemed surprised at these utterances. Finally the Koschevoi
      stepped forward: "Permit me, Cossacks, to address you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Touching the matter in question, gentles, none know better than
      yourselves that many Zaporozhtzi have run in debt to the Jew ale-house
      keepers and to their brethren, so that now they have not an atom of
      credit. Again, touching the matter in question, there are many young
      fellows who have no idea of what war is like, although you know, gentles,
      that without war a young man cannot exist. How make a Zaporozhetz out of
      him if he has never killed a Mussulman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He speaks well," thought Bulba.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not, however, gentles, that I speak thus in order to break the
      truce; God forbid! I merely mention it. Besides, it is a shame to see what
      sort of church we have for our God. Not only has the church remained
      without exterior decoration during all the years which by God's mercy the
      Setch has stood, but up to this day even the holy pictures have no
      adornments. No one has even thought of making them a silver frame; they
      have only received what some Cossacks have left them in their wills; and
      these gifts were poor, since they had drunk up nearly all they had during
      their lifetime. I am making you this speech, therefore, not in order to
      stir up a war against the Mussulmans; we have promised the Sultan peace,
      and it would be a great sin in us to break this promise, for we swore it
      on our law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is he mixing things up like that for?" said Bulba to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see, gentles, that war cannot be begun; honour does not permit it.
      But according to my poor opinion, we might, I think, send out a few young
      men in boats and let them plunder the coasts of Anatolia a little. What do
      you think, gentles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lead us, lead us all!" shouted the crowd on all sides. "We are ready to
      lay down our lives for our faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Koschevoi was alarmed. He by no means wished to stir up all Zaporozhe;
      a breach of the truce appeared to him on this occasion unsuitable. "Permit
      me, gentles, to address you further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough!" yelled the Cossacks; "you can say nothing better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it must be so, then let it be so. I am the slave of your will. We
      know, and from Scripture too, that the voice of the people is the voice of
      God. It is impossible to devise anything better than the whole nation has
      devised. But here lies the difficulty; you know, gentles, that the Sultan
      will not permit that which delights our young men to go unpunished. We
      should be prepared at such a time, and our forces should be fresh, and
      then we should fear no one. But during their absence the Tatars may
      assemble fresh forces; the dogs do not show themselves in sight and dare
      not come while the master is at home, but they can bite his heels from
      behind, and bite painfully too. And if I must tell you the truth, we have
      not boats enough, nor powder ready in sufficient quantity, for all to go.
      But I am ready, if you please; I am the slave of your will."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cunning hetman was silent. The various groups began to discuss the
      matter, and the hetmans of the kurens to take counsel together; few were
      drunk fortunately, so they decided to listen to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of men set out at once for the opposite shore of the Dnieper, to
      the treasury of the army, where in strictest secrecy, under water and
      among the reeds, lay concealed the army chest and a portion of the arms
      captured from the enemy. Others hastened to inspect the boats and prepare
      them for service. In a twinkling the whole shore was thronged with men.
      Carpenters appeared with axes in their hands. Old, weatherbeaten,
      broad-shouldered, strong-legged Zaporozhtzi, with black or silvered
      moustaches, rolled up their trousers, waded up to their knees in water,
      and dragged the boats on to the shore with stout ropes; others brought
      seasoned timber and all sorts of wood. The boats were freshly planked,
      turned bottom upwards, caulked and tarred, and then bound together side by
      side after Cossack fashion, with long strands of reeds, so that the swell
      of the waves might not sink them. Far along the shore they built fires and
      heated tar in copper cauldrons to smear the boats. The old and the
      experienced instructed the young. The blows and shouts of the workers rose
      all over the neighbourhood; the bank shook and moved about.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time a large ferry-boat began to near the shore. The mass of
      people standing in it began to wave their hands from a distance. They were
      Cossacks in torn, ragged gaberdines. Their disordered garments, for many
      had on nothing but their shirts, with a short pipe in their mouths, showed
      that they had either escaped from some disaster or had caroused to such an
      extent that they had drunk up all they had on their bodies. A short,
      broad-shouldered Cossack of about fifty stepped out from the midst of them
      and stood in front. He shouted and waved his hand more vigorously than any
      of the others; but his words could not be heard for the cries and
      hammering of the workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence come you!" asked the Koschevoi, as the boat touched the shore. All
      the workers paused in their labours, and, raising their axes and chisels,
      looked on expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From a misfortune!" shouted the short Cossack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me, noble Zaporozhtzi, to address you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or would you prefer to assemble a council?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, we are all here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The people all pressed together in one mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you then heard nothing of what has been going on in the hetman's
      dominions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" inquired one of the kuren hetmans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! what! Evidently the Tatars have plastered up your ears so that you
      might hear nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us then; what has been going on there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is going on the like of which no man born or christened ever yet has
      seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us what it is, you son of a dog!" shouted one of the crowd,
      apparently losing patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things have come to such a pass that our holy churches are no longer
      ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How not ours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are pledged to the Jews. If the Jew is not first paid, there can be
      no mass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the dog of a Jew does not make a sign with his unclean hand over
      the holy Easter-bread, it cannot be consecrated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He lies, brother gentles. It cannot be that an unclean Jew puts his mark
      upon the holy Easter-bread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen! I have not yet told all. Catholic priests are going about all
      over the Ukraine in carts. The harm lies not in the carts, but in the fact
      that not horses, but orthodox Christians (1), are harnessed to them.
      Listen! I have not yet told all. They say that the Jewesses are making
      themselves petticoats out of our popes' vestments. Such are the deeds that
      are taking place in the Ukraine, gentles! And you sit here revelling in
      Zaporozhe; and evidently the Tatars have so scared you that you have no
      eyes, no ears, no anything, and know nothing that is going on in the
      world."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (1) That is of the Greek Church. The Poles were Catholics.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Stop, stop!" broke in the Koschevoi, who up to that moment had stood with
      his eyes fixed upon the earth like all Zaporozhtzi, who, on important
      occasions, never yielded to their first impulse, but kept silence, and
      meanwhile concentrated inwardly all the power of their indignation. "Stop!
      I also have a word to say. But what were you about? When your father the
      devil was raging thus, what were you doing yourselves? Had you no swords?
      How came you to permit such lawlessness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! how did we come to permit such lawlessness? You would have tried when
      there were fifty thousand of the Lyakhs (2) alone; yes, and it is a shame
      not to be concealed, when there are also dogs among us who have already
      accepted their faith."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) Lyakhs, an opprobrious name for the Poles.
</pre>
    <p>
      "But your hetman and your leaders, what have they done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God preserve any one from such deeds as our leaders performed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our hetman, roasted in a brazen ox, now lies in Warsaw; and the heads and
      hands of our leaders are being carried to all the fairs as a spectacle for
      the people. That is what our leaders did."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole throng became wildly excited. At first silence reigned all along
      the shore, like that which precedes a tempest; and then suddenly voices
      were raised and all the shore spoke:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! The Jews hold the Christian churches in pledge! Roman Catholic
      priests have harnessed and beaten orthodox Christians! What! such torture
      has been permitted on Russian soil by the cursed unbelievers! And they
      have done such things to the leaders and the hetman? Nay, this shall not
      be, it shall not be." Such words came from all quarters. The Zaporozhtzi
      were moved, and knew their power. It was not the excitement of a
      giddy-minded folk. All who were thus agitated were strong, firm
      characters, not easily aroused, but, once aroused, preserving their inward
      heat long and obstinately. "Hang all the Jews!" rang through the crowd.
      "They shall not make petticoats for their Jewesses out of popes'
      vestments! They shall not place their signs upon the holy wafers! Drown
      all the heathens in the Dnieper!" These words uttered by some one in the
      throng flashed like lightning through all minds, and the crowd flung
      themselves upon the suburb with the intention of cutting the throats of
      all the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor sons of Israel, losing all presence of mind, and not being in any
      case courageous, hid themselves in empty brandy-casks, in ovens, and even
      crawled under the skirts of their Jewesses; but the Cossacks found them
      wherever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious nobles!" shrieked one Jew, tall and thin as a stick, thrusting
      his sorry visage, distorted with terror, from among a group of his
      comrades, "gracious nobles! suffer us to say a word, only one word. We
      will reveal to you what you never yet have heard, a thing more important
      than I can say&mdash;very important!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, say it," said Bulba, who always liked to hear what an accused man
      had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious nobles," exclaimed the Jew, "such nobles were never seen, by
      heavens, never! Such good, kind, and brave men there never were in the
      world before!" His voice died away and quivered with fear. "How was it
      possible that we should think any evil of the Zaporozhtzi? Those men are
      not of us at all, those who have taken pledges in the Ukraine. By heavens,
      they are not of us! They are not Jews at all. The evil one alone knows
      what they are; they are only fit to be spit upon and cast aside. Behold,
      my brethren, say the same! Is it not true, Schloma? is it not true,
      Schmul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By heavens, it is true!" replied Schloma and Schmul, from among the
      crowd, both pale as clay, in their ragged caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never yet," continued the tall Jew, "have had any secret intercourse
      with your enemies, and we will have nothing to do with Catholics; may the
      evil one fly away with them! We are like own brothers to the Zaporozhtzi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! the Zaporozhtzi are brothers to you!" exclaimed some one in the
      crowd. "Don't wait! the cursed Jews! Into the Dnieper with them, gentles!
      Drown all the unbelievers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were the signal. They seized the Jews by the arms and began to
      hurl them into the waves. Pitiful cries resounded on all sides; but the
      stern Zaporozhtzi only laughed when they saw the Jewish legs, cased in
      shoes and stockings, struggling in the air. The poor orator who had called
      down destruction upon himself jumped out of the caftan, by which they had
      seized him, and in his scant parti-coloured under waistcoat clasped
      Bulba's legs, and cried, in piteous tones, "Great lord! gracious noble! I
      knew your brother, the late Doroscha. He was a warrior who was an ornament
      to all knighthood. I gave him eight hundred sequins when he was obliged to
      ransom himself from the Turks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew my brother?" asked Taras.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By heavens, I knew him. He was a magnificent nobleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yankel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said Taras; and after reflecting, he turned to the Cossacks and
      spoke as follows: "There will always be plenty of time to hang the Jew, if
      it proves necessary; but for to-day give him to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Taras led him to his waggon, beside which stood his Cossacks.
      "Crawl under the waggon; lie down, and do not move. And you, brothers, do
      not surrender this Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he returned to the square, for the whole crowd had long since
      collected there. All had at once abandoned the shore and the preparation
      of the boats; for a land-journey now awaited them, and not a sea-voyage,
      and they needed horses and waggons, not ships. All, both young and old,
      wanted to go on the expedition; and it was decided, on the advice of the
      chiefs, the hetmans of the kurens, and the Koschevoi, and with the
      approbation of the whole Zaporozhtzian army, to march straight to Poland,
      to avenge the injury and disgrace to their faith and to Cossack renown, to
      seize booty from the cities, to burn villages and grain, and spread their
      glory far over the steppe. All at once girded and armed themselves. The
      Koschevoi grew a whole foot taller. He was no longer the timid executor of
      the restless wishes of a free people, but their untrammelled master. He
      was a despot, who know only to command. All the independent and
      pleasure-loving warriors stood in an orderly line, with respectfully bowed
      heads, not venturing to raise their eyes, when the Koschevoi gave his
      orders. He gave these quietly, without shouting and without haste, but
      with pauses between, like an experienced man deeply learned in Cossack
      affairs, and carrying into execution, not for the first time, a wisely
      matured enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Examine yourselves, look well to yourselves; examine all your equipments
      thoroughly," he said; "put your teams and your tar-boxes (3) in order;
      test your weapons. Take not many clothes with you: a shirt and a couple of
      pairs of trousers to each Cossack, and a pot of oatmeal and millet apiece&mdash;let
      no one take any more. There will be plenty of provisions, all that is
      needed, in the waggons. Let every Cossack have two horses. And two hundred
      yoke of oxen must be taken, for we shall require them at the fords and
      marshy places. Keep order, gentles, above all things. I know that there
      are some among you whom God has made so greedy that they would like to
      tear up silk and velvet for foot-cloths. Leave off such devilish habits;
      reject all garments as plunder, and take only weapons: though if valuables
      offer themselves, ducats or silver, they are useful in any case. I tell
      you this beforehand, gentles, if any one gets drunk on the expedition, he
      will have a short shrift: I will have him dragged by the neck like a dog
      behind the baggage waggons, no matter who he may be, even were he the most
      heroic Cossack in the whole army; he shall be shot on the spot like a dog,
      and flung out, without sepulture, to be torn by the birds of prey, for a
      drunkard on the march deserves no Christian burial. Young men, obey the
      old men in all things! If a ball grazes you, or a sword cuts your head or
      any other part, attach no importance to such trifles. Mix a charge of
      powder in a cup of brandy, quaff it heartily, and all will pass off&mdash;you
      will not even have any fever; and if the wound is large, put simple earth
      upon it, mixing it first with spittle in your palm, and that will dry it
      up. And now to work, to work, lads, and look well to all, and without
      haste."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (3) The Cossack waggons have their axles smeared with tar instead of
    grease.
</pre>
    <p>
      So spoke the Koschevoi; and no sooner had he finished his speech than all
      the Cossacks at once set to work. All the Setch grew sober. Nowhere was a
      single drunken man to be found, it was as though there never had been such
      a thing among the Cossacks. Some attended to the tyres of the wheels,
      others changed the axles of the waggons; some carried sacks of provisions
      to them or leaded them with arms; others again drove up the horses and
      oxen. On all sides resounded the tramp of horses' hoofs, test-shots from
      the guns, the clank of swords, the lowing of oxen, the screech of rolling
      waggons, talking, sharp cries and urging-on of cattle. Soon the Cossack
      force spread far over all the plain; and he who might have undertaken to
      run from its van to its rear would have had a long course. In the little
      wooden church the priest was offering up prayers and sprinkling all
      worshippers with holy water. All kissed the cross. When the camp broke up
      and the army moved out of the Setch, all the Zaporozhtzi turned their
      heads back. "Farewell, our mother!" they said almost in one breath. "May
      God preserve thee from all misfortune!"
    </p>

      As he passed through the suburb, Taras Bulba saw that his Jew, Yankel, had
      already erected a sort of booth with an awning, and was selling flint,
      screwdrivers, powder, and all sorts of military stores needed on the road,
      even to rolls and bread. "What devils these Jews are!" thought Taras; and
      riding up to him, he said, "Fool, why are you sitting here? do you want to
      be shot like a crow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yankel in reply approached nearer, and making a sign with both hands, as
      though wishing to impart some secret, said, "Let the noble lord but keep
      silence and say nothing to any one. Among the Cossack waggons is a waggon
      of mine. I am carrying all sorts of needful stores for the Cossacks, and
      on the journey I will furnish every sort of provisions at a lower price
      than any Jew ever sold at before. 'Tis so, by heavens! by heavens, 'tis
      so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras Bulba shrugged his shoulders in amazement at the Jewish nature, and
      went on to the camp.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      All South-west Poland speedily became a prey to fear. Everywhere the
      rumour flew, "The Zaporozhtzi! The Zaporozhtzi have appeared!" All who
      could flee did so. All rose and scattered after the manner of that
      lawless, reckless age, when they built neither fortresses nor castles, but
      each man erected a temporary dwelling of straw wherever he happened to
      find himself. He thought, "It is useless to waste money and labour on an
      izba, when the roving Tatars will carry it off in any case." All was in an
      uproar: one exchanged his plough and oxen for a horse and gun, and joined
      an armed band; another, seeking concealment, drove off his cattle and
      carried off all the household stuff he could. Occasionally, on the road,
      some were encountered who met their visitors with arms in their hands; but
      the majority fled before their arrival. All knew that it was hard to deal
      with the raging and warlike throng known by the name of the Zaporozhian
      army; a body which, under its independent and disorderly exterior,
      concealed an organisation well calculated for times of battle. The
      horsemen rode steadily on without overburdening or heating their horses;
      the foot-soldiers marched only by night, resting during the day, and
      selecting for this purpose desert tracts, uninhabited spots, and forests,
      of which there were then plenty. Spies and scouts were sent ahead to study
      the time, place, and method of attack. And lo! the Zaporozhtzi suddenly
      appeared in those places where they were least expected: then all were put
      to the sword; the villages were burned; and the horses and cattle which
      were not driven off behind the army killed upon the spot. They seemed to
      be fiercely revelling, rather than carrying out a military expedition. Our
      hair would stand on end nowadays at the horrible traits of that fierce,
      half-civilised age, which the Zaporozhtzi everywhere exhibited: children
      killed, women's breasts cut open, the skin flayed from the legs up to the
      knees, and the victim then set at liberty. In short, the Cossacks paid
      their former debts in coin of full weight. The abbot of one monastery, on
      hearing of their approach, sent two monks to say that they were not
      behaving as they should; that there was an agreement between the
      Zaporozhtzi and the government; that they were breaking faith with the
      king, and violating all international rights. "Tell your bishop from me
      and from all the Zaporozhtzi," said the Koschevoi, "that he has nothing to
      fear: the Cossacks, so far, have only lighted and smoked their pipes." And
      the magnificent abbey was soon wrapped in the devouring flames, its tall
      Gothic windows showing grimly through the waves of fire as they parted.
      The fleeing mass of monks, women, and Jews thronged into those towns where
      any hope lay in the garrison and the civic forces. The aid sent in season
      by the government, but delayed on the way, consisted of a few troops which
      either were unable to enter the towns or, seized with fright, turned their
      backs at the very first encounter and fled on their swift horses. However,
      several of the royal commanders, who had conquered in former battles,
      resolved to unite their forces and confront the Zaporozhtzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, above all, did our young Cossacks, disgusted with pillage,
      greed, and a feeble foe, and burning with the desire to distinguish
      themselves in presence of their chiefs, seek to measure themselves in
      single combat with the warlike and boastful Lyakhs, prancing on their
      spirited horses, with the sleeves of their jackets thrown back and
      streaming in the wind. This game was inspiriting; they won at it many
      costly sets of horse-trappings and valuable weapons. In a month the
      scarcely fledged birds attained their full growth, were completely
      transformed, and became men; their features, in which hitherto a trace of
      youthful softness had been visible, grew strong and grim. But it was
      pleasant to old Taras to see his sons among the foremost. It seemed as
      though Ostap were designed by nature for the game of war and the difficult
      science of command. Never once losing his head or becoming confused under
      any circumstances, he could, with a cool audacity almost supernatural in a
      youth of two-and-twenty, in an instant gauge the danger and the whole
      scope of the matter, could at once devise a means of escaping, but of
      escaping only that he might the more surely conquer. His movements now
      began to be marked by the assurance which comes from experience, and in
      them could be detected the germ of the future leader. His person
      strengthened, and his bearing grew majestically leonine. "What a fine
      leader he will make one of these days!" said old Taras. "He will make a
      splendid leader, far surpassing even his father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii gave himself up wholly to the enchanting music of blades and
      bullets. He knew not what it was to consider, or calculate, or to measure
      his own as against the enemy's strength. He gazed on battle with mad
      delight and intoxication: he found something festal in the moments when a
      man's brain burns, when all things wave and flutter before his eyes, when
      heads are stricken off, horses fall to the earth with a sound of thunder,
      and he rides on like a drunken man, amid the whistling of bullets and the
      flashing of swords, dealing blows to all, and heeding not those aimed at
      himself. More than once their father marvelled too at Andrii, seeing him,
      stirred only by a flash of impulse, dash at something which a sensible man
      in cold blood never would have attempted, and, by the sheer force of his
      mad attack, accomplish such wonders as could not but amaze even men grown
      old in battle. Old Taras admired and said, "And he too will make a good
      warrior if the enemy does not capture him meanwhile. He is not Ostap, but
      he is a dashing warrior, nevertheless."
    </p>
    <p>
      The army decided to march straight on the city of Dubno, which, rumour
      said, contained much wealth and many rich inhabitants. The journey was
      accomplished in a day and a half, and the Zaporozhtzi appeared before the
      city. The inhabitants resolved to defend themselves to the utmost extent
      of their power, and to fight to the last extremity, preferring to die in
      their squares and streets, and on their thresholds, rather than admit the
      enemy to their houses. A high rampart of earth surrounded the city; and in
      places where it was low or weak, it was strengthened by a wall of stone,
      or a house which served as a redoubt, or even an oaken stockade. The
      garrison was strong and aware of the importance of their position. The
      Zaporozhtzi attacked the wall fiercely, but were met with a shower of
      grapeshot. The citizens and residents of the town evidently did not wish
      to remain idle, but gathered on the ramparts; in their eyes could be read
      desperate resistance. The women too were determined to take part in the
      fray, and upon the heads of the Zaporozhians rained down stones, casks of
      boiling water, and sacks of lime which blinded them. The Zaporozhtzi were
      not fond of having anything to do with fortified places: sieges were not
      in their line. The Koschevoi ordered them to retreat, saying, "It is
      useless, brother gentles; we will retire: but may I be a heathen Tatar,
      and not a Christian, if we do not clear them out of that town! may they
      all perish of hunger, the dogs!" The army retreated, surrounded the town,
      and, for lack of something to do, busied themselves with devastating the
      surrounding country, burning the neighbouring villages and the ricks of
      unthreshed grain, and turning their droves of horses loose in the
      cornfields, as yet untouched by the reaping-hook, where the plump ears
      waved, fruit, as luck would have it, of an unusually good harvest which
      should have liberally rewarded all tillers of the soil that season.
    </p>
    <p>
      With horror those in the city beheld their means of subsistence destroyed.
      Meanwhile the Zaporozhtzi, having formed a double ring of their waggons
      around the city, disposed themselves as in the Setch in kurens, smoked
      their pipes, bartered their booty for weapons, played at leapfrog and
      odd-and-even, and gazed at the city with deadly cold-bloodedness. At night
      they lighted their camp fires, and the cooks boiled the porridge for each
      kuren in huge copper cauldrons; whilst an alert sentinel watched all night
      beside the blazing fire. But the Zaporozhtzi soon began to tire of
      inactivity and prolonged sobriety, unaccompanied by any fighting. The
      Koschevoi even ordered the allowance of wine to be doubled, which was
      sometimes done in the army when no difficult enterprises or movements were
      on hand. The young men, and Taras Bulba's sons in particular, did not like
      this life. Andrii was visibly bored. "You silly fellow!" said Taras to
      him, "be patient, you will be hetman one day. He is not a good warrior who
      loses heart in an important enterprise; but he who is not tired even of
      inactivity, who endures all, and who even if he likes a thing can give it
      up." But hot youth cannot agree with age; the two have different natures,
      and look at the same thing with different eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the meantime Taras's band, led by Tovkatch, arrived; with him were
      also two osauls, the secretary, and other regimental officers: the
      Cossacks numbered over four thousand in all. There were among them many
      volunteers, who had risen of their own free will, without any summons, as
      soon as they had heard what the matter was. The osauls brought to Taras's
      sons the blessing of their aged mother, and to each a picture in a
      cypress-wood frame from the Mezhigorski monastery at Kief. The two
      brothers hung the pictures round their necks, and involuntarily grew
      pensive as they remembered their old mother. What did this blessing
      prophecy? Was it a blessing for their victory over the enemy, and then a
      joyous return to their home with booty and glory, to be everlastingly
      commemorated in the songs of guitar-players? or was it...? But the future
      is unknown, and stands before a man like autumnal fogs rising from the
      swamps; birds fly foolishly up and down in it with flapping wings, never
      recognising each other, the dove seeing not the vulture, nor the vulture
      the dove, and no one knowing how far he may be flying from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ostap had long since attended to his duties and gone to the kuren. Andrii,
      without knowing why, felt a kind of oppression at his heart. The Cossacks
      had finished their evening meal; the wonderful July night had completely
      fallen; still he did not go to the kuren, nor lie down to sleep, but gazed
      unconsciously at the whole scene before him. In the sky innumerable stars
      twinkled brightly. The plain was covered far and wide with scattered
      waggons with swinging tar-buckets, smeared with tar, and loaded with every
      description of goods and provisions captured from the foe. Beside the
      waggons, under the waggons, and far beyond the waggons, Zaporozhtzi were
      everywhere visible, stretched upon the grass. They all slumbered in
      picturesque attitudes; one had thrust a sack under his head, another his
      cap, and another simply made use of his comrade's side. Swords, guns,
      matchlocks, short pipe-stems with copper mountings, iron awls, and a flint
      and steel were inseparable from every Cossack. The heavy oxen lay with
      their feet doubled under them like huge whitish masses, and at a distance
      looked like gray stones scattered on the slopes of the plain. On all sides
      the heavy snores of sleeping warriors began to arise from the grass, and
      were answered from the plain by the ringing neighs of their steeds,
      chafing at their hobbled feet. Meanwhile a certain threatening
      magnificence had mingled with the beauty of the July night. It was the
      distant glare of the burning district afar. In one place the flames spread
      quietly and grandly over the sky; in another, suddenly bursting into a
      whirlwind, they hissed and flew upwards to the very stars, and floating
      fragments died away in the most distant quarter of the heavens. Here the
      black, burned monastery like a grim Carthusian monk stood threatening, and
      displaying its dark magnificence at every flash; there blazed the
      monastery garden. It seemed as though the trees could be heard hissing as
      they stood wrapped in smoke; and when the fire burst forth, it suddenly
      lighted up the ripe plums with a phosphoric lilac-coloured gleam, or
      turned the yellowing pears here and there to pure gold. In the midst of
      them hung black against the wall of the building, or the trunk of a tree,
      the body of some poor Jew or monk who had perished in the flames with the
      structure. Above the distant fires hovered a flock of birds, like a
      cluster of tiny black crosses upon a fiery field. The town thus laid bare
      seemed to sleep; the spires and roofs, and its palisade and walls, gleamed
      quietly in the glare of the distant conflagrations. Andrii went the rounds
      of the Cossack ranks. The camp-fires, beside which the sentinels sat, were
      ready to go out at any moment; and even the sentinels slept, having
      devoured oatmeal and dumplings with true Cossack appetites. He was
      astonished at such carelessness, thinking, "It is well that there is no
      strong enemy at hand and nothing to fear." Finally he went to one of the
      waggons, climbed into it, and lay down upon his back, putting his clasped
      hands under his head; but he could not sleep, and gazed long at the sky.
      It was all open before him; the air was pure and transparent; the dense
      clusters of stars in the Milky Way, crossing the sky like a belt, were
      flooded with light. From time to time Andrii in some degree lost
      consciousness, and a light mist of dream veiled the heavens from him for a
      moment; but then he awoke, and they became visible again.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of these intervals it seemed to him that some strange human
      figure flitted before him. Thinking it to be merely a vision which would
      vanish at once, he opened his eyes, and beheld a withered, emaciated face
      bending over him, and gazing straight into his own. Long coal-black hair,
      unkempt, dishevelled, fell from beneath a dark veil which had been thrown
      over the head; whilst the strange gleam of the eyes, and the death-like
      tone of the sharp-cut features, inclined him to think that it was an
      apparition. His hand involuntarily grasped his gun; and he exclaimed
      almost convulsively: "Who are you? If you are an evil spirit, avaunt! If
      you are a living being, you have chosen an ill time for your jest. I will
      kill you with one shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this, the apparition laid its finger upon its lips and seemed
      to entreat silence. He dropped his hands and began to look more
      attentively. He recognised it to be a woman from the long hair, the brown
      neck, and the half-concealed bosom. But she was not a native of those
      regions: her wide cheek-bones stood out prominently over her hollow
      cheeks; her small eyes were obliquely set. The more he gazed at her
      features, the more he found them familiar. Finally he could restrain
      himself no longer, and said, "Tell me, who are you? It seems to me that I
      know you, or have seen you somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago in Kief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago in Kief!" repeated Andrii, endeavouring to collect in his
      mind all that lingered in his memory of his former student life. He looked
      intently at her once more, and suddenly exclaimed at the top of his voice,
      "You are the Tatar! the servant of the lady, the Waiwode's daughter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh!" cried the Tatar, clasping her hands with a supplicating glance,
      trembling all over, and turning her head round in order to see whether any
      one had been awakened by Andrii's loud exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, tell me, why are you here?" said Andrii almost breathlessly, in
      a whisper, interrupted every moment by inward emotion. "Where is the lady?
      is she alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is now in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the city!" he exclaimed, again almost in a shriek, and feeling all the
      blood suddenly rush to his heart. "Why is she in the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the old lord himself is in the city: he has been Waiwode of Dubno
      for the last year and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she married? How strange you are! Tell me about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has eaten nothing for two days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not one of the inhabitants has had a morsel of bread for a long
      while; all have long been eating earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady saw you from the city wall, among the Zaporozhtzi. She said to
      me, 'Go tell the warrior: if he remembers me, let him come to me; and do
      not forget to make him give you a bit of bread for my aged mother, for I
      do not wish to see my mother die before my very eyes. Better that I should
      die first, and she afterwards! Beseech him; clasp his knees, his feet: he
      also has an aged mother, let him give you the bread for her sake!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Many feelings awoke in the young Cossack's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how came you here? how did you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By an underground passage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there an underground passage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not betray it, warrior?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear it by the holy cross!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You descend into a hole, and cross the brook, yonder among the reeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it leads into the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Straight into the monastery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go, let us go at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bit of bread, in the name of Christ and of His holy mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, so be it. Stand here beside the waggon, or, better still, lie down
      in it: no one will see you, all are asleep. I will return at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he set off for the baggage waggons, which contained the provisions
      belonging to their kuren. His heart beat. All the past, all that had been
      extinguished by the Cossack bivouacks, and by the stern battle of life,
      flamed out at once on the surface and drowned the present in its turn.
      Again, as from the dark depths of the sea, the noble lady rose before him:
      again there gleamed in his memory her beautiful arms, her eyes, her
      laughing mouth, her thick dark-chestnut hair, falling in curls upon her
      shoulders, and the firm, well-rounded limbs of her maiden form. No, they
      had not been extinguished in his breast, they had not vanished, they had
      simply been laid aside, in order, for a time, to make way for other strong
      emotions; but often, very often, the young Cossack's deep slumber had been
      troubled by them, and often he had lain sleepless on his couch, without
      being able to explain the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat more violently at the thought of seeing her again, and his
      young knees shook. On reaching the baggage waggons, he had quite forgotten
      what he had come for; he raised his hand to his brow and rubbed it long,
      trying to recollect what he was to do. At length he shuddered, and was
      filled with terror as the thought suddenly occurred to him that she was
      dying of hunger. He jumped upon the waggon and seized several large loaves
      of black bread; but then he thought, "Is this not food, suited to a robust
      and easily satisfied Zaporozhetz, too coarse and unfit for her delicate
      frame?" Then he recollected that the Koschevoi, on the previous evening,
      had reproved the cooks for having cooked up all the oatmeal into porridge
      at once, when there was plenty for three times. Sure that he would find
      plenty of porridge in the kettles, he drew out his father's travelling
      kettle and went with it to the cook of their kuren, who was sleeping
      beside two big cauldrons, holding about ten pailfuls, under which the
      ashes still glowed. Glancing into them, he was amazed to find them empty.
      It must have required supernatural powers to eat it all; the more so, as
      their kuren numbered fewer than the others. He looked into the cauldron of
      the other kurens&mdash;nothing anywhere. Involuntarily the saying recurred
      to his mind, "The Zaporozhtzi are like children: if there is little they
      eat it, if there is much they leave nothing." What was to be done? There
      was, somewhere in the waggon belonging to his father's band, a sack of
      white bread, which they had found when they pillaged the bakery of the
      monastery. He went straight to his father's waggon, but it was not there.
      Ostap had taken it and put it under his head; and there he lay, stretched
      out on the ground, snoring so that the whole plain rang again. Andrii
      seized the sack abruptly with one hand and gave it a jerk, so that Ostap's
      head fell to the ground. The elder brother sprang up in his sleep, and,
      sitting there with closed eyes, shouted at the top of his lungs, "Stop
      them! Stop the cursed Lyakhs! Catch the horses! catch the horses!"&mdash;"Silence!
      I'll kill you," shouted Andrii in terror, flourishing the sack over him.
      But Ostap did not continue his speech, sank down again, and gave such a
      snore that the grass on which he lay waved with his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii glanced timidly on all sides to see if Ostap's talking in his sleep
      had waked any of the Cossacks. Only one long-locked head was raised in the
      adjoining kuren, and after glancing about, was dropped back on the ground.
      After waiting a couple of minutes he set out with his load. The Tatar
      woman was lying where he had left her, scarcely breathing. "Come, rise up.
      Fear not, all are sleeping. Can you take one of these loaves if I cannot
      carry all?" So saying, he swung the sack on to his back, pulled out
      another sack of millet as he passed the waggon, took in his hands the
      loaves he had wanted to give the Tatar woman to carry, and, bending
      somewhat under the load, went boldly through the ranks of sleeping
      Zaporozhtzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrii," said old Bulba, as he passed. His heart died within him. He
      halted, trembling, and said softly, "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a woman with you. When I get up I'll give you a sound thrashing.
      Women will lead you to no good." So saying, he leaned his hand upon his
      hand and gazed intently at the muffled form of the Tatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii stood there, more dead than alive, not daring to look in his
      father's face. When he did raise his eyes and glance at him, old Bulba was
      asleep, with his head still resting in the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii crossed himself. Fear fled from his heart even more rapidly than it
      had assailed it. When he turned to look at the Tatar woman, she stood
      before him, muffled in her mantle, like a dark granite statue, and the
      gleam of the distant dawn lighted up only her eyes, dull as those of a
      corpse. He plucked her by the sleeve, and both went on together, glancing
      back continually. At length they descended the slope of a small ravine,
      almost a hole, along the bottom of which a brook flowed lazily, overgrown
      with sedge, and strewed with mossy boulders. Descending into this ravine,
      they were completely concealed from the view of all the plain occupied by
      the Zaporovian camp. At least Andrii, glancing back, saw that the steep
      slope rose behind him higher than a man. On its summit appeared a few
      blades of steppe-grass; and behind them, in the sky, hung the moon, like a
      golden sickle. The breeze rising on the steppe warned them that the dawn
      was not far off. But nowhere was the crow of the cock heard. Neither in
      the city nor in the devastated neighbourhood had there been a cock for a
      long time past. They crossed the brook on a small plank, beyond which rose
      the opposite bank, which appeared higher than the one behind them and rose
      steeply. It seemed as though this were the strong point of the citadel
      upon which the besieged could rely; at all events, the earthen wall was
      lower there, and no garrison appeared behind it. But farther on rose the
      thick monastery walls. The steep bank was overgrown with steppe-grass, and
      in the narrow ravine between it and the brook grew tall reeds almost as
      high as a man. At the summit of the bank were the remains of a wattled
      fence, which had formerly surrounded some garden, and in front of it were
      visible the wide leaves of the burdock, from among which rose blackthorn,
      and sunflowers lifting their heads high above all the rest. Here the Tatar
      flung off her slippers and went barefoot, gathering her clothes up
      carefully, for the spot was marshy and full of water. Forcing their way
      among the reeds, they stopped before a ruined outwork. Skirting this
      outwork, they found a sort of earthen arch&mdash;an opening not much
      larger than the opening of an oven. The Tatar woman bent her head and went
      first. Andrii followed, bending low as he could, in order to pass with his
      sacks; and both soon found themselves in total darkness.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Andrii could hardly move in the dark and narrow earthen burrow, as he
      followed the Tatar, dragging after him his sacks of bread. "It will soon
      be light," said his guide: "we are approaching the spot where I placed a
      light." And in fact the dark earthen walls began to be gradually lit up.
      They reached a widening in the passage where, it seemed, there had once
      been a chapel; at least, there was a small table against the wall, like an
      altar, and above, the faded, almost entirely obliterated picture of a
      Catholic Madonna. A small silver lamp hanging before it barely illumined
      it. The Tatar stooped and picked up from the ground a copper candlestick
      which she had left there, a candlestick with a tall, slender stem, and
      snuffers, pin, and extinguisher hanging about it on chains. She lighted it
      at the silver lamp. The light grew stronger; and as they went on, now
      illumined by it, and again enveloped in pitchy shadow, they suggested a
      picture by Gerard Dow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warrior's fresh, handsome countenance, overflowing with health and
      youth, presented a strong contrast to the pale, emaciated face of his
      companion. The passage grew a little higher, so that Andrii could hold
      himself erect. He gazed with curiosity at the earthen walls. Here and
      there, as in the catacombs at Kief, were niches in the walls; and in some
      places coffins were standing. Sometimes they came across human bones which
      had become softened with the dampness and were crumbling into dust. It was
      evident that pious folk had taken refuge here from the storms, sorrows,
      and seductions of the world. It was extremely damp in some places; indeed
      there was water under their feet at intervals. Andrii was forced to halt
      frequently to allow his companion to rest, for her fatigue kept
      increasing. The small piece of bread she had swallowed only caused a pain
      in her stomach, of late unused to food; and she often stood motionless for
      minutes together in one spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a small iron door appeared before them. "Glory be to God, we
      have arrived!" said the Tatar in a faint voice, and tried to lift her hand
      to knock, but had no strength to do so. Andrii knocked hard at the door in
      her stead. There was an echo as though a large space lay beyond the door;
      then the echo changed as if resounding through lofty arches. In a couple
      of minutes, keys rattled, and steps were heard descending some stairs. At
      length the door opened, and a monk, standing on the narrow stairs with the
      key and a light in his hands, admitted them. Andrii involuntarily halted
      at the sight of a Catholic monk&mdash;one of those who had aroused such
      hate and disdain among the Cossacks that they treated them even more
      inhumanly than they treated the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk, on his part, started back on perceiving a Zaporovian Cossack,
      but a whisper from the Tatar reassured him. He lighted them in, fastened
      the door behind them, and led them up the stairs. They found themselves
      beneath the dark and lofty arches of the monastery church. Before one of
      the altars, adorned with tall candlesticks and candles, knelt a priest
      praying quietly. Near him on each side knelt two young choristers in lilac
      cassocks and white lace stoles, with censers in their hands. He prayed for
      the performance of a miracle, that the city might be saved; that their
      souls might be strengthened; that patience might be given them; that doubt
      and timid, weak-spirited mourning over earthly misfortunes might be
      banished. A few women, resembling shadows, knelt supporting themselves
      against the backs of the chairs and dark wooden benches before them, and
      laying their exhausted heads upon them. A few men stood sadly, leaning
      against the columns upon which the wide arches rested. The stained-glass
      window above the altar suddenly glowed with the rosy light of dawn; and
      from it, on the floor, fell circles of blue, yellow, and other colours,
      illuminating the dim church. The whole altar was lighted up; the smoke
      from the censers hung a cloudy rainbow in the air. Andrii gazed from his
      dark corner, not without surprise, at the wonders worked by the light. At
      that moment the magnificent swell of the organ filled the whole church. It
      grew deeper and deeper, expanded, swelled into heavy bursts of thunder;
      and then all at once, turning into heavenly music, its ringing tones
      floated high among the arches, like clear maiden voices, and again
      descended into a deep roar and thunder, and then ceased. The thunderous
      pulsations echoed long and tremulously among the arches; and Andrii, with
      half-open mouth, admired the wondrous music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he felt some one plucking the shirt of his caftan. "It is time," said
      the Tatar. They traversed the church unperceived, and emerged upon the
      square in front. Dawn had long flushed the heavens; all announced sunrise.
      The square was empty: in the middle of it still stood wooden pillars,
      showing that, perhaps only a week before, there had been a market here
      stocked with provisions. The streets, which were unpaved, were simply a
      mass of dried mud. The square was surrounded by small, one-storied stone
      or mud houses, in the walls of which were visible wooden stakes and posts
      obliquely crossed by carved wooden beams, as was the manner of building in
      those days. Specimens of it can still be seen in some parts of Lithuania
      and Poland. They were all covered with enormously high roofs, with a
      multitude of windows and air-holes. On one side, close to the church, rose
      a building quite detached from and taller than the rest, probably the
      town-hall or some official structure. It was two stories high, and above
      it, on two arches, rose a belvedere where a watchman stood; a huge
      clock-face was let into the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square seemed deserted, but Andrii thought he heard a feeble groan.
      Looking about him, he perceived, on the farther side, a group of two or
      three men lying motionless upon the ground. He fixed his eyes more
      intently on them, to see whether they were asleep or dead; and, at the
      same moment, stumbled over something lying at his feet. It was the dead
      body of a woman, a Jewess apparently. She appeared to be young, though it
      was scarcely discernible in her distorted and emaciated features. Upon her
      head was a red silk kerchief; two rows of pearls or pearl beads adorned
      the beads of her head-dress, from beneath which two long curls hung down
      upon her shrivelled neck, with its tightly drawn veins. Beside her lay a
      child, grasping convulsively at her shrunken breast, and squeezing it with
      involuntary ferocity at finding no milk there. He neither wept nor
      screamed, and only his gently rising and falling body would have led one
      to guess that he was not dead, or at least on the point of breathing his
      last. They turned into a street, and were suddenly stopped by a madman,
      who, catching sight of Andrii's precious burden, sprang upon him like a
      tiger, and clutched him, yelling, "Bread!" But his strength was not equal
      to his madness. Andrii repulsed him and he fell to the ground. Moved with
      pity, the young Cossack flung him a loaf, which he seized like a mad dog,
      gnawing and biting it; but nevertheless he shortly expired in horrible
      suffering, there in the street, from the effect of long abstinence. The
      ghastly victims of hunger startled them at every step. Many, apparently
      unable to endure their torments in their houses, seemed to run into the
      streets to see whether some nourishing power might not possibly descend
      from the air. At the gate of one house sat an old woman, and it was
      impossible to say whether she was asleep or dead, or only unconscious; at
      all events, she no longer saw or heard anything, and sat immovable in one
      spot, her head drooping on her breast. From the roof of another house hung
      a worn and wasted body in a rope noose. The poor fellow could not endure
      the tortures of hunger to the last, and had preferred to hasten his end by
      a voluntary death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of such terrible proofs of famine, Andrii could not refrain
      from saying to the Tatar, "Is there really nothing with which they can
      prolong life? If a man is driven to extremities, he must feed on what he
      has hitherto despised; he can sustain himself with creatures which are
      forbidden by the law. Anything can be eaten under such circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have eaten everything," said the Tatar, "all the animals. Not a
      horse, nor a dog, nor even a mouse is to be found in the whole city. We
      never had any store of provisions in the town: they were all brought from
      the villages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you, while dying such a fearful death, still dream of
      defending the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly the Waiwode might have surrendered; but yesterday morning the
      commander of the troops at Buzhana sent a hawk into the city with a note
      saying that it was not to be given up; that he was coming to its rescue
      with his forces, and was only waiting for another leader, that they might
      march together. And now they are expected every moment. But we have
      reached the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii had already noticed from a distance this house, unlike the others,
      and built apparently by some Italian architect. It was constructed of thin
      red bricks, and had two stories. The windows of the lower story were
      sheltered under lofty, projecting granite cornices. The upper story
      consisted entirely of small arches, forming a gallery; between the arches
      were iron gratings enriched with escutcheons; whilst upon the gables of
      the house more coats-of-arms were displayed. The broad external staircase,
      of tinted bricks, abutted on the square. At the foot of it sat guards, who
      with one hand held their halberds upright, and with the other supported
      their drooping heads, and in this attitude more resembled apparitions than
      living beings. They neither slept nor dreamed, but seemed quite insensible
      to everything; they even paid no attention to who went up the stairs. At
      the head of the stairs, they found a richly-dressed warrior, armed
      cap-a-pie, and holding a breviary in his hand. He turned his dim eyes upon
      them; but the Tatar spoke a word to him, and he dropped them again upon
      the open pages of his breviary. They entered the first chamber, a large
      one, serving either as a reception-room, or simply as an ante-room; it was
      filled with soldiers, servants, secretaries, huntsmen, cup-bearers, and
      the other servitors indispensable to the support of a Polish magnate's
      estate, all seated along the walls. The reek of extinguished candles was
      perceptible; and two were still burning in two huge candlesticks, nearly
      as tall as a man, standing in the middle of the room, although morning had
      long since peeped through the wide grated window. Andrii wanted to go
      straight on to the large oaken door adorned with a coat-of-arms and a
      profusion of carved ornaments, but the Tatar pulled his sleeve and pointed
      to a small door in the side wall. Through this they gained a corridor, and
      then a room, which he began to examine attentively. The light which
      filtered through a crack in the shutter fell upon several objects&mdash;a
      crimson curtain, a gilded cornice, and a painting on the wall. Here the
      Tatar motioned to Andrii to wait, and opened the door into another room
      from which flashed the light of a fire. He heard a whispering, and a soft
      voice which made him quiver all over. Through the open door he saw flit
      rapidly past a tall female figure, with a long thick braid of hair falling
      over her uplifted hands. The Tatar returned and told him to go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could never understand how he entered and how the door was shut behind
      him. Two candles burned in the room and a lamp glowed before the images:
      beneath the lamp stood a tall table with steps to kneel upon during
      prayer, after the Catholic fashion. But his eye did not seek this. He
      turned to the other side and perceived a woman, who appeared to have been
      frozen or turned to stone in the midst of some quick movement. It seemed
      as though her whole body had sought to spring towards him, and had
      suddenly paused. And he stood in like manner amazed before her. Not thus
      had he pictured to himself that he should find her. This was not the same
      being he had formerly known; nothing about her resembled her former self;
      but she was twice as beautiful, twice as enchanting, now than she had been
      then. Then there had been something unfinished, incomplete, about her; now
      here was a production to which the artist had given the finishing stroke
      of his brush. That was a charming, giddy girl; this was a woman in the
      full development of her charms. As she raised her eyes, they were full of
      feeling, not of mere hints of feeling. The tears were not yet dry in them,
      and framed them in a shining dew which penetrated the very soul. Her
      bosom, neck, and arms were moulded in the proportions which mark fully
      developed loveliness. Her hair, which had in former days waved in light
      ringlets about her face, had become a heavy, luxuriant mass, a part of
      which was caught up, while part fell in long, slender curls upon her arms
      and breast. It seemed as though her every feature had changed. In vain did
      he seek to discover in them a single one of those which were engraved in
      his memory&mdash;a single one. Even her great pallor did not lessen her
      wonderful beauty; on the contrary, it conferred upon it an irresistible,
      inexpressible charm. Andrii felt in his heart a noble timidity, and stood
      motionless before her. She, too, seemed surprised at the appearance of the
      Cossack, as he stood before her in all the beauty and might of his young
      manhood, and in the very immovability of his limbs personified the utmost
      freedom of movement. His eyes beamed with clear decision; his velvet brows
      curved in a bold arch; his sunburnt cheeks glowed with all the ardour of
      youthful fire; and his downy black moustache shone like silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have no power to thank you, noble sir," she said, her silvery voice
      all in a tremble. "God alone can reward you, not I, a weak woman." She
      dropped her eyes, her lids fell over them in beautiful, snowy semicircles,
      guarded by lashes long as arrows; her wondrous face bowed forward, and a
      delicate flush overspread it from within. Andrii knew not what to say; he
      wanted to say everything. He had in his mind to say it all ardently as it
      glowed in his heart&mdash;and could not. He felt something confining his
      mouth; voice and words were lacking; he felt that it was not for him, bred
      in the seminary and in the tumult of a roaming life, to reply fitly to
      such language, and was angry with his Cossack nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Tatar entered the room. She had cut up the bread which
      the warrior had brought into small pieces on a golden plate, which she
      placed before her mistress. The lady glanced at her, at the bread, at her
      again, and then turned her eyes towards Andrii. There was a great deal in
      those eyes. That gentle glance, expressive of her weakness and her
      inability to give words to the feeling which overpowered her, was far more
      comprehensible to Andrii than any words. His heart suddenly grew light
      within him, all seemed made smooth. The mental emotions and the feelings
      which up to that moment he had restrained with a heavy curb, as it were,
      now felt themselves released, at liberty, and anxious to pour themselves
      out in a resistless torrent of words. Suddenly the lady turned to the
      Tatar, and said anxiously, "But my mother? you took her some?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I carried him some; he said that he would come to thank the young lord in
      person."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the bread and raised it to her mouth. With inexpressible delight
      Andrii watched her break it with her shining fingers and eat it; but all
      at once he recalled the man mad with hunger, who had expired before his
      eyes on swallowing a morsel of bread. He turned pale and, seizing her
      hand, cried, "Enough! eat no more! you have not eaten for so long that too
      much bread will be poison to you now." And she at once dropped her hand,
      laid her bread upon the plate, and gazed into his eyes like a submissive
      child. And if any words could express&mdash;But neither chisel, nor brush,
      nor mighty speech is capable of expressing what is sometimes seen in
      glances of maidens, nor the tender feeling which takes possession of him
      who receives such maiden glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My queen!" exclaimed Andrii, his heart and soul filled with emotion,
      "what do you need? what do you wish? command me! Impose on me the most
      impossible task in all the world: I fly to fulfil it! Tell me to do that
      which it is beyond the power of man to do: I will fulfil it if I destroy
      myself. I will ruin myself. And I swear by the holy cross that ruin for
      your sake is as sweet&mdash;but no, it is impossible to say how sweet! I
      have three farms; half my father's droves of horses are mine; all that my
      mother brought my father, and which she still conceals from him&mdash;all
      this is mine! Not one of the Cossacks owns such weapons as I; for the
      pommel of my sword alone they would give their best drove of horses and
      three thousand sheep. And I renounce all this, I discard it, I throw it
      aside, I will burn and drown it, if you will but say the word, or even
      move your delicate black brows! But I know that I am talking madly and
      wide of the mark; that all this is not fitting here; that it is not for
      me, who have passed my life in the seminary and among the Zaporozhtzi, to
      speak as they speak where kings, princes, and all the best of noble
      knighthood have been. I can see that you are a different being from the
      rest of us, and far above all other boyars' wives and maiden daughters."
    </p>
    <p>
      With growing amazement the maiden listened, losing no single word, to the
      frank, sincere language in which, as in a mirror, the young, strong spirit
      reflected itself. Each simple word of this speech, uttered in a voice
      which penetrated straight to the depths of her heart, was clothed in
      power. She advanced her beautiful face, pushed back her troublesome hair,
      opened her mouth, and gazed long, with parted lips. Then she tried to say
      something and suddenly stopped, remembering that the warrior was known by
      a different name; that his father, brothers, country, lay beyond, grim
      avengers; that the Zaporozhtzi besieging the city were terrible, and that
      the cruel death awaited all who were within its walls, and her eyes
      suddenly filled with tears. She seized a silk embroidered handkerchief and
      threw it over her face. In a moment it was all wet; and she sat for some
      time with her beautiful head thrown back, and her snowy teeth set on her
      lovely under-lip, as though she suddenly felt the sting of a poisonous
      serpent, without removing the handkerchief from her face, lest he should
      see her shaken with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak but one word to me," said Andrii, and he took her satin-skinned
      hand. A sparkling fire coursed through his veins at the touch, and he
      pressed the hand lying motionless in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she still kept silence, never taking the kerchief from her face, and
      remaining motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you so sad? Tell me, why are you so sad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast away the handkerchief, pushed aside the long hair which fell over
      her eyes, and poured out her heart in sad speech, in a quiet voice, like
      the breeze which, rising on a beautiful evening, blows through the thick
      growth of reeds beside the stream. They rustle, murmur, and give forth
      delicately mournful sounds, and the traveller, pausing in inexplicable
      sadness, hears them, and heeds not the fading light, nor the gay songs of
      the peasants which float in the air as they return from their labours in
      meadow and stubble-field, nor the distant rumble of the passing waggon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am not I worthy of eternal pity? Is not the mother that bore me unhappy?
      Is it not a bitter lot which has befallen me? Art not thou a cruel
      executioner, fate? Thou has brought all to my feet&mdash;the highest
      nobles in the land, the richest gentlemen, counts, foreign barons, all the
      flower of our knighthood. All loved me, and any one of them would have
      counted my love the greatest boon. I had but to beckon, and the best of
      them, the handsomest, the first in beauty and birth would have become my
      husband. And to none of them didst thou incline my heart, O bitter fate;
      but thou didst turn it against the noblest heroes of our land, and towards
      a stranger, towards our enemy. O most holy mother of God! for what sin
      dost thou so pitilessly, mercilessly, persecute me? In abundance and
      superfluity of luxury my days were passed, the richest dishes and the
      sweetest wine were my food. And to what end was it all? What was it all
      for? In order that I might at last die a death more cruel than that of the
      meanest beggar in the kingdom? And it was not enough that I should be
      condemned to so horrible a fate; not enough that before my own end I
      should behold my father and mother perish in intolerable torment, when I
      would have willingly given my own life twenty times over to save them; all
      this was not enough, but before my own death I must hear words of love
      such as I had never before dreamed of. It was necessary that he should
      break my heart with his words; that my bitter lot should be rendered still
      more bitter; that my young life should be made yet more sad; that my death
      should seem even more terrible; and that, dying, I should reproach thee
      still more, O cruel fate! and thee&mdash;forgive my sin&mdash;O holy
      mother of God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she ceased in despair, her feelings were plainly expressed in her face.
      Every feature spoke of gnawing sorrow and, from the sadly bowed brow and
      downcast eyes to the tears trickling down and drying on her softly burning
      cheeks, seemed to say, "There is no happiness in this face."

    <p>
      "Such a thing was never heard of since the world began. It cannot be,"
      said Andrii, "that the best and most beautiful of women should suffer so
      bitter a fate, when she was born that all the best there is in the world
      should bow before her as before a saint. No, you will not die, you shall
      not die! I swear by my birth and by all there is dear to me in the world
      that you shall not die. But if it must be so; if nothing, neither
      strength, nor prayer, nor heroism, will avail to avert this cruel fate&mdash;then
      we will die together, and I will die first. I will die before you, at your
      beauteous knees, and even in death they shall not divide us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deceive not yourself and me, noble sir," she said, gently shaking her
      beautiful head; "I know, and to my great sorrow I know but too well, that
      it is impossible for you to love me. I know what your duty is, and your
      faith. Your father calls you, your comrades, your country, and we are your
      enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are my father, my comrades, my country to me?" said Andrii, with
      a quick movement of his head, and straightening up his figure like a
      poplar beside the river. "Be that as it may, I have no one, no one!" he
      repeated, with that movement of the hand with which the Cossack expresses
      his determination to do some unheard-of deed, impossible to any other man.
      "Who says that the Ukraine is my country? Who gave it to me for my
      country? Our country is the one our soul longs for, the one which is
      dearest of all to us. My country is&mdash;you! That is my native land, and
      I bear that country in my heart. I will bear it there all my life, and I
      will see whether any of the Cossacks can tear it thence. And I will give
      everything, barter everything, I will destroy myself, for that country!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Astounded, she gazed in his eyes for a space, like a beautiful statue, and
      then suddenly burst out sobbing; and with the wonderful feminine
      impetuosity which only grand-souled, uncalculating women, created for fine
      impulses of the heart, are capable of, threw herself upon his neck,
      encircling it with her wondrous snowy arms, and wept. At that moment
      indistinct shouts rang through the street, accompanied by the sound of
      trumpets and kettledrums; but he heard them not. He was only conscious of
      the beauteous mouth bathing him with its warm, sweet breath, of the tears
      streaming down his face, and of her long, unbound perfumed hair, veiling
      him completely in its dark and shining silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Tatar ran in with a cry of joy. "Saved, saved!" she
      cried, beside herself. "Our troops have entered the city. They have
      brought corn, millet, flour, and Zaporozhtzi in chains!" But no one heard
      that "our troops" had arrived in the city, or what they had brought with
      them, or how they had bound the Zaporozhtzi. Filled with feelings untasted
      as yet upon earth, Andrii kissed the sweet mouth which pressed his cheek,
      and the sweet mouth did not remain unresponsive. In this union of kisses
      they experienced that which it is given to a man to feel but once on
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Cossack was ruined. He was lost to Cossack chivalry. Never again
      will Zaporozhe, nor his father's house, nor the Church of God, behold him.
      The Ukraine will never more see the bravest of the children who have
      undertaken to defend her. Old Taras may tear the grey hair from his
      scalp-lock, and curse the day and hour in which such a son was born to
      dishonour him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Noise and movement were rife in the Zaporozhian camp. At first, no one
      could account for the relieving army having made its way into the city;
      but it afterwards appeared that the Pereyaslavsky kuren, encamped before
      the wide gate of the town, had been dead drunk. It was no wonder that half
      had been killed, and the other half bound, before they knew what it was
      all about. Meantime the neighbouring kurens, aroused by the tumult,
      succeeded in grasping their weapons; but the relieving force had already
      passed through the gate, and its rear ranks fired upon the sleepy and only
      half-sober Zaporozhtzi who were pressing in disorder upon them, and kept
      them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Koschevoi ordered a general assembly; and when all stood in a ring and
      had removed their caps and became quiet, he said: "See what happened last
      night, brother gentles! See what drunkenness has led to! See what shame
      the enemy has put upon us! It is evident that, if your allowances are
      kindly doubled, then you are ready to stretch out at full length, and the
      enemies of Christ can not only take your very trousers off you, but sneeze
      in your faces without your hearing them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks all stood with drooping heads, knowing that they were guilty;
      only Kukubenko, the hetman of the Nezamisky kuren, answered back. "Stop,
      father!" said he; "although it is not lawful to make a retort when the
      Koschevoi speaks before the whole army, yet it is necessary to say that
      that was not the state of the case. You have not been quite just in your
      reprimand. The Cossacks would have been guilty, and deserving of death,
      had they got drunk on the march, or when engaged on heavy toilsome labour
      during war; but we have been sitting here unoccupied, loitering in vain
      before the city. There was no fast or other Christian restraint; how then
      could it be otherwise than that a man should get drunk in idleness? There
      is no sin in that. But we had better show them what it is to attack
      innocent people. They first beat us well, and now we will beat them so
      that not half a dozen of them will ever see home again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of the hetman of the kuren pleased the Cossacks. They raised
      their drooping heads upright and many nodded approvingly, muttering,
      "Kukubenko has spoken well!" And Taras Bulba, who stood not far from the
      Koschevoi, said: "How now, Koschevoi? Kukubenko has spoken truth. What
      have you to say to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I to say? I say, Blessed be the father of such a son! It does
      not need much wisdom to utter words of reproof; but much wisdom is needed
      to find such words as do not embitter a man's misfortune, but encourage
      him, restore to him his spirit, put spurs to the horse of his soul,
      refreshed by water. I meant myself to speak words of comfort to you, but
      Kukubenko has forestalled me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Koschevoi has also spoken well!" rang through the ranks of the
      Zaporozhtzi. "His words are good," repeated others. And even the
      greyheads, who stood there like dark blue doves, nodded their heads and,
      twitching their grey moustaches, muttered softly, "That was well said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen now, gentles," continued the Koschevoi. "To take the city, by
      scaling its walls, or undermining them as the foreign engineers do, is not
      proper, not Cossack fashion. But, judging from appearances, the enemy
      entered the city without many provisions; they had not many waggons with
      them. The people in the city are hungry; they will all eat heartily, and
      the horses will soon devour the hay. I don't know whether their saints
      will fling them down anything from heaven with hayforks; God only knows
      that though there are a great many Catholic priests among them. By one
      means or another the people will seek to leave the city. Divide
      yourselves, therefore, into three divisions, and take up your posts before
      the three gates; five kurens before the principal gate, and three kurens
      before each of the others. Let the Dadikivsky and Korsunsky kurens go into
      ambush and Taras and his men into ambush too. The Titarevsky and
      Timoschevsky kurens are to guard the baggage train on the right flank, the
      Scherbinovsky and Steblikivsky on the left, and to select from their ranks
      the most daring young men to face the foe. The Lyakhs are of a restless
      nature and cannot endure a siege, and perhaps this very day they will
      sally forth from the gates. Let each hetman inspect his kuren; those whose
      ranks are not full are to be recruited from the remains of the
      Pereyaslavsky kuren. Inspect them all anew. Give a loaf and a beaker to
      each Cossack to strengthen him. But surely every one must be satiated from
      last night; for all stuffed themselves so that, to tell the truth, I am
      only surprised that no one burst in the night. And here is one further
      command: if any Jew spirit-seller sells a Cossack so much as a single jug
      of brandy, I will nail pig's ears to his very forehead, the dog, and hang
      him up by his feet. To work, brothers, to work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the Koschevoi give his orders. All bowed to their girdles, and
      without putting on their caps set out for their waggons and camps. It was
      only when they had gone some distance that they covered themselves. All
      began to equip themselves: they tested their swords, poured powder from
      the sacks into their powder-flasks, drew up and arranged the waggons, and
      looked to their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to his band, Taras wondered what had become of Andrii; could he
      have been captured and found while asleep with the others? But no, Andrii
      was not the man to go alive into captivity. Yet he was not to be seen
      among the slaughtered Cossacks. Taras pondered deeply and went past his
      men without hearing that some one had for some time been calling him by
      name. "Who wants me?" he said, finally arousing himself from his
      reflections. Before him stood the Jew, Yankel. "Lord colonel! lord
      colonel!" said the Jew in a hasty and broken voice, as though desirous of
      revealing something not utterly useless, "I have been in the city, lord
      colonel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras looked at the Jew, and wondered how he had succeeded in getting into
      the city. "What enemy took you there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you at once," said Yankel. "As soon as I heard the uproar
      this morning, when the Cossacks began to fire, I seized my caftan and,
      without stopping to put it on, ran at the top of my speed, thrusting my
      arms in on the way, because I wanted to know as soon as possible the cause
      of the noise and why the Cossacks were firing at dawn. I ran to the very
      gate of the city, at the moment when the last of the army was passing
      through. I looked, and in command of the rearguard was Cornet
      Galyandovitch. He is a man well known to me; he has owed me a hundred
      ducats these three years past. I ran after him, as though to claim the
      debt of him, and so entered the city with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You entered the city, and wanted him to settle the debt!" said Bulba;
      "and he did not order you to be hung like a dog on the spot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By heavens, he did want to hang me," replied the Jew; "his servants had
      already seized me and thrown a rope about my neck. But I besought the
      noble lord, and said that I would wait for the money as long as his
      lordship liked, and promised to lend him more if he would only help me to
      collect my debts from the other nobles; for I can tell my lord that the
      noble cornet had not a ducat in his pocket, although he has farms and
      estates and four castles and steppe-land that extends clear to Schklof;
      but he has not a penny, any more than a Cossack. If the Breslau Jews had
      not equipped him, he would never have gone on this campaign. That was the
      reason he did not go to the Diet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do in the city? Did you see any of our people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, there are many of them there: Itzok, Rachum, Samuel,
      Khaivalkh, Evrei the pawnbroker&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May they die, the dogs!" shouted Taras in a rage. "Why do you name your
      Jewish tribe to me? I ask you about our Zaporozhtzi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw none of our Zaporozhtzi; I saw only Lord Andrii."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw Andrii!" shouted Bulba. "What is he doing? Where did you see him?
      In a dungeon? in a pit? dishonoured? bound?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who would dare to bind Lord Andrii? now he is so grand a knight. I hardly
      recognised him. Gold on his shoulders and his belt, gold everywhere about
      him; as the sun shines in spring, when every bird twitters and sings in
      the orchard, so he shines, all gold. And his horse, which the Waiwode
      himself gave him, is the very best; that horse alone is worth two hundred
      ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba was petrified. "Why has he put on foreign garments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He put them on because they were finer. And he rides about, and the
      others ride about, and he teaches them, and they teach him; like the very
      grandest Polish noble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who forced him to do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not say that he had been forced. Does not my lord know that he
      went over to them of his own free will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who went over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Andrii."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Went where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Went over to their side; he is now a thorough foreigner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you hog's ear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it possible that I should lie? Am I a fool, that I should lie?
      Would I lie at the risk of my head? Do not I know that Jews are hung like
      dogs if they lie to nobles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it means, according to you, he has betrayed his native land and his
      faith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say that he has betrayed anything; I merely said that he had
      gone over to the other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you imp of a Jew! Such a deed was never known in a Christian
      land. You are making a mistake, dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May the grass grow upon the threshold of my house if I am mistaken! May
      every one spit upon the grave of my father, my mother, my father's father,
      and my mother's father, if I am mistaken! If my lord wished I can even
      tell him why he went over to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Waiwode has a beautiful daughter. Holy Father! what a beauty!" Here
      the Jew tried his utmost to express beauty by extending his hands,
      screwing up his eyes, and twisting his mouth to one side as though tasting
      something on trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did it all for her, he went there for her sake. When a man is in love,
      then all things are the same to him; like the sole of a shoe which you can
      bend in any direction if you soak it in water."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba reflected deeply. He remembered the power of weak woman&mdash;how
      she had ruined many a strong man, and that this was the weak point in
      Andrii's nature&mdash;and stood for some time in one spot, as though
      rooted there. "Listen, my lord, I will tell my lord all," said the Jew.
      "As soon as I heard the uproar, and saw them going through the city gate,
      I seized a string of pearls, in case of any emergency. For there are
      beauties and noble-women there; 'and if there are beauties and
      noble-women,' I said to myself, 'they will buy pearls, even if they have
      nothing to eat.' And, as soon as ever the cornet's servants had set me at
      liberty, I hastened to the Waiwode's residence to sell my pearls. I asked
      all manner of questions of the lady's Tatar maid; the wedding is to take
      place immediately, as soon as they have driven off the Zaporozhtzi. Lord
      Andrii has promised to drive off the Zaporovians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did not kill him on the spot, you devil's brat?" shouted Bulba.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I kill him? He went over of his own free will. What is his
      crime? He liked it better there, so he went there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you saw him face to face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Face to face, by heavens! such a magnificent warrior! more splendid than
      all the rest. God bless him, he knew me, and when I approached him he said
      at once&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said&mdash;First he beckoned me with his finger, and then he said,
      'Yankel!' Lord Andrii said, 'Yankel, tell my father, tell my brother, tell
      all the Cossacks, all the Zaporozhtzi, everybody, that my father is no
      longer my father, nor my brother my brother, nor my comrades my comrades;
      and that I will fight them all, all.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, imp of a Jew!" shouted Taras, beside himself. "You lie, dog! I
      will kill you, Satan! Get away from here! if not, death awaits you!" So
      saying, Taras drew his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified Jew set off instantly, at the full speed of his thin,
      shrunken legs. He ran for a long time, without looking back, through the
      Cossack camp, and then far out on the deserted plain, although Taras did
      not chase him at all, reasoning that it was foolish to thus vent his rage
      on the first person who presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he recollected that he had seen Andrii on the previous night
      traversing the camp with some woman, and he bowed his grey head. Still he
      would not believe that so disgraceful a thing could have happened, and
      that his own son had betrayed his faith and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he placed his men in ambush in a wood&mdash;the only one which had
      not been burned by the Cossacks&mdash;whilst the Zaporozhians, foot and
      horse, set out for the three gates by three different roads. One after
      another the kurens turned out: Oumansky, Popovichesky, Kanevsky,
      Steblikovsky, Nezamaikovsky, Gurgazif, Titarevsky, Tomischevsky. The
      Pereyaslavsky kuren alone was wanting. Its Cossacks had smoked and drank
      to their destruction. Some awoke to find themselves bound in the enemy's
      hands; others never woke at all but passed in their sleep into the damp
      earth; and the hetman Khlib himself, minus his trousers and accoutrements,
      found himself in the camp of the Lyakhs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uproar among the Zaporozhtzi was heard in the city. All the besieged
      hastened to the ramparts, and a lively scene was presented to the
      Cossacks. The handsome Polish heroes thronged on the wall. The brazen
      helmets of some shone like the sun, and were adorned with feathers white
      as swans. Others wore pink and blue caps, drooping over one ear, and
      caftans with the sleeves thrown back, embroidered with gold. Their weapons
      were richly mounted and very costly, as were their equipments. In the
      front rank the Budzhakovsky colonel stood proudly in his red cap
      ornamented with gold. He was a tall, stout man, and his rich and ample
      caftan hardly covered him. Near the side gate stood another colonel. He
      was a dried-up little man, but his small, piercing eyes gleamed sharply
      from under his thick and shaggy brows, and as he turned quickly on all
      sides, motioning boldly with his thin, withered hand, and giving out his
      orders, it was evident that, in spite of his little body, he understood
      military science thoroughly. Not far from him stood a very tall cornet,
      with thick moustaches and a highly-coloured complexion&mdash;a noble fond
      of strong mead and hearty revelry. Behind them were many nobles who had
      equipped themselves, some with their own ducats, some from the royal
      treasury, some with money obtained from the Jews, by pawning everything
      they found in their ancestral castles. Many too were parasites, whom the
      senators took with them to dinners for show, and who stole silver cups
      from the table and the sideboard, and when the day's display was over
      mounted some noble's coach-box and drove his horses. There were folk of
      all kinds there. Sometimes they had not enough to drink, but all were
      equipped for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossack ranks stood quietly before the walls. There was no gold about
      them, save where it shone on the hilt of a sword or the mountings of a
      gun. The Zaporozhtzi were not given to decking themselves out gaily for
      battle: their coats-of-mail and garments were plain, and their
      black-bordered red-crowned caps showed darkly in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men&mdash;Okhrim Nasch and Mikiga Golokopuitenko&mdash;advanced from
      the Zaporozhian ranks. One was quite young, the other older; both fierce
      in words, and not bad specimens of Cossacks in action. They were followed
      by Demid Popovitch, a strongly built Cossack who had been hanging about
      the Setch for a long time, after having been in Adrianople and undergoing
      a great deal in the course of his life. He had been burned, and had
      escaped to the Setch with blackened head and singed moustaches. But
      Popovitch recovered, let his hair grow, raised moustaches thick and black
      as pitch, and was a stout fellow, according to his own biting speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Red jackets on all the army, but I should like to know what sort of men
      are under them," he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you," shouted the stout colonel from above. "I will capture
      the whole of you. Surrender your guns and horses, slaves. Did you see how
      I caught your men?&mdash;Bring out a Zaporozhetz on the wall for them to
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      And they let out a Zaporozhetz bound with stout cords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them stood Khlib, the hetman of the Pereyaslavsky kuren, without
      his trousers or accoutrements, just as they had captured him in his
      drunken sleep. He bowed his head in shame before the Cossacks at his
      nakedness, and at having been thus taken like a dog, while asleep. His
      hair had turned grey in one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grieve not, Khlib: we will rescue you," shouted the Cossacks from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grieve not, friend," cried the hetman Borodaty. "It is not your fault
      that they caught you naked: that misfortune might happen to any man. But
      it is a disgrace to them that they should have exposed you to dishonour,
      and not covered your nakedness decently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to be a brave army when you have people who are asleep to
      fight," remarked Golokopuitenko, glancing at the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit, we'll singe your top-knots for you!" was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see them singe our scalp locks!" said Popovitch,
      prancing about before them on his horse; and then, glancing at his
      comrades, he added, "Well, perhaps the Lyakhs speak the truth: if that
      fat-bellied fellow leads them, they will all find a good shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you think they will find a good shelter?" asked the Cossacks,
      knowing that Popovitch was probably preparing some repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the whole army will hide behind him; and the devil himself
      couldn't help you to reach any one with your spear through that belly of
      his!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks laughed, some of them shaking their heads and saying, "What a
      fellow Popovitch is for a joke! but now&mdash;" But the Cossacks had not
      time to explain what they meant by that "now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fall back, fall back quickly from the wall!" shouted the Koschevoi,
      seeing that the Lyakhs could not endure these biting words, and that the
      colonel was waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks had hardly retreated from the wall before the grape-shot
      rained down. On the ramparts all was excitement, and the grey-haired
      Waiwode himself appeared on horseback. The gates opened and the garrison
      sallied forth. In the van came hussars in orderly ranks, behind them the
      horsemen in armour, and then the heroes in brazen helmets; after whom rode
      singly the highest nobility, each man accoutred as he pleased. These
      haughty nobles would not mingle in the ranks with others, and such of them
      as had no commands rode apart with their own immediate following. Next
      came some more companies, and after these the cornet, then more files of
      men, and the stout colonel; and in the rear of the whole force the little
      colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep them from forming in line!" shouted the Koschevoi; "let all the
      kurens attack them at once! Block the other gate! Titarevsky kuren, fall
      on one flank! Dyadovsky kuren, charge on the other! Attack them in the
      rear, Kukubenko and Palivod! Check them, break them!" The Cossacks
      attacked on all sides, throwing the Lyakhs into confusion and getting
      confused themselves. They did not even give the foe time to fire, it came
      to swords and spears at once. All fought hand to hand, and each man had an
      opportunity to distinguish himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demid Popovitch speared three soldiers, and struck two of the highest
      nobles from their saddles, saying, "Good horses! I have long wanted just
      such horses." And he drove the horses far afield, shouting to the Cossacks
      standing about to catch them. Then he rushed again into the fray, fell
      upon the dismounted nobles, slew one, and throwing his lasso round the
      neck of the other, tied him to his saddle and dragged him over the plain,
      after having taken from him his sword from its rich hilt and removed from
      his girdle a whole bag of ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kobita, a good Cossack, though still very young, attacked one of the
      bravest men in the Polish army, and they fought long together. They
      grappled, and the Cossack mastering his foe, and throwing him down,
      stabbed him in the breast with his sharp Turkish knife. But he did not
      look out for himself, and a bullet struck him on the temple. The man who
      struck him down was the most distinguished of the nobles, the handsomest
      scion of an ancient and princely race. Like a stately poplar, he bestrode
      his dun-coloured steed, and many heroic deeds did he perform. He cut two
      Cossacks in twain. Fedor Korzh, the brave Cossack, he overthrew together
      with his horse, shooting the steed and picking off the rider with his
      spear. Many heads and hands did he hew off; and slew Kobita by sending a
      bullet through his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a man I should like to measure strength with!" shouted Kukubenko,
      the hetman of the Nezamaikovsky kuren. Spurring his horse, he dashed
      straight at the Pole's back, shouting loudly, so that all who stood near
      shuddered at the unearthly yell. The boyard tried to wheel his horse
      suddenly and face him, but his horse would not obey him; scared by the
      terrible cry, it bounded aside, and the Lyakh received Kukubenko's fire.
      The ball struck him in the shoulder-blade, and he rolled from his saddle.
      Even then he did not surrender and strove to deal his enemy a blow, but
      his hand was weak. Kukubenko, taking his heavy sword in both hands, thrust
      it through his mouth. The sword, breaking out two teeth, cut the tongue in
      twain, pierced the windpipe, and penetrated deep into the earth, nailing
      him to the ground. His noble blood, red as viburnum berries beside the
      river, welled forth in a stream staining his yellow, gold-embroidered
      caftan. But Kukubenko had already left him, and was forcing his way, with
      his Nezamaikovsky kuren, towards another group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has left untouched rich plunder," said Borodaty, hetman of the
      Oumansky kuren, leaving his men and going to the place where the nobleman
      killed by Kukubenko lay. "I have killed seven nobles with my own hand, but
      such spoil I never beheld on any one." Prompted by greed, Borodaty bent
      down to strip off the rich armour, and had already secured the Turkish
      knife set with precious stones, and taken from the foe's belt a purse of
      ducats, and from his breast a silver case containing a maiden's curl,
      cherished tenderly as a love-token. But he heeded not how the red-faced
      cornet, whom he had already once hurled from the saddle and given a good
      blow as a remembrance, flew upon him from behind. The cornet swung his arm
      with all his might, and brought his sword down upon Borodaty's bent neck.
      Greed led to no good: the head rolled off, and the body fell headless,
      sprinkling the earth with blood far and wide; whilst the Cossack soul
      ascended, indignant and surprised at having so soon quitted so stout a
      frame. The cornet had not succeeded in seizing the hetman's head by its
      scalp-lock, and fastening it to his saddle, before an avenger had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a hawk floating in the sky, sweeping in great circles with his mighty
      wings, suddenly remains poised in air, in one spot, and thence darts down
      like an arrow upon the shrieking quail, so Taras's son Ostap darted
      suddenly upon the cornet and flung a rope about his neck with one cast.
      The cornet's red face became a still deeper purple as the cruel noose
      compressed his throat, and he tried to use his pistol; but his
      convulsively quivering hand could not aim straight, and the bullet flew
      wild across the plain. Ostap immediately unfastened a silken cord which
      the cornet carried at his saddle bow to bind prisoners, and having with it
      bound him hand and foot, attached the cord to his saddle and dragged him
      across the field, calling on all the Cossacks of the Oumansky kuren to
      come and render the last honours to their hetman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Oumantzi heard that the hetman of their kuren, Borodaty, was no
      longer among the living, they deserted the field of battle, rushed to
      secure his body, and consulted at once as to whom they should select as
      their leader. At length they said, "But why consult? It is impossible to
      find a better leader than Bulba's son, Ostap; he is younger than all the
      rest of us, it is true; but his judgment is equal to that of the eldest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ostap, taking off his cap, thanked his comrades for the honour, and did
      not decline it on the ground of youth or inexperience, knowing that war
      time is no fitting season for that; but instantly ordered them straight to
      the fray, and soon showed them that not in vain had they chosen him as
      hetman. The Lyakhs felt that the matter was growing too hot for them, and
      retreated across the plain in order to form again at its other end. But
      the little colonel signalled to the reserve of four hundred, stationed at
      the gate, and these rained shot upon the Cossacks. To little purpose,
      however, their shot only taking effect on the Cossack oxen, which were
      gazing wildly upon the battle. The frightened oxen, bellowing with fear,
      dashed into the camp, breaking the line of waggons and trampling on many.
      But Taras, emerging from ambush at the moment with his troops, headed off
      the infuriated cattle, which, startled by his yell, swooped down upon the
      Polish troops, overthrew the cavalry, and crushed and dispersed them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, oxen!" cried the Zaporozhtzi; "you served us on the march, and
      now you serve us in war." And they attacked the foe with fresh vigour
      killing many of the enemy. Several distinguished themselves&mdash;Metelitza
      and Schilo, both of the Pisarenki, Vovtuzenko, and many others. The Lyakhs
      seeing that matters were going badly for them flung away their banners and
      shouted for the city gates to be opened. With a screeching sound the
      iron-bound gates swung open and received the weary and dust-covered
      riders, flocking like sheep into a fold. Many of the Zaporozhtzi would
      have pursued them, but Ostap stopped his Oumantzi, saying, "Farther,
      farther from the walls, brother gentles! it is not well to approach them
      too closely." He spoke truly; for from the ramparts the foe rained and
      poured down everything which came to hand, and many were struck. At that
      moment the Koschevoi came up and congratulated him, saying, "Here is the
      new hetman leading the army like an old one!" Old Bulba glanced round to
      see the new hetman, and beheld Ostap sitting on his horse at the head of
      the Oumantzi, his cap on one side and the hetman's staff in his hand. "Who
      ever saw the like!" he exclaimed; and the old man rejoiced, and began to
      thank all the Oumantzi for the honour they had conferred upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks retired, preparing to go into camp; but the Lyakhs showed
      themselves again on the city ramparts with tattered mantles. Many rich
      caftans were spotted with blood, and dust covered the brazen helmets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you bound us?" cried the Zaporozhtzi to them from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will do so!" shouted the big colonel from above, showing them a rope.
      The weary, dust-covered warriors ceased not to threaten, nor the most
      zealous on both sides to exchange fierce remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all dispersed. Some, weary with battle, stretched themselves out
      to rest; others sprinkled their wounds with earth, and bound them with
      kerchiefs and rich stuffs captured from the enemy. Others, who were
      fresher, began to inspect the corpses and to pay them the last honours.
      They dug graves with swords and spears, brought earth in their caps and
      the skirts of their garments, laid the Cossacks' bodies out decently, and
      covered them up in order that the ravens and eagles might not claw out
      their eyes. But binding the bodies of the Lyakhs, as they came to hand, to
      the tails of horses, they let these loose on the plain, pursuing them and
      beating them for some time. The infuriated horses flew over hill and
      hollow, through ditch and brook, dragging the bodies of the Poles, all
      covered with blood and dust, along the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the kurens sat down in circles in the evening, and talked for a long
      time of their deeds, and of the achievements which had fallen to the share
      of each, for repetition by strangers and posterity. It was long before
      they lay down to sleep; and longer still before old Taras, meditating what
      it might signify that Andrii was not among the foe, lay down. Had the
      Judas been ashamed to come forth against his own countrymen? or had the
      Jew been deceiving him, and had he simply gone into the city against his
      will? But then he recollected that there were no bounds to a woman's
      influence upon Andrii's heart; he felt ashamed, and swore a mighty oath to
      himself against the fair Pole who had bewitched his son. And he would have
      kept his oath. He would not have looked at her beauty; he would have
      dragged her forth by her thick and splendid hair; he would have trailed
      her after him over all the plain, among all the Cossacks. Her beautiful
      shoulders and bosom, white as fresh-fallen snow upon the mountain-tops,
      would have been crushed to earth and covered with blood and dust. Her
      lovely body would have been torn to pieces. But Taras, who did not foresee
      what God prepares for man on the morrow, began to grow drowsy, and finally
      fell asleep. The Cossacks still talked among themselves; and the sober
      sentinel stood all night long beside the fire without blinking and keeping
      a good look out on all sides.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun had not ascended midway in the heavens when all the army assembled
      in a group. News had come from the Setch that during the Cossacks' absence
      the Tatars had plundered it completely, unearthed the treasures which were
      kept concealed in the ground, killed or carried into captivity all who had
      remained behind, and straightway set out, with all the flocks and droves
      of horses they had collected, for Perekop. One Cossack only, Maksin
      Galodukha, had broken loose from the Tatars' hands, stabbed the Mirza,
      seized his bag of sequins, and on a Tatar horse, in Tatar garments, had
      fled from his pursuers for two nights and a day and a half, ridden his
      horse to death, obtained another, killed that one too, and arrived at the
      Zaporozhian camp upon a third, having learned upon the road that the
      Zaporozhtzi were before Dubno. He could only manage to tell them that this
      misfortune had taken place; but as to how it happened&mdash;whether the
      remaining Zaporozhtzi had been carousing after Cossack fashion, and had
      been carried drunk into captivity, and how the Tatars were aware of the
      spot where the treasures of the army were concealed&mdash;he was too
      exhausted to say. Extremely fatigued, his body swollen, and his face
      scorched and weatherbeaten, he had fallen down, and a deep sleep had
      overpowered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such cases it was customary for the Cossacks to pursue the robbers at
      once, endeavouring to overtake them on the road; for, let the prisoners
      once be got to the bazaars of Asia Minor, Smyrna, or the island of Crete,
      and God knows in what places the tufted heads of Zaporozhtzi might not be
      seen. This was the occasion of the Cossacks' assembling. They all stood to
      a man with their caps on; for they had not met to listen to the commands
      of their hetman, but to take counsel together as equals among equals. "Let
      the old men first advise," was shouted to the crowd. "Let the Koschevoi
      give his opinion," cried others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Koschevoi, taking off his cap and speaking not as commander, but as a
      comrade among comrades, thanked all the Cossacks for the honour, and said,
      "There are among us many experienced men and much wisdom; but since you
      have thought me worthy, my counsel is not to lose time in pursuing the
      Tatars, for you know yourselves what the Tatar is. He will not pause with
      his stolen booty to await our coming, but will vanish in a twinkling, so
      that you can find no trace of him. Therefore my advice is to go. We have
      had good sport here. The Lyakhs now know what Cossacks are. We have
      avenged our faith to the extent of our ability; there is not much to
      satisfy greed in the famished city, and so my advice is to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To go," rang heavily through the Zaporozhian kurens. But such words did
      not suit Taras Bulba at all; and he brought his frowning, iron-grey brows
      still lower down over his eyes, brows like bushes growing on dark mountain
      heights, whose crowns are suddenly covered with sharp northern frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Koschevoi, your counsel is not good," said he. "You cannot say that.
      You have evidently forgotten that those of our men captured by the Lyakhs
      will remain prisoners. You evidently wish that we should not heed the
      first holy law of comradeship; that we should leave our brethren to be
      flayed alive, or carried about through the towns and villages after their
      Cossack bodies have been quartered, as was done with the hetman and the
      bravest Russian warriors in the Ukraine. Have the enemy not desecrated the
      holy things sufficiently without that? What are we? I ask you all what
      sort of a Cossack is he who would desert his comrade in misfortune, and
      let him perish like a dog in a foreign land? If it has come to such a pass
      that no one has any confidence in Cossack honour, permitting men to spit
      upon his grey moustache, and upbraid him with offensive words, then let no
      one blame me; I will remain here alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Zaporozhtzi who were there wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you forgotten, brave comrades," said the Koschevoi, "that the
      Tatars also have comrades of ours in their hands; that if we do not rescue
      them now their lives will be sacrificed in eternal imprisonment among the
      infidels, which is worse than the most cruel death? Have you forgotten
      that they now hold all our treasure, won by Christian blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks reflected, not knowing what to say. None of them wished to
      deserve ill repute. Then there stepped out in front of them the oldest in
      years of all the Zaporozhian army, Kasyan Bovdug. He was respected by all
      the Cossacks. Twice had he been chosen Koschevoi, and had also been a
      stout warrior; but he had long been old, and had ceased to go upon raids.
      Neither did the old man like to give advice to any one; but loved to lie
      upon his side in the circle of Cossacks, listening to tales of every
      occurrence on the Cossack marches. He never joined in the conversation,
      but only listened, and pressed the ashes with his finger in his short
      pipe, which never left his mouth; and would sit so long with his eyes half
      open, that the Cossacks never knew whether he were asleep or still
      listening. He always stayed at home during their raids, but this time the
      old man had joined the army. He had waved his hand in Cossack fashion, and
      said, "Wherever you go, I am going too; perhaps I may be of some service
      to the Cossack nation." All the Cossacks became silent when he now stepped
      forward before the assembly, for it was long since any speech from him had
      been heard. Every one wanted to know what Bovdug had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my turn to speak a word, brother gentles," he began: "listen, my
      children, to an old man. The Koschevoi spoke well as the head of the
      Cossack army; being bound to protect it, and in respect to the treasures
      of the army he could say nothing wiser. That is so! Let that be my first
      remark; but now listen to my second. And this is my second remark: Taras
      spoke even more truly. God grant him many years, and that such leaders may
      be plentiful in the Ukraine! A Cossack's first duty and honour is to guard
      comradeship. Never in all my life, brother gentles, have I heard of any
      Cossack deserting or betraying any of his comrades. Both those made
      captive at the Setch and these taken here are our comrades. Whether they
      be few or many, it makes no difference; all are our comrades, and all are
      dear to us. So this is my speech: Let those to whom the prisoners captured
      by the Tatars are dear set out after the Tatars; and let those to whom the
      captives of the Poles are dear, and who do not care to desert a righteous
      cause, stay behind. The Koschevoi, in accordance with his duty, will
      accompany one half in pursuit of the Tatars, and the other half can choose
      a hetman to lead them. But if you will heed the words of an old man, there
      is no man fitter to be the commanding hetman than Taras Bulba. Not one of
      us is his equal in heroism."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke Bovdug, and paused; and all the Cossacks rejoiced that the old
      man had in this manner brought them to an agreement. All flung up their
      caps and shouted, "Thanks, father! He kept silence for a long, long time,
      but he has spoken at last. Not in vain did he say, when we prepared for
      this expedition, that he might be useful to the Cossack nation: even so it
      has come to pass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, are you agreed upon anything?" asked the Koschevoi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all agreed!" cried the Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the council is at an end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At an end!" cried the Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then listen to the military command, children," said the Koschevoi,
      stepping forward, and putting on his cap; whilst all the Cossacks took off
      theirs, and stood with uncovered heads, and with eyes fixed upon the
      earth, as was always the custom among them when the leader prepared to
      speak. "Now divide yourselves, brother gentles! Let those who wish to go
      stand on the right, and those who wish to stay, on the left. Where the
      majority of a kuren goes there its officers are to go: if the minority of
      a kuren goes over, it must be added to another kuren."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they began to take up their positions, some to the right and some to
      the left. Whither the majority of a kuren went thither the hetman went
      also; and the minority attached itself to another kuren. It came out
      pretty even on both sides. Those who wished to remain were nearly the
      whole of the Nezamaikovsky kuren, the entire Oumansky kuren, the entire
      Kanevsky kuren, and the larger half of the Popovitchsky, the Timoschevsky
      and the Steblikivsky kurens. All the rest preferred to go in pursuit of
      the Tatars. On both sides there were many stout and brave Cossacks. Among
      those who decided to follow the Tatars were Tcherevaty, and those good old
      Cossacks Pokotipole, Lemisch, and Prokopovitch Koma. Demid Popovitch also
      went with that party, because he could not sit long in one place: he had
      tried his hand on the Lyakhs and wanted to try it on the Tatars also. The
      hetmans of kurens were Nostiugan, Pokruischka, Nevnimsky, and numerous
      brave and renowned Cossacks who wished to test their swords and muscles in
      an encounter with the Tatars. There were likewise many brave Cossacks
      among those who preferred to remain, including the kuren hetmans,
      Demitrovitch, Kukubenko, Vertikhvist, Balan, and Ostap Bulba. Besides
      these there were plenty of stout and distinguished warriors: Vovtuzenko,
      Tcherevitchenko, Stepan Guska, Okhrim Guska, Vikola Gonstiy, Zadorozhniy,
      Metelitza, Ivan Zakrutiguba, Mosiy Pisarenko, and still another Pisarenko,
      and many others. They were all great travellers; they had visited the
      shores of Anatolia, the salt marshes and steppes of the Crimea, all the
      rivers great and small which empty into the Dnieper, and all the fords and
      islands of the Dnieper; they had been in Moldavia, Wallachia, and Turkey;
      they had sailed all over the Black Sea, in their double-ruddered Cossack
      boats; they had attacked with fifty skiffs in line the tallest and richest
      ships; they had sunk many a Turkish galley, and had burnt much, very much
      powder in their day; more than once they had made foot-bandages from
      velvets and rich stuffs; more than once they had beaten buckles for their
      girdles out of sequins. Every one of them had drunk and revelled away what
      would have sufficed any other for a whole lifetime, and had nothing to
      show for it. They spent it all, like Cossacks, in treating all the world,
      and in hiring music that every one might be merry. Even now few of them
      had amassed any property: some caskets, cups, and bracelets were hidden
      beneath the reeds on the islands of the Dnieper in order that the Tatars
      might not find them if by mishap they should succeed in falling suddenly
      on the Setch; but it would have been difficult for the Tatars to find
      them, for the owners themselves had forgotten where they had buried them.
      Such were the Cossacks who wished to remain and take vengeance on the
      Lyakhs for their trusty comrades and the faith of Christ. The old Cossack
      Bovdug wished also to remain with them, saying, "I am not of an age to
      pursue the Tatars, but this is a place to meet a good Cossack death. I
      have long prayed God that when my life was to end I might end it in battle
      for a holy and Christian cause. And so it has come to pass. There can be
      no more glorious end in any other place for the aged Cossack."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had all separated, and were ranged in two lines on opposite
      sides, the Koschevoi passed through the ranks, and said, "Well, brother
      gentles, are the two parties satisfied with each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All satisfied, father!" replied the Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then kiss each other, and bid each other farewell; for God knows whether
      you will ever see each other alive again. Obey your hetman, but you know
      yourselves what you have to do: you know yourselves what Cossack honour
      requires."
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the Cossacks kissed each other. The hetmans first began it.
      Stroking down their grey moustaches, they kissed each other, making the
      sign of the cross, and then, grasping hands firmly, wanted to ask of each
      other, "Well, brother, shall we see one another again or not?" But they
      did not ask the question: they kept silence, and both grey-heads were lost
      in thought. Then the Cossacks took leave of each other to the last man,
      knowing that there was a great deal of work before them all. Yet they were
      not obliged to part at once: they would have to wait until night in order
      not to let the Lyakhs perceive the diminution in the Cossack army. Then
      all went off, by kurens, to dine.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, all who had the prospect of the journey before them lay down
      to rest, and fell into a deep and long sleep, as though foreseeing that it
      was the last sleep they should enjoy in such security. They slept even
      until sunset; and when the sun had gone down and it had grown somewhat
      dusky, began to tar the waggons. All being in readiness, they sent the
      waggons ahead, and having pulled off their caps once more to their
      comrades, quietly followed the baggage train. The cavalry, without shouts
      or whistles to the horses, tramped lightly after the foot-soldiers, and
      all soon vanished in the darkness. The only sound was the dull thud of
      horses' hoofs, or the squeak of some wheel which had not got into working
      order, or had not been properly tarred amid the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their comrades stood for some time waving their hands, though nothing was
      visible. But when they returned to their camping places and saw by the
      light of the gleaming stars that half the waggons were gone, and many of
      their comrades, each man's heart grew sad; all became involuntarily
      pensive, and drooped their heads towards the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras saw how troubled were the Cossack ranks, and that sadness, unsuited
      to brave men, had begun to quietly master the Cossack hearts; but he
      remained silent. He wished to give them time to become accustomed to the
      melancholy caused by their parting from their comrades; but, meanwhile, he
      was preparing to rouse them at one blow, by a loud battle-cry in Cossack
      fashion, in order that good cheer might return to the soul of each with
      greater strength than before. Of this only the Slav nature, a broad,
      powerful nature, which is to others what the sea is to small rivulets, is
      capable. In stormy times it roars and thunders, raging, and raising such
      waves as weak rivers cannot throw up; but when it is windless and quiet,
      it spreads its boundless glassy surface, clearer than any river, a
      constant delight to the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras ordered his servants to unload one of the waggons which stood apart.
      It was larger and stronger than any other in the Cossack camp; two stout
      tires encircled its mighty wheels. It was heavily laden, covered with
      horsecloths and strong wolf-skins, and firmly bound with tightly drawn
      tarred ropes. In the waggon were flasks and casks of good old wine, which
      had long lain in Taras's cellar. He had brought it along, in case a moment
      should arrive when some deed awaited them worthy of being handed down to
      posterity, so that each Cossack, to the very last man, might quaff it, and
      be inspired with sentiments fitting to the occasion. On receiving his
      command, the servants hastened to the waggon, hewed asunder the stout
      ropes with their swords, removed the thick wolf-skins and horsecloths, and
      drew forth the flasks and casks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take them all," said Bulba, "all there are; take them, that every one may
      be supplied. Take jugs, or the pails for watering the horses; take sleeve
      or cap; but if you have nothing else, then hold your two hands under."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Cossacks seized something: one took a jug, another a pail, another
      a sleeve, another a cap, and another held both hands. Taras's servants,
      making their way among the ranks, poured out for all from the casks and
      flasks. But Taras ordered them not to drink until he should give the
      signal for all to drink together. It was evident that he wished to say
      something. He knew that however good in itself the wine might be and
      however fitted to strengthen the spirit of man, yet, if a suitable speech
      were linked with it, then the strength of the wine and of the spirit would
      be doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I treat you, brother gentles," thus spoke Bulba, "not in honour of your
      having made me hetman, however great such an honour may be, nor in honour
      of our parting from our comrades. To do both would be fitting at a fitting
      time; but the moment before us is not such a time. The work before us is
      great both in labour and in glory for the Cossacks. Therefore let us drink
      all together, let us drink before all else to the holy orthodox faith,
      that the day may finally come when it may be spread over all the world,
      and that everywhere there may be but one faith, and that all Mussulmans
      may become Christians. And let us also drink together to the Setch, that
      it may stand long for the ruin of the Mussulmans, and that every year
      there may issue forth from it young men, each better, each handsomer than
      the other. And let us drink to our own glory, that our grandsons and their
      sons may say that there were once men who were not ashamed of comradeship,
      and who never betrayed each other. Now to the faith, brother gentles, to
      the faith!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the faith!" cried those standing in the ranks hard by, with thick
      voices. "To the faith!" those more distant took up the cry; and all, both
      young and old, drank to the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Setch!" said Taras, raising his hand high above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Setch!" echoed the foremost ranks. "To the Setch!" said the old
      men, softly, twitching their grey moustaches; and eagerly as young hawks,
      the youths repeated, "To the Setch!" And the distant plain heard how the
      Cossacks mentioned their Setch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now a last draught, comrades, to the glory of all Christians now living
      in the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And every Cossack drank a last draught to the glory of all Christians in
      the world. And among all the ranks in the kurens they long repeated, "To
      all the Christians in the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pails were empty, but the Cossacks still stood with their hands
      uplifted. Although the eyes of all gleamed brightly with the wine, they
      were thinking deeply. Not of greed or the spoils of war were they thinking
      now, nor of who would be lucky enough to get ducats, fine weapons,
      embroidered caftans, and Tcherkessian horses; but they meditated like
      eagles perched upon the rocky crests of mountains, from which the distant
      sea is visible, dotted, as with tiny birds, with galleys, ships, and every
      sort of vessel, bounded only by the scarcely visible lines of shore, with
      their ports like gnats and their forests like fine grass. Like eagles they
      gazed out on all the plain, with their fate darkling in the distance. All
      the plain, with its slopes and roads, will be covered with their white
      projecting bones, lavishly washed with their Cossack blood, and strewn
      with shattered waggons and with broken swords and spears; the eagles will
      swoop down and tear out their Cossack eyes. But there is one grand
      advantage: not a single noble deed will be lost, and the Cossack glory
      will not vanish like the tiniest grain of powder from a gun-barrel. The
      guitar-player with grey beard falling upon his breast, and perhaps a
      white-headed old man still full of ripe, manly strength will come, and
      will speak his low, strong words of them. And their glory will resound
      through all the world, and all who are born thereafter will speak of them;
      for the word of power is carried afar, ringing like a booming brazen bell,
      in which the maker has mingled much rich, pure silver, that is beautiful
      sound may be borne far and wide through the cities, villages, huts, and
      palaces, summoning all betimes to holy prayer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the city, no one knew that one-half of the Cossacks had gone in pursuit
      of the Tatars. From the tower of the town hall the sentinel only perceived
      that a part of the waggons had been dragged into the forest; but it was
      thought that the Cossacks were preparing an ambush&mdash;a view taken by
      the French engineer also. Meanwhile, the Koschevoi's words proved not
      unfounded, for a scarcity of provisions arose in the city. According to a
      custom of past centuries, the army did not separate as much as was
      necessary. They tried to make a sortie; but half of those who did so were
      instantly killed by the Cossacks, and the other half driven back into the
      city with no results. But the Jews availed themselves of the opportunity
      to find out everything; whither and why the Zaporozhtzi had departed, and
      with what leaders, and which particular kurens, and their number, and how
      many had remained on the spot, and what they intended to do; in short,
      within a few minutes all was known in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The besieged took courage, and prepared to offer battle. Taras had already
      divined it from the noise and movement in the city, and hastened about,
      making his arrangements, forming his men, and giving orders and
      instructions. He ranged the kurens in three camps, surrounding them with
      the waggons as bulwarks&mdash;a formation in which the Zaporozhtzi were
      invincible&mdash;ordered two kurens into ambush, and drove sharp stakes,
      broken guns, and fragments of spears into a part of the plain, with a view
      to forcing the enemy's cavalry upon it if an opportunity should present
      itself. When all was done which was necessary, he made a speech to the
      Cossacks, not for the purpose of encouraging and freshening up their
      spirits&mdash;he knew their souls were strong without that&mdash;but
      simply because he wished to tell them all he had upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to tell you, brother gentles, what our brotherhood is. You have
      heard from your fathers and grandfathers in what honour our land has
      always been held by all. We made ourselves known to the Greeks, and we
      took gold from Constantinople, and our cities were luxurious, and we had,
      too, our temples, and our princes&mdash;the princes of the Russian people,
      our own princes, not Catholic unbelievers. But the Mussulmans took all;
      all vanished, and we remained defenceless; yea, like a widow after the
      death of a powerful husband: defenceless was our land as well as
      ourselves! Such was the time, comrades, when we joined hands in a
      brotherhood: that is what our fellowship consists in. There is no more
      sacred brotherhood. The father loves his children, the mother loves her
      children, the children love their father and mother; but this is not like
      that, brothers. The wild beast also loves its young. But a man can be
      related only by similarity of mind and not of blood. There have been
      brotherhoods in other lands, but never any such brotherhoods as on our
      Russian soil. It has happened to many of you to be in foreign lands. You
      look: there are people there also, God's creatures, too; and you talk with
      them as with the men of your own country. But when it comes to saying a
      hearty word&mdash;you will see. No! they are sensible people, but not the
      same; the same kind of people, and yet not the same! No, brothers, to love
      as the Russian soul loves, is to love not with the mind or anything else,
      but with all that God has given, all that is within you. Ah!" said Taras,
      and waved his hand, and wiped his grey head, and twitched his moustache,
      and then went on: "No, no one else can love in that way! I know that
      baseness has now made its way into our land. Men care only to have their
      ricks of grain and hay, and their droves of horses, and that their mead
      may be safe in their cellars; they adopt, the devil only knows what
      Mussulman customs. They speak scornfully with their tongues. They care not
      to speak their real thoughts with their own countrymen. They sell their
      own things to their own comrades, like soulless creatures in the
      market-place. The favour of a foreign king, and not even a king, but the
      poor favour of a Polish magnate, who beats them on the mouth with his
      yellow shoe, is dearer to them than all brotherhood. But the very meanest
      of these vile men, whoever he may be, given over though he be to vileness
      and slavishness, even he, brothers, has some grains of Russian feeling;
      and they will assert themselves some day. And then the wretched man will
      beat his breast with his hands; and will tear his hair, cursing his vile
      life loudly, and ready to expiate his disgraceful deeds with torture. Let
      them know what brotherhood means on Russian soil! And if it has come to
      the point that a man must die for his brotherhood, it is not fit that any
      of them should die so. No! none of them. It is not a fit thing for their
      mouse-like natures."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke the hetman; and after he had finished his speech he still
      continued to shake his head, which had grown grey in Cossack service. All
      who stood there were deeply affected by his speech, which went to their
      very hearts. The oldest in the ranks stood motionless, their grey heads
      drooping. Tears trickled quietly from their aged eyes; they wiped them
      slowly away with their sleeves, and then all, as if with one consent,
      waved their hands in the air at the same moment, and shook their
      experienced heads. For it was evident that old Taras recalled to them many
      of the best-known and finest traits of the heart in a man who has become
      wise through suffering, toil, daring, and every earthly misfortune, or,
      though unknown to them, of many things felt by young, pure spirits, to the
      eternal joy of the parents who bore them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the army of the enemy was already marching out of the city, sounding
      drums and trumpets; and the nobles, with their arms akimbo, were riding
      forth too, surrounded by innumerable servants. The stout colonel gave his
      orders, and they began to advance briskly on the Cossack camps, pointing
      their matchlocks threateningly. Their eyes flashed, and they were
      brilliant with brass armour. As soon as the Cossacks saw that they had
      come within gunshot, their matchlocks thundered all together, and they
      continued to fire without cessation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detonations resounded through the distant fields and meadows, merging
      into one continuous roar. The whole plain was shrouded in smoke, but the
      Zaporozhtzi continued to fire without drawing breath&mdash;the rear ranks
      doing nothing but loading the guns and handing them to those in front,
      thus creating amazement among the enemy, who could not understand how the
      Cossacks fired without reloading. Amid the dense smoke which enveloped
      both armies, it could not be seen how first one and then another dropped:
      but the Lyakhs felt that the balls flew thickly, and that the affair was
      growing hot; and when they retreated to escape from the smoke and see how
      matters stood, many were missing from their ranks, but only two or three
      out of a hundred were killed on the Cossack side. Still the Cossacks went
      on firing off their matchlocks without a moment's intermission. Even the
      foreign engineers were amazed at tactics heretofore unknown to them, and
      said then and there, in the presence of all, "These Zaporozhtzi are brave
      fellows. That is the way men in other lands ought to fight." And they
      advised that the cannons should at once be turned on the camps. Heavily
      roared the iron cannons with their wide throats; the earth hummed and
      trembled far and wide, and the smoke lay twice as heavy over the plain.
      They smelt the reek of the powder among the squares and streets in the
      most distant as well as the nearest quarters of the city. But those who
      laid the cannons pointed them too high, and the shot describing too wide a
      curve flew over the heads of the camps, and buried themselves deep in the
      earth at a distance, tearing the ground, and throwing the black soil high
      in the air. At the sight of such lack of skill the French engineer tore
      his hair, and undertook to lay the cannons himself, heeding not the
      Cossack bullets which showered round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras saw from afar that destruction menaced the whole Nezamaikovsky and
      Steblikivsky kurens, and gave a ringing shout, "Get away from the waggons
      instantly, and mount your horses!" But the Cossacks would not have
      succeeded in effecting both these movements if Ostap had not dashed into
      the middle of the foe and wrenched the linstocks from six cannoneers. But
      he could not wrench them from the other four, for the Lyakhs drove him
      back. Meanwhile the foreign captain had taken the lunt in his own hand to
      fire the largest cannon, such a cannon as none of the Cossacks had ever
      beheld before. It looked horrible with its wide mouth, and a thousand
      deaths poured forth from it. And as it thundered, the three others
      followed, shaking in fourfold earthquake the dully responsive earth. Much
      woe did they cause. For more than one Cossack wailed the aged mother,
      beating with bony hands her feeble breast; more than one widow was left in
      Glukhof, Nemirof, Chernigof, and other cities. The loving woman will
      hasten forth every day to the bazaar, grasping at all passers-by, scanning
      the face of each to see if there be not among them one dearer than all;
      but though many an army will pass through the city, never among them will
      a single one of all their dearest be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half the Nezamaikovsky kuren was as if it had never been. As the hail
      suddenly beats down a field where every ear of grain shines like purest
      gold, so were they beaten down.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the Cossacks hastened thither! How they all started up! How raged
      Kukubenko, the hetman, when he saw that the best half of his kuren was no
      more! He fought his way with his remaining Nezamaikovtzi to the very midst
      of the fray, cut down in his wrath, like a cabbage, the first man he met,
      hurled many a rider from his steed, piercing both horse and man with his
      lance; and making his way to the gunners, captured some of the cannons.
      Here he found the hetman of the Oumansky kuren, and Stepan Guska, hard at
      work, having already seized the largest cannon. He left those Cossacks
      there, and plunged with his own into another mass of the foe, making a
      lane through it. Where the Nezamaikovtzi passed there was a street; where
      they turned about there was a square as where streets meet. The foemen's
      ranks were visibly thinning, and the Lyakhs falling in sheaves. Beside the
      waggons stood Vovtuzenko, and in front Tcherevitchenko, and by the more
      distant ones Degtyarenko; and behind them the kuren hetman, Vertikhvist.
      Degtyarenko had pierced two Lyakhs with his spear, and now attacked a
      third, a stout antagonist. Agile and strong was the Lyakh, with glittering
      arms, and accompanied by fifty followers. He fell fiercely upon
      Degtyarenko, struck him to the earth, and, flourishing his sword above
      him, cried, "There is not one of you Cossack dogs who has dared to oppose
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is one," said Mosiy Schilo, and stepped forward. He was a muscular
      Cossack, who had often commanded at sea, and undergone many vicissitudes.
      The Turks had once seized him and his men at Trebizond, and borne them
      captives to the galleys, where they bound them hand and foot with iron
      chains, gave them no food for a week at a time, and made them drink
      sea-water. The poor prisoners endured and suffered all, but would not
      renounce their orthodox faith. Their hetman, Mosiy Schilo, could not bear
      it: he trampled the Holy Scriptures under foot, wound the vile turban
      about his sinful head, and became the favourite of a pasha, steward of a
      ship, and ruler over all the galley slaves. The poor slaves sorrowed
      greatly thereat, for they knew that if he had renounced his faith he would
      be a tyrant, and his hand would be the more heavy and severe upon them. So
      it turned out. Mosiy Schilo had them put in new chains, three to an oar.
      The cruel fetters cut to the very bone; and he beat them upon the back.
      But when the Turks, rejoicing at having obtained such a servant, began to
      carouse, and, forgetful of their law, got all drunk, he distributed all
      the sixty-four keys among the prisoners, in order that they might free
      themselves, fling their chains and manacles into the sea, and, seizing
      their swords, in turn kill the Turks. Then the Cossacks collected great
      booty, and returned with glory to their country; and the guitar-players
      celebrated Mosiy Schilo's exploits for a long time. They would have
      elected him Koschevoi, but he was a very eccentric Cossack. At one time he
      would perform some feat which the most sagacious would never have dreamed
      of. At another, folly simply took possession of him, and he drank and
      squandered everything away, was in debt to every one in the Setch, and, in
      addition to that, stole like a street thief. He carried off a whole
      Cossack equipment from a strange kuren by night and pawned it to the
      tavern-keeper. For this dishonourable act they bound him to a post in the
      bazaar, and laid a club beside him, in order that every one who passed
      should, according to the measure of his strength, deal him a blow. But
      there was not one Zaporozhetz out of them all to be found who would raise
      the club against him, remembering his former services. Such was the
      Cossack, Mosiy Schilo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is one who will kill you, dog!" he said, springing upon the Lyakh.
      How they hacked away! their shoulder-plates and breast-plates bent under
      their blows. The hostile Lyakh cut through Schilo's shirt of mail,
      reaching the body itself with his blade. The Cossack's shirt was dyed
      purple: but Schilo heeded it not. He brandished his brawny hand, heavy
      indeed was that mighty fist, and brought the pommel of his sword down
      unexpectedly upon his foeman's head. The brazen helmet flew into pieces
      and the Lyakh staggered and fell; but Schilo went on hacking and cutting
      gashes in the body of the stunned man. Kill not utterly thine enemy,
      Cossack: look back rather! The Cossack did not turn, and one of the dead
      man's servants plunged a knife into his neck. Schilo turned and tried to
      seize him, but he disappeared amid the smoke of the powder. On all sides
      rose the roar of matchlocks. Schilo knew that his wound was mortal. He
      fell with his hand upon his wound, and said, turning to his comrades,
      "Farewell, brother gentles, my comrades! may the holy Russian land stand
      forever, and may it be eternally honoured!" And as he closed his failing
      eyes, the Cossack soul fled from his grim body. Then Zadorozhniy came
      forward with his men, Vertikhvist issued from the ranks, and Balaban
      stepped forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What now, gentles?" said Taras, calling to the hetmans by name: "there is
      yet powder in the power-flasks? The Cossack force is not weakened? the
      Cossacks do not yield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is yet powder in the flasks, father; the Cossack force is not
      weakened yet: the Cossacks yield not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Cossacks pressed vigorously on: the foemen's ranks were
      disordered. The short colonel beat the assembly, and ordered eight painted
      standards to be displayed to collect his men, who were scattered over all
      the plain. All the Lyakhs hastened to the standards. But they had not yet
      succeeded in ranging themselves in order, when the hetman Kukubenko
      attacked their centre again with his Nezamaikovtzi and fell straight upon
      the stout colonel. The colonel could not resist the attack, and, wheeling
      his horse about, set out at a gallop; but Kukubenko pursued him for a
      considerable distance cross the plain and prevented him from joining his
      regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving this from the kuren on the flank, Stepan Guska set out after
      him, lasso in hand, bending his head to his horse's neck. Taking advantage
      of an opportunity, he cast his lasso about his neck at the first attempt.
      The colonel turned purple in the face, grasped the cord with both hands,
      and tried to break it; but with a powerful thrust Stepan drove his lance
      through his body, and there he remained pinned to the earth. But Guska did
      not escape his fate. The Cossacks had but time to look round when they
      beheld Stepan Guska elevated on four spears. All the poor fellow succeeded
      in saying was, "May all our enemies perish, and may the Russian land
      rejoice forever!" and then he yielded up his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks glanced around, and there was Metelitza on one side,
      entertaining the Lyakhs by dealing blows on the head to one and another;
      on the other side, the hetman Nevelitchkiy was attacking with his men; and
      Zakrutibuga was repulsing and slaying the enemy by the waggons. The third
      Pisarenko had repulsed a whole squadron from the more distant waggons; and
      they were still fighting and killing amongst the other waggons, and even
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, gentles?" cried Taras, stepping forward before them all: "is
      there still powder in your flasks? Is the Cossack force still strong? do
      the Cossacks yield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is still powder in the flasks, father; the Cossack force is still
      strong: the Cossacks yield not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bovdug had already fallen from the waggons; a bullet had struck him
      just below the heart. The old man collected all his strength, and said, "I
      sorrow not to part from the world. God grant every man such an end! May
      the Russian land be forever glorious!" And Bovdug's spirit flew above, to
      tell the old men who had gone on long before that men still knew how to
      fight on Russian soil, and better still, that they knew how to die for it
      and the holy faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaban, hetman of a kuren, soon after fell to the ground also from a
      waggon. Three mortal wounds had he received from a lance, a bullet, and a
      sword. He had been one of the very best of Cossacks, and had accomplished
      a great deal as a commander on naval expeditions; but more glorious than
      all the rest was his raid on the shores of Anatolia. They collected many
      sequins, much valuable Turkish plunder, caftans, and adornments of every
      description. But misfortune awaited them on their way back. They came
      across the Turkish fleet, and were fired on by the ships. Half the boats
      were crushed and overturned, drowning more than one; but the bundles of
      reeds bound to the sides, Cossack fashion, saved the boats from completely
      sinking. Balaban rowed off at full speed, and steered straight in the face
      of the sun, thus rendering himself invisible to the Turkish ships. All the
      following night they spent in baling out the water with pails and their
      caps, and in repairing the damaged places. They made sails out of their
      Cossack trousers, and, sailing off, escaped from the fastest Turkish
      vessels. And not only did they arrive unharmed at the Setch, but they
      brought a gold-embroidered vesture for the archimandrite at the
      Mezhigorsky Monastery in Kief, and an ikon frame of pure silver for the
      church in honour of the Intercession of the Virgin Mary, which is in
      Zaporozhe. The guitar-players celebrated the daring of Balaban and his
      Cossacks for a long time afterwards. Now he bowed his head, feeling the
      pains which precede death, and said quietly, "I am permitted, brother
      gentles, to die a fine death. Seven have I hewn in pieces, nine have I
      pierced with my lance, many have I trampled upon with my horse's hoofs;
      and I no longer remember how many my bullets have slain. May our Russian
      land flourish forever!" and his spirit fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cossacks, Cossacks! abandon not the flower of your army. Already was
      Kukubenko surrounded, and seven men only remained of all the Nezamaikovsky
      kuren, exhausted and with garments already stained with their blood. Taras
      himself, perceiving their straits, hastened to their rescue; but the
      Cossacks arrived too late. Before the enemies who surrounded him could be
      driven off, a spear was buried just below Kukubenko's heart. He sank into
      the arms of the Cossacks who caught him, and his young blood flowed in a
      stream, like precious wine brought from the cellar in a glass vessel by
      careless servants, who, stumbling at the entrance, break the rich flask.
      The wine streams over the ground, and the master, hastening up, tears his
      hair, having reserved it, in order that if God should grant him, in his
      old age, to meet again the comrade of his youth, they might over it recall
      together former days, when a man enjoyed himself otherwise and better than
      now. Kukubenko cast his eyes around, and said, "I thank God that it has
      been my lot to die before your eyes, comrades. May they live better who
      come after us than we have lived; and may our Russian land, beloved by
      Christ, flourish forever!" and his young spirit fled. The angels took it
      in their arms and bore it to heaven: it will be well with him there. "Sit
      down at my right hand, Kukubenko," Christ will say to him: "you never
      betrayed your comrades, you never committed a dishonourable act, you never
      sold a man into misery, you preserved and defended my church." The death
      of Kukubenko saddened them all. The Cossack ranks were terribly thinned.
      Many brave men were missing, but the Cossacks still stood their ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, gentles," cried Taras to the remaining kurens: "is there still
      powder in your flasks? Are your swords blunted? Are the Cossack forces
      wearied? Have the Cossacks given way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is still an abundance of powder; our swords are still sharp; the
      Cossack forces are not wearied, and the Cossacks have not yet yielded."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Cossacks again strained every nerve, as though they had suffered
      no loss. Only three kuren hetmans still remained alive. Red blood flowed
      in streams everywhere; heaps of their bodies and of those of the enemy
      were piled high. Taras looked up to heaven, and there already hovered a
      flock of vultures. Well, there would be prey for some one. And there the
      foe were raising Metelitza on their lances, and the head of the second
      Pisarenko was dizzily opening and shutting its eyes; and the mangled body
      of Okhrim Guska fell upon the ground. "Now," said Taras, and waved a cloth
      on high. Ostap understood this signal and springing quickly from his
      ambush attacked sharply. The Lyakhs could not withstand this onslaught;
      and he drove them back, and chased them straight to the spot where the
      stakes and fragments of spears were driven into the earth. The horses
      began to stumble and fall and the Lyakhs to fly over their heads. At that
      moment the Korsuntzi, who had stood till the last by the baggage waggons,
      perceived that they still had some bullets left, and suddenly fired a
      volley from their matchlocks. The Lyakhs became confused, and lost their
      presence of mind; and the Cossacks took courage. "The victory is ours!"
      rang Cossack voices on all sides; the trumpets sounded and the banner of
      victory was unfurled. The beaten Lyakhs ran in all directions and hid
      themselves. "No, the victory is not yet complete," said Taras, glancing at
      the city gate; and he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates opened, and out dashed a hussar band, the flower of all the
      cavalry. Every rider was mounted on a matched brown horse from the
      Kabardei; and in front rode the handsomest, the most heroic of them all.
      His black hair streamed from beneath his brazen helmet; and from his arm
      floated a rich scarf, embroidered by the hands of a peerless beauty. Taras
      sprang back in horror when he saw that it was Andrii. And the latter
      meanwhile, enveloped in the dust and heat of battle, eager to deserve the
      scarf which had been bound as a gift upon his arm, flew on like a
      greyhound; the handsomest, most agile, and youngest of all the band. The
      experienced huntsman urges on the greyhound, and he springs forward,
      tossing up the snow, and a score of times outrunning the hare, in the
      ardour of his course. And so it was with Andrii. Old Taras paused and
      observed how he cleared a path before him, hewing away and dealing blows
      to the right and the left. Taras could not restrain himself, but shouted:
      "Your comrades! your comrades! you devil's brat, would you kill your own
      comrades?" But Andrii distinguished not who stood before him, comrades or
      strangers; he saw nothing. Curls, long curls, were what he saw; and a
      bosom like that of a river swan, and a snowy neck and shoulders, and all
      that is created for rapturous kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey there, lads! only draw him to the forest, entice him to the forest
      for me!" shouted Taras. Instantly thirty of the smartest Cossacks
      volunteered to entice him thither; and setting their tall caps firmly
      spurred their horses straight at a gap in the hussars. They attacked the
      front ranks in flank, beat them down, cut them off from the rear ranks,
      and slew many of them. Golopuitenko struck Andrii on the back with his
      sword, and immediately set out to ride away at the top of his speed. How
      Andrii flew after him! How his young blood coursed through all his veins!
      Driving his sharp spurs into his horse's flanks, he tore along after the
      Cossacks, never glancing back, and not perceiving that only twenty men at
      the most were following him. The Cossacks fled at full gallop, and
      directed their course straight for the forest. Andrii overtook them, and
      was on the point of catching Golopuitenko, when a powerful hand seized his
      horse's bridle. Andrii looked; before him stood Taras! He trembled all
      over, and turned suddenly pale, like a student who, receiving a blow on
      the forehead with a ruler, flushes up like fire, springs in wrath from his
      seat to chase his comrade, and suddenly encounters his teacher entering
      the classroom; in the instant his wrathful impulse calms down and his
      futile anger vanishes. In this wise, in an instant, Andrii's wrath was as
      if it had never existed. And he beheld before him only his terrible
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what are we going to do now?" said Taras, looking him straight in
      the eyes. But Andrii could make no reply to this, and stood with his eyes
      fixed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, son; did your Lyakhs help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrii made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think that you should be such a traitor! that you should betray your
      faith! betray your comrades! Dismount from your horse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedient as a child, he dismounted, and stood before Taras more dead than
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand still, do not move! I gave you life, I will also kill you!" said
      Taras, and, retreating a step backwards, he brought his gun up to his
      shoulder. Andrii was white as a sheet; his lips moved gently, and he
      uttered a name; but it was not the name of his native land, nor of his
      mother, nor his brother; it was the name of the beautiful Pole. Taras
      fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the ear of corn cut down by the reaping-hook, like the young lamb
      when it feels the deadly steel in its heart, he hung his head and rolled
      upon the grass without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderer of his son stood still, and gazed long upon the lifeless
      body. Even in death he was very handsome; his manly face, so short a time
      ago filled with power, and with an irresistible charm for every woman,
      still had a marvellous beauty; his black brows, like sombre velvet, set
      off his pale features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he not a true Cossack?" said Taras; "he is tall of stature, and
      black-browed, his face is that of a noble, and his hand was strong in
      battle! He is fallen! fallen without glory, like a vile dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, what have you done? Was it you who killed him?" said Ostap,
      coming up at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ostap gazed intently at the dead man. He was sorry for his brother, and
      said at once: "Let us give him honourable burial, father, that the foe may
      not dishonour his body, nor the birds of prey rend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will bury him without our help," said Taras; "there will be plenty
      of mourners and rejoicers for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he reflected for a couple of minutes, whether he should fling him to
      the wolves for prey, or respect in him the bravery which every brave man
      is bound to honour in another, no matter whom? Then he saw Golopuitenko
      galloping towards them and crying: "Woe, hetman, the Lyakhs have been
      reinforced, a fresh force has come to their rescue!" Golopuitenko had not
      finished speaking when Vovtuzenko galloped up: "Woe, hetman! a fresh force
      is bearing down upon us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vovtuzenko had not finished speaking when Pisarenko rushed up without his
      horse: "Where are you, father? The Cossacks are seeking for you. Hetman
      Nevelitchkiy is killed, Zadorozhniy is killed, and Tcherevitchenko: but
      the Cossacks stand their ground; they will not die without looking in your
      eyes; they want you to gaze upon them once more before the hour of death
      arrives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To horse, Ostap!" said Taras, and hastened to find his Cossacks, to look
      once more upon them, and let them behold their hetman once more before the
      hour of death. But before they could emerge from the wood, the enemy's
      force had already surrounded it on all sides, and horsemen armed with
      swords and spears appeared everywhere between the trees. "Ostap, Ostap!
      don't yield!" shouted Taras, and grasping his sword he began to cut down
      all he encountered on every side. But six suddenly sprang upon Ostap. They
      did it in an unpropitious hour: the head of one flew off, another turned
      to flee, a spear pierced the ribs of a third; a fourth, more bold, bent
      his head to escape the bullet, and the bullet striking his horse's breast,
      the maddened animal reared, fell back upon the earth, and crushed his
      rider under him. "Well done, son! Well done, Ostap!" cried Taras: "I am
      following you." And he drove off those who attacked him. Taras hewed and
      fought, dealing blows at one after another, but still keeping his eye upon
      Ostap ahead. He saw that eight more were falling upon his son. "Ostap,
      Ostap! don't yield!" But they had already overpowered Ostap; one had flung
      his lasso about his neck, and they had bound him, and were carrying him
      away. "Hey, Ostap, Ostap!" shouted Taras, forcing his way towards him, and
      cutting men down like cabbages to right and left. "Hey, Ostap, Ostap!" But
      something at that moment struck him like a heavy stone. All grew dim and
      confused before his eyes. In one moment there flashed confusedly before
      him heads, spears, smoke, the gleam of fire, tree-trunks, and leaves; and
      then he sank heavily to the earth like a felled oak, and darkness covered
      his eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I have slept a long while!" said Taras, coming to his senses, as if after
      a heavy drunken sleep, and trying to distinguish the objects about him. A
      terrible weakness overpowered his limbs. The walls and corners of a
      strange room were dimly visible before him. At length he perceived that
      Tovkatch was seated beside him, apparently listening to his every breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," thought Tovkatch, "you might have slept forever." But he said
      nothing, only shook his finger, and motioned him to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me where I am now?" asked Taras, straining his mind, and trying
      to recollect what had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be silent!" cried his companion sternly. "Why should you want to know?
      Don't you see that you are all hacked to pieces? Here I have been
      galloping with you for two weeks without taking a breath; and you have
      been burnt up with fever and talking nonsense. This is the first time you
      have slept quietly. Be silent if you don't wish to do yourself an injury."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Taras still tried to collect his thoughts and to recall what had
      passed. "Well, the Lyakhs must have surrounded and captured me. I had no
      chance of fighting my way clear from the throng."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be silent, I tell you, you devil's brat!" cried Tovkatch angrily, as a
      nurse, driven beyond her patience, cries out at her unruly charge. "What
      good will it do you to know how you got away? It is enough that you did
      get away. Some people were found who would not abandon you; let that be
      enough for you. It is something for me to have ridden all night with you.
      You think that you passed for a common Cossack? No, they have offered a
      reward of two thousand ducats for your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Ostap!" cried Taras suddenly, and tried to rise; for all at once he
      recollected that Ostap had been seized and bound before his very eyes, and
      that he was now in the hands of the Lyakhs. Grief overpowered him. He
      pulled off and tore in pieces the bandages from his wounds, and threw them
      far from him; he tried to say something, but only articulated some
      incoherent words. Fever and delirium seized upon him afresh, and he
      uttered wild and incoherent speeches. Meanwhile his faithful comrade stood
      beside him, scolding and showering harsh, reproachful words upon him
      without stint. Finally, he seized him by the arms and legs, wrapped him up
      like a child, arranged all his bandages, rolled him in an ox-hide, bound
      him with bast, and, fastening him with ropes to his saddle, rode with him
      again at full speed along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get you there, even if it be not alive! I will not abandon your body
      for the Lyakhs to make merry over you, and cut your body in twain and
      fling it into the water. Let the eagle tear out your eyes if it must be
      so; but let it be our eagle of the steppe and not a Polish eagle, not one
      which has flown hither from Polish soil. I will bring you, though it be a
      corpse, to the Ukraine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke his faithful companion. He rode without drawing rein, day and
      night, and brought Taras still insensible into the Zaporozhian Setch
      itself. There he undertook to cure him, with unswerving care, by the aid
      of herbs and liniments. He sought out a skilled Jewess, who made Taras
      drink various potions for a whole month, and at length he improved.
      Whether it was owing to the medicine or to his iron constitution gaining
      the upper hand, at all events, in six weeks he was on his feet. His wounds
      had closed, and only the scars of the sabre-cuts showed how deeply injured
      the old Cossack had been. But he was markedly sad and morose. Three deep
      wrinkles engraved themselves upon his brow and never more departed thence.
      Then he looked around him. All was new in the Setch; all his old
      companions were dead. Not one was left of those who had stood up for the
      right, for faith and brotherhood. And those who had gone forth with the
      Koschevoi in pursuit of the Tatars, they also had long since disappeared.
      All had perished. One had lost his head in battle; another had died for
      lack of food, amid the salt marshes of the Crimea; another had fallen in
      captivity and been unable to survive the disgrace. Their former Koschevoi
      was no longer living, nor any of his old companions, and the grass was
      growing over those once alert with power. He felt as one who had given a
      feast, a great noisy feast. All the dishes had been smashed in pieces; not
      a drop of wine was left anywhere; the guests and servants had all stolen
      valuable cups and platters; and he, like the master of the house, stood
      sadly thinking that it would have been no feast. In vain did they try to
      cheer Taras and to divert his mind; in vain did the long-bearded,
      grey-haired guitar-players come by twos and threes to glorify his Cossack
      deeds. He gazed grimly and indifferently at everything, with inappeasable
      grief printed on his stolid face; and said softly, as he drooped his head,
      "My son, my Ostap!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zaporozhtzi assembled for a raid by sea. Two hundred boats were
      launched on the Dnieper, and Asia Minor saw those who manned them, with
      their shaven heads and long scalp-locks, devote her thriving shores to
      fire and sword; she saw the turbans of her Mahometan inhabitants strewn,
      like her innumerable flowers, over the blood-sprinkled fields, and
      floating along her river banks; she saw many tarry Zaporozhian trousers,
      and strong hands with black hunting-whips. The Zaporozhtzi ate up and laid
      waste all the vineyards. In the mosques they left heaps of dung. They used
      rich Persian shawls for sashes, and girded their dirty gaberdines with
      them. Long afterwards, short Zaporozhian pipes were found in those
      regions. They sailed merrily back. A ten-gun Turkish ship pursued them and
      scattered their skiffs, like birds, with a volley from its guns. A third
      part of them sank in the depths of the sea; but the rest again assembled,
      and gained the mouth of the Dnieper with twelve kegs full of sequins. But
      all this did not interest Taras. He went off upon the steppe as though to
      hunt; but the charge remained in his gun, and, laying down the weapon, he
      would seat himself sadly on the shores of the sea. He sat there long with
      drooping head, repeating continually, "My Ostap, my Ostap!" Before him
      spread the gleaming Black Sea; in the distant reeds the sea-gull screamed.
      His grey moustache turned to silver, and the tears fell one by one upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Taras could endure it no longer. "Whatever happens, I must go and
      find out what he is doing. Is he alive, or in the grave? I will know, cost
      what it may!" Within a week he found himself in the city of Ouman, fully
      armed, and mounted, with lance, sword, canteen, pot of oatmeal, powder
      horn, cord to hobble his horse, and other equipments. He went straight to
      a dirty, ill-kept little house, the small windows of which were almost
      invisible, blackened as they were with some unknown dirt. The chimney was
      wrapped in rags; and the roof, which was full of holes, was covered with
      sparrows. A heap of all sorts of refuse lay before the very door. From the
      window peered the head of a Jewess, in a head-dress with discoloured
      pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your husband at home?" said Bulba, dismounting, and fastening his
      horse's bridle to an iron hook beside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is at home," said the Jewess, and hastened out at once with a measure
      of corn for the horse, and a stoup of beer for the rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your Jew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in the other room at prayer," replied the Jewess, bowing and
      wishing Bulba good health as he raised the cup to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remain here, feed and water my horse, whilst I go speak with him alone. I
      have business with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      This Jew was the well-known Yankel. He was there as revenue-farmer and
      tavern-keeper. He had gradually got nearly all the neighbouring noblemen
      and gentlemen into his hands, had slowly sucked away most of their money,
      and had strongly impressed his presence on that locality. For a distance
      of three miles in all directions, not a single farm remained in a proper
      state. All were falling in ruins; all had been drunk away, and poverty and
      rags alone remained. The whole neighbourhood was depopulated, as if after
      a fire or an epidemic; and if Yankel had lived there ten years, he would
      probably have depopulated the Waiwode's whole domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras entered the room. The Jew was praying, enveloped in his dirty
      shroud, and was turning to spit for the last time, according to the forms
      of his creed, when his eye suddenly lighted on Taras standing behind him.
      The first thing that crossed Yankel's mind was the two thousand ducats
      offered for his visitor's head; but he was ashamed of his avarice, and
      tried to stifle within him the eternal thought of gold, which twines, like
      a snake, about the soul of a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Yankel," said Taras to the Jew, who began to bow low before him,
      and as he spoke he shut the door so that they might not be seen, "I saved
      your life: the Zaporozhtzi would have torn you to pieces like a dog. Now
      it is your turn to do me a service."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew's face clouded over a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What service? If it is a service I can render, why should I not render
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask no questions. Take me to Warsaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Warsaw? Why to Warsaw?" said the Jew, and his brows and shoulders rose
      in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me nothing. Take me to Warsaw. I must see him once more at any cost,
      and say one word to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say a word to whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To him&mdash;to Ostap&mdash;to my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has not my lord heard that already&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, I know all. They offer two thousand ducats for my head. They know
      its value, fools! I will give you five thousand. Here are two thousand on
      the spot," and Bulba poured out two thousand ducats from a leather purse,
      "and the rest when I return."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew instantly seized a towel and concealed the ducats under it. "Ai,
      glorious money! ai, good money!" he said, twirling one gold piece in his
      hand and testing it with his teeth. "I don't believe the man from whom my
      lord took these fine gold pieces remained in the world an hour longer; he
      went straight to the river and drowned himself, after the loss of such
      magnificent gold pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not have asked you, I might possibly have found my own way to
      Warsaw; but some one might recognise me, and then the cursed Lyakhs would
      capture me, for I am not clever at inventions; whilst that is just what
      you Jews are created for. You would deceive the very devil. You know every
      trick: that is why I have come to you; and, besides, I could do nothing of
      myself in Warsaw. Harness the horse to your waggon at once and take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my lord thinks that I can take the nag at once, and harness him, and
      say 'Get up, Dapple!' My lord thinks that I can take him just as he is,
      without concealing him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, hide me, hide me as you like: in an empty cask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ai, ai! and my lord thinks he can be concealed in an empty cask? Does not
      my lord know that every man thinks that every cast he sees contains
      brandy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let them think it is brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them think it is brandy?" said the Jew, and grasped his ear-locks
      with both hands, and then raised them both on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why are you so frightened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does not my lord know that God has made brandy expressly for every
      one to sip? They are all gluttons and fond of dainties there: a nobleman
      will run five versts after a cask; he will make a hole in it, and as soon
      as he sees that nothing runs out, he will say, 'A Jew does not carry empty
      casks; there is certainly something wrong. Seize the Jew, bind the Jew,
      take away all the Jew's money, put the Jew in prison!' Then all the vile
      people will fall upon the Jew, for every one takes a Jew for a dog; and
      they think he is not a man, but only a Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then put me in the waggon with some fish over me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot, my lord, by heaven, I cannot: all over Poland the people are as
      hungry as dogs now. They will steal the fish, and feel my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then take me in the fiend's way, only take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, listen, my lord!" said the Jew, turning up the ends of his
      sleeves, and approaching him with extended arms. "This is what we will do.
      They are building fortresses and castles everywhere: French engineers have
      come from Germany, and so a great deal of brick and stone is being carried
      over the roads. Let my lord lie down in the bottom of the waggon, and over
      him I will pile bricks. My lord is strong and well, apparently, so he will
      not mind if it is a little heavy; and I will make a hole in the bottom of
      the waggon in order to feed my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do what you will, only take me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour, a waggon-load of bricks left Ouman, drawn by two sorry nags.
      On one of them sat tall Yankel, his long, curling ear-locks flowing from
      beneath his Jewish cap, as he bounced about on the horse, like a
      verst-mark planted by the roadside.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time when these things took place, there were as yet on the
      frontiers neither custom-house officials nor guards&mdash;those bugbears
      of enterprising people&mdash;so that any one could bring across anything
      he fancied. If any one made a search or inspection, he did it chiefly for
      his own pleasure, especially if there happened to be in the waggon objects
      attractive to his eye, and if his own hand possessed a certain weight and
      power. But the bricks found no admirers, and they entered the principal
      gate unmolested. Bulba, in his narrow cage, could only hear the noise, the
      shouts of the driver, and nothing more. Yankel, bouncing up and down on
      his dust-covered nag, turned, after making several detours, into a dark,
      narrow street bearing the names of the Muddy and also of the Jews' street,
      because Jews from nearly every part of Warsaw were to be found here. This
      street greatly resembled a back-yard turned wrong side out. The sun never
      seemed to shine into it. The black wooden houses, with numerous poles
      projecting from the windows, still further increased the darkness. Rarely
      did a brick wall gleam red among them; for these too, in many places, had
      turned quite black. Here and there, high up, a bit of stuccoed wall
      illumined by the sun glistened with intolerable whiteness. Pipes, rags,
      shells, broken and discarded tubs: every one flung whatever was useless to
      him into the street, thus affording the passer-by an opportunity of
      exercising all his five senses with the rubbish. A man on horseback could
      almost touch with his hand the poles thrown across the street from one
      house to another, upon which hung Jewish stockings, short trousers, and
      smoked geese. Sometimes a pretty little Hebrew face, adorned with
      discoloured pearls, peeped out of an old window. A group of little Jews,
      with torn and dirty garments and curly hair, screamed and rolled about in
      the dirt. A red-haired Jew, with freckles all over his face which made him
      look like a sparrow's egg, gazed from a window. He addressed Yankel at
      once in his gibberish, and Yankel at once drove into a court-yard. Another
      Jew came along, halted, and entered into conversation. When Bulba finally
      emerged from beneath the bricks, he beheld three Jews talking with great
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yankel turned to him and said that everything possible would be done; that
      his Ostap was in the city jail, and that although it would be difficult to
      persuade the jailer, yet he hoped to arrange a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba entered the room with the three Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews again began to talk among themselves in their incomprehensible
      tongue. Taras looked hard at each of them. Something seemed to have moved
      him deeply; over his rough and stolid countenance a flame of hope spread,
      of hope such as sometimes visits a man in the last depths of his despair;
      his aged heart began to beat violently as though he had been a youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Jews!" said he, and there was a triumphant ring in his words.
      "You can do anything in the world, even extract things from the bottom of
      the sea; and it has long been a proverb, that a Jew will steal from
      himself if he takes a fancy to steal. Set my Ostap at liberty! give him a
      chance to escape from their diabolical hands. I promised this man five
      thousand ducats; I will add another five thousand: all that I have, rich
      cups, buried gold, houses, all, even to my last garment, I will part with;
      and I will enter into a contract with you for my whole life, to give you
      half of all the booty I may gain in war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, impossible, dear lord, it is impossible!" said Yankel with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible," said another Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three Jews looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might try," said the third, glancing timidly at the other two. "God
      may favour us."
    </p>
    <p>
      All three Jews discussed the matter in German. Bulba, in spite of his
      straining ears, could make nothing of it; he only caught the word
      "Mardokhai" often repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, my lord!" said Yankel. "We must consult with a man such as there
      never was before in the world... ugh, ugh! as wise as Solomon; and if he
      will do nothing, then no one in the world can. Sit here: this is the key;
      admit no one." The Jews went out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras locked the door, and looked out from the little window upon the
      dirty Jewish street. The three Jews halted in the middle of the street and
      began to talk with a good deal of warmth: a fourth soon joined them, and
      finally a fifth. Again he heard repeated, "Mardokhai, Mardokhai!" The Jews
      glanced incessantly towards one side of the street; at length from a dirty
      house near the end of it emerged a foot in a Jewish shoe and the skirts of
      a caftan. "Ah! Mardokhai, Mardokhai!" shouted the Jews in one voice. A
      thin Jew somewhat shorter than Yankel, but even more wrinkled, and with a
      huge upper lip, approached the impatient group; and all the Jews made
      haste to talk to him, interrupting each other. During the recital,
      Mardokhai glanced several times towards the little window, and Taras
      divined that the conversation concerned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardokhai waved his hands, listened, interrupted, spat frequently to one
      side, and, pulling up the skirts of his caftan, thrust his hand into his
      pocket and drew out some jingling thing, showing very dirty trousers in
      the operation. Finally all the Jews set up such a shouting that the Jew
      who was standing guard was forced to make a signal for silence, and Taras
      began to fear for his safety; but when he remembered that Jews can only
      consult in the street, and that the demon himself cannot understand their
      language, he regained his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later the Jews all entered the room together. Mardokhai
      approached Taras, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "When we set to
      work it will be all right." Taras looked at this Solomon whom the world
      had never known and conceived some hope: indeed, his face might well
      inspire confidence. His upper lip was simply an object of horror; its
      thickness being doubtless increased by adventitious circumstances. This
      Solomon's beard consisted only of about fifteen hairs, and they were on
      the left side. Solomon's face bore so many scars of battle, received for
      his daring, that he had doubtless lost count of them long before, and had
      grown accustomed to consider them as birthmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardokhai departed, accompanied by his comrades, who were filled with
      admiration at his wisdom. Bulba remained alone. He was in a strange,
      unaccustomed situation for the first time in his life; he felt uneasy. His
      mind was in a state of fever. He was no longer unbending, immovable,
      strong as an oak, as he had formerly been: but felt timid and weak. He
      trembled at every sound, at every fresh Jewish face which showed itself at
      the end of the street. In this condition he passed the whole day. He
      neither ate nor drank, and his eye never for a moment left the small
      window looking on the street. Finally, late at night, Mardokhai and Yankel
      made their appearance. Taras's heart died within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news? have you been successful?" he asked with the impatience of a
      wild horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the Jews had recovered breath to answer, Taras perceived that
      Mardokhai no longer had the locks, which had formerly fallen in greasy
      curls from under his felt cap. It was evident that he wished to say
      something, but he uttered only nonsense which Taras could make nothing of.
      Yankel himself put his hand very often to his mouth as though suffering
      from a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dearest lord!" said Yankel: "it is quite impossible now! by heaven,
      impossible! Such vile people that they deserve to be spit upon! Mardokhai
      here says the same. Mardokhai has done what no man in the world ever did,
      but God did not will that it should be so. Three thousand soldiers are in
      garrison here, and to-morrow the prisoners are all to be executed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras looked the Jew straight in the face, but no longer with impatience
      or anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if my lord wishes to see his son, then it must be early to-morrow
      morning, before the sun has risen. The sentinels have consented, and one
      gaoler has promised. But may he have no happiness in the world, woe is me!
      What greedy people! There are none such among us: I gave fifty ducats to
      each sentinel and to the gaoler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Take me to him!" exclaimed Taras, with decision, and with all his
      firmness of mind restored. He agreed to Yankel's proposition that he
      should disguise himself as a foreign count, just arrived from Germany, for
      which purpose the prudent Jew had already provided a costume. It was
      already night. The master of the house, the red-haired Jew with freckles,
      pulled out a mattress covered with some kind of rug, and spread it on a
      bench for Bulba. Yankel lay upon the floor on a similar mattress. The
      red-haired Jew drank a small cup of brandy, took off his caftan, and
      betook himself&mdash;looking, in his shoes and stockings, very like a lean
      chicken&mdash;with his wife, to something resembling a cupboard. Two
      little Jews lay down on the floor beside the cupboard, like a couple of
      dogs. But Taras did not sleep; he sat motionless, drumming on the table
      with his fingers. He kept his pipe in his mouth, and puffed out smoke,
      which made the Jew sneeze in his sleep and pull his coverlet over his
      nose. Scarcely was the sky touched with the first faint gleams of dawn
      than he pushed Yankel with his foot, saying: "Rise, Jew, and give me your
      count's dress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he was dressed. He blackened his moustache and eyebrows, put
      on his head a small dark cap; even the Cossacks who knew him best would
      not have recognised him. Apparently he was not more than thirty-five. A
      healthy colour glowed on his cheeks, and his scars lent him an air of
      command. The gold-embroidered dress became him extremely well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were still asleep. Not a single one of the market folk as yet
      showed himself in the city, with his basket on his arm. Yankel and Bulba
      made their way to a building which presented the appearance of a crouching
      stork. It was large, low, wide, and black; and on one side a long slender
      tower like a stork's neck projected above the roof. This building served
      for a variety of purposes; it was a barrack, a jail, and the criminal
      court. The visitors entered the gate and found themselves in a vast room,
      or covered courtyard. About a thousand men were sleeping here. Straight
      before them was a small door, in front of which sat two sentries playing
      at some game which consisted in one striking the palm of the other's hand
      with two fingers. They paid little heed to the new arrivals, and only
      turned their heads when Yankel said, "It is we, sirs; do you hear? it is
      we."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in!" said one of them, opening the door with one hand, and holding out
      the other to his comrade to receive his blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered a low and dark corridor, which led them to a similar room
      with small windows overhead. "Who goes there?" shouted several voices, and
      Taras beheld a number of warriors in full armour. "We have been ordered to
      admit no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is we!" cried Yankel; "we, by heavens, noble sirs!" But no one would
      listen to him. Fortunately, at that moment a fat man came up, who appeared
      to be a commanding officer, for he swore louder than all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, it is we! you know us, and the lord count will thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admit them, a hundred fiends, and mother of fiends! Admit no one else.
      And no one is to draw his sword, nor quarrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of this order the visitors did not hear. "It is we, it is
      I, it is your friends!" Yankel said to every one they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, can it be managed now?" he inquired of one of the guards, when they
      at length reached the end of the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is possible, but I don't know whether you will be able to gain
      admission to the prison itself. Yana is not here now; another man is
      keeping watch in his place," replied the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ai, ai!" cried the Jew softly: "this is bad, my dear lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on!" said Taras, firmly, and the Jew obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the arched entrance of the vaults stood a heyduke, with a moustache
      trimmed in three layers: the upper layer was trained backwards, the second
      straight forward, and the third downwards, which made him greatly resemble
      a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew shrank into nothing and approached him almost sideways: "Your high
      excellency! High and illustrious lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you speaking to me, Jew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, illustrious lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm, but I am merely a heyduke," said the merry-eyed man with the
      triple-tiered moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I thought it was the Waiwode himself, by heavens! Ai, ai, ai!"
      Thereupon the Jew twisted his head about and spread out his fingers. "Ai,
      what a fine figure! Another finger's-breadth and he would be a colonel.
      The lord no doubt rides a horse as fleet as the wind and commands the
      troops!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The heyduke twirled the lower tier of his moustache, and his eyes beamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a warlike people!" continued the Jew. "Ah, woe is me, what a fine
      race! Golden cords and trappings that shine like the sun; and the maidens,
      wherever they see warriors&mdash;Ai, ai!" Again the Jew wagged his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heyduke twirled his upper moustache and uttered a sound somewhat
      resembling the neighing of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray my lord to do us a service!" exclaimed the Jew: "this prince has
      come hither from a foreign land, and wants to get a look at the Cossacks.
      He never, in all his life, has seen what sort of people the Cossacks are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The advent of foreign counts and barons was common enough in Poland: they
      were often drawn thither by curiosity to view this half-Asiatic corner of
      Europe. They regarded Moscow and the Ukraine as situated in Asia. So the
      heyduke bowed low, and thought fit to add a few words of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know, your excellency," said he, "why you should desire to see
      them. They are dogs, not men; and their faith is such as no one respects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you son of Satan!" exclaimed Bulba. "You are a dog yourself! How
      dare you say that our faith is not respected? It is your heretical faith
      which is not respected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho!" said the heyduke. "I can guess who you are, my friend; you are one
      of the breed of those under my charge. So just wait while I summon our
      men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras realised his indiscretion, but vexation and obstinacy hindered him
      from devising a means of remedying it. Fortunately Yankel managed to
      interpose at this moment:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most noble lord, how is it possible that the count can be a Cossack? If
      he were a Cossack, where could have he obtained such a dress, and such a
      count-like mien?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain that yourself." And the heyduke opened his wide mouth to shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your royal highness, silence, silence, for heaven's sake!" cried Yankel.
      "Silence! we will pay you for it in a way you never dreamed of: we will
      give you two golden ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho! two ducats! I can't do anything with two ducats. I give my barber
      two ducats for only shaving the half of my beard. Give me a hundred
      ducats, Jew." Here the heyduke twirled his upper moustache. "If you don't,
      I will shout at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so much?" said the Jew, sadly, turning pale, and undoing his leather
      purse; but it was lucky that he had no more in it, and that the heyduke
      could not count over a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, my lord, let us depart quickly! Look at the evil-minded fellow!"
      said Yankel to Taras, perceiving that the heyduke was turning the money
      over in his hand as though regretting that he had not demanded more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, you devil of a heyduke?" said Bulba. "What do you mean
      by taking our money and not letting us see the Cossacks? No, you must let
      us see them. Since you have taken the money, you have no right to refuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, go to the devil! If you won't, I'll give the alarm this moment. Take
      yourselves off quickly, I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, my lord, let us go! in God's name let us go! Curse him! May he
      dream such things that he will have to spit," cried poor Yankel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulba turned slowly, with drooping head, and retraced his steps, followed
      by the complaints of Yankel who was sorrowing at the thought of the wasted
      ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why be angry? Let the dog curse. That race cannot help cursing. Oh, woe
      is me, what luck God sends to some people! A hundred ducats merely for
      driving us off! And our brother: they have torn off his ear-locks, and
      they made wounds on his face that you cannot bear to look at, and yet no
      one will give him a hundred gold pieces. O heavens! Merciful God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But this failure made a much deeper impression on Bulba, expressed by a
      devouring flame in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go," he said, suddenly, as if arousing himself; "let us go to the
      square. I want to see how they will torture him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my lord! why go? That will do us no good now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go," said Bulba, obstinately; and the Jew followed him, sighing
      like a nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square on which the execution was to take place was not hard to find:
      for the people were thronging thither from all quarters. In that savage
      age such a thing constituted one of the most noteworthy spectacles, not
      only for the common people, but among the higher classes. A number of the
      most pious old men, a throng of young girls, and the most cowardly women,
      who dreamed the whole night afterwards of their bloody corpses, and
      shrieked as loudly in their sleep as a drunken hussar, missed,
      nevertheless, no opportunity of gratifying their curiosity. "Ah, what
      tortures!" many of them would cry, hysterically, covering their eyes and
      turning away; but they stood their ground for a good while, all the same.
      Many a one, with gaping mouth and outstretched hands, would have liked to
      jump upon other folk's heads, to get a better view. Above the crowd
      towered a bulky butcher, admiring the whole process with the air of a
      connoisseur, and exchanging brief remarks with a gunsmith, whom he
      addressed as "Gossip," because he got drunk in the same alehouse with him
      on holidays. Some entered into warm discussions, others even laid wagers.
      But the majority were of the species who, all the world over, look on at
      the world and at everything that goes on in it and merely scratch their
      noses. In the front ranks, close to the bearded civic-guards, stood a
      young noble, in warlike array, who had certainly put his whole wardrobe on
      his back, leaving only his torn shirt and old shoes at his quarters. Two
      chains, one above the other, hung around his neck. He stood beside his
      mistress, Usisya, and glanced about incessantly to see that no one soiled
      her silk gown. He explained everything to her so perfectly that no one
      could have added a word. "All these people whom you see, my dear Usisya,"
      he said, "have come to see the criminals executed; and that man, my love,
      yonder, holding the axe and other instruments in his hands, is the
      executioner, who will despatch them. When he begins to break them on the
      wheel, and torture them in other ways, the criminals will still be alive;
      but when he cuts off their heads, then, my love, they will die at once.
      Before that, they will cry and move; but as soon as their heads are cut
      off, it will be impossible for them to cry, or to eat or drink, because,
      my dear, they will no longer have any head." Usisya listened to all this
      with terror and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper stories of the houses were filled with people. From the windows
      in the roof peered strange faces with beards and something resembling
      caps. Upon the balconies, beneath shady awnings, sat the aristocracy. The
      hands of smiling young ladies, brilliant as white sugar, rested on the
      railings. Portly nobles looked on with dignity. Servants in rich garb,
      with flowing sleeves, handed round various refreshments. Sometimes a
      black-eyed young rogue would take her cake or fruit and fling it among the
      crowd with her own noble little hand. The crowd of hungry gentles held up
      their caps to receive it; and some tall noble, whose head rose amid the
      throng, with his faded red jacket and discoloured gold braid, and who was
      the first to catch it with the aid of his long arms, would kiss his booty,
      press it to his heart, and finally put it in his mouth. The hawk,
      suspended beneath the balcony in a golden cage, was also a spectator; with
      beak inclined to one side, and with one foot raised, he, too, watched the
      people attentively. But suddenly a murmur ran through the crowd, and a
      rumour spread, "They are coming! they are coming! the Cossacks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were bare-headed, with their long locks floating in the air. Their
      beards had grown, and their once handsome garments were worn out, and hung
      about them in tatters. They walked neither timidly nor surlily, but with a
      certain pride, neither looking at nor bowing to the people. At the head of
      all came Ostap.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were old Taras's feelings when thus he beheld his Ostap? What filled
      his heart then? He gazed at him from amid the crowd, and lost not a single
      movement of his. They reached the place of execution. Ostap stopped. He
      was to be the first to drink the bitter cup. He glanced at his comrades,
      raised his hand, and said in a loud voice: "God grant that none of the
      heretics who stand here may hear, the unclean dogs, how Christians suffer!
      Let none of us utter a single word." After this he ascended the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, son! well done!" said Bulba, softly, and bent his grey head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The executioner tore off his old rags; they fastened his hands and feet in
      stocks prepared expressly, and&mdash;We will not pain the reader with a
      picture of the hellish tortures which would make his hair rise upright on
      his head. They were the outcome of that coarse, wild age, when men still
      led a life of warfare which hardened their souls until no sense of
      humanity was left in them. In vain did some, not many, in that age make a
      stand against such terrible measures. In vain did the king and many
      nobles, enlightened in mind and spirit, demonstrate that such severity of
      punishment could but fan the flame of vengeance in the Cossack nation. But
      the power of the king, and the opinion of the wise, was as nothing before
      the savage will of the magnates of the kingdom, who, by their
      thoughtlessness and unconquerable lack of all far-sighted policy, their
      childish self-love and miserable pride, converted the Diet into the
      mockery of a government. Ostap endured the torture like a giant. Not a
      cry, not a groan, was heard. Even when they began to break the bones in
      his hands and feet, when, amid the death-like stillness of the crowd, the
      horrible cracking was audible to the most distant spectators; when even
      his tormentors turned aside their eyes, nothing like a groan escaped his
      lips, nor did his face quiver. Taras stood in the crowd with bowed head;
      and, raising his eyes proudly at that moment, he said, approvingly, "Well
      done, boy! well done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they took him to the last deadly tortures, it seemed as though
      his strength were failing. He cast his eyes around.
    </p>
    <p>
      O God! all strangers, all unknown faces! If only some of his relatives had
      been present at his death! He would not have cared to hear the sobs and
      anguish of his poor, weak mother, nor the unreasoning cries of a wife,
      tearing her hair and beating her white breast; but he would have liked to
      see a strong man who might refresh him with a word of wisdom, and cheer
      his end. And his strength failed him, and he cried in the weakness of his
      soul, "Father! where are you? do you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear!" rang through the universal silence, and those thousands of
      people shuddered in concert. A detachment of cavalry hastened to search
      through the throng of people. Yankel turned pale as death, and when the
      horsemen had got within a short distance of him, turned round in terror to
      look for Taras; but Taras was no longer beside him; every trace of him was
      lost.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      They soon found traces of Taras. An army of a hundred and twenty thousand
      Cossacks appeared on the frontier of the Ukraine. This was no small
      detachment sallying forth for plunder or in pursuit of the Tatars. No: the
      whole nation had risen, for the measure of the people's patience was
      over-full; they had risen to avenge the disregard of their rights, the
      dishonourable humiliation of themselves, the insults to the faith of their
      fathers and their sacred customs, the outrages upon their church, the
      excesses of the foreign nobles, the disgraceful domination of the Jews on
      Christian soil, and all that had aroused and deepened the stern hatred of
      the Cossacks for a long time past. Hetman Ostranitza, young, but firm in
      mind, led the vast Cossack force. Beside him was seen his old and
      experienced friend and counsellor, Gunya. Eight leaders led bands of
      twelve thousand men each. Two osauls and a bunchuzhniy assisted the
      hetman. A cornet-general carried the chief standard, whilst many other
      banners and standards floated in the air; and the comrades of the staff
      bore the golden staff of the hetman, the symbol of his office. There were
      also many other officials belonging to the different bands, the baggage
      train and the main force with detachments of infantry and cavalry. There
      were almost as many free Cossacks and volunteers as there were registered
      Cossacks. The Cossacks had risen everywhere. They came from Tchigirin,
      from Pereyaslaf, from Baturin, from Glukhof, from the regions of the lower
      Dnieper, and from all its upper shores and islands. An uninterrupted
      stream of horses and herds of cattle stretched across the plain. And among
      all these Cossacks, among all these bands, one was the choicest; and that
      was the band led by Taras Bulba. All contributed to give him an influence
      over the others: his advanced years, his experience and skill in directing
      an army, and his bitter hatred of the foe. His unsparing fierceness and
      cruelty seemed exaggerated even to the Cossacks. His grey head dreamed of
      naught save fire and sword, and his utterances at the councils of war
      breathed only annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to describe all the battles in which the Cossacks
      distinguished themselves, or the gradual courses of the campaign. All this
      is set down in the chronicles. It is well known what an army raised on
      Russian soil, for the orthodox faith, is like. There is no power stronger
      than faith. It is threatening and invincible like a rock, and rising
      amidst the stormy, ever-changing sea. From the very bottom of the sea it
      rears to heaven its jagged sides of firm, impenetrable stone. It is
      visible from everywhere, and looks the waves straight in the face as they
      roll past. And woe to the ship which is dashed against it! Its frame flies
      into splinters, everything in it is split and crushed, and the startled
      air re-echoes the piteous cries of the drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pages of the chronicles there is a minute description of how the
      Polish garrisons fled from the freed cities; how the unscrupulous Jewish
      tavern-keepers were hung; how powerless was the royal hetman, Nikolai
      Pototzky, with his numerous army, against this invincible force; how,
      routed and pursued, he lost the best of his troops by drowning in a small
      stream; how the fierce Cossack regiments besieged him in the little town
      of Polon; and how, reduced to extremities, he promised, under oath, on the
      part of the king and the government, its full satisfaction to all, and the
      restoration of all their rights and privileges. But the Cossacks were not
      men to give way for this. They already knew well what a Polish oath was
      worth. And Pototzky would never more have pranced on his six-thousand
      ducat horse from the Kabardei, attracting the glances of distinguished
      ladies and the envy of the nobility; he would never more have made a
      figure in the Diet, by giving costly feasts to the senators&mdash;if the
      Russian priests who were in the little town had not saved him. When all
      the popes, in their brilliant gold vestments, went out to meet the
      Cossacks, bearing the holy pictures and the cross, with the bishop himself
      at their head, crosier in hand and mitre on his head, the Cossacks all
      bowed their heads and took off their caps. To no one lower than the king
      himself would they have shown respect at such an hour; but their daring
      fell before the Church of Christ, and they honoured their priesthood. The
      hetman and leaders agreed to release Pototzky, after having extracted from
      him a solemn oath to leave all the Christian churches unmolested, to
      forswear the ancient enmity, and to do no harm to the Cossack forces. One
      leader alone would not consent to such a peace. It was Taras. He tore a
      handful of hair from his head, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hetman and leaders! Commit no such womanish deed. Trust not the Lyakhs;
      slay the dogs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the secretary presented the agreement, and the hetman put his hand to
      it, Taras drew a genuine Damascene blade, a costly Turkish sabre of the
      finest steel, broke it in twain like a reed, and threw the two pieces far
      away on each side, saying, "Farewell! As the two pieces of this sword will
      never reunite and form one sword again, so we, comrades, shall nevermore
      behold each other in this world. Remember my parting words." As he spoke
      his voice grew stronger, rose higher, and acquired a hitherto unknown
      power; and his prophetic utterances troubled them all. "Before the death
      hour you will remember me! Do you think that you have purchased peace and
      quiet? do you think that you will make a great show? You will make a great
      show, but after another fashion. They will flay the skin from your head,
      hetman, they will stuff it with bran, and long will it be exhibited at
      fairs. Neither will you retain your heads, gentles. You will be thrown
      into damp dungeons, walled about with stone, if they do not boil you alive
      in cauldrons like sheep. And you, men," he continued, turning to his
      followers, "which of you wants to die his true death? not through sorrows
      and the ale-house; but an honourable Cossack death, all in one bed, like
      bride and groom? But, perhaps, you would like to return home, and turn
      infidels, and carry Polish priests on your backs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will follow you, noble leader, we will follow you!" shouted all his
      band, and many others joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is to be so, then follow me," said Taras, pulling his cap farther
      over his brows. Looking menacingly at the others, he went to his horse,
      and cried to his men, "Let no one reproach us with any insulting speeches.
      Now, hey there, men! we'll call on the Catholics." And then he struck his
      horse, and there followed him a camp of a hundred waggons, and with them
      many Cossack cavalry and infantry; and, turning, he threatened with a
      glance all who remained behind, and wrath was in his eye. The band
      departed in full view of all the army, and Taras continued long to turn
      and glower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hetman and leaders were uneasy; all became thoughtful, and remained
      silent, as though oppressed by some heavy foreboding. Not in vain had
      Taras prophesied: all came to pass as he had foretold. A little later,
      after the treacherous attack at Kaneva, the hetman's head was mounted on a
      stake, together with those of many of his officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what of Taras? Taras made raids all over Poland with his band, burned
      eighteen towns and nearly forty churches, and reached Cracow. He killed
      many nobles, and plundered some of the richest and finest castles. The
      Cossacks emptied on the ground the century-old mead and wine, carefully
      hoarded up in lordly cellars; they cut and burned the rich garments and
      equipments which they found in the wardrobes. "Spare nothing," was the
      order of Taras. The Cossacks spared not the black-browed gentlewomen, the
      brilliant, white-bosomed maidens: these could not save themselves even at
      the altar, for Taras burned them with the altar itself. Snowy hands were
      raised to heaven from amid fiery flames, with piteous shrieks which would
      have moved the damp earth itself to pity and caused the steppe-grass to
      bend with compassion at their fate. But the cruel Cossacks paid no heed;
      and, raising the children in the streets upon the points of their lances,
      they cast them also into the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a mass for the soul of Ostap, you heathen Lyakhs," was all that
      Taras said. And such masses for Ostap he had sung in every village, until
      the Polish Government perceived that Taras's raids were more than ordinary
      expeditions for plunder; and Pototzky was given five regiments, and
      ordered to capture him without fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six days did the Cossacks retreat along the by-roads before their
      pursuers; their horses were almost equal to this unchecked flight, and
      nearly saved them. But this time Pototzky was also equal to the task
      intrusted to him; unweariedly he followed them, and overtook them on the
      bank of the Dniester, where Taras had taken possession of an abandoned and
      ruined castle for the purpose of resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very brink of the Dniester it stood, with its shattered ramparts
      and the ruined remnants of its walls. The summit of the cliff was strewn
      with ragged stones and broken bricks, ready at any moment to detach
      themselves. The royal hetman, Pototzky, surrounded it on the two sides
      which faced the plain. Four days did the Cossacks fight, tearing down
      bricks and stones for missiles. But their stones and their strength were
      at length exhausted, and Taras resolved to cut his way through the
      beleaguering forces. And the Cossacks would have cut their way through,
      and their swift steeds might again have served them faithfully, had not
      Taras halted suddenly in the very midst of their flight, and shouted,
      "Halt! my pipe has dropped with its tobacco: I won't let those heathen
      Lyakhs have my pipe!" And the old hetman stooped down, and felt in the
      grass for his pipe full of tobacco, his inseparable companion on all his
      expeditions by sea and land and at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the meantime a band of Lyakhs suddenly rushed up, and seized him by
      the shoulders. He struggled with all might; but he could not scatter on
      the earth, as he had been wont to do, the heydukes who had seized him.
      "Oh, old age, old age!" he exclaimed: and the stout old Cossack wept. But
      his age was not to blame: nearly thirty men were clinging to his arms and
      legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The raven is caught!" yelled the Lyakhs. "We must think how we can show
      him the most honour, the dog!" They decided, with the permission of the
      hetman, to burn him alive in the sight of all. There stood hard by a
      leafless tree, the summit of which had been struck by lightning. They
      fastened him with iron chains and nails driven through his hands high up
      on the trunk of the tree, so that he might be seen from all sides; and
      began at once to place fagots at its foot. But Taras did not look at the
      wood, nor did he think of the fire with which they were preparing to roast
      him: he gazed anxiously in the direction whence his Cossacks were firing.
      From his high point of observation he could see everything as in the palm
      of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take possession, men," he shouted, "of the hillock behind the wood: they
      cannot climb it!" But the wind did not carry his words to them. "They are
      lost, lost!" he said in despair, and glanced down to where the water of
      the Dniester glittered. Joy gleamed in his eyes. He saw the sterns of four
      boats peeping out from behind some bushes; exerted all the power of his
      lungs, and shouted in a ringing tone, "To the bank, to the bank, men!
      descend the path to the left, under the cliff. There are boats on the
      bank; take all, that they may not catch you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the breeze blew from the other side, and his words were audible
      to the Cossacks. But for this counsel he received a blow on the head with
      the back of an axe, which made everything dance before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cossacks descended the cliff path at full speed, but their pursuers
      were at their heels. They looked: the path wound and twisted, and made
      many detours to one side. "Comrades, we are trapped!" said they. All
      halted for an instant, raised their whips, whistled, and their Tatar
      horses rose from the ground, clove the air like serpents, flew over the
      precipice, and plunged straight into the Dniester. Two only did not alight
      in the river, but thundered down from the height upon the stones, and
      perished there with their horses without uttering a cry. But the Cossacks
      had already swum shoreward from their horses, and unfastened the boats,
      when the Lyakhs halted on the brink of the precipice, astounded by this
      wonderful feat, and thinking, "Shall we jump down to them, or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One young colonel, a lively, hot-blooded soldier, own brother to the
      beautiful Pole who had seduced poor Andrii, did not reflect long, but
      leaped with his horse after the Cossacks. He made three turns in the air
      with his steed, and fell heavily on the rocks. The sharp stones tore him
      in pieces; and his brains, mingled with blood, bespattered the shrubs
      growing on the uneven walls of the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Taras Bulba recovered from the blow, and glanced towards the
      Dniester, the Cossacks were already in the skiffs and rowing away. Balls
      were showered upon them from above but did not reach them. And the old
      hetman's eyes sparkled with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, comrades!" he shouted to them from above; "remember me, and
      come hither again next spring and make merry in the same fashion! What!
      cursed Lyakhs, have ye caught me? Think ye there is anything in the world
      that a Cossack fears? Wait; the time will come when ye shall learn what
      the orthodox Russian faith is! Already the people scent it far and near. A
      czar shall arise from Russian soil, and there shall not be a power in the
      world which shall not submit to him!" But fire had already risen from the
      fagots; it lapped his feet, and the flame spread to the tree.... But can
      any fire, flames, or power be found on earth which are capable of
      overpowering Russian strength?
    </p>
    <p>
      Broad is the river Dniester, and in it are many deep pools, dense
      reed-beds, clear shallows and little bays; its watery mirror gleams,
      filled with the melodious plaint of the swan, the proud wild goose glides
      swiftly over it; and snipe, red-throated ruffs, and other birds are to be
      found among the reeds and along the banks. The Cossacks rowed swiftly on
      in the narrow double-ruddered boats&mdash;rowed stoutly, carefully
      shunning the sand bars, and cleaving the ranks of the birds, which took
      wing&mdash;rowed, and talked of their hetman.

      ST. JOHN'S EVE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A STORY TOLD BY THE SACRISTAN OF THE DIKANKA CHURCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thoma Grigroovitch had one very strange eccentricity: to the day of his
      death he never liked to tell the same thing twice. There were times when,
      if you asked him to relate a thing afresh, he would interpolate new
      matter, or alter it so that it was impossible to recognise it. Once upon a
      time, one of those gentlemen who, like the usurers at our yearly fairs,
      clutch and beg and steal every sort of frippery, and issue mean little
      volumes, no thicker than an A B C book, every month, or even every week,
      wormed this same story out of Thoma Grigorovitch, and the latter
      completely forgot about it. But that same young gentleman, in the
      pea-green caftan, came from Poltava, bringing with him a little book, and,
      opening it in the middle, showed it to us. Thoma Grigorovitch was on the
      point of setting his spectacles astride of his nose, but recollected that
      he had forgotten to wind thread about them and stick them together with
      wax, so he passed it over to me. As I understand nothing about reading and
      writing, and do not wear spectacles, I undertook to read it. I had not
      turned two leaves when all at once he caught me by the hand and stopped
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! tell me first what you are reading."
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess that I was a trifle stunned by such a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! what am I reading, Thoma Grigorovitch? Why, your own words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told you that they were my words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what more would you have? Here it is printed: 'Related by such and
      such a sacristan.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spit on the head of the man who printed that! he lies, the dog of a
      Moscow pedlar! Did I say that? ''Twas just the same as though one hadn't
      his wits about him!' Listen. I'll tell the tale to you on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved up to the table, and he began.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My grandfather (the kingdom of heaven be his! may he eat only wheaten
      rolls and poppy-seed cakes with honey in the other world!) could tell a
      story wonderfully well. When he used to begin a tale you could not stir
      from the spot all day, but kept on listening. He was not like the
      story-teller of the present day, when he begins to lie, with a tongue as
      though he had had nothing to eat for three days, so that you snatch your
      cap and flee from the house. I remember my old mother was alive then, and
      in the long winter evenings when the frost was crackling out of doors, and
      had sealed up hermetically the narrow panes of our cottage, she used to
      sit at her wheel, drawing out a long thread in her hand, rocking the
      cradle with her foot, and humming a song, which I seem to hear even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp, quivering and flaring up as though in fear of something, lighted
      up our cottage; the spindle hummed; and all of us children, collected in a
      cluster, listened to grandfather, who had not crawled off the stove for
      more than five years, owing to his great age. But the wondrous tales of
      the incursions of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the Poles, the bold deeds
      of Podkova, of Poltar-Kozhukh, and Sagaidatchnii, did not interest us so
      much as the stories about some deed of old which always sent a shiver
      through our frames and made our hair rise upright on our heads. Sometimes
      such terror took possession of us in consequence of them, that, from that
      evening forward, Heaven knows how wonderful everything seemed to us. If
      one chanced to go out of the cottage after nightfall for anything, one
      fancied that a visitor from the other world had lain down to sleep in
      one's bed; and I have often taken my own smock, at a distance, as it lay
      at the head of the bed, for the Evil One rolled up into a ball! But the
      chief thing about grandfather's stories was, that he never lied in all his
      life; and whatever he said was so, was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will now tell you one of his wonderful tales. I know that there are a
      great many wise people who copy in the courts, and can even read civil
      documents, but who, if you were to put into their hand a simple
      prayer-book, could not make out the first letter in it, and would show all
      their teeth in derision. These people laugh at everything you tell them.
      Along comes one of them&mdash;and doesn't believe in witches! Yes, glory
      to God that I have lived so long in the world! I have seen heretics to
      whom it would be easier to lie in confession than it would be to our
      brothers and equals to take snuff, and these folk would deny the existence
      of witches! But let them just dream about something, and they won't even
      tell what it was! There, it is no use talking about them!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could have recognised the village of ours a little over a hundred
      years ago; it was a hamlet, the poorest kind of a hamlet. Half a score of
      miserable farmhouses, unplastered and badly thatched, were scattered here
      and there about the fields. There was not a yard or a decent shed to
      shelter animals or waggons. That was the way the wealthy lived: and if you
      had looked for our brothers, the poor&mdash;why, a hole in the ground&mdash;that
      was a cabin for you! Only by the smoke could you tell that a God-created
      man lived there. You ask why they lived so? It was not entirely through
      poverty: almost every one led a raiding Cossack life, and gathered not a
      little plunder in foreign lands; it was rather because it was little use
      building up a good wooden house. Many folk were engaged in raids all over
      the country&mdash;Crimeans, Poles, Lithuanians! It was quite possible that
      their own countrymen might make a descent and plunder everything. Anything
      was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this hamlet a man, or rather a devil in human form, often made his
      appearance. Why he came, and whence, no one knew. He prowled about, got
      drunk, and suddenly disappeared as if into the air, leaving no trace of
      his existence. Then, behold, he seemed to have dropped from the sky again,
      and went flying about the street of the village, of which no trace now
      remains, and which was not more than a hundred paces from Dikanka. He
      would collect together all the Cossacks he met; then there were songs,
      laughter, and cash in plenty, and vodka flowed like water.... He would
      address the pretty girls, and give them ribbons, earrings, strings of
      beads&mdash;more than they knew what to do with. It is true that the
      pretty girls rather hesitated about accepting his presents: God knows,
      perhaps, what unclean hands they had passed through. My grandfather's
      aunt, who kept at that time a tavern, in which Basavriuk (as they called
      this devil-man) often caroused, said that no consideration on the earth
      would have induced her to accept a gift from him. But then, again, how
      avoid accepting? Fear seized on every one when he knit his shaggy brows,
      and gave a sidelong glance which might send your feet God knows whither:
      whilst if you did accept, then the next night some fiend from the swamp,
      with horns on his head, came and began to squeeze your neck, if there was
      a string of beads upon it; or bite your finger, if there was a ring upon
      it; or drag you by the hair, if ribbons were braided in it. God have
      mercy, then, on those who held such gifts! But here was the difficulty: it
      was impossible to get rid of them; if you threw them into the water, the
      diabolical ring or necklace would skim along the surface and into your
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a church in the village&mdash;St. Pantelei, if I remember
      rightly. There lived there a priest, Father Athanasii of blessed memory.
      Observing that Basavriuk did not come to church, even at Easter, he
      determined to reprove him and impose penance upon him. Well, he hardly
      escaped with his life. "Hark ye, sir!" he thundered in reply, "learn to
      mind your own business instead of meddling in other people's, if you don't
      want that throat of yours stuck with boiling kutya (1)." What was to be
      done with this unrepentant man? Father Athanasii contented himself with
      announcing that any one who should make the acquaintance of Basavriuk
      would be counted a Catholic, an enemy of Christ's orthodox church, not a
      member of the human race.

    <p>
      In this village there was a Cossack named Korzh, who had a labourer whom
      people called Peter the Orphan&mdash;perhaps because no one remembered
      either his father or mother. The church elder, it is true, said that they
      had died of the pest in his second year; but my grandfather's aunt would
      not hear of that, and tried with all her might to furnish him with
      parents, although poor Peter needed them about as much as we need last
      year's snow. She said that his father had been in Zaporozhe, and had been
      taken prisoner by the Turks, amongst whom he underwent God only knows what
      tortures, until having, by some miracle, disguised himself as a eunuch, he
      made his escape. Little cared the black-browed youths and maidens about
      Peter's parents. They merely remarked, that if he only had a new coat, a
      red sash, a black lambskin cap with a smart blue crown on his head, a
      Turkish sabre by his side, a whip in one hand and a pipe with handsome
      mountings in the other, he would surpass all the young men. But the pity
      was, that the only thing poor Peter had was a grey gaberdine with more
      holes in it than there are gold pieces in a Jew's pocket. But that was not
      the worst of it. Korzh had a daughter, such a beauty as I think you can
      hardly have chanced to see. My grandfather's aunt used to say&mdash;and
      you know that it is easier for a woman to kiss the Evil One than to call
      any one else a beauty&mdash;that this Cossack maiden's cheeks were as
      plump and fresh as the pinkest poppy when, bathed in God's dew, it unfolds
      its petals, and coquets with the rising sun; that her brows were evenly
      arched over her bright eyes like black cords, such as our maidens buy
      nowadays, for their crosses and ducats, off the Moscow pedlars who visit
      the villages with their baskets; that her little mouth, at sight of which
      the youths smacked their lips, seemed made to warble the songs of
      nightingales; that her hair, black as the raven's wing, and soft as young
      flax, fell in curls over her shoulders, for our maidens did not then plait
      their hair in pigtails interwoven with pretty, bright-hued ribbons. Eh!
      may I never intone another alleluia in the choir, if I would not have
      kissed her, in spite of the grey which is making its way through the old
      wool which covers my pate, and of the old woman beside me, like a thorn in
      my side! Well, you know what happens when young men and maidens live side
      by side. In the twilight the heels of red boots were always visible in the
      place where Pidorka chatted with her Peter. But Korzh would never have
      suspected anything out of the way, only one day&mdash;it is evident that
      none but the Evil One could have inspired him&mdash;Peter took into his
      head to kiss the maiden's rosy lips with all his heart, without first
      looking well about him; and that same Evil One&mdash;may the son of a dog
      dream of the holy cross!&mdash;caused the old grey-beard, like a fool, to
      open the cottage door at that same moment. Korzh was petrified, dropped
      his jaw, and clutched at the door for support. Those unlucky kisses
      completely stunned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering himself, he took his grandfather's hunting whip from the wall,
      and was about to belabour Peter's back with it, when Pidorka's little
      six-year-old brother Ivas rushed up from somewhere or other, and, grasping
      his father's legs with his little hands, screamed out, "Daddy, daddy!
      don't beat Peter!" What was to be done? A father's heart is not made of
      stone. Hanging the whip again on the wall, he led Peter quietly from the
      house. "If you ever show yourself in my cottage again, or even under the
      windows, look out, Peter, for, by heaven, your black moustache will
      disappear; and your black locks, though wound twice about your ears, will
      take leave of your pate, or my name is not Terentiy Korzh." So saying, he
      gave him such a taste of his fist in the nape of his neck, that all grew
      dark before Peter, and he flew headlong out of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was an end of their kissing. Sorrow fell upon our turtle doves;
      and a rumour grew rife in the village that a certain Pole, all embroidered
      with gold, with moustaches, sabre, spurs, and pockets jingling like the
      bells of the bag with which our sacristan Taras goes through the church
      every day, had begun to frequent Korzh's house. Now, it is well known why
      a father has visitors when there is a black-browed daughter about. So, one
      day, Pidorka burst into tears, and caught the hand of her brother Ivas.
      "Ivas, my dear! Ivas, my love! fly to Peter, my child of gold, like an
      arrow from a bow. Tell him all: I would have loved his brown eyes, I would
      have kissed his fair face, but my fate decrees otherwise. More than one
      handkerchief have I wet with burning tears. I am sad and heavy at heart.
      And my own father is my enemy. I will not marry the Pole, whom I do not
      love. Tell him they are making ready for a wedding, but there will be no
      music at our wedding: priests will sing instead of pipes and viols. I
      shall not dance with my bridegroom: they will carry me out. Dark, dark
      will be my dwelling of maple wood; and, instead of chimneys, a cross will
      stand upon the roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stood petrified, without moving from the spot, when the innocent
      child lisped out Pidorka's words to him. "And I, wretched man, had thought
      to go to the Crimea and Turkey, to win gold and return to thee, my beauty!
      But it may not be. We have been overlooked by the evil eye. I too shall
      have a wedding, dear one; but no ecclesiastics will be present at that
      wedding. The black crow instead of the pope will caw over me; the bare
      plain will be my dwelling; the dark blue cloud my roof-tree. The eagle
      will claw out my brown eyes: the rain will wash my Cossack bones, and the
      whirlwinds dry them. But what am I? Of what should I complain? 'Tis clear
      God willed it so. If I am to be lost, then so be it!" and he went straight
      to the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      My late grandfather's aunt was somewhat surprised at seeing Peter at the
      tavern, at an hour when good men go to morning mass; and stared at him as
      though in a dream when he called for a jug of brandy, about half a
      pailful. But the poor fellow tried in vain to drown his woe. The vodka
      stung his tongue like nettles, and tasted more bitter than wormwood. He
      flung the jug from him upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have sorrowed enough, Cossack," growled a bass voice behind him. He
      looked round&mdash;it was Basavriuk! Ugh, what a face! His hair was like a
      brush, his eyes like those of a bull. "I know what you lack: here it is."
      As he spoke he jingled a leather purse which hung from his girdle and
      smiled diabolically. Peter shuddered. "Ha, ha, ha! how it shines!" he
      roared, shaking out ducats into his hands: "ha, ha, ha! how it jingles!
      And I only ask one thing for a whole pile of such shiners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the Evil One!" exclaimed Peter. "Give me them! I'm ready for
      anything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They struck hands upon it, and Basavriuk said, "You are just in time,
      Peter: to-morrow is St. John the Baptist's day. Only on this one night in
      the year does the fern blossom. I will await you at midnight in the Bear's
      ravine."
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not believe that chickens await the hour when the housewife brings
      their corn with as much anxiety as Peter awaited the evening. He kept
      looking to see whether the shadows of the trees were not lengthening,
      whether the sun was not turning red towards setting; and, the longer he
      watched, the more impatient he grew. How long it was! Evidently, God's day
      had lost its end somewhere. But now the sun has set. The sky is red only
      on one side, and it is already growing dark. It grows colder in the
      fields. It gets gloomier and gloomier, and at last quite dark. At last!
      With heart almost bursting from his bosom, he set out and cautiously made
      his way down through the thick woods into the deep hollow called the
      Bear's ravine. Basavriuk was already waiting there. It was so dark that
      you could not see a yard before you. Hand in hand they entered the ravine,
      pushing through the luxuriant thorn-bushes and stumbling at almost every
      step. At last they reached an open spot. Peter looked about him: he had
      never chanced to come there before. Here Basavriuk halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see before you three hillocks? There are a great many kinds of
      flowers upon them. May some power keep you from plucking even one of them.
      But as soon as the fern blossoms, seize it, and look not round, no matter
      what may seem to be going on behind thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter wanted to ask some questions, but behold Basavriuk was no longer
      there. He approached the three hillocks&mdash;where were the flowers? He
      saw none. The wild steppe-grass grew all around, and hid everything in its
      luxuriance. But the lightning flashed; and before him was a whole bed of
      flowers, all wonderful, all strange: whilst amongst them there were also
      the simple fronds of fern. Peter doubted his senses, and stood
      thoughtfully before them, arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What manner of prodigy is this? why, one can see these weeds ten times a
      day. What is there marvellous about them? Devil's face must be mocking
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But behold! the tiny flower-bud of the fern reddened and moved as though
      alive. It was a marvel in truth. It grew larger and larger, and glowed
      like a burning coal. The tiny stars of light flashed up, something burst
      softly, and the flower opened before his eyes like a flame, lighting the
      others about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now is the time," thought Peter, and extended his hand. He saw hundreds
      of hairy hands reach also for the flower from behind him, and there was a
      sound of scampering in his rear. He half closed his eyes, and plucked
      sharply at the stalk, and the flower remained in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All became still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a stump sat Basavriuk, quite blue like a corpse. He did not move so
      much as a finger. Hi eyes were immovably fixed on something visible to him
      alone; his mouth was half open and speechless. Nothing stirred around.
      Ugh! it was horrible! But then a whistle was heard which made Peter's
      heart grow cold within him; and it seemed to him that the grass whispered,
      and the flowers began to talk among themselves in delicate voices, like
      little silver bells, while the trees rustled in murmuring contention;&mdash;Basavriuk's
      face suddenly became full of life, and his eyes sparkled. "The witch has
      just returned," he muttered between his teeth. "Hearken, Peter: a charmer
      will stand before you in a moment; do whatever she commands; if not&mdash;you
      are lost forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he parted the thorn-bushes with a knotty stick and before him stood a
      tiny farmhouse. Basavriuk smote it with his fist, and the wall trembled. A
      large black dog ran out to meet them, and with a whine transformed itself
      into a cat and flew straight at his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be angry, don't be angry, you old Satan!" said Basavriuk, employing
      such words as would have made a good man stop his ears. Behold, instead of
      a cat, an old woman all bent into a bow, with a face wrinkled like a baked
      apple, and a nose and chin like a pair of nutcrackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine charmer!" thought Peter; and cold chills ran down his back. The
      witch tore the flower from his hand, stooped and muttered over it for a
      long time, sprinkling it with some kind of water. Sparks flew from her
      mouth, and foam appeared on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throw it away," she said, giving it back to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter threw it, but what wonder was this? The flower did not fall straight
      to the earth, but for a long while twinkled like a fiery ball through the
      darkness, and swam through the air like a boat. At last it began to sink
      lower and lower, and fell so far away that the little star, hardly larger
      than a poppy-seed, was barely visible. "There!" croaked the old woman, in
      a dull voice: and Basavriuk, giving him a spade, said, "Dig here, Peter:
      you will find more gold than you or Korzh ever dreamed of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter spat on his hands, seized the spade, pressed his foot on it, and
      turned up the earth, a second, a third, a fourth time. The spade clinked
      against something hard, and would go no further. Then his eyes began to
      distinguish a small, iron-bound coffer. He tried to seize it; but the
      chest began to sink into the earth, deeper, farther, and deeper still:
      whilst behind him he heard a laugh like a serpent's hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you shall not have the gold until you shed human blood," said the
      witch, and she led up to him a child of six, covered with a white sheet,
      and indicated by a sign that he was to cut off his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was stunned. A trifle, indeed, to cut off a man's, or even an
      innocent child's, head for no reason whatever! In wrath he tore off the
      sheet enveloping the victim's head, and behold! before him stood Ivas. The
      poor child crossed his little hands, and hung his head. Peter flew at the
      witch with the knife like a madman, and was on the point of laying hands
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you promise for the girl?" thundered Basavriuk; and like a shot
      he was on his back. The witch stamped her foot: a blue flame flashed from
      the earth and illumined all within it. The earth became transparent as if
      moulded of crystal; and all that was within it became visible, as if in
      the palm of the hand. Ducats, precious stones in chests and pots, were
      piled in heaps beneath the very spot they stood on. Peter's eyes flashed,
      his mind grew troubled.... He grasped the knife like a madman, and the
      innocent blood spurted into his eyes. Diabolical laughter resounded on all
      sides. Misshapen monsters flew past him in flocks. The witch, fastening
      her hands in the headless trunk, like a wolf, drank its blood. His head
      whirled. Collecting all his strength, he set out to run. Everything grew
      red before him. The trees seemed steeped in blood, and burned and groaned.
      The sky glowed and threatened. Burning points, like lightning, flickered
      before his eyes. Utterly exhausted, he rushed into his miserable hovel and
      fell to the ground like a log. A death-like sleep overpowered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days and two nights did Peter sleep, without once awakening. When he
      came to himself, on the third day, he looked long at all the corners of
      his hut, but in vain did he endeavour to recollect what had taken place;
      his memory was like a miser's pocket, from which you cannot entice a
      quarter of a kopek. Stretching himself, he heard something clash at his
      feet. He looked, there were two bags of gold. Then only, as if in a dream,
      he recollected that he had been seeking for treasure, and that something
      had frightened him in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Korzh saw the sacks&mdash;and was mollified. "A fine fellow, Peter, quite
      unequalled! yes, and did I not love him? Was he not to me as my own son?"
      And the old fellow repeated this fiction until he wept over it himself.
      Pidorka began to tell Peter how some passing gipsies had stolen Ivas; but
      he could not even recall him&mdash;to such a degree had the Devil's
      influence darkened his mind! There was no reason for delay. The Pole was
      dismissed, and the wedding-feast prepared; rolls were baked, towels and
      handkerchiefs embroidered; the young people were seated at table; the
      wedding-loaf was cut; guitars, cymbals, pipes, viols sounded, and pleasure
      was rife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wedding in the olden times was not like one of the present day. My
      grandfather's aunt used to tell how the maidens&mdash;in festive
      head-dresses of yellow, blue, and pink ribbons, above which they bound
      gold braid; in thin chemisettes embroidered on all the seams with red
      silk, and strewn with tiny silver flowers; in morocco shoes, with high
      iron heels&mdash;danced the gorlitza as swimmingly as peacocks, and as
      wildly as the whirlwind; how the youths&mdash;with their ship-shaped caps
      upon their heads, the crowns of gold brocade, and two horns projecting,
      one in front and another behind, of the very finest black lambskin; in
      tunics of the finest blue silk with red borders&mdash;stepped forward one
      by one, their arms akimbo in stately form, and executed the gopak; how the
      lads&mdash;in tall Cossack caps, and light cloth gaberdines, girt with
      silver embroidered belts, their short pipes in their teeth&mdash;skipped
      before them and talked nonsense. Even Korzh as he gazed at the young
      people could not help getting gay in his old age. Guitar in hand,
      alternately puffing at his pipe and singing, a brandy-glass upon his head,
      the greybeard began the national dance amid loud shouts from the
      merry-makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will not people devise in merry mood? They even began to disguise
      their faces till they did not look like human beings. On such occasions
      one would dress himself as a Jew, another as the Devil: they would begin
      by kissing each other, and end by seizing each other by the hair. God be
      with them! you laughed till you held your sides. They dressed themselves
      in Turkish and Tatar garments. All upon them glowed like a conflagration,
      and then they began to joke and play pranks....
    </p>
    <p>
      An amusing thing happened to my grandfather's aunt, who was at this
      wedding. She was wearing an ample Tatar robe, and, wine-glass in hand, was
      entertaining the company. The Evil One instigated one man to pour vodka
      over her from behind. Another, at the same moment, evidently not by
      accident, struck a light, and held it to her. The flame flashed up, and
      poor aunt, in terror, flung her dress off, before them all. Screams,
      laughter, jests, arose as if at a fair. In a word, the old folks could not
      recall so merry a wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pidorka and Peter began to live like a gentleman and lady. There was
      plenty of everything and everything was fine.... But honest folk shook
      their heads when they marked their way of living. "From the Devil no good
      can come," they unanimously agreed. "Whence, except from the tempter of
      orthodox people, came this wealth? Where else could he have got such a lot
      of gold from? Why, on the very day that he got rich, did Basavriuk vanish
      as if into thin air?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Say, if you can, that people only imagine things! A month had not passed,
      and no one would have recognised Peter. He sat in one spot, saying no word
      to any one; but continually thinking and seemingly trying to recall
      something. When Pidorka succeeded in getting him to speak, he appeared to
      forget himself, and would carry on a conversation, and even grow cheerful;
      but if he inadvertently glanced at the sacks, "Stop, stop! I have
      forgotten," he would cry, and again plunge into reverie and strive to
      recall something. Sometimes when he sat still a long time in one place, it
      seemed to him as though it were coming, just coming back to mind, but
      again all would fade away. It seemed as if he was sitting in the tavern:
      they brought him vodka; vodka stung him; vodka was repulsive to him. Some
      one came along and struck him on the shoulder; but beyond that everything
      was veiled in darkness before him. The perspiration would stream down his
      face, and he would sit exhausted in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did not Pirdorka do? She consulted the sorceresses; and they poured
      out fear, and brewed stomach ache (2)&mdash;but all to no avail. And so
      the summer passed. Many a Cossack had mowed and reaped; many a Cossack,
      more enterprising than the rest, had set off upon an expedition. Flocks of
      ducks were already crowding the marshes, but there was not even a hint of
      improvement.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) "To pour out fear" refers to a practice resorted to in case of
    fear. When it is desired to know what caused this, melted lead or
    wax is poured into water, and the object whose form it assumes is
    the one which frightened the sick person; after this, the fear
    departs. Sonyashnitza is brewed for giddiness and pain in the
    bowels. To this end, a bit of stump is burned, thrown into a jug,
    and turned upside down into a bowl filled with water, which is
    placed on the patient's stomach: after an incantation, he is given
    a spoonful of this water to drink.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was red upon the steppes. Ricks of grain, like Cossack's caps, dotted
      the fields here and there. On the highway were to be encountered waggons
      loaded with brushwood and logs. The ground had become more solid, and in
      places was touched with frost. Already had the snow begun to fall and the
      branches of the trees were covered with rime like rabbit-skin. Already on
      frosty days the robin redbreast hopped about on the snow-heaps like a
      foppish Polish nobleman, and picked out grains of corn; and children, with
      huge sticks, played hockey upon the ice; while their fathers lay quietly
      on the stove, issuing forth at intervals with lighted pipes in their lips,
      to growl, in regular fashion, at the orthodox frost, or to take the air,
      and thresh the grain spread out in the barn. At last the snow began to
      melt, and the ice slipped away: but Peter remained the same; and, the more
      time went on, the more morose he grew. He sat in the cottage as though
      nailed to the spot, with the sacks of gold at his feet. He grew averse to
      companionship, his hair grew long, he became terrible to look at; and
      still he thought of but one thing, still he tried to recall something, and
      got angry and ill-tempered because he could not. Often, rising wildly from
      his seat, he gesticulated violently and fixed his eyes on something as
      though desirous of catching it: his lips moving as though desirous of
      uttering some long-forgotten word, but remaining speechless. Fury would
      take possession of him: he would gnaw and bite his hands like a man half
      crazy, and in his vexation would tear out his hair by the handful, until,
      calming down, he would relapse into forgetfulness, as it were, and then
      would again strive to recall the past and be again seized with fury and
      fresh tortures. What visitation of God was this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pidorka was neither dead not alive. At first it was horrible for her to
      remain alone with him in the cottage; but, in course of time, the poor
      woman grew accustomed to her sorrow. But it was impossible to recognise
      the Pidorka of former days. No blushes, no smiles: she was thin and worn
      with grief, and had wept her bright eyes away. Once some one who took pity
      on her advised her to go to the witch who dwelt in the Bear's ravine, and
      enjoyed the reputation of being able to cure every disease in the world.
      She determined to try that last remedy: and finally persuaded the old
      woman to come to her. This was on St. John's Eve, as it chanced. Peter lay
      insensible on the bench, and did not observe the newcomer. Slowly he rose,
      and looked about him. Suddenly he trembled in every limb, as though he
      were on the scaffold: his hair rose upon his head, and he laughed a laugh
      that filled Pidorka's heart with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have remembered, remembered!" he cried, in terrible joy; and, swinging
      a hatchet round his head, he struck at the old woman with all his might.
      The hatchet penetrated the oaken door nearly four inches. The old woman
      disappeared; and a child of seven, covered in a white sheet, stood in the
      middle of the cottage.... The sheet flew off. "Ivas!" cried Pidorka, and
      ran to him; but the apparition became covered from head to foot with
      blood, and illumined the whole room with red light....
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran into the passage in her terror, but, on recovering herself a
      little, wished to help Peter. In vain! the door had slammed to behind her,
      so that she could not open it. People ran up, and began to knock: they
      broke in the door, as though there were but one mind among them. The whole
      cottage was full of smoke; and just in the middle, where Peter had stood,
      was a heap of ashes whence smoke was still rising. They flung themselves
      upon the sacks: only broken potsherds lay there instead of ducats. The
      Cossacks stood with staring eyes and open mouths, as if rooted to the
      earth, not daring to move a hair, such terror did this wonder inspire in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not remember what happened next. Pidorka made a vow to go upon a
      pilgrimage, collected the property left her by her father, and in a few
      days it was as if she had never been in the village. Whither she had gone,
      no one could tell. Officious old women would have despatched her to the
      same place whither Peter had gone; but a Cossack from Kief reported that
      he had seen, in a cloister, a nun withered to a mere skeleton who prayed
      unceasingly. Her fellow-villagers recognised her as Pidorka by the tokens&mdash;that
      no one heard her utter a word; and that she had come on foot, and had
      brought a frame for the picture of God's mother, set with such brilliant
      stones that all were dazzled at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not the end, if you please. On the same day that the Evil One
      made away with Peter, Basavriuk appeared again; but all fled from him.
      They knew what sort of a being he was&mdash;none else than Satan, who had
      assumed human form in order to unearth treasures; and, since treasures do
      not yield to unclean hands, he seduced the young. That same year, all
      deserted their earthen huts and collected in a village; but even there
      there was no peace on account of that accursed Basavriuk.
    </p>
    <p>
      My late grandfather's aunt said that he was particularly angry with her
      because she had abandoned her former tavern, and tried with all his might
      to revenge himself upon her. Once the village elders were assembled in the
      tavern, and, as the saying goes, were arranging the precedence at the
      table, in the middle of which was placed a small roasted lamb, shame to
      say. They chattered about this, that, and the other&mdash;among the rest
      about various marvels and strange things. Well, they saw something; it
      would have been nothing if only one had seen it, but all saw it, and it
      was this: the sheep raised his head, his goggling eyes became alive and
      sparkled; and the black, bristling moustache, which appeared for one
      instant, made a significant gesture at those present. All at once
      recognised Basavriuk's countenance in the sheep's head; my grandfather's
      aunt thought it was on the point of asking for vodka. The worthy elders
      seized their hats and hastened home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time, the church elder himself, who was fond of an occasional
      private interview with my grandfather's brandy-glass, had not succeeded in
      getting to the bottom twice, when he beheld the glass bowing very low to
      him. "Satan take you, let us make the sign of the cross over you!"&mdash;And
      the same marvel happened to his better half. She had just begun to mix the
      dough in a huge kneading-trough when suddenly the trough sprang up. "Stop,
      stop! where are you going?" Putting its arms akimbo, with dignity, it went
      skipping all about the cottage&mdash;you may laugh, but it was no laughing
      matter to our grandfathers. And in vain did Father Athanasii go through
      all the village with holy water, and chase the Devil through all the
      streets with his brush. My late grandfather's aunt long complained that,
      as soon as it was dark, some one came knocking at her door and scratching
      at the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! All appears to be quiet now in the place where our village stands;
      but it was not so very long ago&mdash;my father was still alive&mdash;that
      I remember how a good man could not pass the ruined tavern which a
      dishonest race had long managed for their own interest. From the
      smoke-blackened chimneys smoke poured out in a pillar, and rising high in
      the air, rolled off like a cap, scattering burning coals over the steppe;
      and Satan (the son of a dog should not be mentioned) sobbed so pitifully
      in his lair that the startled ravens rose in flocks from the neighbouring
      oak-wood and flew through the air with wild cries.

    <h2>
      THE CLOAK
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the department of&mdash;but it is better not to mention the department.
      There is nothing more irritable than departments, regiments, courts of
      justice, and, in a word, every branch of public service. Each individual
      attached to them nowadays thinks all society insulted in his person. Quite
      recently a complaint was received from a justice of the peace, in which he
      plainly demonstrated that all the imperial institutions were going to the
      dogs, and that the Czar's sacred name was being taken in vain; and in
      proof he appended to the complaint a romance in which the justice of the
      peace is made to appear about once every ten lines, and sometimes in a
      drunken condition. Therefore, in order to avoid all unpleasantness, it
      will be better to describe the department in question only as a certain
      department.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in a certain department there was a certain official&mdash;not a very
      high one, it must be allowed&mdash;short of stature, somewhat pock-marked,
      red-haired, and short-sighted, with a bald forehead, wrinkled cheeks, and
      a complexion of the kind known as sanguine. The St. Petersburg climate was
      responsible for this. As for his official status, he was what is called a
      perpetual titular councillor, over which, as is well known, some writers
      make merry, and crack their jokes, obeying the praiseworthy custom of
      attacking those who cannot bite back.
    </p>
    <p>
      His family name was Bashmatchkin. This name is evidently derived from
      "bashmak" (shoe); but when, at what time, and in what manner, is not
      known. His father and grandfather, and all the Bashmatchkins, always wore
      boots, which only had new heels two or three times a year. His name was
      Akakiy Akakievitch. It may strike the reader as rather singular and
      far-fetched, but he may rest assured that it was by no means far-fetched,
      and that the circumstances were such that it would have been impossible to
      give him any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how it came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch was born, if my memory fails me not, in the evening of
      the 23rd of March. His mother, the wife of a Government official and a
      very fine woman, made all due arrangements for having the child baptised.
      She was lying on the bed opposite the door; on her right stood the
      godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Eroshkin, a most estimable man, who served as
      presiding officer of the senate, while the godmother, Anna Semenovna
      Byelobrushkova, the wife of an officer of the quarter, and a woman of rare
      virtues. They offered the mother her choice of three names, Mokiya,
      Sossiya, or that the child should be called after the martyr Khozdazat.
      "No," said the good woman, "all those names are poor." In order to please
      her they opened the calendar to another place; three more names appeared,
      Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy. "This is a judgment," said the old woman.
      "What names! I truly never heard the like. Varada or Varukh might have
      been borne, but not Triphiliy and Varakhasiy!" They turned to another page
      and found Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy. "Now I see," said the old woman,
      "that it is plainly fate. And since such is the case, it will be better to
      name him after his father. His father's name was Akakiy, so let his son's
      be Akakiy too." In this manner he became Akakiy Akakievitch. They
      christened the child, whereat he wept and made a grimace, as though he
      foresaw that he was to be a titular councillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner did it all come about. We have mentioned it in order that
      the reader might see for himself that it was a case of necessity, and that
      it was utterly impossible to give him any other name. When and how he
      entered the department, and who appointed him, no one could remember.
      However much the directors and chiefs of all kinds were changed, he was
      always to be seen in the same place, the same attitude, the same
      occupation; so that it was afterwards affirmed that he had been born in
      undress uniform with a bald head. No respect was shown him in the
      department. The porter not only did not rise from his seat when he passed,
      but never even glanced at him, any more than if a fly had flown through
      the reception-room. His superiors treated him in coolly despotic fashion.
      Some sub-chief would thrust a paper under his nose without so much as
      saying, "Copy," or "Here's a nice interesting affair," or anything else
      agreeable, as is customary amongst well-bred officials. And he took it,
      looking only at the paper and not observing who handed it to him, or
      whether he had the right to do so; simply took it, and set about copying
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young officials laughed at and made fun of him, so far as their
      official wit permitted; told in his presence various stories concocted
      about him, and about his landlady, an old woman of seventy; declared that
      she beat him; asked when the wedding was to be; and strewed bits of paper
      over his head, calling them snow. But Akakiy Akakievitch answered not a
      word, any more than if there had been no one there besides himself. It
      even had no effect upon his work: amid all these annoyances he never made
      a single mistake in a letter. But if the joking became wholly unbearable,
      as when they jogged his hand and prevented his attending to his work, he
      would exclaim, "Leave me alone! Why do you insult me?" And there was
      something strange in the words and the voice in which they were uttered.
      There was in it something which moved to pity; so much that one young man,
      a new-comer, who, taking pattern by the others, had permitted himself to
      make sport of Akakiy, suddenly stopped short, as though all about him had
      undergone a transformation, and presented itself in a different aspect.
      Some unseen force repelled him from the comrades whose acquaintance he had
      made, on the supposition that they were well-bred and polite men. Long
      afterwards, in his gayest moments, there recurred to his mind the little
      official with the bald forehead, with his heart-rending words, "Leave me
      alone! Why do you insult me?" In these moving words, other words resounded&mdash;"I
      am thy brother." And the young man covered his face with his hand; and
      many a time afterwards, in the course of his life, shuddered at seeing how
      much inhumanity there is in man, how much savage coarseness is concealed
      beneath delicate, refined worldliness, and even, O God! in that man whom
      the world acknowledges as honourable and noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to find another man who lived so entirely for his
      duties. It is not enough to say that Akakiy laboured with zeal: no, he
      laboured with love. In his copying, he found a varied and agreeable
      employment. Enjoyment was written on his face: some letters were even
      favourites with him; and when he encountered these, he smiled, winked, and
      worked with his lips, till it seemed as though each letter might be read
      in his face, as his pen traced it. If his pay had been in proportion to
      his zeal, he would, perhaps, to his great surprise, have been made even a
      councillor of state. But he worked, as his companions, the wits, put it,
      like a horse in a mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it is impossible to say that no attention was paid to him. One
      director being a kindly man, and desirous of rewarding him for his long
      service, ordered him to be given something more important than mere
      copying. So he was ordered to make a report of an already concluded affair
      to another department: the duty consisting simply in changing the heading
      and altering a few words from the first to the third person. This caused
      him so much toil that he broke into a perspiration, rubbed his forehead,
      and finally said, "No, give me rather something to copy." After that they
      let him copy on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside this copying, it appeared that nothing existed for him. He gave no
      thought to his clothes: his undress uniform was not green, but a sort of
      rusty-meal colour. The collar was low, so that his neck, in spite of the
      fact that it was not long, seemed inordinately so as it emerged from it,
      like the necks of those plaster cats which wag their heads, and are
      carried about upon the heads of scores of image sellers. And something was
      always sticking to his uniform, either a bit of hay or some trifle.
      Moreover, he had a peculiar knack, as he walked along the street, of
      arriving beneath a window just as all sorts of rubbish were being flung
      out of it: hence he always bore about on his hat scraps of melon rinds and
      other such articles. Never once in his life did he give heed to what was
      going on every day in the street; while it is well known that his young
      brother officials train the range of their glances till they can see when
      any one's trouser straps come undone upon the opposite sidewalk, which
      always brings a malicious smile to their faces. But Akakiy Akakievitch saw
      in all things the clean, even strokes of his written lines; and only when
      a horse thrust his nose, from some unknown quarter, over his shoulder, and
      sent a whole gust of wind down his neck from his nostrils, did he observe
      that he was not in the middle of a page, but in the middle of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home, he sat down at once at the table, supped his cabbage
      soup up quickly, and swallowed a bit of beef with onions, never noticing
      their taste, and gulping down everything with flies and anything else
      which the Lord happened to send at the moment. His stomach filled, he rose
      from the table, and copied papers which he had brought home. If there
      happened to be none, he took copies for himself, for his own
      gratification, especially if the document was noteworthy, not on account
      of its style, but of its being addressed to some distinguished person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at the hour when the grey St. Petersburg sky had quite dispersed, and
      all the official world had eaten or dined, each as he could, in accordance
      with the salary he received and his own fancy; when all were resting from
      the departmental jar of pens, running to and fro from their own and other
      people's indispensable occupations, and from all the work that an uneasy
      man makes willingly for himself, rather than what is necessary; when
      officials hasten to dedicate to pleasure the time which is left to them,
      one bolder than the rest going to the theatre; another, into the street
      looking under all the bonnets; another wasting his evening in compliments
      to some pretty girl, the star of a small official circle; another&mdash;and
      this is the common case of all&mdash;visiting his comrades on the fourth
      or third floor, in two small rooms with an ante-room or kitchen, and some
      pretensions to fashion, such as a lamp or some other trifle which has cost
      many a sacrifice of dinner or pleasure trip; in a word, at the hour when
      all officials disperse among the contracted quarters of their friends, to
      play whist, as they sip their tea from glasses with a kopek's worth of
      sugar, smoke long pipes, relate at times some bits of gossip which a
      Russian man can never, under any circumstances, refrain from, and, when
      there is nothing else to talk of, repeat eternal anecdotes about the
      commandant to whom they had sent word that the tails of the horses on the
      Falconet Monument had been cut off, when all strive to divert themselves,
      Akakiy Akakievitch indulged in no kind of diversion. No one could ever say
      that he had seen him at any kind of evening party. Having written to his
      heart's content, he lay down to sleep, smiling at the thought of the
      coming day&mdash;of what God might send him to copy on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus flowed on the peaceful life of the man, who, with a salary of four
      hundred rubles, understood how to be content with his lot; and thus it
      would have continued to flow on, perhaps, to extreme old age, were it not
      that there are various ills strewn along the path of life for titular
      councillors as well as for private, actual, court, and every other species
      of councillor, even for those who never give any advice or take any
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There exists in St. Petersburg a powerful foe of all who receive a salary
      of four hundred rubles a year, or thereabouts. This foe is no other than
      the Northern cold, although it is said to be very healthy. At nine o'clock
      in the morning, at the very hour when the streets are filled with men
      bound for the various official departments, it begins to bestow such
      powerful and piercing nips on all noses impartially that the poor
      officials really do not know what to do with them. At an hour when the
      foreheads of even those who occupy exalted positions ache with the cold,
      and tears start to their eyes, the poor titular councillors are sometimes
      quite unprotected. Their only salvation lies in traversing as quickly as
      possible, in their thin little cloaks, five or six streets, and then
      warming their feet in the porter's room, and so thawing all their talents
      and qualifications for official service, which had become frozen on the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch had felt for some time that his back and shoulders
      suffered with peculiar poignancy, in spite of the fact that he tried to
      traverse the distance with all possible speed. He began finally to wonder
      whether the fault did not lie in his cloak. He examined it thoroughly at
      home, and discovered that in two places, namely, on the back and
      shoulders, it had become thin as gauze: the cloth was worn to such a
      degree that he could see through it, and the lining had fallen into
      pieces. You must know that Akakiy Akakievitch's cloak served as an object
      of ridicule to the officials: they even refused it the noble name of
      cloak, and called it a cape. In fact, it was of singular make: its collar
      diminishing year by year, but serving to patch its other parts. The
      patching did not exhibit great skill on the part of the tailor, and was,
      in fact, baggy and ugly. Seeing how the matter stood, Akakiy Akakievitch
      decided that it would be necessary to take the cloak to Petrovitch, the
      tailor, who lived somewhere on the fourth floor up a dark stair-case, and
      who, in spite of his having but one eye, and pock-marks all over his face,
      busied himself with considerable success in repairing the trousers and
      coats of officials and others; that is to say, when he was sober and not
      nursing some other scheme in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to say much about this tailor; but, as it is the
      custom to have the character of each personage in a novel clearly defined,
      there is no help for it, so here is Petrovitch the tailor. At first he was
      called only Grigoriy, and was some gentleman's serf; he commenced calling
      himself Petrovitch from the time when he received his free papers, and
      further began to drink heavily on all holidays, at first on the great
      ones, and then on all church festivities without discrimination, wherever
      a cross stood in the calendar. On this point he was faithful to ancestral
      custom; and when quarrelling with his wife, he called her a low female and
      a German. As we have mentioned his wife, it will be necessary to say a
      word or two about her. Unfortunately, little is known of her beyond the
      fact that Petrovitch has a wife, who wears a cap and a dress; but cannot
      lay claim to beauty, at least, no one but the soldiers of the guard even
      looked under her cap when they met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending the staircase which led to Petrovitch's room&mdash;which
      staircase was all soaked with dish-water, and reeked with the smell of
      spirits which affects the eyes, and is an inevitable adjunct to all dark
      stairways in St. Petersburg houses&mdash;ascending the stairs, Akakiy
      Akakievitch pondered how much Petrovitch would ask, and mentally resolved
      not to give more than two rubles. The door was open; for the mistress, in
      cooking some fish, had raised such a smoke in the kitchen that not even
      the beetles were visible. Akakiy Akakievitch passed through the kitchen
      unperceived, even by the housewife, and at length reached a room where he
      beheld Petrovitch seated on a large unpainted table, with his legs tucked
      under him like a Turkish pasha. His feet were bare, after the fashion of
      tailors who sit at work; and the first thing which caught the eye was his
      thumb, with a deformed nail thick and strong as a turtle's shell. About
      Petrovitch's neck hung a skein of silk and thread, and upon his knees lay
      some old garment. He had been trying unsuccessfully for three minutes to
      thread his needle, and was enraged at the darkness and even at the thread,
      growling in a low voice, "It won't go through, the barbarian! you pricked
      me, you rascal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch was vexed at arriving at the precise moment when
      Petrovitch was angry; he liked to order something of Petrovitch when the
      latter was a little downhearted, or, as his wife expressed it, "when he
      had settled himself with brandy, the one-eyed devil!" Under such
      circumstances, Petrovitch generally came down in his price very readily,
      and even bowed and returned thanks. Afterwards, to be sure, his wife would
      come, complaining that her husband was drunk, and so had fixed the price
      too low; but, if only a ten-kopek piece were added, then the matter was
      settled. But now it appeared that Petrovitch was in a sober condition, and
      therefore rough, taciturn, and inclined to demand, Satan only knows what
      price. Akakiy Akakievitch felt this, and would gladly have beat a retreat;
      but he was in for it. Petrovitch screwed up his one eye very intently at
      him, and Akakiy Akakievitch involuntarily said: "How do you do,
      Petrovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you a good morning, sir," said Petrovitch, squinting at Akakiy
      Akakievitch's hands, to see what sort of booty he had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I&mdash;to you, Petrovitch, this&mdash;" It must be known that Akakiy
      Akakievitch expressed himself chiefly by prepositions, adverbs, and scraps
      of phrases which had no meaning whatever. If the matter was a very
      difficult one, he had a habit of never completing his sentences; so that
      frequently, having begun a phrase with the words, "This, in fact, is quite&mdash;"
      he forgot to go on, thinking that he had already finished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked Petrovitch, and with his one eye scanned Akakievitch's
      whole uniform from the collar down to the cuffs, the back, the tails and
      the button-holes, all of which were well known to him, since they were his
      own handiwork. Such is the habit of tailors; it is the first thing they do
      on meeting one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I, here, this&mdash;Petrovitch&mdash;a cloak, cloth&mdash;here you
      see, everywhere, in different places, it is quite strong&mdash;it is a
      little dusty, and looks old, but it is new, only here in one place it is a
      little&mdash;on the back, and here on one of the shoulders, it is a little
      worn, yes, here on this shoulder it is a little&mdash;do you see? that is
      all. And a little work&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrovitch took the cloak, spread it out, to begin with, on the table,
      looked hard at it, shook his head, reached out his hand to the window-sill
      for his snuff-box, adorned with the portrait of some general, though what
      general is unknown, for the place where the face should have been had been
      rubbed through by the finger, and a square bit of paper had been pasted
      over it. Having taken a pinch of snuff, Petrovitch held up the cloak, and
      inspected it against the light, and again shook his head once more. After
      which he again lifted the general-adorned lid with its bit of pasted
      paper, and having stuffed his nose with snuff, closed and put away the
      snuff-box, and said finally, "No, it is impossible to mend it; it's a
      wretched garment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch's heart sank at these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is it impossible, Petrovitch?" he said, almost in the pleading voice
      of a child; "all that ails it is, that it is worn on the shoulders. You
      must have some pieces&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, patches could be found, patches are easily found," said Petrovitch,
      "but there's nothing to sew them to. The thing is completely rotten; if
      you put a needle to it&mdash;see, it will give way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it give way, and you can put on another patch at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is nothing to put the patches on to; there's no use in
      strengthening it; it is too far gone. It's lucky that it's cloth; for, if
      the wind were to blow, it would fly away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, strengthen it again. How will this, in fact&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Petrovitch decisively, "there is nothing to be done with it.
      It's a thoroughly bad job. You'd better, when the cold winter weather
      comes on, make yourself some gaiters out of it, because stockings are not
      warm. The Germans invented them in order to make more money." Petrovitch
      loved, on all occasions, to have a fling at the Germans. "But it is plain
      you must have a new cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word "new," all grew dark before Akakiy Akakievitch's eyes, and
      everything in the room began to whirl round. The only thing he saw clearly
      was the general with the paper face on the lid of Petrovitch's snuff-box.
      "A new one?" said he, as if still in a dream: "why, I have no money for
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a new one," said Petrovitch, with barbarous composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it came to a new one, how would it&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean how much would it cost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you would have to lay out a hundred and fifty or more," said
      Petrovitch, and pursed up his lips significantly. He liked to produce
      powerful effects, liked to stun utterly and suddenly, and then to glance
      sideways to see what face the stunned person would put on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred and fifty rubles for a cloak!" shrieked poor Akakiy
      Akakievitch, perhaps for the first time in his life, for his voice had
      always been distinguished for softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Petrovitch, "for any kind of cloak. If you have a marten
      fur on the collar, or a silk-lined hood, it will mount up to two hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Petrovitch, please," said Akakiy Akakievitch in a beseeching tone, not
      hearing, and not trying to hear, Petrovitch's words, and disregarding all
      his "effects," "some repairs, in order that it may wear yet a little
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it would only be a waste of time and money," said Petrovitch; and
      Akakiy Akakievitch went away after these words, utterly discouraged. But
      Petrovitch stood for some time after his departure, with significantly
      compressed lips, and without betaking himself to his work, satisfied that
      he would not be dropped, and an artistic tailor employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch went out into the street as if in a dream. "Such an
      affair!" he said to himself: "I did not think it had come to&mdash;" and
      then after a pause, he added, "Well, so it is! see what it has come to at
      last! and I never imagined that it was so!" Then followed a long silence,
      after which he exclaimed, "Well, so it is! see what already&mdash;nothing
      unexpected that&mdash;it would be nothing&mdash;what a strange
      circumstance!" So saying, instead of going home, he went in exactly the
      opposite direction without himself suspecting it. On the way, a
      chimney-sweep bumped up against him, and blackened his shoulder, and a
      whole hatful of rubbish landed on him from the top of a house which was
      building. He did not notice it; and only when he ran against a watchman,
      who, having planted his halberd beside him, was shaking some snuff from
      his box into his horny hand, did he recover himself a little, and that
      because the watchman said, "Why are you poking yourself into a man's very
      face? Haven't you the pavement?" This caused him to look about him, and
      turn towards home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There only, he finally began to collect his thoughts, and to survey his
      position in its clear and actual light, and to argue with himself,
      sensibly and frankly, as with a reasonable friend with whom one can
      discuss private and personal matters. "No," said Akakiy Akakievitch, "it
      is impossible to reason with Petrovitch now; he is that&mdash;evidently
      his wife has been beating him. I'd better go to him on Sunday morning;
      after Saturday night he will be a little cross-eyed and sleepy, for he
      will want to get drunk, and his wife won't give him any money; and at such
      a time, a ten-kopek piece in his hand will&mdash;he will become more fit
      to reason with, and then the cloak, and that&mdash;" Thus argued Akakiy
      Akakievitch with himself, regained his courage, and waited until the first
      Sunday, when, seeing from afar that Petrovitch's wife had left the house,
      he went straight to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrovitch's eye was, indeed, very much askew after Saturday: his head
      drooped, and he was very sleepy; but for all that, as soon as he knew what
      it was a question of, it seemed as though Satan jogged his memory.
      "Impossible," said he: "please to order a new one." Thereupon Akakiy
      Akakievitch handed over the ten-kopek piece. "Thank you, sir; I will drink
      your good health," said Petrovitch: "but as for the cloak, don't trouble
      yourself about it; it is good for nothing. I will make you a capital new
      one, so let us settle about it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch was still for mending it; but Petrovitch would not hear
      of it, and said, "I shall certainly have to make you a new one, and you
      may depend upon it that I shall do my best. It may even be, as the fashion
      goes, that the collar can be fastened by silver hooks under a flap."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Akakiy Akakievitch saw that it was impossible to get along without a
      new cloak, and his spirit sank utterly. How, in fact, was it to be done?
      Where was the money to come from? He might, to be sure, depend, in part,
      upon his present at Christmas; but that money had long been allotted
      beforehand. He must have some new trousers, and pay a debt of long
      standing to the shoemaker for putting new tops to his old boots, and he
      must order three shirts from the seamstress, and a couple of pieces of
      linen. In short, all his money must be spent; and even if the director
      should be so kind as to order him to receive forty-five rubles instead of
      forty, or even fifty, it would be a mere nothing, a mere drop in the ocean
      towards the funds necessary for a cloak: although he knew that Petrovitch
      was often wrong-headed enough to blurt out some outrageous price, so that
      even his own wife could not refrain from exclaiming, "Have you lost your
      senses, you fool?" At one time he would not work at any price, and now it
      was quite likely that he had named a higher sum than the cloak would cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although he knew that Petrovitch would undertake to make a cloak for
      eighty rubles, still, where was he to get the eighty rubles from? He might
      possibly manage half, yes, half might be procured, but where was the other
      half to come from? But the reader must first be told where the first half
      came from. Akakiy Akakievitch had a habit of putting, for every ruble he
      spent, a groschen into a small box, fastened with a lock and key, and with
      a slit in the top for the reception of money. At the end of every
      half-year he counted over the heap of coppers, and changed it for silver.
      This he had done for a long time, and in the course of years, the sum had
      mounted up to over forty rubles. Thus he had one half on hand; but where
      was he to find the other half? where was he to get another forty rubles
      from? Akakiy Akakievitch thought and thought, and decided that it would be
      necessary to curtail his ordinary expenses, for the space of one year at
      least, to dispense with tea in the evening; to burn no candles, and, if
      there was anything which he must do, to go into his landlady's room, and
      work by her light. When he went into the street, he must walk as lightly
      as he could, and as cautiously, upon the stones, almost upon tiptoe, in
      order not to wear his heels down in too short a time; he must give the
      laundress as little to wash as possible; and, in order not to wear out his
      clothes, he must take them off, as soon as he got home, and wear only his
      cotton dressing-gown, which had been long and carefully saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, it was a little hard for him at first to accustom
      himself to these deprivations; but he got used to them at length, after a
      fashion, and all went smoothly. He even got used to being hungry in the
      evening, but he made up for it by treating himself, so to say, in spirit,
      by bearing ever in mind the idea of his future cloak. From that time forth
      his existence seemed to become, in some way, fuller, as if he were
      married, or as if some other man lived in him, as if, in fact, he were not
      alone, and some pleasant friend had consented to travel along life's path
      with him, the friend being no other than the cloak, with thick wadding and
      a strong lining incapable of wearing out. He became more lively, and even
      his character grew firmer, like that of a man who has made up his mind,
      and set himself a goal. From his face and gait, doubt and indecision, all
      hesitating and wavering traits disappeared of themselves. Fire gleamed in
      his eyes, and occasionally the boldest and most daring ideas flitted
      through his mind; why not, for instance, have marten fur on the collar?
      The thought of this almost made him absent-minded. Once, in copying a
      letter, he nearly made a mistake, so that he exclaimed almost aloud,
      "Ugh!" and crossed himself. Once, in the course of every month, he had a
      conference with Petrovitch on the subject of the cloak, where it would be
      better to buy the cloth, and the colour, and the price. He always returned
      home satisfied, though troubled, reflecting that the time would come at
      last when it could all be bought, and then the cloak made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair progressed more briskly than he had expected. Far beyond all
      his hopes, the director awarded neither forty nor forty-five rubles for
      Akakiy Akakievitch's share, but sixty. Whether he suspected that Akakiy
      Akakievitch needed a cloak, or whether it was merely chance, at all
      events, twenty extra rubles were by this means provided. This circumstance
      hastened matters. Two or three months more of hunger and Akakiy
      Akakievitch had accumulated about eighty rubles. His heart, generally so
      quiet, began to throb. On the first possible day, he went shopping in
      company with Petrovitch. They bought some very good cloth, and at a
      reasonable rate too, for they had been considering the matter for six
      months, and rarely let a month pass without their visiting the shops to
      inquire prices. Petrovitch himself said that no better cloth could be had.
      For lining, they selected a cotton stuff, but so firm and thick that
      Petrovitch declared it to be better than silk, and even prettier and more
      glossy. They did not buy the marten fur, because it was, in fact, dear,
      but in its stead, they picked out the very best of cat-skin which could be
      found in the shop, and which might, indeed, be taken for marten at a
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrovitch worked at the cloak two whole weeks, for there was a great deal
      of quilting: otherwise it would have been finished sooner. He charged
      twelve rubles for the job, it could not possibly have been done for less.
      It was all sewed with silk, in small, double seams; and Petrovitch went
      over each seam afterwards with his own teeth, stamping in various
      patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was&mdash;it is difficult to say precisely on what day, but probably
      the most glorious one in Akakiy Akakievitch's life, when Petrovitch at
      length brought home the cloak. He brought it in the morning, before the
      hour when it was necessary to start for the department. Never did a cloak
      arrive so exactly in the nick of time; for the severe cold had set in, and
      it seemed to threaten to increase. Petrovitch brought the cloak himself as
      befits a good tailor. On his countenance was a significant expression,
      such as Akakiy Akakievitch had never beheld there. He seemed fully
      sensible that he had done no small deed, and crossed a gulf separating
      tailors who only put in linings, and execute repairs, from those who make
      new things. He took the cloak out of the pocket handkerchief in which he
      had brought it. The handkerchief was fresh from the laundress, and he put
      it in his pocket for use. Taking out the cloak, he gazed proudly at it,
      held it up with both hands, and flung it skilfully over the shoulders of
      Akakiy Akakievitch. Then he pulled it and fitted it down behind with his
      hand, and he draped it around Akakiy Akakievitch without buttoning it.
      Akakiy Akakievitch, like an experienced man, wished to try the sleeves.
      Petrovitch helped him on with them, and it turned out that the sleeves
      were satisfactory also. In short, the cloak appeared to be perfect, and
      most seasonable. Petrovitch did not neglect to observe that it was only
      because he lived in a narrow street, and had no signboard, and had known
      Akakiy Akakievitch so long, that he had made it so cheaply; but that if he
      had been in business on the Nevsky Prospect, he would have charged
      seventy-five rubles for the making alone. Akakiy Akakievitch did not care
      to argue this point with Petrovitch. He paid him, thanked him, and set out
      at once in his new cloak for the department. Petrovitch followed him, and,
      pausing in the street, gazed long at the cloak in the distance, after
      which he went to one side expressly to run through a crooked alley, and
      emerge again into the street beyond to gaze once more upon the cloak from
      another point, namely, directly in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Akakiy Akakievitch went on in holiday mood. He was conscious
      every second of the time that he had a new cloak on his shoulders; and
      several times he laughed with internal satisfaction. In fact, there were
      two advantages, one was its warmth, the other its beauty. He saw nothing
      of the road, but suddenly found himself at the department. He took off his
      cloak in the ante-room, looked it over carefully, and confided it to the
      especial care of the attendant. It is impossible to say precisely how it
      was that every one in the department knew at once that Akakiy Akakievitch
      had a new cloak, and that the "cape" no longer existed. All rushed at the
      same moment into the ante-room to inspect it. They congratulated him and
      said pleasant things to him, so that he began at first to smile and then
      to grow ashamed. When all surrounded him, and said that the new cloak must
      be "christened," and that he must give a whole evening at least to this,
      Akakiy Akakievitch lost his head completely, and did not know where he
      stood, what to answer, or how to get out of it. He stood blushing all over
      for several minutes, and was on the point of assuring them with great
      simplicity that it was not a new cloak, that it was so and so, that it was
      in fact the old "cape."
    </p>
    <p>
      At length one of the officials, a sub-chief probably, in order to show
      that he was not at all proud, and on good terms with his inferiors, said,
      "So be it, only I will give the party instead of Akakiy Akakievitch; I
      invite you all to tea with me to-night; it happens quite a propos, as it
      is my name-day." The officials naturally at once offered the sub-chief
      their congratulations and accepted the invitations with pleasure. Akakiy
      Akakievitch would have declined, but all declared that it was
      discourteous, that it was simply a sin and a shame, and that he could not
      possibly refuse. Besides, the notion became pleasant to him when he
      recollected that he should thereby have a chance of wearing his new cloak
      in the evening also.
    </p>
    <p>
      That whole day was truly a most triumphant festival day for Akakiy
      Akakievitch. He returned home in the most happy frame of mind, took off
      his cloak, and hung it carefully on the wall, admiring afresh the cloth
      and the lining. Then he brought out his old, worn-out cloak, for
      comparison. He looked at it and laughed, so vast was the difference. And
      long after dinner he laughed again when the condition of the "cape"
      recurred to his mind. He dined cheerfully, and after dinner wrote nothing,
      but took his ease for a while on the bed, until it got dark. Then he
      dressed himself leisurely, put on his cloak, and stepped out into the
      street. Where the host lived, unfortunately we cannot say: our memory
      begins to fail us badly; and the houses and streets in St. Petersburg have
      become so mixed up in our head that it is very difficult to get anything
      out of it again in proper form. This much is certain, that the official
      lived in the best part of the city; and therefore it must have been
      anything but near to Akakiy Akakievitch's residence. Akakiy Akakievitch
      was first obliged to traverse a kind of wilderness of deserted,
      dimly-lighted streets; but in proportion as he approached the official's
      quarter of the city, the streets became more lively, more populous, and
      more brilliantly illuminated. Pedestrians began to appear; handsomely
      dressed ladies were more frequently encountered; the men had otter skin
      collars to their coats; peasant waggoners, with their grate-like sledges
      stuck over with brass-headed nails, became rarer; whilst on the other
      hand, more and more drivers in red velvet caps, lacquered sledges and
      bear-skin coats began to appear, and carriages with rich hammer-cloths
      flew swiftly through the streets, their wheels scrunching the snow. Akakiy
      Akakievitch gazed upon all this as upon a novel sight. He had not been in
      the streets during the evening for years. He halted out of curiosity
      before a shop-window to look at a picture representing a handsome woman,
      who had thrown off her shoe, thereby baring her whole foot in a very
      pretty way; whilst behind her the head of a man with whiskers and a
      handsome moustache peeped through the doorway of another room. Akakiy
      Akakievitch shook his head and laughed, and then went on his way. Why did
      he laugh? Either because he had met with a thing utterly unknown, but for
      which every one cherishes, nevertheless, some sort of feeling; or else he
      thought, like many officials, as follows: "Well, those French! What is to
      be said? If they do go in anything of that sort, why&mdash;" But possibly
      he did not think at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch at length reached the house in which the sub-chief
      lodged. The sub-chief lived in fine style: the staircase was lit by a
      lamp; his apartment being on the second floor. On entering the vestibule,
      Akakiy Akakievitch beheld a whole row of goloshes on the floor. Among
      them, in the centre of the room, stood a samovar or tea-urn, humming and
      emitting clouds of steam. On the walls hung all sorts of coats and cloaks,
      among which there were even some with beaver collars or velvet facings.
      Beyond, the buzz of conversation was audible, and became clear and loud
      when the servant came out with a trayful of empty glasses, cream-jugs, and
      sugar-bowls. It was evident that the officials had arrived long before,
      and had already finished their first glass of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch, having hung up his own cloak, entered the inner room.
      Before him all at once appeared lights, officials, pipes, and card-tables;
      and he was bewildered by the sound of rapid conversation rising from all
      the tables, and the noise of moving chairs. He halted very awkwardly in
      the middle of the room, wondering what he ought to do. But they had seen
      him. They received him with a shout, and all thronged at once into the
      ante-room, and there took another look at his cloak. Akakiy Akakievitch,
      although somewhat confused, was frank-hearted, and could not refrain from
      rejoicing when he saw how they praised his cloak. Then, of course, they
      all dropped him and his cloak, and returned, as was proper, to the tables
      set out for whist.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, the noise, the talk, and the throng of people was rather
      overwhelming to Akakiy Akakievitch. He simply did not know where he stood,
      or where to put his hands, his feet, and his whole body. Finally he sat
      down by the players, looked at the cards, gazed at the face of one and
      another, and after a while began to gape, and to feel that it was
      wearisome, the more so as the hour was already long past when he usually
      went to bed. He wanted to take leave of the host; but they would not let
      him go, saying that he must not fail to drink a glass of champagne in
      honour of his new garment. In the course of an hour, supper, consisting of
      vegetable salad, cold veal, pastry, confectioner's pies, and champagne,
      was served. They made Akakiy Akakievitch drink two glasses of champagne,
      after which he felt things grow livelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, he could not forget that it was twelve o'clock, and that he should
      have been at home long ago. In order that the host might not think of some
      excuse for detaining him, he stole out of the room quickly, sought out, in
      the ante-room, his cloak, which, to his sorrow, he found lying on the
      floor, brushed it, picked off every speck upon it, put it on his
      shoulders, and descended the stairs to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street all was still bright. Some petty shops, those permanent
      clubs of servants and all sorts of folk, were open. Others were shut, but,
      nevertheless, showed a streak of light the whole length of the door-crack,
      indicating that they were not yet free of company, and that probably some
      domestics, male and female, were finishing their stories and conversations
      whilst leaving their masters in complete ignorance as to their
      whereabouts. Akakiy Akakievitch went on in a happy frame of mind: he even
      started to run, without knowing why, after some lady, who flew past like a
      flash of lightning. But he stopped short, and went on very quietly as
      before, wondering why he had quickened his pace. Soon there spread before
      him those deserted streets, which are not cheerful in the daytime, to say
      nothing of the evening. Now they were even more dim and lonely: the
      lanterns began to grow rarer, oil, evidently, had been less liberally
      supplied. Then came wooden houses and fences: not a soul anywhere; only
      the snow sparkled in the streets, and mournfully veiled the low-roofed
      cabins with their closed shutters. He approached the spot where the street
      crossed a vast square with houses barely visible on its farther side, a
      square which seemed a fearful desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afar, a tiny spark glimmered from some watchman's box, which seemed to
      stand on the edge of the world. Akakiy Akakievitch's cheerfulness
      diminished at this point in a marked degree. He entered the square, not
      without an involuntary sensation of fear, as though his heart warned him
      of some evil. He glanced back and on both sides, it was like a sea about
      him. "No, it is better not to look," he thought, and went on, closing his
      eyes. When he opened them, to see whether he was near the end of the
      square, he suddenly beheld, standing just before his very nose, some
      bearded individuals of precisely what sort he could not make out. All grew
      dark before his eyes, and his heart throbbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, of course, the cloak is mine!" said one of them in a loud voice,
      seizing hold of his collar. Akakiy Akakievitch was about to shout "watch,"
      when the second man thrust a fist, about the size of a man's head, into
      his mouth, muttering, "Now scream!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch felt them strip off his cloak and give him a push with
      a knee: he fell headlong upon the snow, and felt no more. In a few minutes
      he recovered consciousness and rose to his feet; but no one was there. He
      felt that it was cold in the square, and that his cloak was gone; he began
      to shout, but his voice did not appear to reach to the outskirts of the
      square. In despair, but without ceasing to shout, he started at a run
      across the square, straight towards the watchbox, beside which stood the
      watchman, leaning on his halberd, and apparently curious to know what kind
      of a customer was running towards him and shouting. Akakiy Akakievitch ran
      up to him, and began in a sobbing voice to shout that he was asleep, and
      attended to nothing, and did not see when a man was robbed. The watchman
      replied that he had seen two men stop him in the middle of the square, but
      supposed that they were friends of his; and that, instead of scolding
      vainly, he had better go to the police on the morrow, so that they might
      make a search for whoever had stolen the cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch ran home in complete disorder; his hair, which grew
      very thinly upon his temples and the back of his head, wholly disordered;
      his body, arms, and legs covered with snow. The old woman, who was
      mistress of his lodgings, on hearing a terrible knocking, sprang hastily
      from her bed, and, with only one shoe on, ran to open the door, pressing
      the sleeve of her chemise to her bosom out of modesty; but when she had
      opened it, she fell back on beholding Akakiy Akakievitch in such a state.
      When he told her about the affair, she clasped her hands, and said that he
      must go straight to the district chief of police, for his subordinate
      would turn up his nose, promise well, and drop the matter there. The very
      best thing to do, therefore, would be to go to the district chief, whom
      she knew, because Finnish Anna, her former cook, was now nurse at his
      house. She often saw him passing the house; and he was at church every
      Sunday, praying, but at the same time gazing cheerfully at everybody; so
      that he must be a good man, judging from all appearances. Having listened
      to this opinion, Akakiy Akakievitch betook himself sadly to his room; and
      how he spent the night there any one who can put himself in another's
      place may readily imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, he presented himself at the district chief's; but
      was told that this official was asleep. He went again at ten and was again
      informed that he was asleep; at eleven, and they said: "The superintendent
      is not at home;" at dinner time, and the clerks in the ante-room would not
      admit him on any terms, and insisted upon knowing his business. So that at
      last, for once in his life, Akakiy Akakievitch felt an inclination to show
      some spirit, and said curtly that he must see the chief in person; that
      they ought not to presume to refuse him entrance; that he came from the
      department of justice, and that when he complained of them, they would
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerks dared make no reply to this, and one of them went to call the
      chief, who listened to the strange story of the theft of the coat. Instead
      of directing his attention to the principal points of the matter, he began
      to question Akakiy Akakievitch: Why was he going home so late? Was he in
      the habit of doing so, or had he been to some disorderly house? So that
      Akakiy Akakievitch got thoroughly confused, and left him without knowing
      whether the affair of his cloak was in proper train or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day, for the first time in his life, he never went near the
      department. The next day he made his appearance, very pale, and in his old
      cape, which had become even more shabby. The news of the robbery of the
      cloak touched many; although there were some officials present who never
      lost an opportunity, even such a one as the present, of ridiculing Akakiy
      Akakievitch. They decided to make a collection for him on the spot, but
      the officials had already spent a great deal in subscribing for the
      director's portrait, and for some book, at the suggestion of the head of
      that division, who was a friend of the author; and so the sum was
      trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, moved by pity, resolved to help Akakiy Akakievitch with some
      good advice at least, and told him that he ought not to go to the police,
      for although it might happen that a police-officer, wishing to win the
      approval of his superiors, might hunt up the cloak by some means, still
      his cloak would remain in the possession of the police if he did not offer
      legal proof that it belonged to him. The best thing for him, therefore,
      would be to apply to a certain prominent personage; since this prominent
      personage, by entering into relations with the proper persons, could
      greatly expedite the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing else to be done, Akakiy Akakievitch decided to go to
      the prominent personage. What was the exact official position of the
      prominent personage remains unknown to this day. The reader must know that
      the prominent personage had but recently become a prominent personage,
      having up to that time been only an insignificant person. Moreover, his
      present position was not considered prominent in comparison with others
      still more so. But there is always a circle of people to whom what is
      insignificant in the eyes of others, is important enough. Moreover, he
      strove to increase his importance by sundry devices; for instance, he
      managed to have the inferior officials meet him on the staircase when he
      entered upon his service; no one was to presume to come directly to him,
      but the strictest etiquette must be observed; the collegiate recorder must
      make a report to the government secretary, the government secretary to the
      titular councillor, or whatever other man was proper, and all business
      must come before him in this manner. In Holy Russia all is thus
      contaminated with the love of imitation; every man imitates and copies his
      superior. They even say that a certain titular councillor, when promoted
      to the head of some small separate room, immediately partitioned off a
      private room for himself, called it the audience chamber, and posted at
      the door a lackey with red collar and braid, who grasped the handle of the
      door and opened to all comers; though the audience chamber could hardly
      hold an ordinary writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manners and customs of the prominent personage were grand and
      imposing, but rather exaggerated. The main foundation of his system was
      strictness. "Strictness, strictness, and always strictness!" he generally
      said; and at the last word he looked significantly into the face of the
      person to whom he spoke. But there was no necessity for this, for the
      half-score of subordinates who formed the entire force of the office were
      properly afraid; on catching sight of him afar off they left their work
      and waited, drawn up in line, until he had passed through the room. His
      ordinary converse with his inferiors smacked of sternness, and consisted
      chiefly of three phrases: "How dare you?" "Do you know whom you are
      speaking to?" "Do you realise who stands before you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise he was a very kind-hearted man, good to his comrades, and ready
      to oblige; but the rank of general threw him completely off his balance.
      On receiving any one of that rank, he became confused, lost his way, as it
      were, and never knew what to do. If he chanced to be amongst his equals he
      was still a very nice kind of man, a very good fellow in many respects,
      and not stupid; but the very moment that he found himself in the society
      of people but one rank lower than himself he became silent; and his
      situation aroused sympathy, the more so as he felt himself that he might
      have been making an incomparably better use of his time. In his eyes there
      was sometimes visible a desire to join some interesting conversation or
      group; but he was kept back by the thought, "Would it not be a very great
      condescension on his part? Would it not be familiar? and would he not
      thereby lose his importance?" And in consequence of such reflections he
      always remained in the same dumb state, uttering from time to time a few
      monosyllabic sounds, and thereby earning the name of the most wearisome of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this prominent personage Akakiy Akakievitch presented himself, and this
      at the most unfavourable time for himself though opportune for the
      prominent personage. The prominent personage was in his cabinet conversing
      gaily with an old acquaintance and companion of his childhood whom he had
      not seen for several years and who had just arrived when it was announced
      to him that a person named Bashmatchkin had come. He asked abruptly, "Who
      is he?"&mdash;"Some official," he was informed. "Ah, he can wait! this is
      no time for him to call," said the important man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remarked here that the important man lied outrageously: he had
      said all he had to say to his friend long before; and the conversation had
      been interspersed for some time with very long pauses, during which they
      merely slapped each other on the leg, and said, "You think so, Ivan
      Abramovitch!" "Just so, Stepan Varlamitch!" Nevertheless, he ordered that
      the official should be kept waiting, in order to show his friend, a man
      who had not been in the service for a long time, but had lived at home in
      the country, how long officials had to wait in his ante-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, having talked himself completely out, and more than that,
      having had his fill of pauses, and smoked a cigar in a very comfortable
      arm-chair with reclining back, he suddenly seemed to recollect, and said
      to the secretary, who stood by the door with papers of reports, "So it
      seems that there is a tchinovnik waiting to see me. Tell him that he may
      come in." On perceiving Akakiy Akakievitch's modest mien and his worn
      undress uniform, he turned abruptly to him and said, "What do you want?"
      in a curt hard voice, which he had practised in his room in private, and
      before the looking-glass, for a whole week before being raised to his
      present rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch, who was already imbued with a due amount of fear,
      became somewhat confused: and as well as his tongue would permit,
      explained, with a rather more frequent addition than usual of the word
      "that," that his cloak was quite new, and had been stolen in the most
      inhuman manner; that he had applied to him in order that he might, in some
      way, by his intermediation&mdash;that he might enter into correspondence
      with the chief of police, and find the cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some inexplicable reason this conduct seemed familiar to the prominent
      personage. "What, my dear sir!" he said abruptly, "are you not acquainted
      with etiquette? Where have you come from? Don't you know how such matters
      are managed? You should first have entered a complaint about this at the
      court below: it would have gone to the head of the department, then to the
      chief of the division, then it would have been handed over to the
      secretary, and the secretary would have given it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, your excellency," said Akakiy Akakievitch, trying to collect his
      small handful of wits, and conscious at the same time that he was
      perspiring terribly, "I, your excellency, presumed to trouble you because
      secretaries&mdash;are an untrustworthy race."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, what, what!" said the important personage. "Where did you get such
      courage? Where did you get such ideas? What impudence towards their chiefs
      and superiors has spread among the young generation!" The prominent
      personage apparently had not observed that Akakiy Akakievitch was already
      in the neighbourhood of fifty. If he could be called a young man, it must
      have been in comparison with some one who was twenty. "Do you know to whom
      you speak? Do you realise who stands before you? Do you realise it? do you
      realise it? I ask you!" Then he stamped his foot and raised his voice to
      such a pitch that it would have frightened even a different man from
      Akakiy Akakievitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch's senses failed him; he staggered, trembled in every
      limb, and, if the porters had not run to support him, would have fallen to
      the floor. They carried him out insensible. But the prominent personage,
      gratified that the effect should have surpassed his expectations, and
      quite intoxicated with the thought that his word could even deprive a man
      of his senses, glanced sideways at his friend in order to see how he
      looked upon this, and perceived, not without satisfaction, that his friend
      was in a most uneasy frame of mind, and even beginning, on his part, to
      feel a trifle frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akakiy Akakievitch could not remember how he descended the stairs and got
      into the street. He felt neither his hands nor feet. Never in his life had
      he been so rated by any high official, let alone a strange one. He went
      staggering on through the snow-storm, which was blowing in the streets,
      with his mouth wide open; the wind, in St. Petersburg fashion, darted upon
      him from all quarters, and down every cross-street. In a twinkling it had
      blown a quinsy into his throat, and he reached home unable to utter a
      word. His throat was swollen, and he lay down on his bed. So powerful is
      sometimes a good scolding!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day a violent fever showed itself. Thanks to the generous
      assistance of the St. Petersburg climate, the malady progressed more
      rapidly than could have been expected: and when the doctor arrived, he
      found, on feeling the sick man's pulse, that there was nothing to be done,
      except to prescribe a fomentation, so that the patient might not be left
      entirely without the beneficent aid of medicine; but at the same time, he
      predicted his end in thirty-six hours. After this he turned to the
      landlady, and said, "And as for you, don't waste your time on him: order
      his pine coffin now, for an oak one will be too expensive for him." Did
      Akakiy Akakievitch hear these fatal words? and if he heard them, did they
      produce any overwhelming effect upon him? Did he lament the bitterness of
      his life?&mdash;We know not, for he continued in a delirious condition.
      Visions incessantly appeared to him, each stranger than the other. Now he
      saw Petrovitch, and ordered him to make a cloak, with some traps for
      robbers, who seemed to him to be always under the bed; and cried every
      moment to the landlady to pull one of them from under his coverlet. Then
      he inquired why his old mantle hung before him when he had a new cloak.
      Next he fancied that he was standing before the prominent person,
      listening to a thorough setting-down, and saying, "Forgive me, your
      excellency!" but at last he began to curse, uttering the most horrible
      words, so that his aged landlady crossed herself, never in her life having
      heard anything of the kind from him, the more so as those words followed
      directly after the words "your excellency." Later on he talked utter
      nonsense, of which nothing could be made: all that was evident being, that
      his incoherent words and thoughts hovered ever about one thing, his cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length poor Akakiy Akakievitch breathed his last. They sealed up
      neither his room nor his effects, because, in the first place, there were
      no heirs, and, in the second, there was very little to inherit beyond a
      bundle of goose-quills, a quire of white official paper, three pairs of
      socks, two or three buttons which had burst off his trousers, and the
      mantle already known to the reader. To whom all this fell, God knows. I
      confess that the person who told me this tale took no interest in the
      matter. They carried Akakiy Akakievitch out and buried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And St. Petersburg was left without Akakiy Akakievitch, as though he had
      never lived there. A being disappeared who was protected by none, dear to
      none, interesting to none, and who never even attracted to himself the
      attention of those students of human nature who omit no opportunity of
      thrusting a pin through a common fly, and examining it under the
      microscope. A being who bore meekly the jibes of the department, and went
      to his grave without having done one unusual deed, but to whom,
      nevertheless, at the close of his life appeared a bright visitant in the
      form of a cloak, which momentarily cheered his poor life, and upon whom,
      thereafter, an intolerable misfortune descended, just as it descends upon
      the mighty of this world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days after his death, the porter was sent from the department to
      his lodgings, with an order for him to present himself there immediately;
      the chief commanding it. But the porter had to return unsuccessful, with
      the answer that he could not come; and to the question, "Why?" replied,
      "Well, because he is dead! he was buried four days ago." In this manner
      did they hear of Akakiy Akakievitch's death at the department, and the
      next day a new official sat in his place, with a handwriting by no means
      so upright, but more inclined and slanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who could have imagined that this was not really the end of Akakiy
      Akakievitch, that he was destined to raise a commotion after death, as if
      in compensation for his utterly insignificant life? But so it happened,
      and our poor story unexpectedly gains a fantastic ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rumour suddenly spread through St. Petersburg that a dead man had taken
      to appearing on the Kalinkin Bridge and its vicinity at night in the form
      of a tchinovnik seeking a stolen cloak, and that, under the pretext of its
      being the stolen cloak, he dragged, without regard to rank or calling,
      every one's cloak from his shoulders, be it cat-skin, beaver, fox, bear,
      sable; in a word, every sort of fur and skin which men adopted for their
      covering. One of the department officials saw the dead man with his own
      eyes and immediately recognised in him Akakiy Akakievitch. This, however,
      inspired him with such terror that he ran off with all his might, and
      therefore did not scan the dead man closely, but only saw how the latter
      threatened him from afar with his finger. Constant complaints poured in
      from all quarters that the backs and shoulders, not only of titular but
      even of court councillors, were exposed to the danger of a cold on account
      of the frequent dragging off of their cloaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements were made by the police to catch the corpse, alive or dead,
      at any cost, and punish him as an example to others in the most severe
      manner. In this they nearly succeeded; for a watchman, on guard in
      Kirushkin Alley, caught the corpse by the collar on the very scene of his
      evil deeds, when attempting to pull off the frieze coat of a retired
      musician. Having seized him by the collar, he summoned, with a shout, two
      of his comrades, whom he enjoined to hold him fast while he himself felt
      for a moment in his boot, in order to draw out his snuff-box and refresh
      his frozen nose. But the snuff was of a sort which even a corpse could not
      endure. The watchman having closed his right nostril with his finger, had
      no sooner succeeded in holding half a handful up to the left than the
      corpse sneezed so violently that he completely filled the eyes of all
      three. While they raised their hands to wipe them, the dead man vanished
      completely, so that they positively did not know whether they had actually
      had him in their grip at all. Thereafter the watchmen conceived such a
      terror of dead men that they were afraid even to seize the living, and
      only screamed from a distance, "Hey, there! go your way!" So the dead
      tchinovnik began to appear even beyond the Kalinkin Bridge, causing no
      little terror to all timid people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have totally neglected that certain prominent personage who may
      really be considered as the cause of the fantastic turn taken by this true
      history. First of all, justice compels us to say that after the departure
      of poor, annihilated Akakiy Akakievitch he felt something like remorse.
      Suffering was unpleasant to him, for his heart was accessible to many good
      impulses, in spite of the fact that his rank often prevented his showing
      his true self. As soon as his friend had left his cabinet, he began to
      think about poor Akakiy Akakievitch. And from that day forth, poor Akakiy
      Akakievitch, who could not bear up under an official reprimand, recurred
      to his mind almost every day. The thought troubled him to such an extent
      that a week later he even resolved to send an official to him, to learn
      whether he really could assist him; and when it was reported to him that
      Akakiy Akakievitch had died suddenly of fever, he was startled, hearkened
      to the reproaches of his conscience, and was out of sorts for the whole
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to divert his mind in some way, and drive away the disagreeable
      impression, he set out that evening for one of his friends' houses, where
      he found quite a large party assembled. What was better, nearly every one
      was of the same rank as himself, so that he need not feel in the least
      constrained. This had a marvellous effect upon his mental state. He grew
      expansive, made himself agreeable in conversation, in short, he passed a
      delightful evening. After supper he drank a couple of glasses of champagne&mdash;not
      a bad recipe for cheerfulness, as every one knows. The champagne inclined
      him to various adventures; and he determined not to return home, but to go
      and see a certain well-known lady of German extraction, Karolina Ivanovna,
      a lady, it appears, with whom he was on a very friendly footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be mentioned that the prominent personage was no longer a young
      man, but a good husband and respected father of a family. Two sons, one of
      whom was already in the service, and a good-looking, sixteen-year-old
      daughter, with a rather retrousse but pretty little nose, came every
      morning to kiss his hand and say, "Bonjour, papa." His wife, a still fresh
      and good-looking woman, first gave him her hand to kiss, and then,
      reversing the procedure, kissed his. But the prominent personage, though
      perfectly satisfied in his domestic relations, considered it stylish to
      have a friend in another quarter of the city. This friend was scarcely
      prettier or younger than his wife; but there are such puzzles in the
      world, and it is not our place to judge them. So the important personage
      descended the stairs, stepped into his sledge, said to the coachman, "To
      Karolina Ivanovna's," and, wrapping himself luxuriously in his warm cloak,
      found himself in that delightful frame of mind than which a Russian can
      conceive no better, namely, when you think of nothing yourself, yet when
      the thoughts creep into your mind of their own accord, each more agreeable
      than the other, giving you no trouble either to drive them away or seek
      them. Fully satisfied, he recalled all the gay features of the evening
      just passed, and all the mots which had made the little circle laugh. Many
      of them he repeated in a low voice, and found them quite as funny as
      before; so it is not surprising that he should laugh heartily at them.
      Occasionally, however, he was interrupted by gusts of wind, which, coming
      suddenly, God knows whence or why, cut his face, drove masses of snow into
      it, filled out his cloak-collar like a sail, or suddenly blew it over his
      head with supernatural force, and thus caused him constant trouble to
      disentangle himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the important personage felt some one clutch him firmly by the
      collar. Turning round, he perceived a man of short stature, in an old,
      worn uniform, and recognised, not without terror, Akakiy Akakievitch. The
      official's face was white as snow, and looked just like a corpse's. But
      the horror of the important personage transcended all bounds when he saw
      the dead man's mouth open, and, with a terrible odour of the grave, gave
      vent to the following remarks: "Ah, here you are at last! I have you, that&mdash;by
      the collar! I need your cloak; you took no trouble about mine, but
      reprimanded me; so now give up your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pallid prominent personage almost died of fright. Brave as he was in
      the office and in the presence of inferiors generally, and although, at
      the sight of his manly form and appearance, every one said, "Ugh! how much
      character he had!" at this crisis, he, like many possessed of an heroic
      exterior, experienced such terror, that, not without cause, he began to
      fear an attack of illness. He flung his cloak hastily from his shoulders
      and shouted to his coachman in an unnatural voice, "Home at full speed!"
      The coachman, hearing the tone which is generally employed at critical
      moments and even accompanied by something much more tangible, drew his
      head down between his shoulders in case of an emergency, flourished his
      whip, and flew on like an arrow. In a little more than six minutes the
      prominent personage was at the entrance of his own house. Pale, thoroughly
      scared, and cloakless, he went home instead of to Karolina Ivanovna's,
      reached his room somehow or other, and passed the night in the direst
      distress; so that the next morning over their tea his daughter said, "You
      are very pale to-day, papa." But papa remained silent, and said not a word
      to any one of what had happened to him, where he had been, or where he had
      intended to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurrence made a deep impression upon him. He even began to say:
      "How dare you? do you realise who stands before you?" less frequently to
      the under-officials, and if he did utter the words, it was only after
      having first learned the bearings of the matter. But the most noteworthy
      point was, that from that day forward the apparition of the dead
      tchinovnik ceased to be seen. Evidently the prominent personage's cloak
      just fitted his shoulders; at all events, no more instances of his
      dragging cloaks from people's shoulders were heard of. But many active and
      apprehensive persons could by no means reassure themselves, and asserted
      that the dead tchinovnik still showed himself in distant parts of the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, one watchman in Kolomna saw with his own eyes the apparition come
      from behind a house. But being rather weak of body, he dared not arrest
      him, but followed him in the dark, until, at length, the apparition looked
      round, paused, and inquired, "What do you want?" at the same time showing
      a fist such as is never seen on living men. The watchman said, "It's of no
      consequence," and turned back instantly. But the apparition was much too
      tall, wore huge moustaches, and, directing its steps apparently towards
      the Obukhoff bridge, disappeared in the darkness of the night.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IVAN IVANOVITCH AND IVAN NIKIFOROVITCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      A fine pelisse has Ivan Ivanovitch! splendid! And what lambskin! deuce
      take it, what lambskin! blue-black with silver lights. I'll forfeit, I
      know not what, if you find any one else owning such a one. Look at it, for
      heaven's sake, especially when he stands talking with any one! look at him
      side-ways: what a pleasure it is! To describe it is impossible: velvet!
      silver! fire! Nikolai the Wonder-worker, saint of God! why have I not such
      a pelisse? He had it made before Agafya Fedosyevna went to Kief. You know
      Agafya Fedosyevna who bit the assessor's ear off?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch is a very handsome man. What a house he has in Mirgorod!
      Around it on every side is a balcony on oaken pillars, and on the balcony
      are benches. Ivan Ivanovitch, when the weather gets too warm, throws off
      his pelisse and his remaining upper garments, and sits, in his shirt
      sleeves, on the balcony to observe what is going on in the courtyard and
      the street. What apples and pears he has under his very windows! You have
      but to open the window and the branches force themselves through into the
      room. All this is in front of the house; but you should see what he has in
      the garden. What is there not there? Plums, cherries, every sort of
      vegetable, sunflowers, cucumbers, melons, peas, a threshing-floor, and
      even a forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very fine man, Ivan Ivanovitch! He is very fond of melons: they are his
      favourite food. As soon as he has dined, and come out on his balcony, in
      his shirt sleeves, he orders Gapka to bring two melons, and immediately
      cuts them himself, collects the seeds in a paper, and begins to eat. Then
      he orders Gapka to fetch the ink-bottle, and, with his own hand, writes
      this inscription on the paper of seeds: "These melons were eaten on such
      and such a date." If there was a guest present, then it reads, "Such and
      such a person assisted."
    </p>
    <p>
      The late judge of Mirgorod always gazed at Ivan Ivanovitch's house with
      pleasure. The little house is very pretty. It pleases me because sheds and
      other little additions are built on to it on all sides; so that, looking
      at it from a distance, only roofs are visible, rising one above another,
      and greatly resembling a plate full of pancakes, or, better still, fungi
      growing on the trunk of a tree. Moreover, the roof is all overgrown with
      weeds: a willow, an oak, and two apple-trees lean their spreading branches
      against it. Through the trees peep little windows with carved and
      white-washed shutters, which project even into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very fine man, Ivan Ivanovitch! The commissioner of Poltava knows him
      too. Dorosh Tarasovitch Pukhivotchka, when he leaves Khorola, always goes
      to his house. And when Father Peter, the Protopope who lives at
      Koliberdas, invites a few guests, he always says that he knows of no one
      who so well fulfils all his Christian duties and understands so well how
      to live as Ivan Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      How time flies! More than ten years have already passed since he became a
      widower. He never had any children. Gapka has children and they run about
      the court-yard. Ivan Ivanovitch always gives each of them a cake, or a
      slice of melon, or a pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gapka carries the keys of the storerooms and cellars; but the key of the
      large chest which stands in his bedroom, and that of the centre storeroom,
      Ivan Ivanovitch keeps himself; Gapka is a healthy girl, with ruddy cheeks
      and calves, and goes about in coarse cloth garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a pious man is Ivan Ivanovitch! Every Sunday he dons his pelisse
      and goes to church. On entering, he bows on all sides, generally stations
      himself in the choir, and sings a very good bass. When the service is
      over, Ivan Ivanovitch cannot refrain from passing the poor people in
      review. He probably would not have cared to undertake this tiresome work
      if his natural goodness had not urged him to it. "Good-day, beggar!" he
      generally said, selecting the most crippled old woman, in the most patched
      and threadbare garments. "Whence come you, my poor woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come from the farm, sir. 'Tis two days since I have eaten or drunk: my
      own children drove me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor soul! why did you come hither?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To beg alms, sir, to see whether some one will not give me at least
      enough for bread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm! so you want bread?" Ivan Ivanovitch generally inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should it be otherwise? I am as hungry as a dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm!" replied Ivan Ivanovitch usually, "and perhaps you would like butter
      too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; everything which your kindness will give; I will be content with
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm! Is butter better than bread?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is a hungry person to choose? Anything you please, all is good."
      Thereupon the old woman generally extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go with God's blessing," said Ivan Ivanovitch. "Why do you stand
      there? I'm not beating you." And turning to a second and a third with the
      same questions, he finally returns home, or goes to drink a little glass
      of vodka with his neighbour, Ivan Nikiforovitch, or the judge, or the
      chief of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch is very fond of receiving presents. They please him
      greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very fine man too is Ivan Nikiforovitch. They are such friends as the
      world never saw. Anton Prokofievitch Pupopuz, who goes about to this hour
      in his cinnamon-coloured surtout with blue sleeves and dines every Sunday
      with the judge, was in the habit of saying that the Devil himself had
      bound Ivan Ivanovitch and Ivan Nikiforovitch together with a rope: where
      one went, the other followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch has never married. Although it was reported that he was
      married it was completely false. I know Ivan Nikiforovitch very well, and
      am able to state that he never even had any intention of marrying. Where
      do all these scandals originate? In the same way it was rumoured that Ivan
      Nikiforovitch was born with a tail! But this invention is so clumsy and at
      the same time so horrible and indecent that I do not even consider it
      necessary to refute it for the benefit of civilised readers, to whom it is
      doubtless known that only witches, and very few even of these, have tails.
      Witches, moreover, belong more to the feminine than to the masculine
      gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of their great friendship, these rare friends are not always
      agreed between themselves. Their characters can best be judged by
      comparing them. Ivan Ivanovitch has the usual gift of speaking in an
      extremely pleasant manner. Heavens! How he does speak! The feeling can
      best be described by comparing it to that which you experience when some
      one combs your head or draws his finger softly across your heel. You
      listen and listen until you drop your head. Pleasant, exceedingly
      pleasant! like the sleep after a bath. Ivan Nikiforovitch, on the
      contrary, is more reticent; but if he once takes up his parable, look out
      for yourself! He can talk your head off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch is tall and thin: Ivan Nikiforovitch is rather shorter in
      stature, but he makes it up in thickness. Ivan Ivanovitch's head is like a
      radish, tail down; Ivan Nikiforovitch's like a radish with the tail up.
      Ivan Ivanovitch lolls on the balcony in his shirt sleeves after dinner
      only: in the evening he dons his pelisse and goes out somewhere, either to
      the village shop, where he supplies flour, or into the fields to catch
      quail. Ivan Nikiforovitch lies all day at his porch: if the day is not too
      hot he generally turns his back to the sun and will not go anywhere. If it
      happens to occur to him in the morning he walks through the yard, inspects
      the domestic affairs, and retires again to his room. In early days he used
      to call on Ivan Ivanovitch. Ivan Ivanovitch is a very refined man, and
      never utters an impolite word. Ivan Nikiforovitch is not always on his
      guard. On such occasions Ivan Ivanovitch usually rises from his seat, and
      says, "Enough, enough, Ivan Nikiforovitch! It's better to go out at once
      than to utter such godless words."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch gets into a terrible rage if a fly falls into his
      beet-soup. Then he is fairly beside himself; he flings away his plate and
      the housekeeper catches it. Ivan Nikiforovitch is very fond of bathing;
      and when he gets up to the neck in water, orders a table and a samovar, or
      tea urn, to be placed on the water, for he is very fond of drinking tea in
      that cool position. Ivan Ivanovitch shaves twice a week; Ivan
      Nikiforovitch once. Ivan Ivanovitch is extremely curious. God preserve you
      if you begin to tell him anything and do not finish it! If he is
      displeased with anything he lets it be seen at once. It is very hard to
      tell from Ivan Nikiforovitch's countenance whether he is pleased or angry;
      even if he is rejoiced at anything, he will not show it. Ivan Ivanovitch
      is of a rather timid character: Ivan Nikiforovitch, on the contrary, has,
      as the saying is, such full folds in his trousers that if you were to
      inflate them you might put the courtyard, with its storehouses and
      buildings, inside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch has large, expressive eyes, of a snuff colour, and a mouth
      shaped something like the letter V; Ivan Nikiforovitch has small,
      yellowish eyes, quite concealed between heavy brows and fat cheeks; and
      his nose is the shape of a ripe plum. If Ivanovitch treats you to snuff,
      he always licks the cover of his box first with his tongue, then taps on
      it with his finger and says, as he raises it, if you are an acquaintance,
      "Dare I beg you, sir, to give me the pleasure?" if a stranger, "Dare I beg
      you, sir, though I have not the honour of knowing your rank, name, and
      family, to do me the favour?" but Ivan Nikiforovitch puts his box straight
      into your hand and merely adds, "Do me the favour." Neither Ivan
      Ivanovitch nor Ivan Nikiforovitch loves fleas; and therefore, neither Ivan
      Ivanovitch nor Ivan Nikiforovitch will, on no account, admit a Jew with
      his wares, without purchasing of him remedies against these insects, after
      having first rated him well for belonging to the Hebrew faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of numerous dissimilarities, Ivan Ivanovitch and Ivan
      Nikiforovitch are both very fine fellows.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      FROM WHICH MAY BE SEEN WHENCE AROSE THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN IVAN IVANOVITCH
      AND IVAN NIKIFOROVITCH
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning&mdash;it was in July&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch was lying on his
      balcony. The day was warm; the air was dry, and came in gusts. Ivan
      Ivanovitch had been to town, to the mower's, and at the farm, and had
      succeeded in asking all the muzhiks and women whom he met all manner of
      questions. He was fearfully tired and had laid down to rest. As he lay
      there, he looked at the storehouse, the courtyard, the sheds, the chickens
      running about, and thought to himself, "Heavens! What a well-to-do man I
      am! What is there that I have not? Birds, buildings, granaries, everything
      I take a fancy to; genuine distilled vodka; pears and plums in the
      orchard; poppies, cabbages, peas in the garden; what is there that I have
      not? I should like to know what there is that I have not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he put this question to himself, Ivan Ivanovitch reflected; and
      meantime his eyes, in their search after fresh objects, crossed the fence
      into Ivan Nikiforovitch's yard and involuntarily took note of a curious
      sight. A fat woman was bringing out clothes, which had been packed away,
      and spreading them out on the line to air. Presently an old uniform with
      worn trimmings was swinging its sleeves in the air and embracing a brocade
      gown; from behind it peeped a court-coat, with buttons stamped with
      coats-of-arms, and moth-eaten collar; and white kersymere pantaloons with
      spots, which had once upon a time clothed Ivan Nikiforovitch's legs, and
      might now possibly fit his fingers. Behind them were speedily hung some
      more in the shape of the letter pi. Then came a blue Cossack jacket, which
      Ivan Nikiforovitch had had made twenty years before, when he was preparing
      to enter the militia, and allowed his moustache to grow. And one after
      another appeared a sword, projecting into the air like a spit, and the
      skirts of a grass-green caftan-like garment, with copper buttons the size
      of a five-kopek piece, unfolded themselves. From among the folds peeped a
      vest bound with gold, with a wide opening in front. The vest was soon
      concealed by an old petticoat belonging to his dead grandmother, with
      pockets which would have held a water-melon.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things piled together formed a very interesting spectacle for
      Ivan Ivanovitch; while the sun's rays, falling upon a blue or green
      sleeve, a red binding, or a scrap of gold brocade, or playing in the point
      of a sword, formed an unusual sight, similar to the representations of the
      Nativity given at farmhouses by wandering bands; particularly that part
      where the throng of people, pressing close together, gaze at King Herod in
      his golden crown or at Anthony leading his goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the old woman crawled, grunting, from the storeroom, dragging
      after her an old-fashioned saddle with broken stirrups, worn leather
      holsters, and saddle-cloth, once red, with gilt embroidery and copper
      disks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a stupid woman," thought Ivan Ivanovitch. "She'll be dragging Ivan
      Nikiforovitch out and airing him next."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch was not so far wrong in his surmise. Five minutes later,
      Ivan Nikiforovitch's nankeen trousers appeared, and took nearly half the
      yard to themselves. After that she fetched out a hat and a gun. "What's
      the meaning of this?" thought Ivan Ivanovitch. "I never knew Ivan
      Nikiforovitch had a gun. What does he want with it? Whether he shoots, or
      not, he keeps a gun! Of what use is it to him? But it's a splendid thing.
      I have long wanted just such a one. I should like that gun very much: I
      like to amuse myself with a gun. Hello, there, woman, woman!" shouted Ivan
      Ivanovitch, beckoning to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman approached the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that you have there, my good woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gun, as you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows what sort of a gun? If it were mine, perhaps I should know what
      it is made of; but it is my master's, therefore I know nothing of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch rose, and began to examine the gun on all sides, and
      forgot to reprove the old woman for hanging it and the sword out to air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be iron," went on the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm, iron! why iron?" said Ivan Ivanovitch. "Has your master had it long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; long, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a nice gun!" continued Ivan Ivanovitch. "I will ask him for it. What
      can he want with it? I'll make an exchange with him for it. Is your master
      at home, my good woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is he doing? lying down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, lying down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I will come to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch dressed himself, took his well-seasoned stick for the
      benefit of the dogs, for, in Mirgorod, there are more dogs than people to
      be met in the street, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Ivan Nikiforovitch's house was next door to Ivan Ivanovitch's, so
      that you could have got from one to the other by climbing the fence, yet
      Ivan Ivanovitch went by way of the street. From the street it was
      necessary to turn into an alley which was so narrow that if two one-horse
      carts chanced to meet they could not get out, and were forced to remain
      there until the drivers, seizing the hind-wheels, dragged them back in
      opposite directions into the street, whilst pedestrians drew aside like
      flowers growing by the fence on either hand. Ivan Ivanovitch's waggon-shed
      adjoined this alley on one side; and on the other were Ivan
      Nikiforovitch's granary, gate, and pigeon-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch went up to the gate and rattled the latch. Within arose
      the barking of dogs; but the motley-haired pack ran back, wagging their
      tails when they saw the well-known face. Ivan Ivanovitch traversed the
      courtyard, in which were collected Indian doves, fed by Ivan
      Nikiforovitch's own hand, melon-rinds, vegetables, broken wheels,
      barrel-hoops, and a small boy wallowing with dirty blouse&mdash;a picture
      such as painters love. The shadows of the fluttering clothes covered
      nearly the whole of the yard and lent it a degree of coolness. The woman
      greeted him with a bend of her head and stood, gaping, in one spot. The
      front of the house was adorned with a small porch, with its roof supported
      on two oak pillars&mdash;a welcome protection from the sun, which at that
      season in Little Russia loves not to jest, and bathes the pedestrian from
      head to foot in perspiration. It may be judged how powerful Ivan
      Ivanovitch's desire to obtain the coveted article was when he made up his
      mind, at such an hour, to depart from his usual custom, which was to walk
      abroad only in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room which Ivan Ivanovitch entered was quite dark, for the shutters
      were closed; and the ray of sunlight passing through a hole made in one of
      them took on the colours of the rainbow, and, striking the opposite wall,
      sketched upon it a parti-coloured picture of the outlines of roofs, trees,
      and the clothes suspended in the yard, only upside down. This gave the
      room a peculiar half-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God assist you!" said Ivan Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! how do you do, Ivan Ivanovitch?" replied a voice from the corner of
      the room. Then only did Ivan Ivanovitch perceive Ivan Nikiforovitch lying
      upon a rug which was spread on the floor. "Excuse me for appearing before
      you in a state of nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. You have been asleep, Ivan Nikiforovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been asleep. Have you been asleep, Ivan Ivanovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you have risen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I have risen. Christ be with you, Ivan Nikiforovitch! How can you
      sleep until this time? I have just come from the farm. There's very fine
      barley on the road, charming! and the hay is tall and soft and golden!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gorpina!" shouted Ivan Nikiforovitch, "fetch Ivan Ivanovitch some vodka,
      and some pastry and sour cream!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine weather we're having to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't praise it, Ivan Ivanovitch! Devil take it! You can't get away from
      the heat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, why need you mention the devil! Ah, Ivan Nikiforovitch! you will
      recall my words when it's too late. You will suffer in the next world for
      such godless words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have I offended you, Ivan Ivanovitch? I have not attacked your father
      nor your mother. I don't know how I have insulted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, enough, Ivan Nikiforovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heavens, Ivan Ivanovitch, I did not insult you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's strange that the quails haven't come yet to the whistle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think what you please, but I have not insulted you in any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why they don't come," said Ivan Ivanovitch, as if he did not
      hear Ivan Nikiforovitch; "it is more than time for them already; but they
      seem to need more time for some reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that the barley is good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid barley, splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are having your clothes aired, Ivan Nikiforovitch?" said Ivan
      Ivanovitch at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; those cursed women have ruined some beautiful clothes; almost new
      they were too. Now I'm having them aired; the cloth is fine and good. They
      only need turning to make them fit to wear again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing among them pleased me extremely, Ivan Nikiforovitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, please, what use do you make of the gun that has been put to air
      with the clothes?" Here Ivan Ivanovitch offered his snuff. "May I ask you
      to do me the favour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means! take it yourself; I will use my own." Thereupon Ivan
      Nikiforovitch felt about him, and got hold of his snuff-box. "That stupid
      woman! So she hung the gun out to air. That Jew at Sorotchintzi makes good
      snuff. I don't know what he puts in it, but it is so very fragrant. It is
      a little like tansy. Here, take a little and chew it; isn't it like
      tansy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Nikiforovitch, I want to talk about that gun; what are you going to
      do with it? You don't need it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't I need it? I might want to go shooting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be with you, Ivan Nikiforovitch! When will you go shooting? At the
      millennium, perhaps? So far as I know, or any one can recollect, you never
      killed even a duck; yes, and you are not built to go shooting. You have a
      dignified bearing and figure; how are you to drag yourself about the
      marshes, especially when your garment, which it is not polite to mention
      in conversation by name, is being aired at this very moment? No; you
      require rest, repose." Ivan Ivanovitch as has been hinted at above,
      employed uncommonly picturesque language when it was necessary to persuade
      any one. How he talked! Heavens, how he could talk! "Yes, and you require
      polite actions. See here, give it to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea! The gun is valuable; you can't find such guns anywhere
      nowadays. I bought it of a Turk when I joined the militia; and now, to
      give it away all of a sudden! Impossible! It is an indispensable article."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indispensable for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what? What if robbers should attack the house?... Indispensable
      indeed! Glory to God! I know that a gun stands in my storehouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine gun that! Why, Ivan Nikiforovitch, the lock is ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by ruined? It can be set right; all that needs to be
      done is to rub it with hemp-oil, so that it may not rust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see in your words, Ivan Nikiforovitch, anything but a friendly
      disposition towards me. You will do nothing for me in token of
      friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you say, Ivan Ivanovitch, that I show you no friendship? You
      ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your oxen pasture on my steppes and I
      have never interfered with them. When you go to Poltava, you always ask
      for my waggon, and what then? Have I ever refused? Your children climb
      over the fence into my yard and play with my dogs&mdash;I never say
      anything; let them play, so long as they touch nothing; let them play!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you won't give it to me, then let us make some exchange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you give me for it?" Thereupon Ivan Nikiforovitch raised
      himself on his elbow, and looked at Ivan Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give you my dark-brown sow, the one I have fed in the sty. A
      magnificent sow. You'll see, she'll bring you a litter of pigs next year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see, Ivan Ivanovitch, how you can talk so. What could I do with
      your sow? Make a funeral dinner for the devil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again! You can't get along without the devil! It's a sin! by Heaven, it's
      a sin, Ivan Nikiforovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Ivan Ivanovitch, by offering the deuce knows what kind
      of a sow for my gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is she 'the deuce knows what,' Ivan Nikiforovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? You can judge for yourself perfectly well; here's the gun, a known
      thing; but the deuce knows what that sow is like! If it had not been you
      who said it, Ivan Ivanovitch, I might have put an insulting construction
      on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What defect have you observed in the sow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what do you take me&mdash;for a sow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, sit down! I won't&mdash;No matter about your gun; let it rot
      and rust where it stands in the corner of the storeroom. I don't want to
      say anything more about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After this a pause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say," began Ivan Ivanovitch, "that three kings have declared war
      against our Tzar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Peter Feodorovitch told me so. What sort of war is this, and why is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say exactly, Ivan Nikiforovitch, what the cause is. I suppose
      the kings want us to adopt the Turkish faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fools! They would have it," said Ivan Nikiforovitch, raising his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you see, our Tzar has declared war on them in consequence. 'No,' says
      he, 'do you adopt the faith of Christ!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, our people will beat them, Ivan Ivanovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will. So you won't exchange the gun, Ivan Nikiforovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a strange thing to me, Ivan Ivanovitch, that you, who seem to be a
      man distinguished for sense, should talk such nonsense. What a fool I
      should be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, sit down. God be with it! let it burst! I won't mention it
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment lunch was brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch drank a glass and ate a pie with sour cream. "Listen, Ivan
      Nikiforovitch: I will give you, besides the sow, two sacks of oats. You
      did not sow any oats. You'll have to buy some this year in any case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, Ivan Ivanovitch, I must tell you you are very foolish! Who
      ever heard of swapping a gun for two sacks of oats? Never fear, you don't
      offer your coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you forget, Ivan Nikiforovitch, that I am to give you the sow too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! two sacks of oats and a sow for a gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, is it too little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, for a gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two sacks for a gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two sacks, not empty, but filled with oats; and you've forgotten the
      sow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiss your sow; and if you don't like that, then go to the Evil One!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, get angry now, do! See here; they'll stick your tongue full of
      red-hot needles in the other world for such godless words. After a
      conversation with you, one has to wash one's face and hands and fumigate
      one's self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Ivan Ivanovitch; my gun is a choice thing, a most curious
      thing; and besides, it is a very agreeable decoration in a room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go on like a fool about that gun of yours, Ivan Nikiforovitch," said
      Ivan Ivanovitch with vexation; for he was beginning to be really angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Ivan Ivanovitch, are a regular goose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ivan Nikiforovitch had not uttered that word they would not have
      quarrelled, but would have parted friends as usual; but now things took
      quite another turn. Ivan Ivanovitch flew into a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that you said, Ivan Nikiforovitch?" he said, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said you were like a goose, Ivan Ivanovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you, sir, forgetful of decency and the respect due to a man's
      rank and family, insult him with such a disgraceful name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there disgraceful about it? And why are you flourishing your
      hands so, Ivan Ivanovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dared you, I repeat, in disregard of all decency, call me a goose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I spit on your head, Ivan Ivanovitch! What are you screeching about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch could no longer control himself. His lips quivered; his
      mouth lost its usual V shape, and became like the letter O; he glared so
      that he was terrible to look at. This very rarely happened with Ivan
      Ivanovitch: it was necessary that he should be extremely angry at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I declare to you," exclaimed Ivan Ivanovitch, "that I will no
      longer know you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great pity! By Heaven, I shall never weep on that account!" retorted
      Ivan Nikiforovitch. He lied, by Heaven, he lied! for it was very annoying
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never put my foot inside your house gain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho, ho!" said Ivan Nikiforovitch, vexed, yet not knowing himself what to
      do, and rising to his feet, contrary to his custom. "Hey, there, woman,
      boy!" Thereupon there appeared at the door the same fat woman and the
      small boy, now enveloped in a long and wide coat. "Take Ivan Ivanovitch by
      the arms and lead him to the door!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! a nobleman?" shouted Ivan Ivanovitch with a feeling of vexation and
      dignity. "Just do it if you dare! Come on! I'll annihilate you and your
      stupid master. The crows won't be able to find your bones." Ivan
      Ivanovitch spoke with uncommon force when his spirit was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group presented a striking picture: Ivan Nikiforovitch standing in the
      middle of the room; the woman with her mouth wide open and a senseless,
      terrified look on her face, and Ivan Ivanovitch with uplifted hand, as the
      Roman tribunes are depicted. This was a magnificent spectacle: and yet
      there was but one spectator; the boy in the ample coat, who stood quite
      quietly and picked his nose with his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Ivan Ivanovitch took his hat. "You have behaved well, Ivan
      Nikiforovitch, extremely well! I shall remember it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, Ivan Ivanovitch, go! and see that you don't come in my way: if you
      do, I'll beat your ugly face to a jelly, Ivan Ivanovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that, Ivan Nikiforovitch!" retorted Ivan Ivanovitch, making an
      insulting gesture and banged the door, which squeaked and flew open again
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch appeared at it and wanted to add something more; but
      Ivan Ivanovitch did not glance back and hastened from the yard.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT TOOK PLACE AFTER IVAN IVANOVITCH'S QUARREL WITH IVAN NIKIFOROVITCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      And thus two respectable men, the pride and honour of Mirgorod, had
      quarrelled, and about what? About a bit of nonsense&mdash;a goose. They
      would not see each other, broke off all connection, though hitherto they
      had been known as the most inseparable friends. Every day Ivan Ivanovitch
      and Ivan Nikiforovitch had sent to inquire about each other's health, and
      often conversed together from their balconies and said such charming
      things as did the heart good to listen to. On Sundays, Ivan Ivanovitch, in
      his lambskin pelisse, and Ivan Nikiforovitch, in his cinnamon-coloured
      nankeen spencer, used to set out for church almost arm in arm; and if Ivan
      Ivanovitch, who had remarkably sharp eyes, was the first to catch sight of
      a puddle or any dirt in the street, which sometimes happened in Mirgorod,
      he always said to Ivan Nikiforovitch, "Look out! don't put your foot
      there, it's dirty." Ivan Nikiforovitch, on his side, exhibited the same
      touching tokens of friendship; and whenever he chanced to be standing,
      always held out his hand to Ivan Ivanovitch with his snuff-box, saying:
      "Do me the favour!" And what fine managers both were!&mdash;And these two
      friends!&mdash;When I heard of it, it struck me like a flash of lightning.
      For a long time I would not believe it. Ivan Ivanovitch quarrelling with
      Ivan Nikiforovitch! Such worthy people! What is to be depended upon, then,
      in this world?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ivan Ivanovitch reached home, he remained for some time in a state of
      strong excitement. He usually went, first of all, to the stable to see
      whether his mare was eating her hay; for he had a bay mare with a white
      star on her forehead, and a very pretty little mare she was too; then to
      feed the turkeys and the little pigs with his own hand, and then to his
      room, where he either made wooden dishes, for he could make various
      vessels of wood very tastefully, quite as well as any turner, or read a
      book printed by Liubia, Garia, and Popoff (Ivan Ivanovitch could never
      remember the name, because the serving-maid had long before torn off the
      top part of the title-page while amusing the children), or rested on the
      balcony. But now he did not betake himself to any of his ordinary
      occupations. Instead, on encountering Gapka, he at once began to scold her
      for loitering about without any occupation, though she was carrying groats
      to the kitchen; flung a stick at a cock which came upon the balcony for
      his customary treat; and when the dirty little boy, in his little torn
      blouse, ran up to him and shouted: "Papa, papa! give me a honey-cake," he
      threatened him and stamped at him so fiercely that the frightened child
      fled, God knows whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last he bethought himself, and began to busy himself about his
      every-day duties. He dined late, and it was almost night when he lay down
      to rest on the balcony. A good beet-soup with pigeons, which Gapka had
      cooked for him, quite drove from his mind the occurrences of the morning.
      Again Ivan Ivanovitch began to gaze at his belongings with satisfaction.
      At length his eye rested on the neighbouring yard; and he said to himself,
      "I have not been to Ivan Nikiforovitch's to-day: I'll go there now." So
      saying, Ivan Ivanovitch took his stick and his hat, and directed his steps
      to the street; but scarcely had he passed through the gate than he
      recollected the quarrel, spit, and turned back. Almost the same thing
      happened at Ivan Nikiforovitch's house. Ivan Ivanovitch saw the woman put
      her foot on the fence, with the intention of climbing over into his yard,
      when suddenly Ivan Nikiforovitch's voice was heard crying: "Come back! it
      won't do!" But Ivan Ivanovitch found it very tiresome. It is quite
      possible that these worthy men would have made their peace next day if a
      certain occurrence in Ivan Nikiforovitch's house had not destroyed all
      hopes and poured oil upon the fire of enmity which was ready to die out.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the evening of that very day, Agafya Fedosyevna arrived at Ivan
      Nikiforovitch's. Agafya Fedosyevna was not Ivan Nikiforovitch's relative,
      nor his sister-in-law, nor even his fellow-godparent. There seemed to be
      no reason why she should come to him, and he was not particularly glad of
      her company; still, she came, and lived on him for weeks at a time, and
      even longer. Then she took possession of the keys and took the management
      of the whole house into her own hands. This was extremely displeasing to
      Ivan Nikiforovitch; but he, to his amazement, obeyed her like a child; and
      although he occasionally attempted to dispute, yet Agafya Fedosyevna
      always got the better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess that I do not understand why things are so arranged, that
      women should seize us by the nose as deftly as they do the handle of a
      teapot. Either their hands are so constructed or else our noses are good
      for nothing else. And notwithstanding the fact that Ivan Nikiforovitch's
      nose somewhat resembled a plum, she grasped that nose and led him about
      after her like a dog. He even, in her presence, involuntarily altered his
      ordinary manner of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agafya Fedosyevna wore a cap on her head, and a coffee-coloured cloak with
      yellow flowers and had three warts on her nose. Her figure was like a
      cask, and it would have been as hard to tell where to look for her waist
      as for her to see her nose without a mirror. Her feet were small and
      shaped like two cushions. She talked scandal, ate boiled beet-soup in the
      morning, and swore extremely; and amidst all these various occupations her
      countenance never for one instant changed its expression, which
      phenomenon, as a rule, women alone are capable of displaying.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she arrived, everything went wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Nikiforovitch, don't you make peace with him, nor ask his
      forgiveness; he wants to ruin you; that's the kind of man he is! you don't
      know him yet!" That cursed woman whispered and whispered, and managed so
      that Ivan Nikiforovitch would not even hear Ivan Ivanovitch mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything assumed another aspect. If his neighbour's dog ran into the
      yard, it was beaten within an inch of its life; the children, who climbed
      over the fence, were sent back with howls, their little shirts stripped
      up, and marks of a switch behind. Even the old woman, when Ivan Ivanovitch
      ventured to ask her about something, did something so insulting that Ivan
      Ivanovitch, being an extremely delicate man, only spit, and muttered,
      "What a nasty woman! even worse than her master!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, as a climax to all the insults, his hated neighbour built a
      goose-shed right against his fence at the spot where they usually climbed
      over, as if with the express intention of redoubling the insult. This
      shed, so hateful to Ivan Ivanovitch, was constructed with diabolical
      swiftness&mdash;in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This aroused wrath and a desire for revenge in Ivan Ivanovitch. He showed
      no signs of bitterness, in spite of the fact that the shed encroached on
      his land; but his heart beat so violently that it was extremely difficult
      for him to preserve his calm appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed the day in this manner. Night came&mdash;Oh, if I were a
      painter, how magnificently I would depict the night's charms! I would
      describe how all Mirgorod sleeps; how steadily the myriads of stars gaze
      down upon it; how the apparent quiet is filled far and near with the
      barking of dogs; how the love-sick sacristan steals past them, and scales
      the fence with knightly fearlessness; how the white walls of the houses,
      bathed in the moonlight, grow whiter still, the overhanging trees darker;
      how the shadows of the trees fall blacker, the flowers and the silent
      grass become more fragrant, and the crickets, unharmonious cavaliers of
      the night, strike up their rattling song in friendly fashion on all sides.
      I would describe how, in one of the little, low-roofed, clay houses, the
      black-browed village maid, tossing on her lonely couch, dreams with
      heaving bosom of some hussar's spurs and moustache, and how the moonlight
      smiles upon her cheeks. I would describe how the black shadows of the bats
      flit along the white road before they alight upon the white chimneys of
      the cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would hardly be within my power to depict Ivan Ivanovitch as he
      crept out that night, saw in hand; or the various emotions written on his
      countenance! Quietly, most quietly, he crawled along and climbed upon the
      goose-shed. Ivan Nikiforovitch's dogs knew nothing, as yet, of the quarrel
      between them; and so they permitted him, as an old friend, to enter the
      shed, which rested upon four oaken posts. Creeping up to the nearest post
      he applied his saw and began to cut. The noise produced by the saw caused
      him to glance about him every moment, but the recollection of the insult
      restored his courage. The first post was sawed through. Ivan Ivanovitch
      began upon the next. His eyes burned and he saw nothing for terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he uttered an exclamation and became petrified with fear. A
      ghost appeared to him; but he speedily recovered himself on perceiving
      that it was a goose, thrusting its neck out at him. Ivan Ivanovitch spit
      with vexation and proceeded with his work. The second post was sawed
      through; the building trembled. His heart beat so violently when he began
      on the third, that he had to stop several times. The post was more than
      half sawed through when the frail building quivered violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch had barely time to spring back when it came down with a
      crash. Seizing his saw, he ran home in the greatest terror and flung
      himself upon his bed, without having sufficient courage to peep from the
      window at the consequences of his terrible deed. It seemed to him as
      though Ivan Nikiforovitch's entire household&mdash;the old woman, Ivan
      Nikiforovitch, the boy in the endless coat, all with sticks, and led by
      Agafya Fedosyevna&mdash;were coming to tear down and destroy his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch passed the whole of the following day in a perfect fever.
      It seemed to him that his detested neighbour would set fire to his house
      at least in revenge for this; and so he gave orders to Gapka to keep a
      constant lookout, everywhere, and see whether dry straw were laid against
      it anywhere. Finally, in order to forestall Ivan Nikiforovitch, he
      determined to enter a complaint against him before the district judge of
      Mirgorod. In what it consisted can be learned from the following chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE DISTRICT JUDGE OF MIRGOROD
    </h3>
    <p>
      A wonderful town is Mirgorod! How many buildings are there with straw,
      rush, and even wooden roofs! On the right is a street, on the left a
      street, and fine fences everywhere. Over them twine hop-vines, upon them
      hang pots; from behind them the sunflowers show their sun-like heads,
      poppies blush, fat pumpkins peep; all is luxury itself! The fence is
      invariably garnished with articles which render it still more picturesque:
      woman's widespread undergarments of checked woollen stuff, shirts, or
      trousers. There is no such thing as theft or rascality in Mirgorod, so
      everybody hangs upon his fence whatever strikes his fancy. If you go on to
      the square, you will surely stop and admire the view: such a wonderful
      pool is there! The finest you ever saw. It occupies nearly the whole of
      the square. A truly magnificent pool! The houses and cottages, which at a
      distance might be mistaken for hayricks, stand around it, lost in
      admiration of its beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I agree with those who think that there is no better house than that
      of the district judge. Whether it is of oak or birch is nothing to the
      point; but it has, my dear sirs, eight windows! eight windows in a row,
      looking directly on the square and upon that watery expanse which I have
      just mentioned, and which the chief of police calls a lake. It alone is
      painted the colour of granite. All the other houses in Mirgorod are merely
      whitewashed. Its roof is of wood, and would have been even painted red,
      had not the government clerks eaten the oil which had been prepared for
      that purpose, as it happened during a fast; and so the roof remained
      unpainted. Towards the square projects a porch, which the chickens
      frequently visit, because that porch is nearly always strewn with grain or
      something edible, not intentionally, but through the carelessness of
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is divided into two parts: one of which is the court-room; the
      other the jail. In the half which contains the court-room are two neat,
      whitewashed rooms, the front one for clients, the other having a table
      adorned with ink-spots, and with a looking-glass upon it, and four oak
      chairs with tall backs; whilst along the wall stand iron-bound chests, in
      which are preserved bundles of papers relating to district law-suits. Upon
      one of the chests stood at that time a pair of boots, polished with wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court had been open since morning. The judge, a rather stout man,
      though thinner than Ivan Nikiforovitch, with a good-natured face, a greasy
      dressing-gown, a pipe, and a cup of tea, was conversing with the clerk of
      the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge's lips were directly under his nose, so that he could snuff his
      upper lip as much as he liked. It served him instead of a snuff-box, for
      the snuff intended for his nose almost always lodged upon it. So the judge
      was talking with the assistant. A barefooted girl stood holding a tray
      with cups at once side of them. At the end of the table, the secretary was
      reading the decision in some case, but in such a mournful and monotonous
      voice that the condemned man himself would have fallen asleep while
      listening to it. The judge, no doubt, would have been the first to do so
      had he not entered into an engrossing conversation while it was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expressly tried to find out," said the judge, sipping his already cold
      tea from the cup, "how they manage to sing so well. I had a splendid
      thrush two years ago. Well, all of a sudden he was completely done for,
      and began to sing, God knows what! He got worse and worse and worse and
      worse as time went on; he began to rattle and get hoarse&mdash;just good
      for nothing! And this is how it happened: a little lump, not so big as a
      pea, had come under his throat. It was only necessary to prick that little
      swelling with a needle&mdash;Zachar Prokofievitch taught me that; and, if
      you like, I'll just tell you how it was. I went to him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I read another, Demyan Demyanovitch?" broke in the secretary, who
      had not been reading for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you finished already? Only think how quickly! And I did not hear a
      word of it! Where is it? Give it me and I'll sign it. What else have you
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The case of Cossack Bokitok for stealing a cow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; read it!&mdash;Yes, so I went to him&mdash;I can even tell you
      in detail how he entertained me. There was vodka, and dried sturgeon,
      excellent! Yes, not our sturgeon," there the judge smacked his tongue and
      smiled, upon which his nose took a sniff at its usual snuff-box, "such as
      our Mirgorod shops sell us. I ate no herrings, for, as you know, they give
      me heart-burn; but I tasted the caviare&mdash;very fine caviare, too!
      There's no doubt it, excellent! Then I drank some peach-brandy, real
      gentian. There was saffron-brandy also; but, as you know, I never take
      that. You see, it was all very good. In the first place, to whet your
      appetite, as they say, and then to satisfy it&mdash;Ah! speak of an
      angel," exclaimed the judge, all at once, catching sight of Ivan
      Ivanovitch as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be with us! I wish you a good-morning," said Ivan Ivanovitch, bowing
      all round with his usual politeness. How well he understood the art of
      fascinating everybody in his manner! I never beheld such refinement. He
      knew his own worth quite well, and therefore looked for universal respect
      as his due. The judge himself handed Ivan Ivanovitch a chair; and his nose
      inhaled all the snuff resting on his upper lip, which, with him, was
      always a sign of great pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you take, Ivan Ivanovitch?" he inquired: "will you have a cup
      of tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, much obliged," replied Ivan Ivanovitch, as he bowed and seated
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me the favour&mdash;one little cup," repeated the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you; much obliged for your hospitality," replied Ivan
      Ivanovitch, and rose, bowed, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just one little cup," repeated the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, do not trouble yourself, Demyan Demyanovitch." Whereupon Ivan
      Ivanovitch again rose, bowed, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little cup!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, just a little cup," said Ivan Ivanovitch, and reached
      out his hand to the tray. Heavens! What a height of refinement there was
      in that man! It is impossible to describe what a pleasant impression such
      manners produce!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not have another cup?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you sincerely," answered Ivan Ivanovitch, turning his cup upside
      down upon the tray and bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me the favour, Ivan Ivanovitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot; much obliged." Thereupon Ivan Ivanovitch bowed and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Ivanovitch, for the sake of our friendship, just one little cup!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I am extremely indebted for your hospitality." So saying, Ivan
      Ivanovitch bowed and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a cup, one little cup!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch put his hand out to the tray and took a cup. Oh, the
      deuce! How can a man contrive to support his dignity!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Demyan Demyanovitch," said Ivan Ivanovitch, swallowing the last drain, "I
      have pressing business with you; I want to enter a complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ivan Ivanovitch set down his cup, and drew from his pocket a sheet of
      stamped paper, written over. "A complaint against my enemy, my declared
      enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Nikiforovitch Dovgotchkun."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the judge nearly fell off his chair. "What do you say?" he
      exclaimed, clasping his hands; "Ivan Ivanovitch, is this you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see yourself that it is I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord and all the saints be with you! What! You! Ivan Ivanovitch! you
      have fallen out with Ivan Nikiforovitch! Is it your mouth which says that?
      Repeat it! Is not some one hid behind you who is speaking instead of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there incredible about it? I can't endure the sight of him: he
      has done me a deadly injury&mdash;he has insulted my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Trinity! How am I to believe my mother now? Why, every day, when I
      quarrel with my sister, the old woman says, 'Children, you live together
      like dogs. If you would only take pattern by Ivan Ivanovitch and Ivan
      Nikiforovitch, they are friends indeed! such friends! such worthy people!'
      There you are with your friend! Tell me what this is about. How is it?"
    </p>

      "It is a delicate business, Demyan Demyanovitch; it is impossible to
      relate it in words: be pleased rather to read my plaint. Here, take it by
      this side; it is more convenient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it, Taras Tikhonovitch," said the judge, turning to the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras Tikhonovitch took the plaint; and blowing his nose, as all district
      judges' secretaries blow their noses, with the assistance of two fingers,
      he began to read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the nobleman and landed proprietor of the Mirgorod District, Ivan
      Pererepenko, son of Ivan, a plaint: concerning which the following points
      are to be noted:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, nobleman, known to all the world for
      his godless acts, which inspire disgust, and in lawlessness exceed all
      bounds, on the seventh day of July of this year 1810, inflicted upon me a
      deadly insult, touching my personal honour, and likewise tending to the
      humiliation and confusion of my rank and family. The said nobleman, of
      repulsive aspect, has also a pugnacious disposition, and is full to
      overflowing with blasphemy and quarrelsome words."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the reader paused for an instant to blow his nose again; but the
      judge folded his hands in approbation and murmured to himself, "What a
      ready pen! Lord! how this man does write!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch requested that the reading might proceed, and Taras
      Tikhonovitch went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The said Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, when I went to him with a
      friendly proposition, called me publicly by an epithet insulting and
      injurious to my honour, namely, a goose, whereas it is known to the whole
      district of Mirgorod, that I never was named after that disgusting
      creature, and have no intention of ever being named after it. The proof of
      my noble extraction is that, in the baptismal register to be found in the
      Church of the Three Bishops, the day of my birth, and likewise the fact of
      my baptism, are inscribed. But a goose, as is well known to every one who
      has any knowledge of science, cannot be inscribed in the baptismal
      register; for a goose is not a man but a fowl; which, likewise, is
      sufficiently well known even to persons who have not been to college. But
      the said evil-minded nobleman, being privy to all these facts, affronted
      me with the aforesaid foul word, for no other purpose than to offer a
      deadly insult to my rank and station.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. And the same impolite and indecent nobleman, moreover, attempted
      injury to my property, inherited by me from my father, a member of the
      clerical profession, Ivan Pererepenko, son of Onisieff, of blessed memory,
      inasmuch that he, contrary to all law, transported directly opposite my
      porch a goose-shed, which was done with no other intention that to
      emphasise the insult offered me; for the said shed had, up to that time,
      stood in a very suitable situation, and was still sufficiently strong. But
      the loathsome intention of the aforesaid nobleman consisted simply in
      this: viz., in making me a witness of unpleasant occurrences; for it is
      well known that no man goes into a shed, much less into a goose-shed, for
      polite purposes. In the execution of his lawless deed, the two front posts
      trespassed on my land, received by me during the lifetime of my father,
      Ivan Pererepenko, son of Onisieff, of blessed memory, beginning at the
      granary, thence in a straight line to the spot where the women wash the
      pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "3. The above-described nobleman, whose very name and surname inspire
      thorough disgust, cherishes in his mind a malicious design to burn me in
      my own house. Which the infallible signs, hereinafter mentioned, fully
      demonstrate; in the first place, the said wicked nobleman has begun to
      emerge frequently from his apartments, which he never did formerly on
      account of his laziness and the disgusting corpulence of his body; in the
      second place, in his servants' apartments, adjoining the fence,
      surrounding my own land, received by me from my father of blessed memory,
      Ivan Pererepenko, son of Onisieff, a light burns every day, and for a
      remarkably long period of time, which is also a clear proof of the fact.
      For hitherto, owing to his repulsive niggardliness, not only the
      tallow-candle but also the grease-lamp has been extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore I pray that the said nobleman, Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of
      Nikifor, being plainly guilty of incendiarism, of insult to my rank, name,
      and family, and of illegal appropriation of my property, and, worse than
      all else, of malicious and deliberate addition to my surname, of the
      nickname of goose, be condemned by the court, to fine, satisfaction,
      costs, and damages, and, being chained, be removed to the town jail, and
      that judgment be rendered upon this, my plaint, immediately and without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Written and composed by Ivan Pererepenko, son of Ivan, nobleman, and
      landed proprietor of Mirgorod."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the reading of the plaint was concluded, the judge approached
      Ivanovitch, took him by the button, and began to talk to him after this
      fashion: "What are you doing, Ivan Ivanovitch? Fear God! throw away that
      plaint, let it go! may Satan carry it off! Better take Ivan Nikiforovitch
      by the hand and kiss him, buy some Santurinski or Nikopolski liquor, make
      a punch, and call me in. We will drink it up together and forget all
      unpleasantness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Demyan Demyanovitch! it's not that sort of an affair," said Ivan
      Ivanovitch, with the dignity which always became him so well; "it is not
      an affair which can be arranged by a friendly agreement. Farewell!
      Good-day to you, too, gentlemen," he continued with the same dignity,
      turning to them all. "I hope that my plaint will lead to proper action
      being taken;" and out he went, leaving all present in a state of
      stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge sat down without uttering a word; the secretary took a pinch of
      snuff; the clerks upset some broken fragments of bottles which served for
      inkstands; and the judge himself, in absence of mind, spread out a puddle
      of ink upon the table with his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say to this, Dorofei Trofimovitch?" said the judge, turning
      to the assistant after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've nothing to say," replied the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things do happen!" continued the judge. He had not finished saying
      this before the door creaked and the front half of Ivan Nikiforovitch
      presented itself in the court-room; the rest of him remaining in the
      ante-room. The appearance of Ivan Nikiforovitch, and in court too, seemed
      so extraordinary that the judge screamed; the secretary stopped reading;
      one clerk, in his frieze imitation of a dress-coat, took his pen in his
      lips; and the other swallowed a fly. Even the constable on duty and the
      watchman, a discharged soldier who up to that moment had stood by the door
      scratching about his dirty tunic, with chevrons on its arm, dropped his
      jaw and trod on some one's foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What chance brings you here? How is your health, Ivan Nikiforovitch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ivan Nikiforovitch was neither dead nor alive; for he was stuck fast
      in the door, and could not take a step either forwards or backwards. In
      vain did the judge shout into the ante-room that some one there should
      push Ivan Nikiforovitch forward into the court-room. In the ante-room
      there was only one old woman with a petition, who, in spite of all the
      efforts of her bony hands, could accomplish nothing. Then one of the
      clerks, with thick lips, a thick nose, eyes which looked askance and
      intoxicated, broad shoulders, and ragged elbows, approached the front half
      of Ivan Nikiforovitch, crossed his hands for him as though he had been a
      child, and winked at the old soldier, who braced his knee against Ivan
      Nikiforovitch's belly, so, in spite of the latter's piteous moans, he was
      squeezed out into the ante-room. Then they pulled the bolts, and opened
      the other half of the door. Meanwhile the clerk and his assistant,
      breathing hard with their friendly exertions, exhaled such a strong odour
      that the court-room seemed temporarily turned into a drinking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hurt, Ivan Nikiforovitch? I will tell my mother to send you a
      decoction of brandy, with which you need but to rub your back and stomach
      and all your pains will disappear."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ivan Nikiforovitch dropped into a chair, and could utter no word
      beyond prolonged oh's. Finally, in a faint and barely audible voice from
      fatigue, he exclaimed, "Wouldn't you like some?" and drawing his snuff-box
      from his pocket, added, "Help yourself, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very glad to see you," replied the judge; "but I cannot conceive what
      made you put yourself to so much trouble, and favour us with so unexpected
      an honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A plaint!" Ivan Nikiforovitch managed to ejaculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A plaint? What plaint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A complaint..." here his asthma entailed a prolonged pause&mdash;"Oh! a
      complaint against that rascal&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch Pererepenko!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you too! Such particular friends! A complaint against such a
      benevolent man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's Satan himself!" ejaculated Ivan Nikiforovitch abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge crossed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take my plaint, and read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to be done. Read it, Taras Tikhonovitch," said the
      judge, turning to the secretary with an expression of displeasure, which
      caused his nose to sniff at his upper lip, which generally occurred only
      as a sign of great enjoyment. This independence on the part of his nose
      caused the judge still greater vexation. He pulled out his handkerchief,
      and rubbed off all the snuff from his upper lip in order to punish it for
      its daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary, having gone through the usual performance, which he always
      indulged in before he began to read, that is to say, blowing his nose
      without the aid of a pocket-handkerchief, began in his ordinary voice, in
      the following manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, nobleman of the Mirgorod District,
      presents a plaint, and begs to call attention to the following points:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. Through his hateful malice and plainly manifested ill-will, the person
      calling himself a nobleman, Ivan Pererepenko, son of Ivan, perpetrates
      against me every manner of injury, damage, and like spiteful deeds, which
      inspire me with terror. Yesterday afternoon, like a brigand and thief,
      with axes, saws, chisels, and various locksmith's tools, he came by night
      into my yard and into my own goose-shed located within it, and with his
      own hand, and in outrageous manner, destroyed it; for which very illegal
      and burglarious deed on my side I gave no manner of cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. The same nobleman Pererepenko has designs upon my life; and on the 7th
      of last month, cherishing this design in secret, he came to me, and began,
      in a friendly and insidious manner, to ask of me a gun which was in my
      chamber, and offered me for it, with the miserliness peculiar to him, many
      worthless objects, such as a brown sow and two sacks of oats. Divining at
      that time his criminal intentions, I endeavoured in every way to dissuade
      him from it: but the said rascal and scoundrel, Ivan Pererepenko, son of
      Ivan, abused me like a muzhik, and since that time has cherished against
      me an irreconcilable enmity. His sister was well known to every one as a
      loose character, and went off with a regiment of chasseurs which was
      stationed at Mirgorod five years ago; but she inscribed her husband as a
      peasant. His father and mother too were not law-abiding people, and both
      were inconceivable drunkards. The afore-mentioned nobleman and robber,
      Pererepenko, in his beastly and blameworthy actions, goes beyond all his
      family, and under the guise of piety does the most immoral things. He does
      not observe the fasts; for on the eve of St. Philip's this atheist bought
      a sheep, and next day ordered his mistress, Gapka, to kill it, alleging
      that he needed tallow for lamps and candles at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore I pray that the said nobleman, a manifest robber, church-thief,
      and rascal, convicted of plundering and stealing, may be put in irons, and
      confined in the jail or the government prison, and there, under
      supervision, deprived of his rank and nobility, well flogged, and banished
      to forced labour in Siberia, and that he may be commanded to pay damages
      and costs, and that judgment may be rendered on this my petition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To this plaint, Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, noble of the Mirgorod
      district, has set his hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the secretary had finished reading, Ivan Nikiforovitch seized
      his hat and bowed, with the intention of departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, Ivan Nikiforovitch?" the judge called after him.
      "Sit down a little while. Have some tea. Orishko, why are you standing
      there, you stupid girl, winking at the clerks? Go, bring tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ivan Nikiforovitch, in terror at having got so far from home, and at
      having undergone such a fearful quarantine, made haste to crawl through
      the door, saying, "Don't trouble yourself. It is with pleasure that I&mdash;"
      and closed it after him, leaving all present stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to be done. Both plaints were entered; and the affair
      promised to assume a sufficiently serious aspect when an unforeseen
      occurrence lent an added interest to it. As the judge was leaving the
      court in company with the clerk and secretary, and the employees were
      thrusting into sacks the fowls, eggs, loaves, pies, cracknels, and other
      odds and ends brought by the plaintiffs&mdash;just at that moment a brown
      sow rushed into the room and snatched, to the amazement of the spectators,
      neither a pie nor a crust of bread but Ivan Nikiforovitch's plaint, which
      lay at the end of the table with its leaves hanging over. Having seized
      the document, mistress sow ran off so briskly that not one of the clerks
      or officials could catch her, in spite of the rulers and ink-bottles they
      hurled after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extraordinary occurrence produced a terrible muddle, for there had
      not even been a copy taken of the plaint. The judge, that is to say, his
      secretary and the assistant debated for a long time upon such an
      unheard-of affair. Finally it was decided to write a report of the matter
      to the governor, as the investigation of the matter pertained more to the
      department of the city police. Report No. 389 was despatched to him that
      same day; and also upon that day there came to light a sufficiently
      curious explanation, which the reader may learn from the following
      chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH ARE DETAILED THE DELIBERATIONS OF TWO IMPORTANT PERSONAGES OF
      MIRGOROD
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Ivan Ivanovitch had arranged his domestic affairs and stepped
      out upon the balcony, according to his custom, to lie down, he saw, to his
      indescribable amazement, something red at the gate. This was the red
      facings of the chief of police's coat, which were polished equally with
      his collar, and resembled varnished leather on the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch thought to himself, "It's not bad that Peter Feodorovitch
      has come to talk it over with me." But he was very much surprised to see
      that the chief was walking remarkably fast and flourishing his hands,
      which was very rarely the case with him. There were eight buttons on the
      chief of police's uniform: the ninth, torn off in some manner during the
      procession at the consecration of the church two years before, the police
      had not been able to find up to this time: although the chief, on the
      occasion of the daily reports made to him by the sergeants, always asked,
      "Has that button been found?" These eight buttons were strewn about him as
      women sow beans&mdash;one to the right and one to the left. His left foot
      had been struck by a ball in the last campaign, and so he limped and threw
      it out so far to one side as to almost counteract the efforts of the right
      foot. The more briskly the chief of police worked his walking apparatus
      the less progress he made in advance. So while he was getting to the
      balcony, Ivan Ivanovitch had plenty of time to lose himself in surmises as
      to why the chief was flourishing his hands so vigorously. This interested
      him the more, as the matter seemed one of unusual importance; for the
      chief had on a new dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Peter Feodorovitch!" cried Ivan Ivanovitch, who was, as has
      already been stated, exceedingly curious, and could not restrain his
      impatience as the chief of police began to ascend to the balcony, yet
      never raised his eyes, and kept grumbling at his foot, which could not be
      persuaded to mount the step at the first attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish my good friend and benefactor, Ivan Ivanovitch, a good-day,"
      replied the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray sit down. I see that you are weary, as your lame foot hinders&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My foot!" screamed the chief, bestowing upon Ivan Ivanovitch a glance
      such as a giant might cast upon a pigmy, a pedant upon a dancing-master:
      and he stretched out his foot and stamped upon the floor with it. This
      boldness cost him dear; for his whole body wavered and his nose struck the
      railing; but the brave preserver of order, with the purpose of making
      light of it, righted himself immediately, and began to feel in his pocket
      as if to get his snuff-box. "I must report to you, my dear friend and
      benefactor, Ivan Ivanovitch, that never in all my days have I made such a
      march. Yes, seriously. For instance, during the campaign of 1807&mdash;Ah!
      I will tell to you how I crawled through the enclosure to see a pretty
      little German." Here the chief closed one eye and executed a diabolically
      sly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been to-day?" asked Ivan Ivanovitch, wishing to cut the
      chief short and bring him more speedily to the object of his visit. He
      would have very much liked to inquire what the chief meant to tell him,
      but his extensive knowledge of the world showed him the impropriety of
      such a question; and so he had to keep himself well in hand and await a
      solution, his heart, meanwhile, beating with unusual force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, excuse me! I was going to tell you&mdash;where was I?" answered the
      chief of police. "In the first place, I report that the weather is fine
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these last words, Ivan Ivanovitch nearly died.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But permit me," went on the chief. "I have come to you to-day about a
      very important affair." Here the chief's face and bearing assumed the same
      careworn aspect with which he had ascended to the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch breathed again, and shook as if in a fever, omitting not,
      as was his habit, to put a question. "What is the important matter? Is it
      important?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray judge for yourself; in the first place I venture to report to you,
      dear friend and benefactor, Ivan Ivanovitch, that you&mdash;I beg you to
      observe that, for my own part, I should have nothing to say; but the rules
      of government require it&mdash;that you have transgressed the rules of
      propriety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Peter Feodorovitch? I don't understand at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Ivan Ivanovitch! how can it be that you do not understand?
      Your own beast has destroyed an important government document; and you can
      still say, after that, that you do not understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What beast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own brown sow, with your permission, be it said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I be responsible? Why did the door-keeper of the court open the
      door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Ivan Ivanovitch, your own brown sow. You must be responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am extremely obliged to you for comparing me to a sow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I did not say that, Ivan Ivanovitch! By Heaven! I did not say so!
      Pray judge from your own clear conscience. It is known to you without
      doubt, that in accordance with the views of the government, unclean
      animals are forbidden to roam about the town, particularly in the
      principal streets. Admit, now, that it is prohibited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows what you are talking about! A mighty important business that a
      sow got into the street!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to inform you, Ivan Ivanovitch, permit me, permit me, that this
      is utterly inadvisable. What is to be done? The authorities command, we
      must obey. I don't deny that sometimes chickens and geese run about the
      street, and even about the square, pray observe, chickens and geese; but
      only last year, I gave orders that pigs and goats were not to be admitted
      to the public squares, which regulations I directed to be read aloud at
      the time before all the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Peter Feodorovitch, I see nothing here except that you are doing your
      best to insult me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you cannot say that, my dearest friend and benefactor, that I have
      tried to insult you. Bethink yourself: I never said a word to you last
      year when you built a roof a whole foot higher than is allowed by law. On
      the contrary, I pretended not to have observed it. Believe me, my dearest
      friend, even now, I would, so to speak&mdash;but my duty&mdash;in a word,
      my duty demands that I should have an eye to cleanliness. Just judge for
      yourself, when suddenly in the principal street&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine principal streets yours are! Every woman goes there and throws down
      any rubbish she chooses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to inform you, Ivan Ivanovitch, that it is you who are
      insulting me. That does sometimes happen, but, as a rule, only besides
      fences, sheds, or storehouses; but that a filthy sow should intrude
      herself in the main street, in the square, now is a matter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a matter? Peter Feodorovitch! surely a sow is one of God's
      creatures!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed. Everybody knows that you are a learned man, that you are
      acquainted with sciences and various other subjects. I never studied the
      sciences: I began to learn to write in my thirteenth year. Of course you
      know that I was a soldier in the ranks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm!" said Ivan Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued the chief of police, "in 1801 I was in the Forty-second
      Regiment of chasseurs, lieutenant in the fourth company. The commander of
      our company was, if I may be permitted to mention it, Captain Eremeeff."
      Thereupon the chief of police thrust his fingers into the snuff-box which
      Ivan Ivanovitch was holding open, and stirred up the snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch answered, "Hm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my duty," went on the chief of police, "is to obey the commands of
      the authorities. Do you know, Ivan Ivanovitch, that a person who purloins
      a government document in the court-room incurs capital punishment equally
      with other criminals?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it; and, if you like, I can give you lessons. It is so decreed
      with regard to people, as if you, for instance, were to steal a document;
      but a sow is an animal, one of God's creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; but the law reads, 'Those guilty of theft'&mdash;I beg of you
      to listen most attentively&mdash;'Those guilty!' Here is indicated neither
      race nor sex nor rank: of course an animal can be guilty. You may say what
      you please; but the animal, until the sentence is pronounced by the court,
      should be committed to the charge of the police as a transgressor of the
      law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Peter Feodorovitch," retorted Ivan Ivanovitch coolly, "that shall not
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you like: only I must carry out the orders of the authorities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you threatening me with? Probably you want to send that
      one-armed soldier after her. I shall order the woman who tends the door to
      drive him off with the poker: he'll get his last arm broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not dispute with you. In case you will not commit the sow to the
      charge of the police, then do what you please with her: kill her for
      Christmas, if you like, and make hams of her, or eat her as she is. Only I
      should like to ask you, in case you make sausages, to send me a couple,
      such as your Gapka makes so well, of blood and lard. My Agrafena
      Trofimovna is extremely fond of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will send you a couple of sausages if you permit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be extremely obliged to you, dear friend and benefactor. Now
      permit me to say one word more. I am commissioned by the judge, as well as
      by all our acquaintances, so to speak, to effect a reconciliation between
      you and your friend, Ivan Nikiforovitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! with that brute! I to be reconciled to that clown! Never! It shall
      not be, it shall not be!" Ivan Ivanovitch was in a remarkably determined
      frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you like," replied the chief of police, treating both nostrils to
      snuff. "I will not venture to advise you; but permit me to mention&mdash;here
      you live at enmity, and if you make peace..."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ivan Ivanovitch began to talk about catching quail, as he usually did
      when he wanted to put an end to a conversation. So the chief of police was
      obliged to retire without having achieved any success whatever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FROM WHICH THE READER CAN EASILY DISCOVER WHAT IS CONTAINED IN IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      In spite of all the judge's efforts to keep the matter secret, all
      Mirgorod knew by the next day that Ivan Ivanovitch's sow had stolen Ivan
      Nikiforovitch's petition. The chief of police himself, in a moment of
      forgetfulness, was the first to betray himself. When Ivan Nikiforovitch
      was informed of it he said nothing: he merely inquired, "Was it the brown
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Agafya Fedosyevna, who was present, began again to urge on Ivan
      Nikiforovitch. "What's the matter with you, Ivan Nikiforovitch? People
      will laugh at you as at a fool if you let it pass. How can you remain a
      nobleman after that? You will be worse than the old woman who sells the
      honeycakes with hemp-seed oil you are so fond of."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the mischief-maker persuaded him. She hunted up somewhere a
      middle-aged man with dark complexion, spots all over his face, and a
      dark-blue surtout patched on the elbows, a regular official scribbler. He
      blacked his boots with tar, wore three pens behind his ear, and a glass
      vial tied to his buttonhole with a string instead of an ink-bottle: ate as
      many as nine pies at once, and put the tenth in his pocket, and wrote so
      many slanders of all sorts on a single sheet of stamped paper that no
      reader could get through all at one time without interspersing coughs and
      sneezes. This man laboured, toiled, and wrote, and finally concocted the
      following document:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the District Judge of Mirgorod, from the noble, Ivan Dovgotchkun, son
      of Nikifor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In pursuance of my plaint which was presented by me, Ivan Dovgotchkun,
      son of Nikifor, against the nobleman, Ivan Pererepenko, son of Ivan, to
      which the judge of the Mirgorod district court has exhibited indifference;
      and the shameless, high-handed deed of the brown sow being kept secret,
      and coming to my ears from outside parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the said neglect, plainly malicious, lies incontestably at the
      judge's door; for the sow is a stupid animal, and therefore unfitted for
      the theft of papers. From which it plainly appears that the said
      frequently mentioned sow was not otherwise than instigated to the same by
      the opponent, Ivan Pererepenko, son of Ivan, calling himself a nobleman,
      and already convicted of theft, conspiracy against life, and desecration
      of a church. But the said Mirgorod judge, with the partisanship peculiar
      to him, gave his private consent to this individual; for without such
      consent the said sow could by no possible means have been admitted to
      carry off the document; for the judge of the district court of Mirgorod is
      well provided with servants: it was only necessary to summon a soldier,
      who is always on duty in the reception-room, and who, although he has but
      one eye and one somewhat damaged arm, has powers quite adequate to driving
      out a sow, and to beating it with a stick, from which is credibly evident
      the criminal neglect of the said Mirgorod judge and the incontestable
      sharing of the Jew-like spoils therefrom resulting from these mutual
      conspirators. And the aforesaid robber and nobleman, Ivan Pererepenko, son
      of Ivan, having disgraced himself, finished his turning on his lathe.
      Wherefore, I, the noble Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, declare to the
      said district judge in proper form that if the said brown sow, or the man
      Pererepenko, be not summoned to the court, and judgment in accordance with
      justice and my advantage pronounced upon her, then I, Ivan Dovgotchkun,
      son of Nikifor, shall present a plaint, with observance of all due
      formalities, against the said district judge for his illegal partisanship
      to the superior courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Dovgotchkun, son of Nikifor, noble of the Mirgorod District."
    </p>
    <p>
      This petition produced its effect. The judge was a man of timid
      disposition, as all good people generally are. He betook himself to the
      secretary. But the secretary emitted from his lips a thick "Hm," and
      exhibited on his countenance that indifferent and diabolically equivocal
      expression which Satan alone assumes when he sees his victim hastening to
      his feet. One resource remained to him, to reconcile the two friends. But
      how to set about it, when all attempts up to that time had been so
      unsuccessful? Nevertheless, it was decided to make another effort; but
      Ivan Ivanovitch declared outright that he would not hear of it, and even
      flew into a violent passion; whilst Ivan Nikiforovitch, in lieu of an
      answer, turned his back and would not utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the case went on with the unusual promptness upon which courts
      usually pride themselves. Documents were dated, labelled, numbered, sewed
      together, registered all in one day, and the matter laid on the shelf,
      where it continued to lie, for one, two, or three years. Many brides were
      married; a new street was laid out in Mirgorod; one of the judge's double
      teeth fell out and two of his eye-teeth; more children than ever ran about
      Ivan Ivanovitch's yard; Ivan Nikiforovitch, as a reproof to Ivan
      Ivanovitch, constructed a new goose-shed, although a little farther back
      than the first, and built himself completely off from his neighbour, so
      that these worthy people hardly ever beheld each other's faces; but still
      the case lay in the cabinet, which had become marbled with ink-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime a very important event for all Mirgorod had taken place.
      The chief of police had given a reception. Whence shall I obtain the brush
      and colours to depict this varied gathering and magnificent feast? Take
      your watch, open it, and look what is going on inside. A fearful
      confusion, is it not? Now, imagine almost the same, if not a greater,
      number of wheels standing in the chief of police's courtyard. How many
      carriages and waggons were there! One was wide behind and narrow in front;
      another narrow behind and wide in front. One was a carriage and a waggon
      combined; another neither a carriage nor a waggon. One resembled a huge
      hayrick or a fat merchant's wife; another a dilapidated Jew or a skeleton
      not quite freed from the skin. One was a perfect pipe with long stem in
      profile; another, resembling nothing whatever, suggested some strange,
      shapeless, fantastic object. In the midst of this chaos of wheels rose
      coaches with windows like those of a room. The drivers, in grey Cossack
      coats, gaberdines, and white hare-skin coats, sheepskin hats and caps of
      various patterns, and with pipes in their hands, drove the unharnessed
      horses through the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a reception the chief of police gave! Permit me to run through the
      list of those who were there: Taras Tarasovitch, Evpl Akinfovitch,
      Evtikhiy Evtikhievitch, Ivan Ivanovitch&mdash;not that Ivan Ivanovitch but
      another&mdash;Gabba Bavrilonovitch, our Ivan Ivanovitch, Elevferiy
      Elevferievitch, Makar Nazarevitch, Thoma Grigorovitch&mdash;I can say no
      more: my powers fail me, my hand stops writing. And how many ladies were
      there! dark and fair, tall and short, some fat like Ivan Nikiforovitch,
      and some so thin that it seemed as though each one might hide herself in
      the scabbard of the chief's sword. What head-dresses! what costumes! red,
      yellow, coffee-colour, green, blue, new, turned, re-made dresses, ribbons,
      reticules. Farewell, poor eyes! you will never be good for anything any
      more after such a spectacle. And how long the table was drawn out! and how
      all talked! and what a noise they made! What is a mill with its
      driving-wheel, stones, beams, hammers, wheels, in comparison with this? I
      cannot tell you exactly what they talked about, but presumably of many
      agreeable and useful things, such as the weather, dogs, wheat, caps, and
      dice. At length Ivan Ivanovitch&mdash;not our Ivan Ivanovitch, but the
      other, who had but one eye&mdash;said, "It strikes me as strange that my
      right eye," this one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch always spoke sarcastically about
      himself, "does not see Ivan Nikiforovitch, Gospodin Dovgotchkun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would not come," said the chief of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's two years now, glory to God! since they quarrelled; that is, Ivan
      Ivanovitch and Ivan Nikiforovitch; and where one goes, the other will not
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so!" Thereupon one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch raised his eye and
      clasped his hands. "Well, if people with good eyes cannot live in peace,
      how am I to live amicably, with my bad one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words they all laughed at the tops of their voices. Every one
      liked one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch, because he cracked jokes in that style. A
      tall, thin man in a frieze coat, with a plaster on his nose, who up to
      this time had sat in the corner, and never once altered the expression of
      his face, even when a fly lighted on his nose, rose from his seat, and
      approached nearer to the crowd which surrounded one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch.
      "Listen," said Ivan Ivanovitch, when he perceived that quite a throng had
      collected about him; "suppose we make peace between our friends. Ivan
      Ivanovitch is talking with the women and girls; let us send quietly for
      Ivan Nikiforovitch and bring them together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch's proposal was unanimously agreed to; and it was decided
      to send at once to Ivan Nikiforovitch's house, and beg him, at any rate,
      to come to the chief of police's for dinner. But the difficult question as
      to who was to be intrusted with this weighty commission rendered all
      thoughtful. They debated long as to who was the most expert in diplomatic
      matters. At length it was unanimously agreed to depute Anton Prokofievitch
      to do this business.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is necessary, first of all, to make the reader somewhat acquainted
      with this noteworthy person. Anton Prokofievitch was a truly good man, in
      the fullest meaning of the term. If any one in Mirgorod gave him a
      neckerchief or underclothes, he returned thanks; if any one gave him a
      fillip on the nose, he returned thanks too. If he was asked, "Why, Anton
      Prokofievitch, do you wear a light brown coat with blue sleeves?" he
      generally replied, "Ah, you haven't one like it! Wait a bit, it will soon
      fade and will be alike all over." And, in point of fact, the blue cloth,
      from the effects of the sun, began to turn cinnamon colour, and became of
      the same tint as the rest of the coat. But the strange part of it was that
      Anton Prokofievitch had a habit of wearing woollen clothing in summer and
      nankeen in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anton Prokofievitch had no house of his own. He used to have one on the
      outskirts of the town; but he sold it, and with the purchase-money bought
      a team of brown horses and a little carriage in which he drove about to
      stay with the squires. But as the horses were a deal of trouble and money
      was required for oats, Anton Prokofievitch bartered them for a violin and
      a housemaid, with twenty-five paper rubles to boot. Afterwards Anton
      Prokofievitch sold the violin, and exchanged the girl for a morocco and
      gold tobacco-pouch; now he has such a tobacco-pouch as no one else has. As
      a result of this luxury, he can no longer go about among the country
      houses, but has to remain in the town and pass the night at different
      houses, especially of those gentlemen who take pleasure in tapping him on
      the nose. Anton Prokofievitch is very fond of good eating, and plays a
      good game at cards. Obeying orders always was his forte; so, taking his
      hat and cane, he set out at once on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he walked along, he began to ponder in what manner he should
      contrive to induce Ivan Nikiforovitch to come to the assembly. The
      unbending character of the latter, who was otherwise a worthy man,
      rendered the undertaking almost hopeless. How, indeed, was he to persuade
      him to come, when even rising from his bed cost him so great an effort?
      But supposing that he did rise, how could he get him to come, where, as he
      doubtless knew, his irreconcilable enemy already was? The more Anton
      Prokofievitch reflected, the more difficulties he perceived. The day was
      sultry, the sun beat down, the perspiration poured from him in streams.
      Anton Prokofievitch was a tolerably sharp man in many respects though they
      did tap him on the nose. In bartering, however, he was not fortunate. He
      knew very well when to play the fool, and sometimes contrived to turn
      things to his own profit amid circumstances and surroundings from which a
      wise man could rarely escape without loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ingenious mind had contrived a means of persuading Ivan Nikiforovitch;
      and he was proceeding bravely to face everything when an unexpected
      occurrence somewhat disturbed his equanimity. There is no harm, at this
      point, in admitting to the reader that, among other things, Anton
      Prokofievitch was the owner of a pair of trousers of such singular
      properties that whenever he put them on the dogs always bit his calves.
      Unfortunately, he had donned this particular pair of trousers; and he had
      hardly given himself up to meditation before a fearful barking on all
      sides saluted his ears. Anton Prokofievitch raised such a yell, no one
      could scream louder than he, that not only did the well-known woman and
      the occupant of the endless coat rush out to meet him, but even the small
      boys from Ivan Ivanovitch's yard. But although the dogs succeeded in
      tasting only one of his calves, this sensibility diminished his courage,
      and he entered the porch with a certain amount of timidity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW A RECONCILIATION WAS SOUGHT TO BE EFFECTED AND A LAW SUIT ENSUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Ah! how do you do? Why do you irritate the dogs?" said Ivan
      Nikiforovitch, on perceiving Anton Prokofievitch; for no one spoke
      otherwise than jestingly with Anton Prokofievitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang them! who's been irritating them?" retorted Anton Prokofievitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heavens, no! You are invited to dinner by Peter Feodorovitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He invited you in a more pressing manner than I can tell you. 'Why,' says
      he, 'does Ivan Nikiforovitch shun me like an enemy? He never comes round
      to have a chat, or make a call.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch stroked his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If,' says he, 'Ivan Nikiforovitch does not come now, I shall not know
      what to think: surely, he must have some design against me. Pray, Anton
      Prokofievitch, persuade Ivan Nikiforovitch!' Come, Ivan Nikiforovitch, let
      us go! a very choice company is already met there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch began to look at a cock, which was perched on the roof,
      crowing with all its might.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you only knew, Ivan Nikiforovitch," pursued the zealous ambassador,
      "what fresh sturgeon and caviare Peter Feodorovitch has had sent to him!"
      Whereupon Ivan Nikiforovitch turned his head and began to listen
      attentively. This encouraged the messenger. "Come quickly: Thoma
      Grigorovitch is there too. Why don't you come?" he added, seeing that Ivan
      Nikiforovitch still lay in the same position. "Shall we go, or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This "I won't" startled Anton Prokofievitch. He had fancied that his
      alluring representations had quite moved this very worthy man; but
      instead, he heard that decisive "I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why won't you?" he asked, with a vexation which he very rarely exhibited,
      even when they put burning paper on his head, a trick which the judge and
      the chief of police were particularly fond of indulging in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch took a pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you like, Ivan Nikiforovitch. I do not know what detains you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't I go?" said Ivan Nikiforovitch at length: "because that brigand
      will be there!" This was his ordinary way of alluding to Ivan Ivanovitch.
      "Just God! and is it long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not be there, he will not be there! May the lightning kill me on
      the spot!" returned Anton Prokofievitch, who was ready to perjure himself
      ten times in an hour. "Come along, Ivan Nikiforovitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, Anton Prokofievitch! he is there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, by Heaven, he's not! May I never stir from this place if he's
      there! Now, just think for yourself, what object have I in lying? May my
      hands and feet wither!&mdash;What, don't you believe me now? May I perish
      right here in your presence! Don't you believe me yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch was entirely reassured by these asseverations, and
      ordered his valet, in the boundless coat, to fetch his trousers and
      nankeen spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe how Ivan Nikiforovitch put on his trousers, how they wound his
      neckerchief about his neck, and finally dragged on his spencer, which
      burst under the left sleeve, would be quite superfluous. Suffice it to
      say, that during the whole of the time he preserved a becoming calmness of
      demeanour, and answered not a word to Anton Prokofievitch's proposition to
      exchange something for his Turkish tobacco-pouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the assembly awaited with impatience the decisive moment when
      Ivan Nikiforovitch should make his appearance and at length comply with
      the general desire that these worthy people should be reconciled to each
      other. Many were almost convinced that Ivan Nikiforovitch would not come.
      Even the chief of police offered to bet with one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch that
      he would not come; and only desisted when one-eyed Ivan Ivanovitch
      demanded that he should wager his lame foot against his own bad eye, at
      which the chief of police was greatly offended, and the company enjoyed a
      quiet laugh. No one had yet sat down to the table, although it was long
      past two o'clock, an hour before which in Mirgorod, even on ceremonial
      occasions, every one had already dined.
    </p>

      No sooner did Anton Prokofievitch show himself in the doorway, then he was
      instantly surrounded. Anton Prokofievitch, in answer to all inquiries,
      shouted the all-decisive words, "He will not come!" No sooner had he
      uttered them than a hailstorm of reproaches, scoldings, and, possibly,
      even fillips were about to descend upon his head for the ill success of
      his mission, when all at once the door opened, and&mdash;Ivan
      Nikiforovitch entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Satan himself or a corpse had appeared, it would not have caused such
      consternation amongst the company as Ivan Nikiforovitch's unexpected
      arrival created. But Anton Prokofievitch only went off into a fit of
      laughter, and held his sides with delight at having played such a joke
      upon the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, it was almost past the belief of all that Ivan
      Nikiforovitch could, in so brief a space of time, have attired himself
      like a respectable gentleman. Ivan Ivanovitch was not there at the moment:
      he had stepped out somewhere. Recovering from their amazement, the guests
      expressed an interest in Ivan Nikiforovitch's health, and their pleasure
      at his increase in breadth. Ivan Nikiforovitch kissed every one, and said,
      "Very much obliged!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the fragrance of the beet-soup was wafted through the apartment,
      and tickled the nostrils of the hungry guests very agreeably. All rushed
      headlong to table. The line of ladies, loquacious and silent, thin and
      stout, swept on, and the long table soon glittered with all the hues of
      the rainbow. I will not describe the courses: I will make no mention of
      the curd dumplings with sour cream, nor of the dish of pig's fry that was
      served with the soup, nor of the turkey with plums and raisins, nor of the
      dish which greatly resembled in appearance a boot soaked in kvas, nor of
      the sauce, which is the swan's song of the old-fashioned cook, nor of that
      other dish which was brought in all enveloped in the flames of spirit, and
      amused as well as frightened the ladies extremely. I will say nothing of
      these dishes, because I like to eat them better than to spend many words
      in discussing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Ivanovitch was exceedingly pleased with the fish dressed with
      horse-radish. He devoted himself especially to this useful and nourishing
      preparation. Picking out all the fine bones from the fish, he laid them on
      his plate; and happening to glance across the table&mdash;Heavenly
      Creator; but this was strange! Opposite him sat Ivan Nikiforovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very same instant Ivan Nikiforovitch glanced up also&mdash;No, I
      can do no more&mdash;Give me a fresh pen with a fine point for this
      picture! mine is flabby. Their faces seemed to turn to stone whilst still
      retaining their defiant expression. Each beheld a long familiar face, to
      which it should have seemed the most natural of things to step up,
      involuntarily, as to an unexpected friend, and offer a snuff-box, with the
      words, "Do me the favour," or "Dare I beg you to do me the favour?"
      Instead of this, that face was terrible as a forerunner of evil. The
      perspiration poured in streams from Ivan Ivanovitch and Ivan
      Nikiforovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the guests at the table grew dumb with attention, and never once took
      their eyes off the former friends. The ladies, who had been busy up to
      that time on a sufficiently interesting discussion as to the preparation
      of capons, suddenly cut their conversation short. All was silence. It was
      a picture worthy of the brush of a great artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Ivan Ivanovitch pulled out his handkerchief and began to blow
      his nose; whilst Ivan Nikiforovitch glanced about and his eye rested on
      the open door. The chief of police at once perceived this movement, and
      ordered the door to be fastened. Then both of the friends began to eat,
      and never once glanced at each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dinner was over, the two former friends both rose from their
      seats, and began to look for their hats, with a view to departure. Then
      the chief beckoned; and Ivan Ivanovitch&mdash;not our Ivan Ivanovitch, but
      the other with the one eye&mdash;got behind Ivan Nikiforovitch, and the
      chief stepped behind Ivan Ivanovitch, and the two began to drag them
      backwards, in order to bring them together, and not release them till they
      had shaken hands with each other. Ivan Ivanovitch, the one-eyed, pushed
      Ivan Nikiforovitch, with tolerable success, towards the spot where stood
      Ivan Ivanovitch. But the chief of police directed his course too much to
      one side, because he could not steer himself with his refractory leg,
      which obeyed no orders whatever on this occasion, and, as if with malice
      and aforethought, swung itself uncommonly far, and in quite the contrary
      direction, possibly from the fact that there had been an unusual amount of
      fruit wine after dinner, so that Ivan Ivanovitch fell over a lady in a red
      gown, who had thrust herself into the very midst, out of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an omen forboded no good. Nevertheless, the judge, in order to set
      things to rights, took the chief of police's place, and, sweeping all the
      snuff from his upper lip with his nose, pushed Ivan Ivanovitch in the
      opposite direction. In Mirgorod this is the usual manner of effecting a
      reconciliation: it somewhat resembles a game of ball. As soon as the judge
      pushed Ivan Ivanovitch, Ivan Ivanovitch with the one eye exerted all his
      strength, and pushed Ivan Nikiforovitch, from whom the perspiration
      streamed like rain-water from a roof. In spite of the fact that the
      friends resisted to the best of their ability, they were nevertheless
      brought together, for the two chief movers received reinforcements from
      the ranks of their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were closely surrounded on all sides, not to be released until
      they had decided to give one another their hands. "God be with you, Ivan
      Nikiforovitch and Ivan Ivanovitch! declare upon your honour now, that what
      you quarrelled about were mere trifles, were they not? Are you not ashamed
      of yourselves before people and before God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," said Ivan Nikiforovitch, panting with fatigue, though it
      is to be observed that he was not at all disinclined to a reconciliation,
      "I do not know what I did to Ivan Ivanovitch; but why did he destroy my
      coop and plot against my life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am innocent of any evil designs!" said Ivan Ivanovitch, never looking
      at Ivan Nikiforovitch. "I swear before God and before you, honourable
      noblemen, I did nothing to my enemy! Why does he calumniate me and insult
      my rank and family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have I insulted you, Ivan Ivanovitch?" said Ivan Nikiforovitch. One
      moment more of explanation, and the long enmity would have been
      extinguished. Ivan Nikiforovitch was already feeling in his pocket for his
      snuff-box, and was about to say, "Do me the favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not an insult," answered Ivan Ivanovitch, without raising his eyes,
      "when you, my dear sir, insulted my honour and my family with a word which
      it is improper to repeat here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to observe, in a friendly manner, Ivan Ivanovitch," here Ivan
      Nikiforovitch touched Ivan Ivanovitch's button with his finger, which
      clearly indicated the disposition of his mind, "that you took offence, the
      deuce only knows at what, because I called you a 'goose'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Ivan Nikiforovitch that he had made a mistake in uttering
      that word; but it was too late: the word was said. Everything went to the
      winds. It, on the utterance of this word without witnesses, Ivan
      Ivanovitch lost control of himself and flew into such a passion as God
      preserve us from beholding any man in, what was to be expected now? I put
      it to you, dear readers, what was to be expected now, when the fatal word
      was uttered in an assemblage of persons among whom were ladies, in whose
      presence Ivan Ivanovitch liked to be particularly polite? If Ivan
      Nikiforovitch had set to work in any other manner, if he had only said
      bird and not goose, it might still have been arranged, but all was at an
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave one look at Ivan Nikiforovitch, but such a look! If that look had
      possessed active power, then it would have turned Ivan Nikiforovitch into
      dust. The guests understood the look and hastened to separate them. And
      this man, the very model of gentleness, who never let a single poor woman
      go by without interrogating her, rushed out in a fearful rage. Such
      violent storms do passions produce!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a whole month nothing was heard of Ivan Ivanovitch. He shut himself up
      at home. His ancestral chest was opened, and from it were taken silver
      rubles, his grandfather's old silver rubles! And these rubles passed into
      the ink-stained hands of legal advisers. The case was sent up to the
      higher court; and when Ivan Ivanovitch received the joyful news that it
      would be decided on the morrow, then only did he look out upon the world
      and resolve to emerge from his house. Alas! from that time forth the
      council gave notice day by day that the case would be finished on the
      morrow, for the space of ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years ago, I passed through the town of Mirgorod. I came at a bad
      time. It was autumn, with its damp, melancholy weather, mud and mists. An
      unnatural verdure, the result of incessant rains, covered with a watery
      network the fields and meadows, to which it is as well suited as youthful
      pranks to an old man, or roses to an old woman. The weather made a deep
      impression on me at the time: when it was dull, I was dull; but in spite
      of this, when I came to pass through Mirgorod, my heart beat violently.
      God, what reminiscences! I had not seen Mirgorod for twenty years. Here
      had lived, in touching friendship, two inseparable friends. And how many
      prominent people had died! Judge Demyan Demyanovitch was already gone:
      Ivan Ivanovitch, with the one eye, had long ceased to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered the main street. All about stood poles with bundles of straw on
      top: some alterations were in progress. Several dwellings had been
      removed. The remnants of board and wattled fences projected sadly here and
      there. It was a festival day. I ordered my basket chaise to stop in front
      of the church, and entered softly that no one might turn round. To tell
      the truth, there was no need of this: the church was almost empty; there
      were very few people; it was evident that even the most pious feared the
      mud. The candles seemed strangely unpleasant in that gloomy, or rather
      sickly, light. The dim vestibule was melancholy; the long windows, with
      their circular panes, were bedewed with tears of rain. I retired into the
      vestibule, and addressing a respectable old man, with greyish hair, said,
      "May I inquire if Ivan Nikiforovitch is still living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the lamp before the holy picture burned up more brightly
      and the light fell directly upon the face of my companion. What was my
      surprise, on looking more closely, to behold features with which I was
      acquainted! It was Ivan Nikiforovitch himself! But how he had changed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you well, Ivan Nikiforovitch? How old you have grown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have grown old. I have just come from Poltava to-day," answered
      Ivan Nikiforovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so! you have been to Poltava in such bad weather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was to be done? that lawsuit&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this I sighed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Nikiforovitch observed my sigh, and said, "Do not be troubled: I have
      reliable information that the case will be decided next week, and in my
      favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders, and went to seek news of Ivan Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ivan Ivanovitch is here," some one said to me, "in the choir."
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a gaunt form. Was that Ivan Ivanovitch? His face was covered with
      wrinkles, his hair was perfectly white; but the pelisse was the same as
      ever. After the first greetings were over, Ivan Ivanovitch, turning to me
      with a joyful smile which always became his funnel-shaped face, said,
      "Have you been told the good news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news?" I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My case is to be decided to-morrow without fail: the court has announced
      it decisively."
    </p>
    <p>
      I sighed more deeply than before, made haste to take my leave, for I was
      bound on very important business, and seated myself in my kibitka.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lean nags known in Mirgorod as post-horses started, producing with
      their hoofs, which were buried in a grey mass of mud, a sound very
      displeasing to the ear. The rain poured in torrents upon the Jew seated on
      the box, covered with a rug. The dampness penetrated through and through
      me. The gloomy barrier with a sentry-box, in which an old soldier was
      repairing his weapons, was passed slowly. Again the same fields, in some
      places black where they had been dug up, in others of a greenish hue; wet
      daws and crows; monotonous rain; a tearful sky, without one gleam of
      light!... It is gloomy in this world, gentlemen!

      PART I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nowhere did so many people pause as before the little picture-shop in the
      Shtchukinui Dvor. This little shop contained, indeed, the most varied
      collection of curiosities. The pictures were chiefly oil-paintings covered
      with dark varnish, in frames of dingy yellow. Winter scenes with white
      trees; very red sunsets, like raging conflagrations, a Flemish boor, more
      like a turkey-cock in cuffs than a human being, were the prevailing
      subjects. To these must be added a few engravings, such as a portrait of
      Khozreff-Mirza in a sheepskin cap, and some generals with three-cornered
      hats and hooked noses. Moreover, the doors of such shops are usually
      festooned with bundles of those publications, printed on large sheets of
      bark, and then coloured by hand, which bear witness to the native talent
      of the Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one was the Tzarevna Miliktrisa Kirbitievna; on another the city of
      Jerusalem. There are usually but few purchasers of these productions, but
      gazers are many. Some truant lackey probably yawns in front of them,
      holding in his hand the dishes containing dinner from the cook-shop for
      his master, who will not get his soup very hot. Before them, too, will
      most likely be standing a soldier wrapped in his cloak, a dealer from the
      old-clothes mart, with a couple of penknives for sale, and a huckstress,
      with a basketful of shoes. Each expresses admiration in his own way. The
      muzhiks generally touch them with their fingers; the dealers gaze
      seriously at them; serving boys and apprentices laugh, and tease each
      other with the coloured caricatures; old lackeys in frieze cloaks look at
      them merely for the sake of yawning away their time somewhere; and the
      hucksters, young Russian women, halt by instinct to hear what people are
      gossiping about, and to see what they are looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time our story opens, the young painter, Tchartkoff, paused
      involuntarily as he passed the shop. His old cloak and plain attire showed
      him to be a man who was devoted to his art with self-denying zeal, and who
      had no time to trouble himself about his clothes. He halted in front of
      the little shop, and at first enjoyed an inward laugh over the
      monstrosities in the shape of pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he sank unconsciously into a reverie, and began to ponder as to
      what sort of people wanted these productions? It did not seem remarkable
      to him that the Russian populace should gaze with rapture upon "Eruslanoff
      Lazarevitch," on "The Glutton" and "The Carouser," on "Thoma and Erema."
      The delineations of these subjects were easily intelligible to the masses.
      But where were there purchases for those streaky, dirty oil-paintings? Who
      needed those Flemish boors, those red and blue landscapes, which put forth
      some claims to a higher stage of art, but which really expressed the
      depths of its degradation? They did not appear the works of a self-taught
      child. In that case, in spite of the caricature of drawing, a sharp
      distinction would have manifested itself. But here were visible only
      simple dullness, steady-going incapacity, which stood, through self-will,
      in the ranks of art, while its true place was among the lowest trades. The
      same colours, the same manner, the same practised hand, belonging rather
      to a manufacturing automaton than to a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before the dirty pictures for some time, his thoughts at length
      wandering to other matters. Meanwhile the proprietor of the shop, a little
      grey man, in a frieze cloak, with a beard which had not been shaved since
      Sunday, had been urging him to buy for some time, naming prices, without
      even knowing what pleased him or what he wanted. "Here, I'll take a silver
      piece for these peasants and this little landscape. What painting! it
      fairly dazzles one; only just received from the factory; the varnish isn't
      dry yet. Or here is a winter scene&mdash;take the winter scene; fifteen
      rubles; the frame alone is worth it. What a winter scene!" Here the
      merchant gave a slight fillip to the canvas, as if to demonstrate all the
      merits of the winter scene. "Pray have them put up and sent to your house.
      Where do you live? Here, boy, give me some string!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold, not so fast!" said the painter, coming to himself, and perceiving
      that the brisk dealer was beginning in earnest to pack some pictures up.
      He was rather ashamed not to take anything after standing so long in front
      of the shop; so saying, "Here, stop! I will see if there is anything I
      want here!" he stooped and began to pick up from the floor, where they
      were thrown in a heap, some worn, dusty old paintings. There were old
      family portraits, whose descendants, probably could not be found on earth;
      with torn canvas and frames minus their gilding; in short, trash. But the
      painter began his search, thinking to himself, "Perhaps I may come across
      something." He had heard stories about pictures of the great masters
      having been found among the rubbish in cheap print-sellers' shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer, perceiving what he was about, ceased his importunities, and
      took up his post again at the door, hailing the passers-by with, "Hither,
      friends, here are pictures; step in, step in; just received from the
      makers!" He shouted his fill, and generally in vain, had a long talk with
      a rag-merchant, standing opposite, at the door of his shop; and finally,
      recollecting that he had a customer in his shop, turned his back on the
      public and went inside. "Well, friend, have you chosen anything?" said he.
      But the painter had already been standing motionless for some time before
      a portrait in a large and originally magnificent frame, upon which,
      however, hardly a trace of gilding now remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It represented an old man, with a thin, bronzed face and high cheek-bones;
      the features seemingly depicted in a moment of convulsive agitation. He
      wore a flowing Asiatic costume. Dusty and defaced as the portrait was,
      Tchartkoff saw, when he had succeeded in removing the dirt from the face,
      traces of the work of a great artist. The portrait appeared to be
      unfinished, but the power of the handling was striking. The eyes were the
      most remarkable picture of all: it seemed as though the full power of the
      artist's brush had been lavished upon them. They fairly gazed out of the
      portrait, destroying its harmony with their strange liveliness. When he
      carried the portrait to the door, the eyes gleamed even more
      penetratingly. They produced nearly the same impression on the public. A
      woman standing behind him exclaimed, "He is looking, he is looking!" and
      jumped back. Tchartkoff experienced an unpleasant feeling, inexplicable
      even to himself, and placed the portrait on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, will you take the portrait?" said the dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much is it?" said the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why chaffer over it? give me seventy-five kopeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how much will you give?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty kopeks," said the painter, preparing to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a price! Why, you couldn't buy the frame for that! Perhaps you will
      decide to purchase to-morrow. Sir, sir, turn back! Add ten kopeks. Take
      it, take it! give me twenty kopeks. To tell the truth, you are my only
      customer to-day, and that's the only reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Tchartkoff quite unexpectedly became the purchaser of the old
      portrait, and at the same time reflected, "Why have I bought it? What is
      it to me?" But there was nothing to be done. He pulled a twenty-kopek
      piece from his pocket, gave it to the merchant, took the portrait under
      his arm, and carried it home. On the way thither, he remembered that the
      twenty-kopek piece he had given for it was his last. His thoughts at once
      became gloomy. Vexation and careless indifference took possession of him
      at one and the same moment. The red light of sunset still lingered in one
      half the sky; the houses facing that way still gleamed with its warm
      light; and meanwhile the cold blue light of the moon grew brighter. Light,
      half-transparent shadows fell in bands upon the ground. The painter began
      by degrees to glance up at the sky, flushed with a transparent light; and
      at the same moment from his mouth fell the words, "What a delicate tone!
      What a nuisance! Deuce take it!" Re-adjusting the portrait, which kept
      slipping from under his arm, he quickened his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary and bathed in perspiration, he dragged himself to Vasilievsky
      Ostroff. With difficulty and much panting he made his way up the stairs
      flooded with soap-suds, and adorned with the tracks of dogs and cats. To
      his knock there was no answer: there was no one at home. He leaned against
      the window, and disposed himself to wait patiently, until at last there
      resounded behind him the footsteps of a boy in a blue blouse, his servant,
      model, and colour-grinder. This boy was called Nikita, and spent all his
      time in the streets when his master was not at home. Nikita tried for a
      long time to get the key into the lock, which was quite invisible, by
      reason of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the door was opened. Tchartkoff entered his ante-room, which was
      intolerably cold, as painters' rooms always are, which fact, however, they
      do not notice. Without giving Nikita his coat, he went on into his studio,
      a large room, but low, fitted up with all sorts of artistic rubbish&mdash;plaster
      hands, canvases, sketches begun and discarded, and draperies thrown over
      chairs. Feeling very tired, he took off his cloak, placed the portrait
      abstractedly between two small canvasses, and threw himself on the narrow
      divan. Having stretched himself out, he finally called for a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no candles," said Nikita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, none?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there were none last night," said Nikita. The artist recollected
      that, in fact, there had been no candles the previous evening, and became
      silent. He let Nikita take his coat off, and put on his old worn
      dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There has been a gentleman here," said Nikita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he came for money, I know," said the painter, waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was not alone," said Nikita.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who else was with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, some police officer or other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why a police officer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why, but he says because your rent is not paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what will come of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what will come of it: he said, 'If he won't pay, why, let
      him leave the rooms.' They are both coming again to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them come," said Tchartkoff, with indifference; and a gloomy mood
      took full possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Tchartkoff was an artist of talent, which promised great things: his
      work gave evidence of observation, thought, and a strong inclination to
      approach nearer to nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, my friend," his professor said to him more than once, "you
      have talent; it will be a shame if you waste it: but you are impatient;
      you have but to be attracted by anything, to fall in love with it, you
      become engrossed with it, and all else goes for nothing, and you won't
      even look at it. See to it that you do not become a fashionable artist. At
      present your colouring begins to assert itself too loudly; and your
      drawing is at times quite weak; you are already striving after the
      fashionable style, because it strikes the eye at once. Have a care!
      society already begins to have its attraction for you: I have seen you
      with a shiny hat, a foppish neckerchief.... It is seductive to paint
      fashionable little pictures and portraits for money; but talent is ruined,
      not developed, by that means. Be patient; think out every piece of work,
      discard your foppishness; let others amass money, your own will not fail
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor was partly right. Our artist sometimes wanted to enjoy
      himself, to play the fop, in short, to give vent to his youthful impulses
      in some way or other; but he could control himself withal. At times he
      would forget everything, when he had once taken his brush in his hand, and
      could not tear himself from it except as from a delightful dream. His
      taste perceptibly developed. He did not as yet understand all the depths
      of Raphael, but he was attracted by Guido's broad and rapid handling, he
      paused before Titian's portraits, he delighted in the Flemish masters. The
      dark veil enshrouding the ancient pictures had not yet wholly passed away
      from before them; but he already saw something in them, though in private
      he did not agree with the professor that the secrets of the old masters
      are irremediably lost to us. It seemed to him that the nineteenth century
      had improved upon them considerably, that the delineation of nature was
      more clear, more vivid, more close. It sometimes vexed him when he saw how
      a strange artist, French or German, sometimes not even a painter by
      profession, but only a skilful dauber, produced, by the celerity of his
      brush and the vividness of his colouring, a universal commotion, and
      amassed in a twinkling a funded capital. This did not occur to him when
      fully occupied with his own work, for then he forgot food and drink and
      all the world. But when dire want arrived, when he had no money wherewith
      to buy brushes and colours, when his implacable landlord came ten times a
      day to demand the rent for his rooms, then did the luck of the wealthy
      artists recur to his hungry imagination; then did the thought which so
      often traverses Russian minds, to give up altogether, and go down hill,
      utterly to the bad, traverse his. And now he was almost in this frame of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is all very well, to be patient, be patient!" he exclaimed, with
      vexation; "but there is an end to patience at last. Be patient! but what
      money have I to buy a dinner with to-morrow? No one will lend me any. If I
      did bring myself to sell all my pictures and sketches, they would not give
      me twenty kopeks for the whole of them. They are useful; I feel that not
      one of them has been undertaken in vain; I have learned something from
      each one. Yes, but of what use is it? Studies, sketches, all will be
      studies, trial-sketches to the end. And who will buy, not even knowing me
      by name? Who wants drawings from the antique, or the life class, or my
      unfinished love of a Psyche, or the interior of my room, or the portrait
      of Nikita, though it is better, to tell the truth, than the portraits by
      any of the fashionable artists? Why do I worry, and toil like a learner
      over the alphabet, when I might shine as brightly as the rest, and have
      money, too, like them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, the artist suddenly shuddered, and turned pale. A
      convulsively distorted face gazed at him, peeping forth from the
      surrounding canvas; two terrible eyes were fixed straight upon him; on the
      mouth was written a menacing command of silence. Alarmed, he tried to
      scream and summon Nikita, who already was snoring in the ante-room; but he
      suddenly paused and laughed. The sensation of fear died away in a moment;
      it was the portrait he had bought, and which he had quite forgotten. The
      light of the moon illuminating the chamber had fallen upon it, and lent it
      a strange likeness to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to examine it. He moistened a sponge with water, passed it over
      the picture several times, washed off nearly all the accumulated and
      incrusted dust and dirt, hung it on the wall before him, wondering yet
      more at the remarkable workmanship. The whole face had gained new life,
      and the eyes gazed at him so that he shuddered; and, springing back, he
      exclaimed in a voice of surprise: "It looks with human eyes!" Then
      suddenly there occurred to him a story he had heard long before from his
      professor, of a certain portrait by the renowned Leonardo da Vinci, upon
      which the great master laboured several years, and still regarded as
      incomplete, but which, according to Vasari, was nevertheless deemed by all
      the most complete and finished product of his art. The most finished thing
      about it was the eyes, which amazed his contemporaries; the very smallest,
      barely visible veins in them being reproduced on the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the portrait now before him there was something singular. It was no
      longer art; it even destroyed the harmony of the portrait; they were
      living, human eyes! It seemed as though they had been cut from a living
      man and inserted. Here was none of that high enjoyment which takes
      possession of the soul at the sight of an artist's production, no matter
      how terrible the subject he may have chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he approached the portrait, in order to observe those wondrous eyes,
      and perceived, with terror, that they were gazing at him. This was no copy
      from Nature; it was life, the strange life which might have lighted up the
      face of a dead man, risen from the grave. Whether it was the effect of the
      moonlight, which brought with it fantastic thoughts, and transformed
      things into strange likenesses, opposed to those of matter-of-fact day, or
      from some other cause, but it suddenly became terrible to him, he knew not
      why, to sit alone in the room. He draw back from the portrait, turned
      aside, and tried not to look at it; but his eye involuntarily, of its own
      accord, kept glancing sideways towards it. Finally, he became afraid to
      walk about the room. It seemed as though some one were on the point of
      stepping up behind him; and every time he turned, he glanced timidly back.
      He had never been a coward; but his imagination and nerves were sensitive,
      and that evening he could not explain his involuntary fear. He seated
      himself in one corner, but even then it seemed to him that some one was
      peeping over his shoulder into his face. Even Nikita's snores, resounding
      from the ante-room, did not chase away his fear. At length he rose from
      the seat, without raising his eyes, went behind a screen, and lay down on
      his bed. Through the cracks of the screen he saw his room lit up by the
      moon, and the portrait hanging stiffly on the wall. The eyes were fixed
      upon him in a yet more terrible and significant manner, and it seemed as
      if they would not look at anything but himself. Overpowered with a feeling
      of oppression, he decided to rise from his bed, seized a sheet, and,
      approaching the portrait, covered it up completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done this, he lay done more at ease on his bed, and began to
      meditate upon the poverty and pitiful lot of the artist, and the thorny
      path lying before him in the world. But meanwhile his eye glanced
      involuntarily through the joint of the screen at the portrait muffled in
      the sheet. The light of the moon heightened the whiteness of the sheet,
      and it seemed to him as though those terrible eyes shone through the
      cloth. With terror he fixed his eyes more steadfastly on the spot, as if
      wishing to convince himself that it was all nonsense. But at length he saw&mdash;saw
      clearly; there was no longer a sheet&mdash;the portrait was quite
      uncovered, and was gazing beyond everything around it, straight at him;
      gazing as it seemed fairly into his heart. His heart grew cold. He watched
      anxiously; the old man moved, and suddenly, supporting himself on the
      frame with both arms, raised himself by his hands, and, putting forth both
      feet, leapt out of the frame. Through the crack of the screen, the empty
      frame alone was now visible. Footsteps resounded through the room, and
      approached nearer and nearer to the screen. The poor artist's heart began
      beating fast. He expected every moment, his breath failing for fear, that
      the old man would look round the screen at him. And lo! he did look from
      behind the screen, with the very same bronzed face, and with his big eyes
      roving about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchartkoff tried to scream, and felt that his voice was gone; he tried to
      move; his limbs refused their office. With open mouth, and failing breath,
      he gazed at the tall phantom, draped in some kind of a flowing Asiatic
      robe, and waited for what it would do. The old man sat down almost on his
      very feet, and then pulled out something from among the folds of his wide
      garment. It was a purse. The old man untied it, took it by the end, and
      shook it. Heavy rolls of coin fell out with a dull thud upon the floor.
      Each was wrapped in blue paper, and on each was marked, "1000 ducats." The
      old man protruded his long, bony hand from his wide sleeves, and began to
      undo the rolls. The gold glittered. Great as was the artist's unreasoning
      fear, he concentrated all his attention upon the gold, gazing motionless,
      as it made its appearance in the bony hands, gleamed, rang lightly or
      dully, and was wrapped up again. Then he perceived one packet which had
      rolled farther than the rest, to the very leg of his bedstead, near his
      pillow. He grasped it almost convulsively, and glanced in fear at the old
      man to see whether he noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old man appeared very much occupied: he collected all his rolls,
      replaced them in the purse, and went outside the screen without looking at
      him. Tchartkoff's heart beat wildly as he heard the rustle of the
      retreating footsteps sounding through the room. He clasped the roll of
      coin more closely in his hand, quivering in every limb. Suddenly he heard
      the footsteps approaching the screen again. Apparently the old man had
      recollected that one roll was missing. Lo! again he looked round the
      screen at him. The artist in despair grasped the roll with all his
      strength, tried with all his power to make a movement, shrieked&mdash;and
      awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bathed in a cold perspiration; his heart beat as hard as it was
      possible for it to beat; his chest was oppressed, as though his last
      breath was about to issue from it. "Was it a dream?" he said, seizing his
      head with both hands. But the terrible reality of the apparition did not
      resemble a dream. As he woke, he saw the old man step into the frame: the
      skirts of the flowing garment even fluttered, and his hand felt plainly
      that a moment before it had held something heavy. The moonlight lit up the
      room, bringing out from the dark corners here a canvas, there the model of
      a hand: a drapery thrown over a chair; trousers and dirty boots. Then he
      perceived that he was not lying in his bed, but standing upright in front
      of the portrait. How he had come there, he could not in the least
      comprehend. Still more surprised was he to find the portrait uncovered,
      and with actually no sheet over it. Motionless with terror, he gazed at
      it, and perceived that the living, human eyes were fastened upon him. A
      cold perspiration broke out upon his forehead. He wanted to move away, but
      felt that his feet had in some way become rooted to the earth. And he felt
      that this was not a dream. The old man's features moved, and his lips
      began to project towards him, as though he wanted to suck him in. With a
      yell of despair he jumped back&mdash;and awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it a dream?" With his heart throbbing to bursting, he felt about him
      with both hands. Yes, he was lying in bed, and in precisely the position
      in which he had fallen asleep. Before him stood the screen. The moonlight
      flooded the room. Through the crack of the screen, the portrait was
      visible, covered with the sheet, as it should be, just as he had covered
      it. And so that, too, was a dream? But his clenched fist still felt as
      though something had been held in it. The throbbing of his heart was
      violent, almost terrible; the weight upon his breast intolerable. He fixed
      his eyes upon the crack, and stared steadfastly at the sheet. And lo! he
      saw plainly the sheet begin to open, as though hands were pushing from
      underneath, and trying to throw it off. "Lord God, what is it!" he
      shrieked, crossing himself in despair&mdash;and awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      And was this, too, a dream? He sprang from his bed, half-mad, and could
      not comprehend what had happened to him. Was it the oppression of a
      nightmare, the raving of fever, or an actual apparition? Striving to calm,
      as far as possible, his mental tumult, and stay the wildly rushing blood,
      which beat with straining pulses in every vein, he went to the window and
      opened it. The cool breeze revived him. The moonlight lay on the roofs and
      the white walls of the houses, though small clouds passed frequently
      across the sky. All was still: from time to time there struck the ear the
      distant rumble of a carriage. He put his head out of the window, and gazed
      for some time. Already the signs of approaching dawn were spreading over
      the sky. At last he felt drowsy, shut to the window, stepped back, lay
      down in bed, and quickly fell, like one exhausted, into a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke late, and with the disagreeable feeling of a man who has been
      half-suffocated with coal-gas: his head ached painfully. The room was dim:
      an unpleasant moisture pervaded the air, and penetrated the cracks of his
      windows. Dissatisfied and depressed as a wet cock, he seated himself on
      his dilapidated divan, not knowing what to do, what to set about, and at
      length remembered the whole of his dream. As he recalled it, the dream
      presented itself to his mind as so oppressively real that he even began to
      wonder whether it were a dream, whether there were not something more
      here, whether it were not really an apparition. Removing the sheet, he
      looked at the terrible portrait by the light of day. The eyes were really
      striking in their liveliness, but he found nothing particularly terrible
      about them, though an indescribably unpleasant feeling lingered in his
      mind. Nevertheless, he could not quite convince himself that it was a
      dream. It struck him that there must have been some terrible fragment of
      reality in the vision. It seemed as though there were something in the old
      man's very glance and expression which said that he had been with him that
      night: his hand still felt the weight which had so recently lain in it as
      if some one had but just snatched it from him. It seemed to him that, if
      he had only grasped the roll more firmly, it would have remained in his
      hand, even after his awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, if I only had a portion of that money!" he said, breathing
      heavily; and in his fancy, all the rolls of coin, with their fascinating
      inscription, "1000 ducats," began to pour out of the purse. The rolls
      opened, the gold glittered, and was wrapped up again; and he sat
      motionless, with his eyes fixed on the empty air, as if he were incapable
      of tearing himself from such a sight, like a child who sits before a plate
      of sweets, and beholds, with watering mouth, other people devouring them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there came a knock on the door, which recalled him unpleasantly to
      himself. The landlord entered with the constable of the district, whose
      presence is even more disagreeable to poor people than is the presence of
      a beggar to the rich. The landlord of the little house in which Tchartkoff
      lived resembled the other individuals who own houses anywhere in the
      Vasilievsky Ostroff, on the St. Petersburg side, or in the distant regions
      of Kolomna&mdash;individuals whose character is as difficult to define as
      the colour of a threadbare surtout. In his youth he had been a captain and
      a braggart, a master in the art of flogging, skilful, foppish, and stupid;
      but in his old age he combined all these various qualities into a kind of
      dim indefiniteness. He was a widower, already on the retired list, no
      longer boasted, nor was dandified, nor quarrelled, but only cared to drink
      tea and talk all sorts of nonsense over it. He walked about his room, and
      arranged the ends of the tallow candles; called punctually at the end of
      each month upon his lodgers for money; went out into the street, with the
      key in his hand, to look at the roof of his house, and sometimes chased
      the porter out of his den, where he had hidden himself to sleep. In short,
      he was a man on the retired list, who, after the turmoils and wildness of
      his life, had only his old-fashioned habits left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please to see for yourself, Varukh Kusmitch," said the landlord, turning
      to the officer, and throwing out his hands, "this man does not pay his
      rent, he does not pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I when I have no money? Wait, and I will pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't wait, my good fellow," said the landlord angrily, making a
      gesture with the key which he held in his hand. "Lieutenant-Colonel
      Potogonkin has lived with me seven years, seven years already; Anna
      Petrovna Buchmisteroff rents the coach-house and stable, with the
      exception of two stalls, and has three household servants: that is the
      kind of lodgers I have. I say to you frankly, that this is not an
      establishment where people do not pay their rent. Pay your money at once,
      please, or else clear out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you rented the rooms, please to pay," said the constable, with a
      slight shake of the head, as he laid his finger on one of the buttons of
      his uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what am I to pay with? that's the question. I haven't a groschen
      just at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, satisfy the claims of Ivan Ivanovitch with the fruits of
      your profession," said the officer: "perhaps he will consent to take
      pictures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, my good fellow, no pictures. Pictures of holy subjects,
      such as one could hang upon the walls, would be well enough; or some
      general with a star, or Prince Kutusoff's portrait. But this fellow has
      painted that muzhik, that muzhik in his blouse, his servant who grinds his
      colours! The idea of painting his portrait, the hog! I'll thrash him well:
      he took all the nails out of my bolts, the scoundrel! Just see what
      subjects! Here he has drawn his room. It would have been well enough had
      he taken a clean, well-furnished room; but he has gone and drawn this one,
      with all the dirt and rubbish he has collected. Just see how he has
      defaced my room! Look for yourself. Yes, and my lodgers have been with me
      seven years, the lieutenant-colonel, Anna Petrovna Buchmisteroff. No, I
      tell you, there is no worse lodger than a painter: he lives like a pig&mdash;God
      have mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor artist had to listen patiently to all this. Meanwhile the officer
      had occupied himself with examining the pictures and studies, and showed
      that his mind was more advanced than the landlord's, and that he was not
      insensible to artistic impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heh!" said he, tapping one canvas, on which was depicted a naked woman,
      "this subject is&mdash;lively. But why so much black under her nose? did
      she take snuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shadow," answered Tchartkoff gruffly, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it might have been put in some other place: it is too conspicuous
      under the nose," observed the officer. "And whose likeness is this?" he
      continued, approaching the old man's portrait. "It is too terrible. Was he
      really so dreadful? Ah! why, he actually looks at one! What a
      thunder-cloud! From whom did you paint it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! it is from a&mdash;" said Tchartkoff, but did not finish his
      sentence: he heard a crack. It seems that the officer had pressed too hard
      on the frame of the portrait, thanks to the weight of his constable's
      hands. The small boards at the side caved in, one fell on the floor, and
      with it fell, with a heavy crash, a roll of blue paper. The inscription
      caught Tchartkoff's eye&mdash;"1000 ducats." Like a madman, he sprang to
      pick it up, grasped the roll, and gripped it convulsively in his hand,
      which sank with the weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't there a sound of money?" inquired the officer, hearing the noise
      of something falling on the floor, and not catching sight of it, owing to
      the rapidity with which Tchartkoff had hastened to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What business is it of yours what is in my room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my business because you ought to pay your rent to the landlord at
      once; because you have money, and won't pay, that's why it's my business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will pay him to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and why wouldn't you pay before, instead of giving trouble to your
      landlord, and bothering the police to boot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I did not want to touch this money. I will pay him in full this
      evening, and leave the rooms to-morrow. I will not stay with such a
      landlord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Ivan Ivanovitch, he will pay you," said the constable, turning to
      the landlord. "But in case you are not satisfied in every respect this
      evening, then you must excuse me, Mr. Painter." So saying, he put on his
      three-cornered hat, and went into the ante-room, followed by the landlord
      hanging his head, and apparently engaged in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God, Satan has carried them off!" said Tchartkoff, as he heard the
      outer door of the ante-room close. He looked out into the ante-room, sent
      Nikita off on some errand, in order to be quite alone, fastened the door
      behind him, and, returning to his room, began with wildly beating heart to
      undo the roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      In it were ducats, all new, and bright as fire. Almost beside himself, he
      sat down beside the pile of gold, still asking himself, "Is not this all a
      dream?" There were just a thousand in the roll, the exterior of which was
      precisely like what he had seen in his dream. He turned them over, and
      looked at them for some minutes. His imagination recalled up all the tales
      he had heard of hidden hoards, cabinets with secret drawers, left by
      ancestors for their spendthrift descendants, with firm belief in the
      extravagance of their life. He pondered this: "Did not some grandfather,
      in the present instance, leave a gift for his grandchild, shut up in the
      frame of a family portrait?" Filled with romantic fancies, he began to
      think whether this had not some secret connection with his fate? whether
      the existence of the portrait was not bound up with his own, and whether
      his acquisition of it was not due to a kind of predestination?
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to examine the frame with curiosity. On one side a cavity was
      hollowed out, but concealed so skilfully and neatly by a little board,
      that, if the massive hand of the constable had not effected a breach, the
      ducats might have remained hidden to the end of time. On examining the
      portrait, he marvelled again at the exquisite workmanship, the
      extraordinary treatment of the eyes. They no longer appeared terrible to
      him; but, nevertheless, each time he looked at them a disagreeable feeling
      involuntarily lingered in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said to himself, "no matter whose grandfather you were, I'll put
      a glass over you, and get you a gilt frame." Then he laid his hand on the
      golden pile before him, and his heart beat faster at the touch. "What
      shall I do with them?" he said, fixing his eyes on them. "Now I am
      independent for at least three years: I can shut myself up in my room and
      work. I have money for colours now; for food and lodging&mdash;no one will
      annoy and disturb me now. I will buy myself a first-class lay figure, I
      will order a plaster torso, and some model feet, I will have a Venus. I
      will buy engravings of the best pictures. And if I work three years to
      satisfy myself, without haste or with the idea of selling, I shall surpass
      all, and may become a distinguished artist."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he spoke in solitude, with his good judgment prompting him; but
      louder and more distinct sounded another voice within him. As he glanced
      once more at the gold, it was not thus that his twenty-two years and fiery
      youth reasoned. Now everything was within his power on which he had
      hitherto gazed with envious eyes, had viewed from afar with longing. How
      his heart beat when he thought of it! To wear a fashionable coat, to feast
      after long abstinence, to hire handsome apartments, to go at once to the
      theatre, to the confectioner's, to... other places; and seizing his money,
      he was in the street in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all he went to the tailor, was clothed anew from head to foot,
      and began to look at himself like a child. He purchased perfumes and
      pomades; hired the first elegant suite of apartments with mirrors and
      plateglass windows which he came across in the Nevsky Prospect, without
      haggling about the price; bought, on the impulse of the moment, a costly
      eye-glass; bought, also on the impulse, a number of neckties of every
      description, many more than he needed; had his hair curled at the
      hairdresser's; rode through the city twice without any object whatever;
      ate an immense quantity of sweetmeats at the confectioner's; and went to
      the French Restaurant, of which he had heard rumours as indistinct as
      though they had concerned the Empire of China. There he dined, casting
      proud glances at the other visitors, and continually arranging his curls
      in the glass. There he drank a bottle of champagne, which had been known
      to him hitherto only by hearsay. The wine rather affected his head; and he
      emerged into the street, lively, pugnacious, and ready to raise the Devil,
      according to the Russian expression. He strutted along the pavement,
      levelling his eye-glass at everybody. On the bridge he caught sight of his
      former professor, and slipped past him neatly, as if he did not see him,
      so that the astounded professor stood stock-still on the bridge for a long
      time, with a face suggestive of a note of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his goods and chattels, everything he owned, easels, canvas, pictures,
      were transported that same evening to his elegant quarters. He arranged
      the best of them in conspicuous places, threw the worst into a corner, and
      promenaded up and down the handsome rooms, glancing constantly in the
      mirrors. An unconquerable desire to take the bull by the horns, and show
      himself to the world at once, had arisen in his mind. He already heard the
      shouts, "Tchartkoff! Tchartkoff! Tchartkoff paints! What talent Tchartkoff
      has!" He paced the room in a state of rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he took ten ducats, and went to the editor of a popular
      journal asking his charitable assistance. He was joyfully received by the
      journalist, who called him on the spot, "Most respected sir," squeezed
      both his hands, and made minute inquiries as to his name, birthplace,
      residence. The next day there appeared in the journal, below a notice of
      some newly invented tallow candles, an article with the following heading:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "TCHARTKOFF'S IMMENSE TALENT
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hasten to delight the cultivated inhabitants of the capital with a
      discovery which we may call splendid in every respect. All are agreed that
      there are among us many very handsome faces, but hitherto there has been
      no means of committing them to canvas for transmission to posterity. This
      want has now been supplied: an artist has been found who unites in himself
      all desirable qualities. The beauty can now feel assured that she will be
      depicted with all the grace of her charms, airy, fascinating,
      butterfly-like, flitting among the flowers of spring. The stately father
      of a family can see himself surrounded by his family. Merchant, warrior,
      citizen, statesman&mdash;hasten one and all, wherever you may be. The
      artist's magnificent establishment (Nevsky Prospect, such and such a
      number) is hung with portraits from his brush, worthy of Van Dyck or
      Titian. We do not know which to admire most, their truth and likeness to
      the originals, or the wonderful brilliancy and freshness of the colouring.
      Hail to you, artist! you have drawn a lucky number in the lottery. Long
      live Andrei Petrovitch!" (The journalist evidently liked familiarity.)
      "Glorify yourself and us. We know how to prize you. Universal popularity,
      and with it wealth, will be your meed, though some of our brother
      journalists may rise against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist read this article with secret satisfaction; his face beamed. He
      was mentioned in print; it was a novelty to him: he read the lines over
      several times. The comparison with Van Dyck and Titian flattered him
      extremely. The praise, "Long live Andrei Petrovitch," also pleased him
      greatly: to be spoken of by his Christian name and patronymic in print was
      an honour hitherto totally unknown to him. He began to pace the chamber
      briskly, now he sat down in an armchair, now he sprang up, and seated
      himself on the sofa, planning each moment how he would receive visitors,
      male and female; he went to his canvas and made a rapid sweep of the
      brush, endeavouring to impart a graceful movement to his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the bell at his door rang. He hastened to open it. A lady
      entered, accompanied by a girl of eighteen, her daughter, and followed by
      a lackey in a furred livery-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the painter Tchartkoff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great deal is written about you: your portraits, it is said, are the
      height of perfection." So saying, the lady raised her glass to her eyes
      and glanced rapidly over the walls, upon which nothing was hanging. "But
      where are your portraits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have been taken away" replied the artist, somewhat confusedly: "I
      have but just moved into these apartments; so they are still on the road,
      they have not arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been in Italy?" asked the lady, levelling her glass at him, as
      she found nothing else to point it at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have not been there; but I wish to go, and I have deferred it for a
      while. Here is an arm-chair, madame: you are fatigued?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you: I have been sitting a long time in the carriage. Ah, at last I
      behold your work!" said the lady, running to the opposite wall, and
      bringing her glass to bear upon his studies, sketches, views and portraits
      which were standing there on the floor. "It is charming. Lise! Lise, come
      here. Rooms in the style of Teniers. Do you see? Disorder, disorder, a
      table with a bust upon it, a hand, a palette; dust, see how the dust is
      painted! It is charming. And here on this canvas is a woman washing her
      face. What a pretty face! Ah! a little muzhik! So you do not devote
      yourself exclusively to portraits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that is mere rubbish. I was trying experiments, studies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me your opinion of the portrait painters of the present day. Is it
      not true that there are none now like Titian? There is not that strength
      of colour, that&mdash;that&mdash;What a pity that I cannot express myself
      in Russian." The lady was fond of paintings, and had gone through all the
      galleries in Italy with her eye-glass. "But Monsieur Nohl&mdash;ah, how
      well he paints! what remarkable work! I think his faces have been more
      expression than Titian's. You do not know Monsieur Nohl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Nohl?" inquired the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Nohl. Ah, what talent! He painted her portrait when she was only
      twelve years old. You must certainly come to see us. Lise, you shall show
      him your album. You know, we came expressly that you might begin her
      portrait immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? I am ready this very moment." And in a trice he pulled forward an
      easel with a canvas already prepared, grasped his palette, and fixed his
      eyes on the daughter's pretty little face. If he had been acquainted with
      human nature, he might have read in it the dawning of a childish passion
      for balls, the dawning of sorrow and misery at the length of time before
      dinner and after dinner, the heavy traces of uninterested application to
      various arts, insisted upon by her mother for the elevation of her mind.
      But the artist saw only the tender little face, a seductive subject for
      his brush, the body almost as transparent as porcelain, the delicate white
      neck, and the aristocratically slender form. And he prepared beforehand to
      triumph, to display the delicacy of his brush, which had hitherto had to
      deal only with the harsh features of coarse models, and severe antiques
      and copies of classic masters. He already saw in fancy how this delicate
      little face would turn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," said the lady with a positively touching expression of
      countenance, "I should like her to be painted simply attired, and seated
      among green shadows, like meadows, with a flock or a grove in the
      distance, so that it could not be seen that she goes to balls or
      fashionable entertainments. Our balls, I must confess, murder the
      intellect, deaden all remnants of feeling. Simplicity! would there were
      more simplicity!" Alas, it was stamped on the faces of mother and daughter
      that they had so overdanced themselves at balls that they had become
      almost wax figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchartkoff set to work, posed his model, reflected a bit, fixed upon the
      idea, waved his brush in the air, settling the points mentally, and then
      began and finished the sketching in within an hour. Satisfied with it, he
      began to paint. The task fascinated him; he forgot everything, forgot the
      very existence of the aristocratic ladies, began even to display some
      artistic tricks, uttering various odd sounds and humming to himself now
      and then as artists do when immersed heart and soul in their work. Without
      the slightest ceremony, he made the sitter lift her head, which finally
      began to express utter weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough for the first time," said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little more," said the artist, forgetting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is time to stop. Lise, three o'clock!" said the lady, taking out a
      tiny watch which hung by a gold chain from her girdle. "How late it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a minute," said Tchartkoff innocently, with the pleading voice of a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady appeared to be not at all inclined to yield to his artistic
      demands on this occasion; she promised, however, to sit longer the next
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is vexatious, all the same," thought Tchartkoff to himself: "I had
      just got my hand in;" and he remembered no one had interrupted him or
      stopped him when he was at work in his studio on Vasilievsky Ostroff.
      Nikita sat motionless in one place. You might even paint him as long as
      you pleased; he even went to sleep in the attitude prescribed him. Feeling
      dissatisfied, he laid his brush and palette on a chair, and paused in
      irritation before the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman of the world's compliments awoke him from his reverie. He flew
      to the door to show them out: on the stairs he received an invitation to
      dine with them the following week, and returned with a cheerful face to
      his apartments. The aristocratic lady had completely charmed him. Up to
      that time he had looked upon such beings as unapproachable, born solely to
      ride in magnificent carriages, with liveried footmen and stylish coachmen,
      and to cast indifferent glances on the poor man travelling on foot in a
      cheap cloak. And now, all of a sudden, one of these very beings had
      entered his room; he was painting her portrait, was invited to dinner at
      an aristocratic house. An unusual feeling of pleasure took possession of
      him: he was completely intoxicated, and rewarded himself with a splendid
      dinner, an evening at the theatre, and a drive through the city in a
      carriage, without any necessity whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But meanwhile his ordinary work did not fall in with his mood at all. He
      did nothing but wait for the moment when the bell should ring. At last the
      aristocratic lady arrived with her pale daughter. He seated them, drew
      forward the canvas with skill, and some efforts of fashionable airs, and
      began to paint. The sunny day and bright light aided him not a little: he
      saw in his dainty sitter much which, caught and committed to canvas, would
      give great value to the portrait. He perceived that he might accomplish
      something good if he could reproduce, with accuracy, all that nature then
      offered to his eyes. His heart began to beat faster as he felt that he was
      expressing something which others had not even seen as yet. His work
      engrossed him completely: he was wholly taken up with it, and again forgot
      the aristocratic origin of the sitter. With heaving breast he saw the
      delicate features and the almost transparent body of the fair maiden grow
      beneath his hand. He had caught every shade, the slight sallowness, the
      almost imperceptible blue tinge under the eyes&mdash;and was already
      preparing to put in the tiny mole on the brow, when he suddenly heard the
      mother's voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! why do you paint that? it is not necessary: and you have made it
      here, in several places, rather yellow; and here, quite so, like dark
      spots."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist undertook to explain that the spots and yellow tinge would turn
      out well, that they brought out the delicate and pleasing tones of the
      face. He was informed that they did not bring out tones, and would not
      turn out well at all. It was explained to him that just to-day Lise did
      not feel quite well; that she never was sallow, and that her face was
      distinguished for its fresh colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly he began to erase what his brush had put upon the canvas. Many a
      nearly imperceptible feature disappeared, and with it vanished too a
      portion of the resemblance. He began indifferently to impart to the
      picture that commonplace colouring which can be painted mechanically, and
      which lends to a face, even when taken from nature, the sort of cold
      ideality observable on school programmes. But the lady was satisfied when
      the objectionable tone was quite banished. She merely expressed surprise
      that the work lasted so long, and added that she had heard that he
      finished a portrait completely in two sittings. The artist could not think
      of any answer to this. The ladies rose, and prepared to depart. He laid
      aside his brush, escorted them to the door, and then stood disconsolate
      for a long while in one spot before the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed stupidly at it; and meanwhile there floated before his mind's eye
      those delicate features, those shades, and airy tints which he had copied,
      and which his brush had annihilated. Engrossed with them, he put the
      portrait on one side and hunted up a head of Psyche which he had some time
      before thrown on canvas in a sketchy manner. It was a pretty little face,
      well painted, but entirely ideal, and having cold, regular features not
      lit up by life. For lack of occupation, he now began to tone it up,
      imparting to it all he had taken note of in his aristocratic sitter. Those
      features, shadows, tints, which he had noted, made their appearance here
      in the purified form in which they appear when the painter, after closely
      observing nature, subordinates himself to her, and produces a creation
      equal to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psyche began to live: and the scarcely dawning thought began, little by
      little, to clothe itself in a visible form. The type of face of the
      fashionable young lady was unconsciously transferred to Psyche, yet
      nevertheless she had an expression of her own which gave the picture
      claims to be considered in truth an original creation. Tchartkoff gave
      himself up entirely to his work. For several days he was engrossed by it
      alone, and the ladies surprised him at it on their arrival. He had not
      time to remove the picture from the easel. Both ladies uttered a cry of
      amazement, and clasped their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lise, Lise! Ah, how like! Superb, superb! What a happy thought, too, to
      drape her in a Greek costume! Ah, what a surprise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist could not see his way to disabuse the ladies of their error.
      Shamefacedly, with drooping head, he murmured, "This is Psyche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the character of Psyche? Charming!" said the mother, smiling, upon
      which the daughter smiled too. "Confess, Lise, it pleases you to be
      painted in the character of Psyche better than any other way? What a sweet
      idea! But what treatment! It is Correggio himself. I must say that,
      although I had read and heard about you, I did not know you had so much
      talent. You positively must paint me too." Evidently the lady wanted to be
      portrayed as some kind of Psyche too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I to do with them?" thought the artist. "If they will have it so,
      why, let Psyche pass for what they choose:" and added aloud, "Pray sit a
      little: I will touch it up here and there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I am afraid you will... it is such a capital likeness now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the artist understood that the difficulty was with respect to the
      sallowness, and so he reassured them by saying that he only wished to give
      more brilliancy and expression to the eyes. In truth, he was ashamed, and
      wanted to impart a little more likeness to the original, lest any one
      should accuse him of actual barefaced flattery. And the features of the
      pale young girl at length appeared more closely in Psyche's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said the mother, beginning to fear that the likeness might
      become too decided. The artist was remunerated in every way, with smiles,
      money, compliments, cordial pressures of the hand, invitations to dinner:
      in short, he received a thousand flattering rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait created a furore in the city. The lady exhibited it to her
      friends, and all admired the skill with which the artist had preserved the
      likeness, and at the same time conferred more beauty on the original. The
      last remark, of course, was prompted by a slight tinge of envy. The artist
      was suddenly overwhelmed with work. It seemed as if the whole city wanted
      to be painted by him. The door-bell rang incessantly. From one point of
      view, this might be considered advantageous, as presenting to him endless
      practice in variety and number of faces. But, unfortunately, they were all
      people who were hard to get along with, either busy, hurried people, or
      else belonging to the fashionable world, and consequently more occupied
      than any one else, and therefore impatient to the last degree. In all
      quarters, the demand was merely that the likeness should be good and
      quickly executed. The artist perceived that it was a simple impossibility
      to finish his work; that it was necessary to exchange power of treatment
      for lightness and rapidity, to catch only the general expression, and not
      waste labour on delicate details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, nearly all of his sitters made stipulations on various points.
      The ladies required that mind and character should be represented in their
      portraits; that all angles should be rounded, all unevenness smoothed
      away, and even removed entirely if possible; in short, that their faces
      should be such as to cause every one to stare at them with admiration, if
      not fall in love with them outright. When they sat to him, they sometimes
      assumed expressions which greatly amazed the artist; one tried to express
      melancholy; another, meditation; a third wanted to make her mouth appear
      small on any terms, and puckered it up to such an extent that it finally
      looked like a spot about as big as a pinhead. And in spite of all this,
      they demanded of him good likenesses and unconstrained naturalness. The
      men were no better: one insisted on being painted with an energetic,
      muscular turn to his head; another, with upturned, inspired eyes; a
      lieutenant of the guard demanded that Mars should be visible in his eyes;
      an official in the civil service drew himself up to his full height in
      order to have his uprightness expressed in his face, and that his hand
      might rest on a book bearing the words in plain characters, "He always
      stood up for the right."
    </p>
    <p>
      At first such demands threw the artist into a cold perspiration. Finally
      he acquired the knack of it, and never troubled himself at all about it.
      He understood at a word how each wanted himself portrayed. If a man wanted
      Mars in his face, he put in Mars: he gave a Byronic turn and attitude to
      those who aimed at Byron. If the ladies wanted to be Corinne, Undine, or
      Aspasia, he agreed with great readiness, and threw in a sufficient measure
      of good looks from his own imagination, which does no harm, and for the
      sake of which an artist is even forgiven a lack of resemblance. He soon
      began to wonder himself at the rapidity and dash of his brush. And of
      course those who sat to him were in ecstasies, and proclaimed him a
      genius.

      Tchartkoff became a fashionable artist in every sense of the word. He
      began to dine out, to escort ladies to picture galleries, to dress
      foppishly, and to assert audibly that an artist should belong to society,
      that he must uphold his profession, that artists mostly dress like
      showmakers, do not know how to behave themselves, do not maintain the
      highest tone, and are lacking in all polish. At home, in his studio, he
      carried cleanliness and spotlessness to the last extreme, set up two
      superb footmen, took fashionable pupils, dressed several times a day,
      curled his hair, practised various manners of receiving his callers, and
      busied himself in adorning his person in every conceivable way, in order
      to produce a pleasing impression on the ladies. In short, it would soon
      have been impossible for any one to have recognised in him the modest
      artist who had formerly toiled unknown in his miserable quarters in the
      Vasilievsky Ostroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now expressed himself decidedly concerning artists and art; declared
      that too much credit had been given to the old masters; that even Raphael
      did not always paint well, and that fame attached to many of his works
      simply by force of tradition: that Michael Angelo was a braggart because
      he could boast only a knowledge of anatomy; that there was no grace about
      him, and that real brilliancy and power of treatment and colouring were to
      be looked for in the present century. And there, naturally, the question
      touched him personally. "I do not understand," said he, "how others toil
      and work with difficulty: a man who labours for months over a picture is a
      dauber, and no artist in my opinion; I don't believe he has any talent:
      genius works boldly, rapidly. Here is this portrait which I painted in two
      days, this head in one day, this in a few hours, this in little more than
      an hour. No, I confess I do not recognise as art that which adds line to
      line; that is a handicraft, not art." In this manner did he lecture his
      visitors; and the visitors admired the strength and boldness of his works,
      uttered exclamations on hearing how fast they had been produced, and said
      to each other, "This is talent, real talent! see how he speaks, how his
      eyes gleam! There is something really extraordinary in his face!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It flattered the artist to hear such reports about himself. When printed
      praise appeared in the papers, he rejoiced like a child, although this
      praise was purchased with his money. He carried the printed slips about
      with him everywhere, and showed them to friends and acquaintances as if by
      accident. His fame increased, his works and orders multiplied. Already the
      same portraits over and over again wearied him, by the same attitudes and
      turns, which he had learned by heart. He painted them now without any
      great interest in his work, brushing in some sort of a head, and giving
      them to his pupil's to finish. At first he had sought to devise a new
      attitude each time. Now this had grown wearisome to him. His brain was
      tired with planning and thinking. It was out of his power; his fashionable
      life bore him far away from labour and thought. His work grew cold and
      colourless; and he betook himself with indifference to the reproduction of
      monotonous, well-worn forms. The eternally spick-and-span uniforms, and
      the so-to-speak buttoned-up faces of the government officials, soldiers,
      and statesmen, did not offer a wide field for his brush: it forgot how to
      render superb draperies and powerful emotion and passion. Of grouping,
      dramatic effect and its lofty connections, there was nothing. In face of
      him was only a uniform, a corsage, a dress-coat, and before which the
      artist feels cold and all imagination vanishes. Even his own peculiar
      merits were no longer visible in his works, yet they continued to enjoy
      renown; although genuine connoisseurs and artists merely shrugged their
      shoulders when they saw his latest productions. But some who had known
      Tchartkoff in his earlier days could not understand how the talent of
      which he had given such clear indications in the outset could so have
      vanished; and strove in vain to divine by what means genius could be
      extinguished in a man just when he had attained to the full development of
      his powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the intoxicated artist did not hear these criticisms. He began to
      attain to the age of dignity, both in mind and years: to grow stout, and
      increase visibly in flesh. He often read in the papers such phrases as,
      "Our most respected Andrei Petrovitch; our worthy Andrei Petrovitch." He
      began to receive offers of distinguished posts in the service, invitations
      to examinations and committees. He began, as is usually the case in
      maturer years, to advocate Raphael and the old masters, not because he had
      become thoroughly convinced of their transcendent merits, but in order to
      snub the younger artists. His life was already approaching the period when
      everything which suggests impulse contracts within a man; when a powerful
      chord appeals more feebly to the spirit; when the touch of beauty no
      longer converts virgin strength into fire and flame, but when all the
      burnt-out sentiments become more vulnerable to the sound of gold, hearken
      more attentively to its seductive music, and little by little permit
      themselves to be completely lulled to sleep by it. Fame can give no
      pleasure to him who has stolen it, not won it; so all his feelings and
      impulses turned towards wealth. Gold was his passion, his ideal, his fear,
      his delight, his aim. The bundles of bank-notes increased in his coffers;
      and, like all to whose lot falls this fearful gift, he began to grow
      inaccessible to every sentiment except the love of gold. But something
      occurred which gave him a powerful shock, and disturbed the whole tenor of
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he found upon his table a note, in which the Academy of Painting
      begged him, as a worthy member of its body, to come and give his opinion
      upon a new work which had been sent from Italy by a Russian artist who was
      perfecting himself there. The painter was one of his former comrades, who
      had been possessed with a passion for art from his earliest years, had
      given himself up to it with his whole soul, estranged himself from his
      friends and relatives, and had hastened to that wonderful Rome, at whose
      very name the artist's heart beats wildly and hotly. There he buried
      himself in his work from which he permitted nothing to entice him. He
      visited the galleries unweariedly, he stood for hours at a time before the
      works of the great masters, seizing and studying their marvellous methods.
      He never finished anything without revising his impressions several times
      before these great teachers, and reading in their works silent but
      eloquent counsels. He gave each impartially his due, appropriating from
      all only that which was most beautiful, and finally became the pupil of
      the divine Raphael alone, as a great poet, after reading many works, at
      last made Homer's "Iliad" his only breviary, having discovered that it
      contains all one wants, and that there is nothing which is not expressed
      in it in perfection. And so he brought away from his school the grand
      conception of creation, the mighty beauty of thought, the high charm of
      that heavenly brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tchartkoff entered the room, he found a crowd of visitors already
      collected before the picture. The most profound silence, such as rarely
      settles upon a throng of critics, reigned over all. He hastened to assume
      the significant expression of a connoisseur, and approached the picture;
      but, O God! what did he behold!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure, faultless, beautiful as a bride, stood the picture before him. The
      critics regarded this new hitherto unknown work with a feeling of
      involuntary wonder. All seemed united in it: the art of Raphael, reflected
      in the lofty grace of the grouping; the art of Correggio, breathing from
      the finished perfection of the workmanship. But more striking than all
      else was the evident creative power in the artist's mind. The very
      minutest object in the picture revealed it; he had caught that melting
      roundness of outline which is visible in nature only to the artist
      creator, and which comes out as angles with a copyist. It was plainly
      visible how the artist, having imbibed it all from the external world, had
      first stored it in his mind, and then drawn it thence, as from a spiritual
      source, into one harmonious, triumphant song. And it was evident, even to
      the uninitiated, how vast a gulf there was fixed between creation and a
      mere copy from nature. Involuntary tears stood ready to fall in the eyes
      of those who surrounded the picture. It seemed as though all joined in a
      silent hymn to the divine work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motionless, with open mouth, Tchartkoff stood before the picture. At
      length, when by degrees the visitors and critics began to murmur and
      comment upon the merits of the work, and turning to him, begged him to
      express an opinion, he came to himself once more. He tried to assume an
      indifferent, everyday expression; strove to utter some such commonplace
      remark as; "Yes, to tell the truth, it is impossible to deny the artist's
      talent; there is something in it;" but the speech died upon his lips,
      tears and sobs burst forth uncontrollably, and he rushed from the room
      like one beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he stood in his magnificent studio. All his being, all his
      life, had been aroused in one instant, as if youth had returned to him, as
      if the dying sparks of his talent had blazed forth afresh. The bandage
      suddenly fell from his eyes. Heavens! to think of having mercilessly
      wasted the best years of his youth, of having extinguished, trodden out
      perhaps, that spark of fire which, cherished in his breast, might perhaps
      have been developed into magnificence and beauty, and have extorted too,
      its meed of tears and admiration! It seemed as though those impulses which
      he had known in other days re-awoke suddenly in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized a brush and approached his canvas. One thought possessed him
      wholly, one desire consumed him; he strove to depict a fallen angel. This
      idea was most in harmony with his frame of mind. The perspiration started
      out upon his face with his efforts; but, alas! his figures, attitudes,
      groups, thoughts, arranged themselves stiffly, disconnectedly. His hand
      and his imagination had been too long confined to one groove; and the
      fruitless effort to escape from the bonds and fetters which he had imposed
      upon himself, showed itself in irregularities and errors. He had despised
      the long, wearisome ladder to knowledge, and the first fundamental law of
      the future great man, hard work. He gave vent to his vexation. He ordered
      all his later productions to be taken out of his studio, all the
      fashionable, lifeless pictures, all the portraits of hussars, ladies, and
      councillors of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut himself up alone in his room, would order no food, and devoted
      himself entirely to his work. He sat toiling like a scholar. But how
      pitifully wretched was all which proceeded from his hand! He was stopped
      at every step by his ignorance of the very first principles: simple
      ignorance of the mechanical part of his art chilled all inspiration and
      formed an impassable barrier to his imagination. His brush returned
      involuntarily to hackneyed forms: hands folded themselves in a set
      attitude; heads dared not make any unusual turn; the very garments turned
      out commonplace, and would not drape themselves to any unaccustomed
      posture of the body. And he felt and saw this all himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But had I really any talent?" he said at length: "did not I deceive
      myself?" Uttering these words, he turned to the early works which he had
      painted so purely, so unselfishly, in former days, in his wretched cabin
      yonder in lonely Vasilievsky Ostroff. He began attentively to examine them
      all; and all the misery of his former life came back to him. "Yes," he
      cried despairingly, "I had talent: the signs and traces of it are
      everywhere visible&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused suddenly, and shivered all over. His eyes encountered other eyes
      fixed immovably upon him. It was that remarkable portrait which he had
      bought in the Shtchukinui Dvor. All this time it had been covered up,
      concealed by other pictures, and had utterly gone out of his mind. Now, as
      if by design, when all the fashionable portraits and paintings had been
      removed from the studio, it looked forth, together with the productions of
      his early youth. As he recalled all the strange events connected with it;
      as he remembered that this singular portrait had been, in a manner, the
      cause of his errors; that the hoard of money which he had obtained in such
      peculiar fashion had given birth in his mind to all the wild caprices
      which had destroyed his talent&mdash;madness was on the point of taking
      possession of him. At once he ordered the hateful portrait to be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his mental excitement was not thereby diminished. His whole being was
      shaken to its foundation; and he suffered that fearful torture which is
      sometimes exhibited when a feeble talent strives to display itself on a
      scale too great for it and cannot do so. A horrible envy took possession
      of him&mdash;an envy which bordered on madness. The gall flew to his heart
      when he beheld a work which bore the stamp of talent. He gnashed his
      teeth, and devoured it with the glare of a basilisk. He conceived the most
      devilish plan which ever entered into the mind of man, and he hastened
      with the strength of madness to carry it into execution. He began to
      purchase the best that art produced of every kind. Having bought a picture
      at a great price, he transported it to his room, flung himself upon it
      with the ferocity of a tiger, cut it, tore it, chopped it into bits, and
      stamped upon it with a grin of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast wealth he had amassed enabled him to gratify this devilish
      desire. He opened his bags of gold and unlocked his coffers. No monster of
      ignorance ever destroyed so many superb productions of art as did this
      raging avenger. At any auction where he made his appearance, every one
      despaired at once of obtaining any work of art. It seemed as if an angry
      heaven had sent this fearful scourge into the world expressly to destroy
      all harmony. Scorn of the world was expressed in his countenance. His
      tongue uttered nothing save biting and censorious words. He swooped down
      like a harpy into the street: and his acquaintances, catching sight of him
      in the distance, sought to turn aside and avoid a meeting with him, saying
      that it poisoned all the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the world and art, such a life could not last long: his
      passions were too overpowering for his feeble strength. Attacks of madness
      began to recur more frequently, and ended at last in the most frightful
      illness. A violent fever, combined with galloping consumption, seized upon
      him with such violence, that in three days there remained only a shadow of
      his former self. To this was added indications of hopeless insanity.
      Sometimes several men were unable to hold him. The long-forgotten, living
      eyes of the portrait began to torment him, and then his madness became
      dreadful. All the people who surrounded his bed seemed to him horrible
      portraits. The portrait doubled and quadrupled itself; all the walls
      seemed hung with portraits, which fastened their living eyes upon him;
      portraits glared at him from the ceiling, from the floor; the room widened
      and lengthened endlessly, in order to make room for more of the motionless
      eyes. The doctor who had undertaken to attend him, having learned
      something of his strange history, strove with all his might to fathom the
      secret connection between the visions of his fancy and the occurrences of
      his life, but without the slightest success. The sick man understood
      nothing, felt nothing, save his own tortures, and gave utterance only to
      frightful yells and unintelligible gibberish. At last his life ended in a
      final attack of unutterable suffering. Nothing could be found of all his
      great wealth; but when they beheld the mutilated fragments of grand works
      of art, the value of which exceeded a million, they understood the
      terrible use which had been made of it.

      PART II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A THRONG of carriages and other vehicles stood at the entrance of a house
      in which an auction was going on of the effects of one of those wealthy
      art-lovers who have innocently passed for Maecenases, and in a
      simple-minded fashion expended, to that end, the millions amassed by their
      thrifty fathers, and frequently even by their own early labours. The long
      saloon was filled with the most motley throng of visitors, collected like
      birds of prey swooping down upon an unburied corpse. There was a whole
      squadron of Russian shop-keepers from the Gostinnui Dvor, and from the
      old-clothes mart, in blue coats of foreign make. Their faces and
      expressions were a little more natural here, and did not display that
      fictitious desire to be subservient which is so marked in the Russian
      shop-keeper when he stands before a customer in his shop. Here they stood
      upon no ceremony, although the saloons were full of those very aristocrats
      before whom, in any other place, they would have been ready to sweep, with
      reverence, the dust brought in by their feet. They were quite at their
      ease, handling pictures and books without ceremony, when desirous of
      ascertaining the value of the goods, and boldly upsetting bargains
      mentally secured in advance by noble connoisseurs. There were many of
      those infallible attendants of auctions who make it a point to go to one
      every day as regularly as to take their breakfast; aristocratic
      connoisseurs who look upon it as their duty not to miss any opportunity of
      adding to their collections, and who have no other occupation between
      twelve o'clock and one; and noble gentlemen, with garments very
      threadbare, who make their daily appearance without any selfish object in
      view, but merely to see how it all goes off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quantity of pictures were lying about in disorder: with them were
      mingled furniture, and books with the cipher of the former owner, who
      never was moved by any laudable desire to glance into them. Chinese vases,
      marble slabs for tables, old and new furniture with curving lines, with
      griffins, sphinxes, and lions' paws, gilded and ungilded, chandeliers,
      sconces, all were heaped together in a perfect chaos of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The auction appeared to be at its height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surging throng was competing for a portrait which could not but arrest
      the attention of all who possessed any knowledge of art. The skilled hand
      of an artist was plainly visible in it. The portrait, which had apparently
      been several times restored and renovated, represented the dark features
      of an Asiatic in flowing garments, and with a strange and remarkable
      expression of countenance; but what struck the buyers more than anything
      else was the peculiar liveliness of the eyes. The more they were looked
      at, the more did they seem to penetrate into the gazer's heart. This
      peculiarity, this strange illusion achieved by the artist, attracted the
      attention of nearly all. Many who had been bidding gradually withdrew, for
      the price offered had risen to an incredible sum. There remained only two
      well-known aristocrats, amateurs of painting, who were unwilling to forego
      such an acquisition. They grew warm, and would probably have run the
      bidding up to an impossible sum, had not one of the onlookers suddenly
      exclaimed, "Permit me to interrupt your competition for a while: I,
      perhaps, more than any other, have a right to this portrait."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words at once drew the attention of all to him. He was a tall man of
      thirty-five, with long black curls. His pleasant face, full of a certain
      bright nonchalance, indicated a mind free from all wearisome, worldly
      excitement; his garments had no pretence to fashion: all about him
      indicated the artist. He was, in fact, B. the painter, a man personally
      well known to many of those present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However strange my words may seem to you," he continued, perceiving that
      the general attention was directed to him, "if you will listen to a short
      story, you may possibly see that I was right in uttering them. Everything
      assures me that this is the portrait which I am looking for."
    </p>
    <p>
      A natural curiosity illuminated the faces of nearly all present; and even
      the auctioneer paused as he was opening his mouth, and with hammer
      uplifted in the air, prepared to listen. At the beginning of the story,
      many glanced involuntarily towards the portrait; but later on, all bent
      their attention solely on the narrator, as his tale grew gradually more
      absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that portion of the city which is called Kolomna," he began.
      "There everything is unlike anything else in St. Petersburg. Retired
      officials remove thither to live; widows; people not very well off, who
      have acquaintances in the senate, and therefore condemn themselves to this
      for nearly the whole of their lives; and, in short, that whole list of
      people who can be described by the words ash-coloured&mdash;people whose
      garments, faces, hair, eyes, have a sort of ashy surface, like a day when
      there is in the sky neither cloud nor sun. Among them may be retired
      actors, retired titular councillors, retired sons of Mars, with ruined
      eyes and swollen lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life in Kolomna is terribly dull: rarely does a carriage appear, except,
      perhaps, one containing an actor, which disturbs the universal stillness
      by its rumble, noise, and jingling. You can get lodgings for five rubles a
      month, coffee in the morning included. Widows with pensions are the most
      aristocratic families there; they conduct themselves well, sweep their
      rooms often, chatter with their friends about the dearness of beef and
      cabbage, and frequently have a young daughter, a taciturn, quiet,
      sometimes pretty creature; an ugly dog, and wall-clocks which strike in a
      melancholy fashion. Then come the actors whose salaries do not permit them
      to desert Kolomna, an independent folk, living, like all artists, for
      pleasure. They sit in their dressing-gowns, cleaning their pistols, gluing
      together all sorts of things out of cardboard, playing draughts and cards
      with any friend who chances to drop in, and so pass away the morning,
      doing pretty nearly the same in the evening, with the addition of punch
      now and then. After these great people and aristocracy of Kolomna, come
      the rank and file. It is as difficult to put a name to them as to remember
      the multitude of insects which breed in stale vinegar. There are old women
      who get drunk, who make a living by incomprehensible means, like ants,
      dragging old clothes and rags from the Kalinkin Bridge to the old
      clothes-mart, in order to sell them for fifteen kopeks&mdash;in short, the
      very dregs of mankind, whose conditions no beneficent, political economist
      has devised any means of ameliorating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have mentioned them in order to point out how often such people find
      themselves under the necessity of seeking immediate temporary assistance
      and having recourse to borrowing. Hence there settles among them a
      peculiar race of money-lenders who lend small sums on security at an
      enormous percentage. Among these usurers was a certain... but I must not
      omit to mention that the occurrence which I have undertaken to relate
      occurred the last century, in the reign of our late Empress Catherine the
      Second. So, among the usurers, at that epoch, was a certain person&mdash;an
      extraordinary being in every respect, who had settled in that quarter of
      the city long before. He went about in flowing Asiatic garb; his dark
      complexion indicated a Southern origin, but to what particular nation he
      belonged, India, Greece, or Persia, no one could say with certainty. Of
      tall, almost colossal stature, with dark, thin, ardent face, heavy
      overhanging brows, and an indescribably strange colour in his large eyes
      of unwonted fire, he differed sharply and strongly from all the
      ash-coloured denizens of the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His very dwelling was unlike the other little wooden houses. It was of
      stone, in the style of those formerly much affected by Genoese merchants,
      with irregular windows of various sizes, secured with iron shutters and
      bars. This usurer differed from other usurers also in that he could
      furnish any required sum, from that desired by the poor old beggar-woman
      to that demanded by the extravagant grandee of the court. The most
      gorgeous equipages often halted in front of his house, and from their
      windows sometimes peeped forth the head of an elegant high-born lady.
      Rumour, as usual, reported that his iron coffers were full of untold gold,
      treasures, diamonds, and all sorts of pledges, but that, nevertheless, he
      was not the slave of that avarice which is characteristic of other
      usurers. He lent money willingly, and on very favourable terms of payment
      apparently, but, by some curious method of reckoning, made them mount to
      an incredible percentage. So said rumour, at any rate. But what was
      strangest of all was the peculiar fate of those who received money from
      him: they all ended their lives in some unhappy way. Whether this was
      simply the popular superstition, or the result of reports circulated with
      an object, is not known. But several instances which happened within a
      brief space of time before the eyes of every one were vivid and striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among the aristocracy of that day, one who speedily drew attention to
      himself was a young man of one of the best families who had made a figure
      in his early years in court circles, a warm admirer of everything true and
      noble, zealous in his love for art, and giving promise of becoming a
      Maecenas. He was soon deservedly distinguished by the Empress, who
      conferred upon him an important post, fully proportioned to his deserts&mdash;a
      post in which he could accomplish much for science and the general
      welfare. The youthful dignitary surrounded himself with artists, poets,
      and learned men. He wished to give work to all, to encourage all. He
      undertook, at his own expense, a number of useful publications; gave
      numerous orders to artists; offered prizes for the encouragement of
      different arts; spent a great deal of money, and finally ruined himself.
      But, full of noble impulses, he did not wish to relinquish his work,
      sought to raise a loan, and finally betook himself to the well-known
      usurer. Having borrowed a considerable sum from him, the man in a short
      time changed completely. He became a persecutor and oppressor of budding
      talent and intellect. He saw the bad side in everything produced, and
      every word he uttered was false.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, unfortunately, came the French Revolution. This furnished him with
      an excuse for every kind of suspicion. He began to discover a
      revolutionary tendency in everything; to concoct terrible and unjust
      accusations, which made scores of people unhappy. Of course, such conduct
      could not fail in time to reach the throne. The kind-hearted Empress was
      shocked; and, full of the noble spirit which adorns crowned heads, she
      uttered words still engraven on many hearts. The Empress remarked that not
      under a monarchical government were high and noble impulses persecuted;
      not there were the creations of intellect, poetry, and art contemned and
      oppressed. On the other hand, monarchs alone were their protectors.
      Shakespeare and Moliere flourished under their magnanimous protection,
      while Dante could not find a corner in his republican birthplace. She said
      that true geniuses arise at the epoch of brilliancy and power in emperors
      and empires, but not in the time of monstrous political apparitions and
      republican terrorism, which, up to that time, had never given to the world
      a single poet; that poet-artists should be marked out for favour, since
      peace and divine quiet alone compose their minds, not excitement and
      tumult; that learned men, poets, and all producers of art are the pearls
      and diamonds in the imperial crown: by them is the epoch of the great
      ruler adorned, and from them it receives yet greater brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the Empress uttered these words she was divinely beautiful for the
      moment, and I remember old men who could not speak of the occurrence
      without tears. All were interested in the affair. It must be remarked, to
      the honour of our national pride, that in the Russian's heart there always
      beats a fine feeling that he must adopt the part of the persecuted. The
      dignitary who had betrayed his trust was punished in an exemplary manner
      and degraded from his post. But he read a more dreadful punishment in the
      faces of his fellow-countrymen: universal scorn. It is impossible to
      describe what he suffered, and he died in a terrible attack of raving
      madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another striking example also occurred. Among the beautiful women in
      which our northern capital assuredly is not poor, one decidedly surpassed
      the rest. Her loveliness was a combination of our Northern charms with
      those of the South, a gem such as rarely makes its appearance on earth. My
      father said that he had never beheld anything like it in the whole course
      of his life. Everything seemed to be united in her, wealth, intellect, and
      wit. She had throngs of admirers, the most distinguished of them being
      Prince R., the most noble-minded of all young men, the finest in face, and
      an ideal of romance in his magnanimous and knightly sentiments. Prince R.
      was passionately in love, and was requited by a like ardent passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the match seemed unequal to the parents. The prince's family estates
      had not been in his possession for a long time, his family was out of
      favour, and the sad state of his affairs was well known to all. Of a
      sudden the prince quitted the capital, as if for the purpose of arranging
      his affairs, and after a short interval reappeared, surrounded with luxury
      and splendour. Brilliant balls and parties made him known at court. The
      lady's father began to relent, and the wedding took place. Whence this
      change in circumstances, this unheard-of-wealth, came, no one could fully
      explain; but it was whispered that he had entered into a compact with the
      mysterious usurer, and had borrowed money of him. However that may have
      been, the wedding was a source of interest to the whole city, and the
      bride and bridegroom were objects of general envy. Every one knew of their
      warm and faithful love, the long persecution they had had to endure from
      every quarter, the great personal worth of both. Ardent women at once
      sketched out the heavenly bliss which the young couple would enjoy. But it
      turned out very differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the course of a year a frightful change came over the husband. His
      character, up to that time so noble, became poisoned with jealous
      suspicions, irritability, and inexhaustible caprices. He became a tyrant
      to his wife, a thing which no one could have foreseen, and indulged in the
      most inhuman deeds, and even in blows. In a year's time no one would have
      recognised the woman who, such a little while before, had dazzled and
      drawn about her throngs of submissive adorers. Finally, no longer able to
      endure her lot, she proposed a divorce. Her husband flew into a rage at
      the very suggestion. In the first outburst of passion, he chased her about
      the room with a knife, and would doubtless have murdered her then and
      there, if they had not seized him and prevented him. In a fit of madness
      and despair he turned the knife against himself, and ended his life amid
      the most horrible sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides these two instances which occurred before the eyes of all the
      world, stories circulated of many more among the lower classes, nearly all
      of which had tragic endings. Here an honest sober man became a drunkard;
      there a shopkeeper's clerk robbed his master; again, a driver who had
      conducted himself properly for a number of years cut his passenger's
      throat for a groschen. It was impossible that such occurrences, related,
      not without embellishments, should not inspire a sort of involuntary
      horror amongst the sedate inhabitants of Kolomna. No one entertained any
      doubt as to the presence of an evil power in the usurer. They said that he
      imposed conditions which made the hair rise on one's head, and which the
      miserable wretch never afterward dared reveal to any other being; that his
      money possessed a strange power of attraction; that it grew hot of itself,
      and that it bore strange marks. And it is worthy of remark, that all the
      colony of Kolomna, all these poor old women, small officials, petty
      artists, and insignificant people whom we have just recapitulated, agreed
      that it was better to endure anything, and to suffer the extreme of
      misery, rather than to have recourse to the terrible usurer. Old women
      were even found dying of hunger, who preferred to kill their bodies rather
      than lose their soul. Those who met him in the street experienced an
      involuntary sense of fear. Pedestrians took care to turn aside from his
      path, and gazed long after his tall, receding figure. In his face alone
      there was sufficient that was uncommon to cause any one to ascribe to him
      a supernatural nature. The strong features, so deeply chiselled; the
      glowing bronze of his complexion; the incredible thickness of his brows;
      the intolerable, terrible eyes&mdash;everything seemed to indicate that
      the passions of other men were pale compared to those raging within him.
      My father stopped short every time he met him, and could not refrain each
      time from saying, 'A devil, a perfect devil!' But I must introduce you as
      speedily as possible to my father, the chief character of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father was a remarkable man in many respects. He was an artist of rare
      ability, a self-taught artist, without teachers or schools, principles and
      rules, carried away only by the thirst for perfection, and treading a path
      indicated by his own instincts, for reasons unknown, perchance, even to
      himself. Through some lofty and secret instinct he perceived the presence
      of a soul in every object. And this secret instinct and personal
      conviction turned his brush to Christian subjects, grand and lofty to the
      last degree. His was a strong character: he was an honourable, upright,
      even rough man, covered with a sort of hard rind without, not entirely
      lacking in pride, and given to expressing himself both sharply and
      scornfully about people. He worked for very small results; that is to say,
      for just enough to support his family and obtain the materials he needed;
      he never, under any circumstances, refused to aid any one, or to lend a
      helping hand to a poor artist; and he believed with the simple, reverent
      faith of his ancestors. At length, by his unintermitting labour and
      perseverance in the path he had marked out for himself, he began to win
      the approbation of those who honoured his self-taught talent. They gave
      him constant orders for churches, and he never lacked employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of his paintings possessed a strong interest for him. I no longer
      recollect the exact subject: I only know that he needed to represent the
      Spirit of Darkness in it. He pondered long what form to give him: he
      wished to concentrate in his face all that weighs down and oppresses a
      man. In the midst of his meditations there suddenly occurred to his mind
      the image of the mysterious usurer; and he thought involuntarily, 'That's
      how I ought to paint the Devil!' Imagine his amazement when one day, as he
      was at work in his studio, he heard a knock at the door, and directly
      after there entered that same terrible usurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You are an artist?' he said to my father abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I am,' answered my father in surprise, waiting for what should come
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good! Paint my portrait. I may possibly die soon. I have no children;
      but I do not wish to die completely, I wish to live. Can you paint a
      portrait that shall appear as though it were alive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father reflected, 'What could be better! he offers himself for the
      Devil in my picture.' He promised. They agreed upon a time and price; and
      the next day my father took palette and brushes and went to the usurer's
      house. The lofty court-yard, dogs, iron doors and locks, arched windows,
      coffers, draped with strange covers, and, last of all, the remarkable
      owner himself, seated motionless before him, all produced a strange
      impression on him. The windows seemed intentionally so encumbered below
      that they admitted the light only from the top. 'Devil take him, how well
      his face is lighted!' he said to himself, and began to paint assiduously,
      as though afraid that the favourable light would disappear. 'What power!'
      he repeated to himself. 'If I only accomplish half a likeness of him, as
      he is now, it will surpass all my other works: he will simply start from
      the canvas if I am only partly true to nature. What remarkable features!'
      He redoubled his energy; and began himself to notice how some of his
      sitter's traits were making their appearance on the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the more closely he approached resemblance, the more conscious he
      became of an aggressive, uneasy feeling which he could not explain to
      himself. Notwithstanding this, he set himself to copy with literal
      accuracy every trait and expression. First of all, however, he busied
      himself with the eyes. There was so much force in those eyes, that it
      seemed impossible to reproduce them exactly as they were in nature. But he
      resolved, at any price, to seek in them the most minute characteristics
      and shades, to penetrate their secret. As soon, however, as he approached
      them in resemblance, and began to redouble his exertions, there sprang up
      in his mind such a terrible feeling of repulsion, of inexplicable
      expression, that he was forced to lay aside his brush for a while and
      begin anew. At last he could bear it no longer: he felt as if these eyes
      were piercing into his soul, and causing intolerable emotion. On the
      second and third days this grew still stronger. It became horrible to him.
      He threw down his brush, and declared abruptly that he could paint the
      stranger no longer. You should have seen how the terrible usurer changed
      countenance at these words. He threw himself at his feet, and besought him
      to finish the portrait, saying that his fate and his existence depended on
      it; that he had already caught his prominent features; that if he could
      reproduce them accurately, his life would be preserved in his portrait in
      a supernatural manner; that by that means he would not die completely;
      that it was necessary for him to continue to exist in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father was frightened by these words: they seemed to him strange and
      terrible to such a degree, that he threw down his brushes and palette and
      rushed headlong from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thought of it troubled him all day and all night; but the next
      morning he received the portrait from the usurer, by a woman who was the
      only creature in his service, and who announced that her master did not
      want the portrait, and would pay nothing for it, and had sent it back. On
      the evening of the same day he learned that the usurer was dead, and that
      preparations were in progress to bury him according to the rites of his
      religion. All this seemed to him inexplicably strange. But from that day a
      marked change showed itself in his character. He was possessed by a
      troubled, uneasy feeling, of which he was unable to explain the cause; and
      he soon committed a deed which no one could have expected of him. For some
      time the works of one of his pupils had been attracting the attention of a
      small circle of connoisseurs and amateurs. My father had perceived his
      talent, and manifested a particular liking for him in consequence.
      Suddenly the general interest in him and talk about him became unendurable
      to my father who grew envious of him. Finally, to complete his vexation,
      he learned that his pupil had been asked to paint a picture for a recently
      built and wealthy church. This enraged him. 'No, I will not permit that
      fledgling to triumph!' said he: 'it is early, friend, to think of
      consigning old men to the gutters. I still have powers, God be praised!
      We'll soon see which will put down the other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this straightforward, honourable man employed intrigues which he had
      hitherto abhorred. He finally contrived that there should be a competition
      for the picture which other artists were permitted to enter into. Then he
      shut himself up in his room, and grasped his brush with zeal. It seemed as
      if he were striving to summon all his strength up for this occasion. And,
      in fact, the result turned out to be one of his best works. No one doubted
      that he would bear off the palm. The pictures were placed on exhibition,
      and all the others seemed to his as night to day. But of a sudden, one of
      the members present, an ecclesiastical personage if I mistake not, made a
      remark which surprised every one. 'There is certainly much talent in this
      artist's picture,' said he, 'but no holiness in the faces: there is even,
      on the contrary, a demoniacal look in the eyes, as though some evil
      feeling had guided the artist's hand.' All looked, and could not but
      acknowledge the truth of these words. My father rushed forward to his
      picture, as though to verify for himself this offensive remark, and
      perceived with horror that he had bestowed the usurer's eyes upon nearly
      all the figures. They had such a diabolical gaze that he involuntarily
      shuddered. The picture was rejected; and he was forced to hear, to his
      indescribable vexation, that the palm was awarded to his pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible to describe the state of rage in which he returned home.
      He almost killed my mother, he drove the children away, broke his brushes
      and easels, tore down the usurer's portrait from the wall, demanded a
      knife, and ordered a fire to be built in the chimney, intending to cut it
      in pieces and burn it. A friend, an artist, caught him in the act as he
      entered the room&mdash;a jolly fellow, always satisfied with himself,
      inflated by unattainable wishes, doing daily anything that came to hand,
      and taking still more gaily to his dinner and little carouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What are you doing? What are you preparing to burn?' he asked, and
      stepped up to the portrait. 'Why, this is one of your very best works. It
      is the usurer who died a short time ago: yes, it is a most perfect
      likeness. You did not stop until you had got into his very eyes. Never did
      eyes look as these do now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, I'll see how they look in the fire!' said my father, making a
      movement to fling the portrait into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Stop, for Heaven's sake!' exclaimed his friend, restraining him: 'give
      it to me, rather, if it offends your eyes to such a degree.' My father
      resisted, but yielded at length; and the jolly fellow, well pleased with
      his acquisition, carried the portrait home with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he was gone, my father felt more calm. The burden seemed to have
      disappeared from his soul in company with the portrait. He was surprised
      himself at his evil feelings, his envy, and the evident change in his
      character. Reviewing his acts, he became sad at heart; and not without
      inward sorrow did he exclaim, 'No, it was God who punished me! my picture,
      in fact, was meant to ruin my brother-man. A devilish feeling of envy
      guided my brush, and that devilish feeling must have made itself visible
      in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He set out at once to seek his former pupil, embraced him warmly, begged
      his forgiveness, and endeavoured as far as possible to excuse his own
      fault. His labours continued as before; but his face was more frequently
      thoughtful. He prayed more, grew more taciturn, and expressed himself less
      sharply about people: even the rough exterior of his character was
      modified to some extent. But a certain occurrence soon disturbed him more
      than ever. He had seen nothing for a long time of the comrade who had
      begged the portrait of him. He had already decided to hunt him up, when
      the latter suddenly made his appearance in his room. After a few words and
      questions on both sides, he said, 'Well, brother, it was not without cause
      that you wished to burn that portrait. Devil take it, there's something
      horrible about it! I don't believe in sorcerers; but, begging your pardon,
      there's an unclean spirit in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How so?' asked my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, from the very moment I hung it up in my room I felt such
      depression&mdash;just as if I wanted to murder some one. I never knew in
      my life what sleeplessness was; but I suffered not from sleeplessness
      alone, but from such dreams!&mdash;I cannot tell whether they were dreams,
      or what; it was as if a demon were strangling one: and the old man
      appeared to me in my sleep. In short, I can't describe my state of mind. I
      had a sensation of fear, as if expecting something unpleasant. I felt as
      if I could not speak a cheerful or sincere word to any one: it was just as
      if a spy were sitting over me. But from the very hour that I gave that
      portrait to my nephew, who asked for it, I felt as if a stone had been
      rolled from my shoulders, and became cheerful, as you see me now. Well,
      brother, you painted the very Devil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "During this recital my father listened with unswerving attention, and
      finally inquired, 'And your nephew now has the portrait?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My nephew, indeed! he could not stand it!' said the jolly fellow: 'do
      you know, the soul of that usurer has migrated into it; he jumps out of
      the frame, walks about the room; and what my nephew tells of him is simply
      incomprehensible. I should take him for a lunatic, if I had not undergone
      a part of it myself. He sold it to some collector of pictures; and he
      could not stand it either, and got rid of it to some one else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This story produced a deep impression on my father. He grew seriously
      pensive, fell into hypochondria, and finally became fully convinced that
      his brush had served as a tool of the Devil; and that a portion of the
      usurer's vitality had actually passed into the portrait, and was now
      troubling people, inspiring diabolical excitement, beguiling painters from
      the true path, producing the fearful torments of envy, and so forth. Three
      catastrophes which occurred afterwards, three sudden deaths of wife,
      daughter, and infant son, he regarded as a divine punishment on him, and
      firmly resolved to withdraw from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as I was nine years old, he placed me in an academy of painting,
      and, paying all his debts, retired to a lonely cloister, where he soon
      afterwards took the vows. There he amazed every one by the strictness of
      his life, and his untiring observance of all the monastic rules. The prior
      of the monastery, hearing of his skill in painting, ordered him to paint
      the principal picture in the church. But the humble brother said plainly
      that he was unworthy to touch a brush, that his was contaminated, that
      with toil and great sacrifice must he first purify his spirit in order to
      render himself fit to undertake such a task. He increased the rigours of
      monastic life for himself as much as possible. At last, even they became
      insufficient, and he retired, with the approval of the prior, into the
      desert, in order to be quite alone. There he constructed himself a cell
      from branches of trees, ate only uncooked roots, dragged about a stone
      from place to place, stood in one spot with his hands lifted to heaven,
      from the rising until the going down of the sun, reciting prayers without
      cessation. In this manner did he for several years exhaust his body,
      invigorating it, at the same time, with the strength of fervent prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At length, one day he returned to the cloister, and said firmly to the
      prior, 'Now I am ready. If God wills, I will finish my task.' The subject
      he selected was the Birth of Christ. A whole year he sat over it, without
      leaving his cell, barely sustaining himself with coarse food, and praying
      incessantly. At the end of the year the picture was ready. It was a really
      wonderful work. Neither prior nor brethren knew much about painting; but
      all were struck with the marvellous holiness of the figures. The
      expression of reverent humility and gentleness in the face of the Holy
      Mother, as she bent over the Child; the deep intelligence in the eyes of
      the Holy Child, as though he saw something afar; the triumphant silence of
      the Magi, amazed by the Divine Miracle, as they bowed at his feet: and
      finally, the indescribable peace which emanated from the whole picture&mdash;all
      this was presented with such strength and beauty, that the impression it
      made was magical. All the brethren threw themselves on their knees before
      it; and the prior, deeply affected, exclaimed, 'No, it is impossible for
      any artist, with the assistance only of earthly art, to produce such a
      picture: a holy, divine power has guided thy brush, and the blessing of
      Heaven rested upon thy labour!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "By that time I had completed my education at the academy, received the
      gold medal, and with it the joyful hope of a journey to Italy&mdash;the
      fairest dream of a twenty-year-old artist. It only remained for me to take
      leave of my father, from whom I had been separated for twelve years. I
      confess that even his image had long faded from my memory. I had heard
      somewhat of his grim saintliness, and rather expected to meet a hermit of
      rough exterior, a stranger to everything in the world, except his cell and
      his prayers, worn out, tried up, by eternal fasting and penance. But how
      great was my surprise when a handsome old man stood before me! No traces
      of exhaustion were visible on his countenance: it beamed with the light of
      a heavenly joy. His beard, white as snow, and his thin, almost transparent
      hair of the same silvery hue, fell picturesquely upon his breast, and upon
      the folds of his black gown, even to the rope with which his poor monastic
      garb was girded. But most surprising to me of all was to hear from his
      mouth such words and thoughts about art as, I confess, I long shall bear
      in mind, and I sincerely wish that all my comrades would do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I expected you, my son,' he said, when I approached for his blessing.
      'The path awaits you in which your life is henceforth to flow. Your path
      is pure&mdash;desert it not. You have talent: talent is the most priceless
      of God's gifts&mdash;destroy it not. Search out, subject all things to
      your brush; but in all see that you find the hidden soul, and most of all,
      strive to attain to the grand secret of creation. Blessed is the elect one
      who masters that! There is for him no mean object in nature. In lowly
      themes the artist creator is as great as in great ones: in the despicable
      there is nothing for him to despise, for it passes through the purifying
      fire of his mind. An intimation of God's heavenly paradise is contained
      for the artist in art, and by that alone is it higher than all else. But
      by as much as triumphant rest is grander than every earthly emotion, by so
      much is the lofty creation of art higher than everything else on earth.
      Sacrifice everything to it, and love it with passion&mdash;not with the
      passion breathing with earthly desire, but a peaceful, heavenly passion.
      It cannot plant discord in the spirit, but ascends, like a resounding
      prayer, eternally to God. But there are moments, dark moments&mdash;' He
      paused, and I observed that his bright face darkened, as though some cloud
      crossed it for a moment. 'There is one incident of my life,' he said. 'Up
      to this moment, I cannot understand what that terrible being was of whom I
      painted a likeness. It was certainly some diabolical apparition. I know
      that the world denies the existence of the Devil, and therefore I will not
      speak of him. I will only say that I painted him with repugnance: I felt
      no liking for my work, even at the time. I tried to force myself, and,
      stifling every emotion in a hard-hearted way, to be true to nature. I have
      been informed that this portrait is passing from hand to hand, and sowing
      unpleasant impressions, inspiring artists with feelings of envy, of dark
      hatred towards their brethren, with malicious thirst for persecution and
      oppression. May the Almighty preserve you from such passions! There is
      nothing more terrible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He blessed and embraced me. Never in my life was I so grandly moved.
      Reverently, rather than with the feeling of a son, I leaned upon his
      breast, and kissed his scattered silver locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tears shone in his eyes. 'Fulfil my one request, my son,' said he, at the
      moment of parting. 'You may chance to see the portrait I have mentioned
      somewhere. You will know it at once by the strange eyes, and their
      peculiar expression. Destroy it at any cost.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judge for yourselves whether I could refuse to promise, with an oath, to
      fulfil this request. In the space of fifteen years I had never succeeded
      in meeting with anything which in any way corresponded to the description
      given me by my father, until now, all of a sudden, at an auction&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist did not finish his sentence, but turned his eyes to the wall in
      order to glance once more at the portrait. The entire throng of auditors
      made the same movement, seeking the wonderful portrait with their eyes.
      But, to their extreme amazement, it was no longer on the wall. An
      indistinct murmur and exclamation ran through the crowd, and then was
      heard distinctly the word, "stolen." Some one had succeeded in carrying it
      off, taking advantage of the fact that the attention of the spectators was
      distracted by the story. And those present long remained in a state of
      surprise, not knowing whether they had really seen those remarkable eyes,
      or whether it was simply a dream which had floated for an instant before
      their eyesight, strained with long gazing at old pictures.

    <h2>
      THE CALASH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The town of B&mdash;&mdash; had become very lively since a cavalry
      regiment had taken up its quarters in it. Up to that date it had been
      mortally wearisome there. When you happened to pass through the town and
      glanced at its little mud houses with their incredibly gloomy aspect, the
      pen refuses to express what you felt. You suffered a terrible uneasiness
      as if you had just lost all your money at play, or had committed some
      terrible blunder in company. The plaster covering the houses, soaked by
      the rain, had fallen away in many places from their walls, which from
      white had become streaked and spotted, whilst old reeds served to thatch
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a custom very common in the towns of South Russia, the chief of
      police has long since had all the trees in the gardens cut down to improve
      the view. One never meets anything in the town, unless it is a cock
      crossing the road, full of dust and soft as a pillow. At the slightest
      rain this dust is turned into mud, and then all the streets are filled
      with pigs. Displaying to all their grave faces, they utter such grunts
      that travellers only think of pressing their horses to get away from them
      as soon as possible. Sometimes some country gentleman of the
      neighbourhood, the owner of a dozen serfs, passes in a vehicle which is a
      kind of compromise between a carriage and a cart, surrounded by sacks of
      flour, and whipping up his bay mare with her colt trotting by her side.
      The aspect of the marketplace is mournful enough. The tailor's house
      sticks out very stupidly, not squarely to the front but sideways. Facing
      it is a brick house with two windows, unfinished for fifteen years past,
      and further on a large wooden market-stall standing by itself and painted
      mud-colour. This stall, which was to serve as a model, was built by the
      chief of police in the time of his youth, before he got into the habit of
      falling asleep directly after dinner, and of drinking a kind of decoction
      of dried goose-berries every evening. All around the rest of the
      market-place are nothing but palings. But in the centre are some little
      sheds where a packet of round cakes, a stout woman in a red dress, a bar
      of soap, some pounds of bitter almonds, some lead, some cotton, and two
      shopmen playing at "svaika," a game resembling quoits, are always to be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the arrival of the cavalry regiment everything changed. The streets
      became more lively and wore quite another aspect. Often from their little
      houses the inhabitants would see a tall and well-made officer with a
      plumed hat pass by, on his way to the quarters of one of his comrades to
      discuss the chances of promotion or the qualities of a new tobacco, or
      perhaps to risk at play his carriage, which might indeed be called the
      carriage of all the regiment, since it belonged in turn to every one of
      them. To-day it was the major who drove out in it, to-morrow it was seen
      in the lieutenant's coach-house, and a week later the major's servant was
      again greasing its wheels. The long hedges separating the houses were
      suddenly covered with soldiers' caps exposed to the sun, grey frieze
      cloaks hung in the doorways, and moustaches harsh and bristling as clothes
      brushes were to be met with in all the streets. These moustaches showed
      themselves everywhere, but above all at the market, over the shoulders of
      the women of the place who flocked there from all sides to make their
      purchases. The officers lent great animation to society at B&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society consisted up till then of the judge who was living with a deacon's
      wife, and of the chief of police, a very sensible man, but one who slept
      all day long from dinner till evening, and from evening till dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This general liveliness was still further increased when the town of B&mdash;&mdash;
      became the residence of the general commanding the brigade to which the
      regiment belonged. Many gentlemen of the neighbourhood, whose very
      existence no one had even suspected, began to come into the town with the
      intention of calling on the officers, or, perhaps, of playing bank, a game
      concerning which they had up till then only a very confused notion,
      occupied as they were with their crops and the commissions of their wives
      and their hare-hunting. I am very sorry that I cannot recollect for what
      reason the general made up his mind one fine day to give a grand dinner.
      The preparations were overwhelming. The clatter of knives in the kitchen
      was heard as far as the town gates. The whole of the market was laid under
      contributions, so much so that the judge and the deacon's wife found
      themselves obliged that day to be satisfied with hasty puddings and cakes
      of flour. The little courtyard of the house occupied by the general was
      crowded with vehicles. The company only consisted of men, officers and
      gentlemen of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst these latter was above all conspicuous Pythagoras Pythagoravitch
      Tchertokoutski, one of the leading aristocrats of the district of B&mdash;,
      the most fiery orator at the nobiliary elections and the owner of a very
      elegant turn-out. He had served in a cavalry regiment and had even passed
      for one of its most accomplished officers, having constantly shown himself
      at all the balls and parties wherever his regiment was quartered.
      Information respecting him may be asked of all the young ladies in the
      districts of Tamboff and Simbirsk. He would very probably have further
      extended his reputation in other districts if he had not been obliged to
      leave the service in consequence of one of those affairs which are spoken
      of as "a very unpleasant business." Had he given or received a blow? I
      cannot say with certainty, but what is indisputable is that he was asked
      to send in his resignation. However, this accident had no unpleasant
      effect upon the esteem in which he had been held up till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchertokoutski always wore a coat of a military cut, spurs and moustache,
      in order not to have it supposed that he had served in the infantry, a
      branch of the service upon which he lavished the most contemptuous
      expressions. He frequented the numerous fairs to which flock the whole of
      the population of Southern Russia, consisting of nursemaids, tall girls,
      and burly gentlemen who go there in vehicles of such strange aspect that
      no one has ever seen their match even in a dream. He instinctively guessed
      the spot in which a regiment of cavalry was to be found and never failed
      to introduce himself to the officers. On perceiving them he bounded
      gracefully from his light phaeton and soon made acquaintance with them. At
      the last election he had given to the whole of the nobility a grand dinner
      during which he declared that if he were elected marshal he would put all
      gentlemen on the best possible footing. He usually behaved after the
      fashion of a great noble. He had married a rather pretty lady with a dowry
      of two hundred serfs and some thousands of rubles. This money was at once
      employed in the purchase of six fine horses, some gilt bronze locks, and a
      tame monkey. He further engaged a French cook. The two hundred peasants of
      the lady, as well as two hundred more belonging to the gentleman, were
      mortgaged to the bank. In a word, he was a regular nobleman. Besides
      himself, several other gentlemen were amongst the general's guests, but it
      is not worth while speaking of them. The officers of the regiment, amongst
      whom were the colonel and the fat major, formed the majority of those
      present. The general himself was rather stout; a good officer,
      nevertheless, according to his subordinates. He had a rather deep bass
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was magnificent; there were sturgeons, sterlets, bustards,
      asparagus, quail, partridges, mushrooms. The flavour of all these dishes
      supplied an irrefutable proof of the sobriety of the cook during the
      twenty-four hours preceding the dinner. Four soldiers, who had been given
      him as assistants, had not ceased working all night, knife in hand, at the
      composition of ragouts and jellies. The immense quantity of long-necked
      bottles, mingled with shorter ones, holding claret and madeira; the fine
      summer day, the wide-open windows, the plates piled up with ice on the
      table, the crumpled shirt-fronts of the gentlemen in plain clothes, and a
      brisk and noisy conversation, now dominated by the general's voice, and
      now besprinkled with champagne, were all in perfect harmony. The guests
      rose from the table with a pleasant feeling of repletion, and, after
      having lit their pipes, all stepped out, coffee-cups in hand, on to the
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can see her now," said the general. "Here, my dear fellow," added he,
      addressing his aide-de-camp, an active well-made young officer, "have the
      bay mare brought here. You shall see for yourselves, gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the general took a long pull at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is not quite recovered yet; there is not a decent stable in this
      cursed little place. But she is not bad looking&mdash;" puff&mdash;puff,
      the general here let out the smoke which he had kept in his mouth till
      then&mdash;"the little mare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is long since your excellency&mdash;" puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff&mdash;"condescended
      to buy her?" asked Tchertokoutski.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff. "Not very long, I had her from the
      breeding establishment two years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did your excellency condescend to take her ready broken, or to have
      her broken in here yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff. "Here."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the general disappeared behind a cloud of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a soldier jumped out of the stable. The trampling of a
      horse's hoofs was heard, and another soldier with immense moustaches, and
      wearing a long white tunic, appeared, leading by the bridle the terrified
      and quivering mare, which, suddenly rearing, lifted him off his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Agrafena Ivanovna," said he, leading her towards the
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare's name was Agrafena Ivanovna. Strong and bold as a Southern
      beauty, she suddenly became motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general began to look at her with evident satisfaction, and left off
      smoking. The colonel himself went down the steps and patted her neck. The
      major ran his hand down her legs, and all the other officers clicked their
      tongues at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchertokoutski left the verandah to take up a position beside the mare.
      The soldier who held her bridle drew himself up and stared fixedly at the
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very fine, very fine," said Tchertokoutski, "a very well-shaped
      beast. Will your excellency allow me to ask whether she is a good goer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She goes well, but that idiot of a doctor, deuce take him, has given her
      some balls which have made her sneeze for the last two days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a fine beast, a very fine beast. Has your excellency a turn-out to
      match the horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn-out! but she's a saddle horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I put the question, your excellency, to know if you have an
      equipage worthy of your other horses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have not much in the way of equipages; I must admit that, for some
      time past, I have been wanting to buy a calash, such as they build
      now-a-days. I have written about it to my brother who is now at St.
      Petersburg, but I do not know whether he will be able to send me one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me, your excellency," remarked the colonel, "that there are
      no better calashes than those of Vienna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right." Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an excellent calash, your excellency, a real Viennese calash,"
      said Tchertokoutski.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That in which you came?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, I make use of that for ordinary service, but the other is
      something extraordinary. It is as light as a feather, and if you sit in
      it, it seems as if your nurse was rocking you in a cradle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very comfortable then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extremely comfortable; the cushions, the springs, and everything else are
      perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what a quantity of things can be packed away in it. I have never seen
      anything like it, your excellency. When I was still in the service there
      was room enough in the body to stow away ten bottles of rum, twenty pounds
      of tobacco, six uniforms, and two pipes, the longest pipes imaginable,
      your excellency; and in the pockets inside you could stow away a whole
      bullock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cost four thousand rubles, your excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be good at that price. Did you buy it yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, your excellency, I had it by chance. It was bought by one of my
      oldest friends, a fine fellow with whom you would be very well pleased. We
      are very intimate. What is mine is his, and what is his is mine. I won it
      of him at cards. Would your excellency have the kindness to honour me at
      dinner to-morrow? You could see my calash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to say. Alone I could not&mdash;but if you would allow
      me to come with these officers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of them to come too. I shall esteem it a great honour, gentlemen,
      to have the pleasure of seeing you at my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel, the major, and the other officers thanked Tchertokoutski.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am of opinion myself, your excellency, that if one buys anything it
      should be good; it is not worth the trouble of getting, if it turns out
      bad. If you do me the honour of calling on me to-morrow, I will show you
      some improvements I have introduced on my estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general looked at him, and puffed out a fresh cloud of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchertokoutski was charmed with his notion of inviting the officers, and
      mentally ordered in advance all manner of dishes for their entertainment.
      He smiled at these gentlemen, who on their part appeared to increase their
      show of attention towards him, as was noticeable from the expression of
      their eyes and the little half-nods they bestowed upon him. His bearing
      assumed a certain ease, and his voice expressed his great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency will make the acquaintance of the mistress of the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be most agreeable to me," said the general, twirling his
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchertokoutski was firmly resolved to return home at once in order to make
      all necessary preparations in good time. He had already taken his hat, but
      a strange fatality caused him to remain for some time at the general's.
      The card tables had been set out, and all the company, separating into
      groups of four, scattered itself about the room. Lights were brought in.
      Tchertokoutski did not know whether he ought to sit down to whist. But as
      the officers invited him, he thought that the rules of good breeding
      obliged him to accept. He sat down. I do not know how a glass of punch
      found itself at his elbow, but he drank it off without thinking. After
      playing two rubbers, he found another glass close to his hand which he
      drank off in the same way, though not without remarking:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really time for me to go, gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to play a fresh rubber. However, the conversation which was going
      on in every corner of the room took an especial turn. Those who were
      playing whist were quiet enough, but the others talked a great deal. A
      captain had taken up his position on a sofa, and leaning against a
      cushion, pipe in mouth, he captivated the attention of a circle of guests
      gathered about him by his eloquent narrative of amorous adventures. A very
      stout gentleman whose arms were so short that they looked like two
      potatoes hanging by his sides, listened to him with a very satisfied
      expression, and from time to time exerted himself to pull his
      tobacco-pouch out of his coat-tail pocket. A somewhat brisk discussion on
      cavalry drill had arisen in another corner, and Tchertokoutski, who had
      twice already played a knave for a king, mingled in the conversation by
      calling out from his place: "In what year?" or "What regiment?" without
      noticing that very often his question had no application whatever. At
      length, a few minutes before supper, play came to an end. Tchertokoutski
      could remember that he had won a great deal, but he did not take up his
      winnings, and after rising stood for some time in the position of a man
      who has no handkerchief in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down to supper. As might be expected, wine was not lacking, and
      Tchertokoutski kept involuntarily filling his glass with it, for he was
      surrounded with bottles. A lengthy conversation took place at table, but
      the guests carried it on after a strange fashion. A colonel, who had
      served in 1812, described a battle which had never taken place; and
      besides, no one ever could make out why he took a cork and stuck it into a
      pie. They began to break-up at three in the morning. The coachmen were
      obliged to take several of them in their arms like bundles; and
      Tchertokoutski himself, despite his aristocratic pride, bowed so low to
      the company, that he took home two thistles in his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman who drove him home found every one asleep. He routed out,
      after some trouble, the valet, who, after having ushered his master
      through the hall, handed him over to a maid-servant. Tchertokoutski
      followed her as well as he could to the best room, and stretched himself
      beside his pretty young wife, who was sleeping in a night-gown as white as
      snow. The shock of her husband falling on the bed awoke her&mdash;she
      stretched out her arms, opened her eyes, closed them quickly, and then
      opened them again quite wide, with a half-vexed air. Seeing that her
      husband did not pay the slightest attention to her, she turned over on the
      other side, rested her fresh and rosy cheek on her hand, and went to sleep
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late&mdash;that is, according to country customs&mdash;when the
      lady awoke again. Her husband was snoring more loudly than ever. She
      recollected that he had come home at four o'clock, and not wishing to
      awaken him, got up alone, and put on her slippers, which her husband had
      had sent for her from St. Petersburg, and a white dressing-gown which fell
      about her like the waters of a fountain. Then she passed into her
      dressing-room, and after washing in water as fresh as herself, went to her
      toilet table. She looked at herself twice in the glass, and thought she
      looked very pretty that morning. This circumstance, a very insignificant
      one apparently, caused her to stay two hours longer than usual before her
      glass. She dressed herself very tastefully and went into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was splendid: it was one of the finest days of the summer. The
      sun, which had almost reached the meridian, shed its most ardent rays; but
      a pleasant coolness reigned under the leafy arcades; and the flowers,
      warmed by the sun, exhaled their sweetest perfume. The pretty mistress of
      the house had quite forgotten that it was noon at least, and that her
      husband was still asleep. Already she heard the snores of two coachmen and
      a groom, who were taking their siesta in the stable, after having dined
      copiously. But she was still sitting in a bower from which the deserted
      high road could be seen, when all at once her attention was caught by a
      light cloud of dust rising in the distance. After looking at it for some
      moments, she ended by making out several vehicles, closely following one
      another. First came a light calash, with two places, in which was the
      general, wearing his large and glittering epaulettes, with the colonel.
      This was followed by another with four places, containing the captain, the
      aide-de-camp and two lieutenants. Further on, came the celebrated
      regimental vehicle, the present owner of which was the major, and behind
      that another in which were packed five officers, one on his comrade's
      knees, the procession being closed by three more on three fine bays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they coming here?" thought the mistress of the house. "Good heavens,
      yes! they are leaving the main road."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a cry, clasped her hands, and ran straight across the flower-beds
      to her bedroom, where her husband was still sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up! get up! get up at once," she cried, pulling him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What&mdash;what's the matter?" murmured Tchertokoutski, stretching his
      limbs without opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, get up. Visitors have come, do you hear? visitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Visitors, what visitors?" After saying these words he uttered a little
      plaintive grunt like that of a sucking calf: "M-m-m. Let me kiss you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, get up at once, for heaven's sake. The general has come with all
      his officers. Ah! goodness, you have got a thistle in your moustache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The general! Has he come already? But why the deuce did not they wake me?
      And the dinner, is the dinner ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But haven't I ordered a dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dinner! You got home at four o'clock in the morning and you did not
      answer a single word to all my questions. I did not wake you, since you
      had so little sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchertokoutski, his eyes staring out of his head, remained motionless for
      some moments as though a thunderbolt had struck him. All at once he jumped
      out of bed in his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idiot that I am," he exclaimed, clasping his hand to his forehead; "I had
      invited them to dinner. What is to be done? are they far off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will be here in a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, hide yourself. Ho there, somebody. Hi there, you girl. Come
      here, you fool; what are you afraid of? The officers are coming here; tell
      them I am not at home, that I went out early this morning, that I am not
      coming back. Do you understand? Go and repeat it to all the servants. Be
      off, quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having uttered these words, he hurriedly slipped on his dressing-gown, and
      ran off to shut himself up in the coach-house, which he thought the safest
      hiding-place. But he fancied that he might be noticed in the corner in
      which he had taken refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will be better," said he to himself, letting down the steps of the
      nearest vehicle, which happened to be the calash. He jumped inside, closed
      the door, and, as a further precaution, covered himself with the leather
      apron. There he remained, wrapped in his dressing-gown, in a doubled-up
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the equipages had drawn up before the porch. The general
      got out of his carriage and shook himself, followed by the colonel,
      arranging the feathers in his hat. After him came the stout major, his
      sabre under his arm, and the slim lieutenants, whilst the mounted officers
      also alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The master is not at home," said a servant appearing at the top of a
      flight of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! not at home; but he is coming home for dinner, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he is not; he has gone out for the day and will not be back till this
      time to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me," said the general; "but what the deuce&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a joke," said the colonel laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, such things are inconceivable," said the general angrily. "If he
      could not receive us, why did he invite us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot understand, your excellency, how it is possible to act in such a
      manner," observed a young officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said the general, who always made an officer under the rank of
      captain repeat his remarks twice over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wondered, your excellency, how any one could do such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so; if anything has happened he ought to have let us know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to be done, your excellency, we had better go back
      home," said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, there is nothing to be done. However, we can see the calash
      without him; probably he has not taken it with him. Come here, my man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does your excellency want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show us your master's new calash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have the kindness to step this way to the coach-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general entered the coach-house followed by his officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me pull it a little forward, your excellency," said the servant, "it
      is rather dark here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general and his officers walked around the calash, carefully
      inspecting the wheels and springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing remarkable about it," said the general; "it is a very
      ordinary calash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to look at," added the colonel; "there is absolutely nothing good
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me, your excellency, that it is not worth four thousand
      rubles," remarked a young officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said, your excellency, that I do not think that it is worth four
      thousand rubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four thousand! It is not worth two. Perhaps, however, the inside is well
      fitted. Unbutton the apron."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tchertokoutski appeared before the officers' eyes, clad in his
      dressing-gown and doubled up in a singular fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, there you are," said the astonished general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he covered Tchertokoutski up again and went off with his officers.
    </p>
    <p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
