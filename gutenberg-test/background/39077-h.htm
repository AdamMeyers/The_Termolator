<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span>,</p>

<p>The news from Ireland, not all of which finds its way into your daily
papers, grows in excitement. The exploit of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Douglas P-ne</span>, M.P., of Lisfinny Castle, has taken
root, and all the landed gentry among the Irish Members are fortifying
themselves in their castles, and hanging themselves outside the
front-door by ropes to deliver addresses to their constituents. The
regular thing now is to hang out our M.P.'s on the outer wall. I do not
see accounts of these proceedings in your London papers. I was, as you
know, a Journalist before I was Lord Mayor; so, if you don't mind, I'll
send you a few jottings. If there is anything due for lineage, please
remit it anonymously to the Land League Fund "From A Sympathiser."</p>

<p>Foremost in this band of heroic patriots is the <i>ch&acirc;telain</i> of
Butlerstown, <span class="smcap">Joseph G-ll-s B-gg-r</span>, M.P.,
Butlerstown Castle, as everyone acquainted with Ireland knows, stands on
the summit of a Danish rath, and was once the seat of an <span
class="smcap">O'Toole</span>. Now it is the den of <span
class="smcap">Joseph G-ll-s</span>. For some time he has been practising
a flying leap from the eastern to the western turret, a distance of
fifty feet over a yawning abyss, amid the cavernous depths of which the
petulant plummet has played in vain. It is thrilling, whether at early
dawn, or what time the darkening wing of Night begins to flap, to hear a
shrill cry of "Hear, hear!" to see a well-known figure cleaving the
astonished air, and to behold <span class="smcap">Joseph G-ll-s</span>,
erewhile upright on the eastern turret, prone on that which lifts its
head nearer the setting sun. To be present on one of the occasions when
<span class="smcap">Joey B</span>. reads a Blue Book for three hours to
a deputation shivering in the moat, is enough to convince the dullest
Saxon of the hopelessness of enthralling a nation which has given birth
to such as he. As <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> himself says,
quoting, with slight variation, my own immortal verse,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Whether on the turret high,</p>
<p>Or in the moat not dry,</p>
<p>What matter if for Ireland dear we talk!"</p>
</div>

<p>But the affairs at Butlerstown should not withdraw our gaze from a not
less momentous event which recently happened in the neighbourhood of
Cork city. Mr. <span class="smcap">P-rn-ll</span>, as he has recently
explained to you, has not found it expedient or even necessary to take
part in our recent public proceedings in Ireland. But this abstention is
to a certain extent illusory. It is no secret in our inner circles that
our glorious Chief was but the other day in close communication with his
constituents in the city of Cork. He arrived shortly after breakfast in
a balloon which was skilfully brought to pause over the rising ground by
Sunday's Well. At the approach of the balloon the trained intelligence
of the Police fathomed the plot. The Privy Council was immediately
communicated with. Sworn information was laid, and the meeting was
solemnly proclaimed by telegraph. In the meanwhile, Mr. <span
class="smcap">P-rn-ll</span> had addressed the meeting at some length
and met with an enthusiastic reception. The Police massing in
considerable numbers and beginning to b&acirc;ton the electors, the Hon.
Member poured a bag of ballast over them, and the balloon, gracefully
rising, disappeared in the direction of Limerick. The proceedings then
terminated.</p>

<p>I expect that the success of this new departure, or perhaps I should say
this unexpected arrival, will encourage our great Chief to pay a series
of flying visits to Ireland. His adventure was certainly happier and
more successful than one which befell our esteemed friend <span
class="smcap">Tim H-ly</span>, and nearly brought to an untimely
conclusion a life dear to us and of inestimable value to Ireland. <span
class="smcap">Tim</span> was announced to take the chair at a mass
meeting summoned under the auspices of the local branch of the Land
League of Longford. A room was taken, the word passed round, and all
preparations made for a successful meeting. The Police, however, got
wind of it, and of course the meeting was proclaimed. But <span
class="smcap">Tim</span>, as you may happen to know, is not the man to
have his purpose lightly set aside. It was made known that <span
class="smcap">Tim</span> would make his speech and the Police might
catch him if they could. You know, may be, the big factory in the
thriving town of Longford&mdash;the one with a tall chimbly? Well, the word
was passed along again that the bhoys were to assemble about the
factory. "Would they bring a chair or a table," they said, "for <span
class="smcap">Tim</span> to stand on?" "No," said <span
class="smcap">Tim</span>, wiping his spectacles, "you leave it to me."</p>

<p>Meeting announced to take place at eight o'clock. On the very strike of
the hour, a stentorian voice, not unfamiliar in the House of Commons,
floated over the assembled multitude. "Men of Longford," it said, "we
are assembled here in the exercise of our privilege as free men." First
of all they could not tell where the voice came from. Looking up,
behold! there was <span class="smcap">Tim</span> planted inside the top
of the tall chimbley, using it like a Bishop's pulpit. It was a capital
idea, and worked admirably for half an hour, with the Police all
throbbing and raging round, and <span class="smcap">Tim</span> eyeing
them quite calmly, and all the crowd roaring and cheering, and throwing
up their hats, and <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span> getting it hot.
Somehow, whether from treachery or accident no one knows, and perhaps
never will know, but in the middle of one of his best sentences, <span
class="smcap">Tim</span> suddenly vanished from sight, and was a clear
three minutes later picked up from among the cinders in the furnace
below. The proceedings then terminated.</p>

<p>There is a good deal more I could tell you, <span
class="smcap">Toby</span>, my bhoy, if time permitted. I should like
above all to tell you of Major <span class="smcap">O'G-rm-n</span>'s
magnificent oration delivered from the main shaft of the sewer in
Waterford, with his former constituents hanging on his lips and the
grate of the sewer. But I am just off myself to address a meeting of my
fellow citizens. This too, is of course, proclaimed, and equally of
course that makes no difference. I get on the top of the Lord Mayor's
coach, leaning on the Mace, and supported by the Sword-bearer. The
horses move at walking pace, and I address the crowd. It's wonderful
what a lot one can take out of <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span> that
way.</p>

<h2>BISHOP AND PORT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>In my Autobiography, which I am glad and proud to say, has met with your
cordial approbation, I have recorded how the late lamented Bishop, Dr.
<span class="smcap">Sumner</span>, said to me, "I have drunk a bottle of
port wine every day since I was a boy." Well, his son, the Archdeacon,
is annoyed at this statement. Now, my memory is a very good one, and if
I am wrong in one point so circumstantially narrated, why not in
several, why not in all? If the Bishop did not say this, to me, <i>who
did</i>? Somebody said it, that I will swear. Who said it? If my memory
fails me, is it not also likely that the Bishop's memory was not
particularly good, and consequently, that he was mistaken in thinking
that he had drunk a bottle a day since his boyhood? I have little doubt
that the Bishop only imagined it, and perhaps he was joking. Perhaps he
was playing on the words "bishop" and "port." "Bishop" was a hot drink,
I fancy, made with port wine. I have no hesitation in comforting his
Archidiaconal offspring by assuring him that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, his father, the Bishop, did not drink a bottle of
port every day since his boyhood. He was a very fine old clergyman&mdash;I
forget whether he was exactly portly or not, or whether he resided in
Portman Square,&mdash;and I should say that first-rate port, such as the
<i>elixir vit&aelig;</i> that made a hale centenarian of Sir <span
class="smcap">Moses Montefiore</span>, taken frequently, would have
tended to make him the genial prelate he was. Had he only gone into port
once, that would not have sufficed to have produced such a Bishop, for
"One swallow does not make a <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>."

<span class="author">Yours ever,<span class="i6 smcap">W(ithdraw) P(ort) Frith</span>.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The Archdeacon is satisfied, and if he will only come round to see
me and bring a bottle of the port the Bishop didn't drink, why, on my
word as an artist, <i>I'll draw the cork</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>What shall he have who kills the Deer</i>?" Why, something to eat,
of course. At least this was, among others, the notion of the poor
starving Cottars. And they have now given up venison-eating because the
food is deer.</p>

<h2>ROBERT AT KILBURN.</h2>

<p>I had the cureosity one day to arsk a lerned gennelman on whom I was
waiting, whether the poor fellers who lived in the world ever so many
hundred years ago had got any Copperashuns. He pretended not to
understand me at fust, and said, with a larf, as he dared say as they
was made much as we was; that is to say, sum with large ones, and some
with little ones; but when I xplained what I reely meant, he told me as
they had, speshally amung the Romuns as lived in Ittaly. He was a werry
amusing Gent, and when I arsked him what langwidge the Romuns torked, he
tried to gammon me as they all spoke Latin, ewen the little children and
all, but in coarse I wasn't quite such a hignoramus as to swaller that,
as my son <span class="smcap">William</span>, who isn't by no means a
fool, learnt Latin at Skool for three year and tells me as he carn't
speak it a bit. The lerned gent also told me as it was such a rum tung
to speak that they hadn't not no word for "Yes!" So that if a Gent of
those long days had bin a dining at the "Ship and Turtle" an bin a
waited on by an Hed Waiter, like me, and had said to him "Woud you like
arf-a-crown, Waiter?" the pore feller woodn't have been able to say,
"Yessir!" I was jest a leetle shocked at his torking such rubbish to me,
it was hardly respekful, speshally as he had ony drunk one pint of
Bollinger and one of our 63 Port, but its astonishing how heasily sum
peeple's heds is affected. I was in hopes as he woud have tried the
experymint on me, but he didn't, but went smiling away.</p>

<p>I shood werry much have liked to have heard a good deal more about them
werry old Copperashuns, and weather they was to be compared to that
werry old 'un as I nose so well and respecs so ighly, for good deeds as
well as good living. Take their werry last one as a sample. Earing of
what was a going on down at Kilburn on Guy Fox day, and finding as the
return train would bring me back in time for my perfeshnal dooties, I
went there and found thowsands of peeple all met in a nice little new
Park, that the old <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> was a coming
down to fust of all crissen, and then throw open to the publick. And
down he came accordingly in his full state Carridge, and his full state
Footmen, and his full state Sherryiffs, and their full state Carridges
and Footmen, jest for all the world as if he was a going to make a call
on a few Royal Princes and Dooks, insted of opening a new Park
surrounded by numbers of the reel working-classes. But he always has bin
a reel gennelman, and never makes no difference atween rich and poor
when he can do some good. I wasn't quite near enuff to hear what he said
when he made his speech, but a werry respectable reporter arterwards
told me, that the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> had written a
letter to <span class="smcap">Queen Wictoria</span> to ask if he might
call the Park after her. And she had wrote to him in reply, "Deer <span
class="smcap">Handsum</span>, as there's alreddy a Wictoria Park, you
may call this here one the Qween's Park. Pleas to remember this 5th of
Nowember, Yours trewly, W. R. I."</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> enounced this pleasing
intelligence, thus simply exprest, lorks how we did all cheer, and a
little band that had bin hid in a little tent, struck up the hole of arf
a werse of <i>God Save the Queen</i>, at which we all took off our hats,
footmen and all, and braved the bitter blarst with our bare heds. Ah,
that's wot I calls trew loyalty, and long may it continue, not the cold
bitter blarst, but the warm sweet loyalty, for I'm sorry to say as the
unusual xposure guv me a bad cold.</p>

<p>I got back just in time for the Bankwet. The <span class="smcap">Lord
Mare</span> with his usual kindness had let the Chairman of the
Committee, the sillibrated Mr. <span class="smcap">Woodbacon</span>, the
grate bookseller, take the Chair, and a remarkabul good un he made,
setting so good a xample as regards short speeches as made ewerybody
follow suit.</p>

<p>And now what was this hole proceeding all about? This is what I learnt
from what was said:&mdash;</p>

<p>It wood seem then, that at Kilburn where it was wunce all green feelds,
there has growed up a reglar crowd of working peeple with far more than
their fair share of children and as the feelds has all come for to be
bilt over, the poor little children afoursaid have been obleeged to do
their playing in the streets, and the nateral or rather unnateral
consequence has follered, as that numbers of the poor little deers was
run over and killed. So a nice little Park has been made for 'em all to
play in, where they can injoy their fresh hair and releeve their poor
Mother's minds, and grow up red and strong and harty, instead of white
and weak and wan. And the old Copperashun having put it all ship shape,
and promist to keep it all in order for hever, arsked the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> to go down and open it, as he did, and in
sitch full state that one of the natives said as it was like a lot of
sunbeams suddenly cumming out on a clowdy day. So the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> finished his long list of good deeds by
adding one more to 'em, and the Copperashun added one more Open Space to
the many they has either secured or helped to secure. So wenever I hears
a sneer at 'em I shall say, "Please to remember that 5th of November!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Important Summing-up.</span> (<i>By Our Own
Special Reporter in the recent case of Somebody or Other v. Another
Person of the name of</i> <span class="smcap">Barley</span>).&mdash;Mr.
Justice <span class="smcap">Mathew</span> regretted being compelled to
decide against <span class="smcap">Barley</span> on the question of
"quantities." Of course, there had been an error on the part of the
highly respectable Corporation of Ramsgate, which might be characterised
as a "sin of commission," while the neglect of their clerk to enter
their arrangement with <span class="smcap">Barley</span> on the minutes
was a "sin of omission." All the witnesses in this case must be
believed, as they had, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of <span
class="smcap">Barley</span>, taken their oats&mdash;he should say their
oaths. Perhaps when the present statute came to be revised, Mr. <span
class="smcap">Barley</span> might act for the town, for which it appears
he had done good service, and <span class="smcap">Barley</span> would

<h2>TOM BROWN &amp; CO.'S SCHOOL DAYS.</h2>

<h3><i>A Glimpse at the Commercial Education of the Future</i>.</h3>

<p>Twelve o'Clock struck, and the Fourth Form at St. Dunstan's
left its class-room with a rush. The old hour of leaving off the
morning's studies was still preserved. Yet, in conformity with the
spirit of the times, the venerable foundation of St. Dunstan's had
recently witnessed great changes. The Governing Body had taken
the matter in hand, and had gone to work with a will. The teaching
of Greek and Latin had been entirely suppressed, polite literature
eliminated, and the whole curriculum of the school arranged
solely to the provision of that glaring want of the times, a sound
commercial education. To effect this, some radical changes had
been necessary. The Rev. <span class="smcap">Jabez Plumkin</span>, D.D.,
Oxford Prizeman,
through whose unwearied exertions, for the past five-and-twenty
years, St. Dunstan's had been gradually acquiring an increasing
fame in the Class-lists of both Universities, had been forcibly ejected
from the Head-Mastership, and his place filled by a leading member
of a well-known firm of advertising stock-jobbers, and the
Assistant-Masters
had all been selected on similar lines.</p>

<p>"Company-floating," was taught by a late Promoter, who had had
much experience in the creation of many bubble concerns, and
"Rigging the Market" was entrusted to a Professor who was known,
in his capacity as Accountant to a wholesale City Cheese Warehouse,
to have contracted a thorough familiarity with this important subject
of the new commercial education. Everything was done to foster
a spirit of keen speculative enterprise in the boys. The whole
traditions of the school were changed. The old idea of honour had
died out. How to over-reach each other by sharp practice was the
one idea that animated every youthful breast from the senior in the
Sixth to the junior in the Under Third. The tape was always working
at the Principal's desk. The study-tables were covered with
Stock and Mining Journals. Even the playground was turned into
a Money Market. Cricket had been banished to make way for the
more exciting game of "Bulls and Bears," and the Principal passing
through occasionally, would sometimes stop and say, "That's right,
my boys, learn to do each other, and remember the motto of your
School, 'Monies maketh man.'" Posted up upon the gates, communicated
by telegraph hourly from the City, were every day to be
found the latest prices. And it was to get a first look at this that
the Fourth Form had just left its class-room with a rush.</p>

<p>A crowd of eager faces were anxiously scanning the latest quotations,
and notes were being taken in a score of pocket-books, whipped
out for the purpose. <span class="smcap">Tom Brown &amp; Co.</span>&mdash;he had
earned this <i>sobriquet</i>
from his companions for his shrewd business capacity&mdash;did not,
however, join the throng, but stood a little way off, looking on, and
waiting for the excitement to abate. Gradually it calmed down, and
the boys broke up into little knots and groups, discussing the state
of the market. Then he spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, you fellows," he said, "I've got a good thing on here,
that, I fancy, will be more worth your attention than even the latest
prices." He pulled a prospectus from his pocket. An interested
crowd closed round him at once. "It's 'Old Mother <span
class="smcap">Noggins</span>,
Limited,'" he went on, reading from the paper before him, "This
Company has been started for the purpose of acquiring at wholesale
prices all the tarts, bull's-eyes, apples, toffy, and ginger-beer,
forming the present stock-in-trade of Old Mother <span
class="smcap">Noggins's</span> store,
and for retailing the same at a figure, that will, after paying the
guaranteed interest on the fourpenny debenture shares, admit of the
declaration of a dividend of 14 per cent. on the ordinary paid-up
share capital of the Company.</p>

<p>A buzz of excited admiration went up from the throng. The Fourth
Form at St. Dunstan's had not for a long time had such a good thing
put before it.</p>

<p>"I know," continued <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, producing a bundle
of forms of application
from his pocket, "that you fellows, would like to hear of it.
Who'll go for it?"</p>

<p>There was a loud responsive shout of "I!" and a dozen hands were
at once stretched towards the speaker. Business commenced, and
sixpences, shillings, and half-crowns were pouring into <span
class="smcap">Tom's</span> pockets
faster than he could cram them there. He was making a very good
morning's work of it. Presently, a dull, heavy-looking boy joined
the group.</p>

<p>"Hullo, <span class="smcap">Flopper</span>!" cried <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>, addressing this last arrival, "why
don't you put that ten bob your Uncle sent you into this thing? I'll
be bound he told you to turn it over. You won't get such a chance
every day."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked <span class="smcap">Flopper</span>.</p>

<p>A chorus of voices instantly joined in a brief explanation of the
advantages of investing in "Old Mother <span
class="smcap">Noggins'</span> Limited."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said <span class="smcap">Flopper</span>, "I don't know that I
won't."</p>

<p>"Not if I know it," cried an authoritative voice, breaking in upon
the scene. It was <span class="smcap">Snagsby</span>, the "Sharper" who
spoke. There was a
general look in his direction, and a disposition to make way for
him as he approached. He had been mixed up disadvantageously
in a recent "corner" in marbles, and had from time to time floated
several concerns that had never paid any dividends, and was generally
regarded as a "queer" customer in consequence. It was for
this reason that he had been nicknamed the "Sharper."</p>

<p>"And what do you want him to do with his money?" asked <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>, stepping forward in a defiant attitude.</p>

<p>"He'll put every blessed halfpenny of it into my 'General Pen-knife
Supply,'" was the laconic reply. "He signed for the allotment
last night."</p>

<p>"But I've changed my mind," pleaded <span class="smcap">Flopper</span>,
helplessly, and
he handed the half-sovereign to <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>"You give that up!" cried the Sharper, menacingly.</p>

<p>"You try to take it!" replied <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, grimly.</p>

<p>In another instant the Sharper had flown at <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>. There was a
brief struggle. <span class="smcap">Tom</span> hit out at him, and
caught him in the face.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your game, is it!" shouted the Sharper. "You'll
fight me for that."</p>

<p>"Fight you? When and where you like," replied <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>There was a general cheering and throwing up of hats.</p>

<p>"Hooray! There's going to be a fight between the Sharper and
<span class="smcap">Tom Brown &amp; Co.</span>," shouted the Fourth Form.
They hadn't had
such good news for a long time.</p>

<hr />

<p>The whole School was there, and the third round had been fought.
Betting had been fast and furious, and there had been several
attempts made by the supporters of both champions to break the
ring and put an end to the contest when the fortunes of the day
seemed to be going against their own special favourite. But now a
curious thing happened. After a little preliminary sparring in the
fourth round, <span class="smcap">Tom Brown &amp; Co.</span>, suddenly dropping
on one knee, went to the ground.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the surprising news was known that he had given
in. The sponge was thrown up, and the Sharper declared the victor.
<span class="smcap">Tom</span> was quickly surrounded by his friends,
and led off the field.
<span class="smcap">Flopper</span> ran up to him. "I'm so sorry, <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>," he said, "that you
should have fought in my quarrel, and have got licked."</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in <span class="smcap">Tom's</span> eye. "My dear
fellow," he replied.
"Don't imagine I wouldn't have thrashed him; but business
is business, and I got a good price for not doing so. Didn't you
twig that <i>I sold the fight</i>?"</p>

<hr />

<p>That night <span class="smcap">Tom Brown &amp; Co.</span> wrote home an
enthusiastic account
of his day's doings to his parents. The next morning, <span
class="smcap">Tom Brown</span>,
Senior, referring to the letter with a glow of pride on his commercial
face, remarked to his better-half that the boy's training seemed
perfect,
and that he was destined to turn out remarkably well. "I can't
tell you," he added, "how I long to see that boy loose upon the
Stock Exchange. He will be a credit to the family."</p>

<p>What can be more dismal than the fourth day of a Fancy Bazaar for a
"Sale of Work," in aid of a parochial charity? Honestly, I do not know.
I fancy that even the proverbial "Mute at a funeral," must be livelier.
That is my present opinion, and it was the same last Thursday, when
lured by a programme quaintly printed in "old-faced" type, and having
"ye" in lieu of "the," and "Maister" instead of Mister, I made my way to
the Portman Rooms in Baker Street, (formerly Madame <span
class="smcap">Tussaud's</span>) and sought admission to "Old Marybone
Gardens, A.D. 1670." Outside the ex
<i>dep&ocirc;t</i> of Waxworks, were two persons in the costume of the last
Century distributing circulars, and later on I met another couple
similarly apparelled heading a procession of Sandwich-men walking down
Waterloo Place. In the Hall of the Bazaar lads in the same sort of
dresses, were selling programmes (marked sixpence) for twopence. I
entered by a small canvass-cottage "y'clept" (as the Sale of Workers
would call it) "the Rose of Normandy," and found myself in the once
famous "Hall of Kings" without the figures. I discovered two or three
dwarf trees, some lattice-work and a lot of canvass-covering. I must
confess it did not cause me much surprise to find only a few spectators.
The moment I appeared, a lady advanced and asked me in a tone of
authority to take a button-hole. I refused with courtesy suggestive at
once of the gallant and the miser, and the Sale of Work-woman retired
rather crest-fallen. Then two girls, costumed as two females of a past
but vague period, dashed at me as I turned away, and breathlessly
explained that if I bought a half-crown ticket I should be entitled to a
chance in a raffle for a five-guinea sofa-cushion. I slightly frowned as
I expeditiously refused the invitation, and the ladies disappeared into
a corner&mdash;I trust more in sorrow than in anger&mdash;to read the evening
paper. In the centre of the room was a "fish pond" full of presents,
where a mild-looking curate was feebly attempting to secure a prize. On
the whole the entertainment was scarcely exhilarating. The programme
promised "from V to VI of ye clocke" (how silly!) "a <i>s&eacute;ance</i> of
Mesmerism," in two "partes," (how really stupid!) and "Maister <span
class="smcap">Charles Bertram</span>" (Why "Maister?") was to appear
later on. Then at eight "of ye clocke" (dear, dear! <i>how</i> idiotic!)
"the Welbeck Dramatic Club" (what a name!) was "to performe ye Comic
Drama by <span class="smcap">L. S. Buckingham</span>, y'clept" (of
course!) "<i>Take that Girl away</i>." Later still "Mistresse <span
class="smcap">Jarley</span>" was to give her waxworks with the
assistance of "Maister <span class="smcap">Sidney Ward</span>," (tut,
tut!) the Festival finally closing with "Music" at "X of ye clocke"
(stuff and nonsense!). It will be seen that I cannot even now look at
the programme (priced at sixpence and sold for twopence) without some
signs of impatience. The afternoon was too young to allow of my
assisting at any of these toothsome merry-makings, so after mooning
about for a quarter of an hour I came away. As I left, a newly-arrived
dame of mature years was putting on a nurse's cap hurriedly, evidently
with the view to starting in hot pursuit of me to secure my custom for
some toys. The ladies with the cushion looked at me languidly as I
passed them, and then returned to a perusal of their paper. When last I
had had the advantage of paying a visit to "the Portman Rooms, formerly
Mme. <span class="smcap">Tussaud's</span>," I had seen nothing but
waxwork figures in eccentric attitudes. On the whole, I think the former
denizens of the place looked more at home in their quaint costumes than
the Sale of Workers "from Tuesday, November 22 to Saturday, November 26,
inclusive!"</p>

<p>Finding myself in its neighbourhood, I could not help taking a turn in
the present palace of the eminent "Portrait Modellist." I paid the
necessary shilling and the optional sixpence, and renewed my
acquaintance with "The Kings and Queens," "The Coronation Group," and
"The Chamber of Horrors." A group representing a reception at the
Vatican was quite new, if I except two or three funeral attendants, who,
I fancy I remember, made their last (but one) appearance at the Lying in
State of <span class="smcap">Pio Nono</span>. After examining a rather
cheerful presentment of the latest assassin in "The Chamber of
Comparative Physiognomy" (as the Chamber of Horrors was once, for a
short period, "y'clept"), I passed through a turnstile, and entered the
Refreshment Department. Here I noticed that an "overflow meeting,"
consisting, amongst other more-or-less-interesting exhibits of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Lewis Wingfield's</span> historical costume-wearers (from
the Healtheries), and that now rather-imperfectly-remembered worthy, the
late Sir <span class="smcap">Bartle Frere</span> (from the rooms above),
had been humorously arranged, no doubt with a view to provoking healthy
and hearty laughter. Having refreshed my mind with a hurried inspection
of this delightful, albeit, somewhat miscellaneous gathering, and my
body with a twopenny Bath bun, I gracefully retired, greatly pleased
with the afternoon's entertainment.</p>

<p>What a set these Emperors, Empresses, Kings, Queens, Princes and
Princesses, Dukes and Duchesses, &amp;c., &amp;c., and all such great people
everywhere seem to have been, according to the <i>Memoirs of Count
Horace de Viel Castel</i> (published by Messrs. <span
class="smcap">Remington &amp; Co.</span>), who was a kind of small French
<span class="smcap">Pepys</span>, a great snob, and a Parisian <i>Sir
Benjamin Backbite</i>. Yet there is in this <span
class="smcap">Horace</span> something of the Horatian satirist, only
without the poetry.</p>

<p><span class="small">"But <span class="smcap">Horace</span>, Sir, was delicate, was nice,"</span>

which is not exactly the characteristic of the writings of <span
class="smcap">M. de Viel</span> Castel, who tells us</p>

<div class="poem">
            <p class="i6">"Of birth-nights, balls, and shows,</p>
<p>More than ten <span class="smcap">Hollinsheds</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Halls</span>, or <span class="smcap">Stowes</span>.</p>
<p>When the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> frowned, or smiled, he knows; and what</p>
<p>A subtle Minister may make of that:</p>
<p>Who sins with whom:"&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>And such like tittle-tattle <i>ad nauseam</i>, not sparing his own
father and brother. Imagine the sort of man who, night after night,
could sit down and chuckle over the composition of this precious diary!
"With the exception of the President and the Princess" (<span
class="smcap">Mathilde</span>, at whose house he was perpetually
dining), he says, "all the (<span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span>)
family are good for nothing."</p>

<p>Of the <i>bourgeois</i> class he writes, "They are always the same
stupid, craven-hearted, vain race." He was shocked at the production of
<i>La Dame aux Camelias</i>, and considered it as a degradation of the
French stage and a disgrace to the Public that patronised the
performance. To have shocked M. <span class="smcap">de Viel
Castel</span> was a feat indeed. <span class="smcap">Fould</span> "the
foxy Jew" got ten millions out of the Cr&eacute;dit Foncier; so the public was
fool'd also. <span class="smcap">D'Orsay</span> was "a ridiculous old
doll," and the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span> "an old
fool." He sneered at England, but considered at the moment that an
alliance with us was the best policy. The Empress at one time went in
for spirit-rapping, and consulted a table which told her a variety of
lies about the result and duration of the Crimean War. Such a table must
have been very black and supported by blacklegs, though it had
sufficient french polish about it to be silent in the presence of a
bishop. It is not until the last page of the <i>Memoirs</i>, 1864, that
the name of M. <span class="smcap">de Bismarck</span> appears. I suppose
that "Society," high, low, or middle-class, has always gone on in much
the same way, more or less openly, according to the spirit of the Court,
since what is called "Society" came into existence; and invariably with
a <span class="smcap">Viel Castel</span>, or a <span
class="smcap">Greville</span>, or some one even less particular and more
observant "among them takin' notes" for future publication. Mr.
Bousfield, the translator, seems to have done his work with a judicious
regard for a certain section of English readers. It strikes me that he
has had the good taste to omit a few anecdotes about some of our own
exalted personages which would not have been received with unmixed
satisfaction in every quarter. This is only a surmise on my part, as I
am unacquainted with the original work.</p>

<p>Let me recommend everyone who values a powerful study of character more
than a merely cleverly-constructed story, to read <i>Marzio's
Crucifix</i>, by <span class="smcap">Marion Crawford</span>. I do not
know what special opportunities the author had for the work, but the
characters are individually, masterpieces. The scene between
<i>Marzio</i> and <i>Don Paolo</i>, when the latter is wrapt in devout
contemplation of the artist's <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, is most striking,
and would have been more so had <i>Marzio</i> carried out his intention
of knocking his brother down, and disposing of him out of hand.</p>

<p>With Mr. <span class="smcap">Saunders's</span> <i>The Story of some
Famous Books</i> (<span class="smcap">Elliot Stock</span>) I was rather
disappointed, in consequence of there not being enough "famous books,"
and not much more story than the needy knife-grinder had to tell. Still,
I thank him for introducing me to a delightful name&mdash;"<span
class="smcap">Theopompus</span> of Chios"&mdash;whom, for this present, I
will take as my godfather, and sign myself,
<span class="author">Yours,     <span class="i6 smcap">Theopompus, Baron de Book Worms</span>.</span> </p>

<h2>HOW TO ESCAPE THE FOG.</h2>

<p>Fogs? Nonsense! Fogs are always mist. And the way to miss them is to go
to the Institute of Painters in Oil. That will oil the wheels of life in
this atrociously hibernal weather, and make existence in a fog
enjoyable. There, in the well-warmed, pleasantly-lighted rooms, will you
find countless pleasant pictures&mdash;delightful sea-subjects, charming
landscapes, and amusing scenes, by accomplished painters, which will
infuse a little Summer into the dull, depressing, brumous, filthy
atmosphere of a weary London Winter. If you cannot get away to Monte
Carlo, Mentone, Nice, or Rome, hasten at once and take one of Sir <span
class="smcap">John Linton's</span> excursion <i>coupons</i>, and
personally conduct yourself&mdash;if you don't conduct yourself as you ought,
you'll probably be turned out&mdash;round the well-filled galleries in
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Seal making a Deep Impression.</p>
</div>

<p>I've no particular reason to think an account of my life will interest
anybody. That being so, I don't know why I write it. But I do. I suppose
it's Chance. <span class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> (who <i>is</i> such fun!)
calls my Memoir, because I'm a F.R.S., a case of "<i>Fellow-De-Se</i>."</p>

<p>Talking of Chance, everything that has ever happened to me <i>has</i>
been Chance!</p>

<p>For instance, what could have been more a matter of luck than my
choosing a house at Down? <span class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> says
something about being "Down on my luck." (What a master of style old
<span class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> is, to be sure!)</p>

<p>Then there was that voyage on the <i>Sea-Mew</i>. If it hadn't been that
my Uncle kicked me six times round his garden at Shrewsbury, because I
said "I'd be jiggered if I went," I don't believe I should ever have had
courage to accept the appointment of Naturalist to the expedition. That
voyage gave me an object in life. My nose had <i>made</i> me an object
in life before that (<i>vide Portrait</i>), but Natural Selection
triumphed over my nose, and so I became in due time famous, and an
Ag-nose-tic!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Schooldays.</span></h3>

<p>At school I was an exceptionally naughty boy. I cannot conceive what
induced me to tell another little boy that I had often produced
crab-apples by taking a dead crab and burying it in an orchard, but I
did. My little friend, I recollect, didn't believe me, and indeed pulled
my nose (always a sore point with me, but he made its point much sorer)
for telling what he called "beastly crams." We had a fight, I also
remember. Perhaps I ought to call it a "struggle for existence." He was
much the "fittest," and he survived. <i>I</i> got licked.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Choice of Calling.</span></h3>

<p>My extreme naughtiness continued unabated when I became a young man.
Nobody expected I should ever "do" anything&mdash;except six months' hard
labour! At Cambridge I was so shockingly "rowdy," that my father
declared, there was no alternative but to send me into the Church. But
as I was hunting with the College drag at the hour when I ought to have
been in for my Ordination Examination, the Bishop failed to see matters
in the same light. I then decided to be a Doctor. If I had stuck to this
profession I fancy that my turn for trying experiments would have landed
me in some exalted position&mdash;possibly at Newgate. As it was, after
attending a lecture on Surgery, I was discovered in the local Hospital
trying to cut off a patient's leg on an entirely new principle, with a
pair of scissors and an old meat-saw, and I was nearly "run in" for
manslaughter. I decided to give up Medicine, and a slight shindy over a
supposed error of mine in calculating a score having prevented my
becoming a success as a Public-house Billiard-marker, I thought I would
make my mark in another way, as a breeder of race-horses. Being,
however, forcibly chucked out of Newmarket Heath one day for an alleged
irregularity which I never could understand, I began really to wonder
what profession I <i>was</i> fitted to adorn.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">I become a Naturalist.</span></h3>

<p>It was at this time that the Captain of the <i>Sea-Mew</i> offered me
that post of which I have before spoken. I accepted it, and began at
once to lower the record in sea-sickness, being never once well on board
ship <i>for three whole years</i>! It was a new experience, and altered
me a good deal. From being rowdy and idle I became quiet and abnormally
diligent. If you don't believe this, ask <span
class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> (who is such fun!). On returning to England
I at once settled Down, and began to write books.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The "Origin of Species."</span></h3>

<p>This work is my title to fame. It only took me thirty-three years and
six months to write. I felt quite glad when it was finished. People who
have read it tell me they feel the same, The row it caused was
frightful! If you want to see "<span class="smcap">Soapy Sam's</span>"
slashing <i>Quarterly Review</i> article pulverised, read <span
class="smcap">H-xl-y's</span> reply. (But, query&mdash;isn't this scientific
log-rolling?) The remark which was made, after perusing the book, by
that eminent Botanist, my friend Professor <span
class="smcap">Hookey</span>, was&mdash;"Walker!" But he was soon converted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Way of Working.</span></h3>

<p>This, also, can't interest anybody, yet I give it. I get up at 4 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and take a walk. From 7 to 10 I work. After
dinner&mdash;with champagne&mdash;I take another stroll. I have made most
astonishing scientific discoveries at this time. I could, point out the
exact spot in the road where I became convinced that <i>the whole
country had been elevated sixteen feet since the morning</i>! <span
class="smcap">H-xl-y</span>, who was with me, quite agreed, and said
that we must all have been elevated at the same time, without knowing
it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Favourite Authors.</span></h3>

<p>These are, of course, <span class="smcap">Lyell</span> on <i>Lias</i>,
and <span class="smcap">Hookey</span> on <i>Herbaceous Foraminifera</i>.
They are far superior to <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, who
bores me. I like novels, the trashier the better. Only let 'em end well,
and I don't care how they begin, or whether they begin at all. In
newspapers, the best part, I think, is the Parliamentary Debates. In
reading them I have often got valuable hints as to the "Origin of
Speeches," and they frequently afford conclusive evidence of the
"Descent of Man." I thought of bringing Parliamentary manners in as a
chapter in my book on "Earth-worms," but <span
class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> advised me not to, and I didn't.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Nose.</span></h3>

<p>I think I've mentioned this feature before. It troubles me. It is
undoubtedly of a low type, yet it has survived! Why have I not been
fitted with a fitter one? It is another instance of the fact that
everything&mdash;including my fame&mdash;has come to me by sheer luck. <span
class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> says "there's a Dar-winning modesty about
this last remark." Also says, "I've found the 'Philosopher's Tone.'"
(What screaming fun <span class="smcap">H-xl-y</span> always is!)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">My Portraits.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps I may be allowed to say one word as to the Photographs preceding
these volumes. <i>They aren't the least little bit like me</i>! In
Volume One I appear as the unmistakable "Country Butcher." In Volume Two
I am "The Gorilla Asleep," or "Beetle-brow Napping" (after a
beetle-hunt, probably). Volume Three represents me as the Typical
Brigand of Transpontine Melodrama.</p>

<p>Why, too, has the Photographer insisted on bringing out that unfortunate
feature of mine so prominently?</p>

<p>Why? indeed! Who nose?</p>

back to her. I don't like her present home so well as I did her
first&mdash;not
so tasty, to my mind. She's got nice things about her, though,
I <i>will</i> say&mdash;a nice sideboard, a nice ... (<i>Inventory follows
here</i>.)</p>

<p><i>The Friend (darkly)</i>. All the same, it's a constant wonder to me
how she can ever bring herself to sleep in <i>that</i> bed!</p>

<p><i>The H. R. M</i>. I couldn't myself; but (<i>charitably</i>) we've not
all
the same feelings. (<i>Crush increases; Female Promenader with very
yellow hair passes, with apologies</i>.) "Excuse me, Madame" (<i>with
attempt at mimicry</i>); ah&mdash;and she <i>needs</i> it! The orchestra's
coming
back now. I didn't notice that young woman among them before&mdash;what's
<i>she</i> going to play, I wonder?</p>

<p><i>The Friend</i>. Whatever it is, she might look more pleasant over it!</p>

<p><i>The H. R. M</i>. So she might&mdash;we can't all be good-looking, but
we can all be pleasant&mdash;but they wouldn't have engaged her here, if
she hadn't her gift!</p>

<p><i>The Friend</i>. Oh, you may depend on it, she's got a gift&mdash;but I do
call her plain, myself.</p>

I've this special advantage&mdash;my <i>immense</i> knowledge of the world.

toes like that&mdash;the great clumsy thing! I'm next to you, aren't I?

up at this end&mdash;she's so quiet and lady-like over it, and pretty too;
they put all the pretty ones in front, but there's one quite an old

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
