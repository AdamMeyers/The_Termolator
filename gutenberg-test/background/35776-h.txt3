CHAPTER I



ON SIXTY-MILE CREEK



It was a grim, gray day; a day which plainly told of the
passing of late fall across the border line of the fierce
northern winter. Six inches of snow had fallen during the
night, and the leaden overcast of the sky threatened many
more inches yet to fall.



Five great sled dogs crouched in their harness, with
quarters tucked under them and forelegs outspread. They
were waiting the long familiar command to "mush"; an
order they had not heard since the previous winter.



Their brief summer leisure had passed, lost beneath the
white pall which told of weary toil awaiting them in the
immediate future. Unlike the humans with whom they were
associated, however, the coming winter held no terrors for
them. It was the normal condition under which the sled
dog performed its life's work.



The load on the sled was nearing completion. The tough-looking,
keen-eyed man bestowed his chattels with a care and
skill which told of long experience, and a profound knowledge
of the country through which he had to travel. Silently
he passed back and forth between the sled and the weather-battered
shelter which had been his home for more than
three years. His moccasined feet gave out no sound; his
voice was silent under the purpose which occupied all his
thought. He was leaving the desert heart of the Yukon to
face the perils of the winter trail. He was about to embark
for the storm-riven shores of the Alaskan coast.



A young woman stood silently by, watching his labors with
the voiceless interest of those who live the drear life of silent
places. Her interest was consuming, as her handsome brown
eyes told. Her strong, young heart was full of a profound
envy; and a sort of despairing longing came near to filling
her eyes with unaccustomed tears. The terrors of this man's
journey would have been small enough for her if only she
could get out of this wilderness of desolation to which she
had willingly condemned herself.



Her heart ached, and her despair grew as she watched.
But she knew only too well that her limitless prison was of
her own seeking, as was her sharing of the sordid lot of the
man she had elected to follow. More than that she knew
that the sentence she had passed upon herself carried with
it the terror of coming motherhood in the midst of this
desolate world, far from the reach of help, far from the
companionship of her sex.



At last the man paused, surveying his work. He tested
the raw-hide bonds which held his load; he glanced at the
space still left clear in the sled, with measuring eye, and
stood raking at his beard with powerful, unclean fingers. It
was this pause that drove the woman's crowding feelings to
sudden speech.



"Heavens, how I wish I were going with you, Tug!"
she cried.



The man lifted his sharp eyes questioningly.



"Do you, Audie?" he said, in a metallic voice, in which
there was no softening. Then he shook his head. "It'll be
a hell of a trip. Guess I'd change places with you readily
enough."



"You would?" the girl laughed mirthlessly. "You're going
down with a big 'wad' of gold to       to a land of       plenty. Oh,
God, how I hate this wilderness!"



The man called Tug surveyed her for a moment with eyes
long since hardened by the merciless struggle of the cruel
Yukon world. Then he shook his head.



"It sounds good when you put it that way. But there's
miles to go before I reach the 'land of plenty.'" He laughed
shortly. "I've got to face the winter trail, and we all know
what that means. And more than that. I'm packing a sick
man with me, and I've got to keep him warm the whole way.
It's a guess, and a poor one, if he don't die by the way.
That's why I'm going. Say, he's my partner, and I've got to
get him through." He laughed again. "Oh, it's not sentiment.
He's useful to me, and so I want to save him if I
can."



Tug's manner was something like the coldly rugged view
of the distant peaks which marked the horizon on every hand.
The girl watching his sturdy figure, with its powerful head
and hard, set face, understood something of this. She understood
that he was something in the nature of a product of
that harsh, snow-bound world. He was strong, and she knew
it; and strength appealed to her. It was the only thing that
was worth while in such a country.



"You can't save Charlie," she said decidedly. "They tell
you you can't get consumption in this country       but, well,
I'd say you can get everything that makes life hell. He's got
it; and a chill on the way will add pneumonia to his trouble,
and then              " She made a significant gesture.



"Maybe you're right," Tug admitted. Then he shrugged,
and, moving over to one of the dogs, busy chewing its rawhide
harness, kicked it brutally. "Anyway he's got to take
his chance, same as we all have."



The girl sighed.



"Yes." She was thinking of herself. "When do you
start?"



The man looked at the sky. Then he glanced down at the
land sloping away to the distant banks of a creek, which in
a less monstrous country would have borne the prouder
denomination of "river."



"When your Leo comes up to help me pack Charlie into
the sled. Say, isn't that him coming along up now?" he
added, shading his eyes. "This snow's got me dazzled for
a bit."



The girl peered out over the white world. It was an
impressive view. Far as the eye could see a great ring of
gray-crested hills spread out, their slopes massed with
patches of forest, and the gleaming beds of ancient glaciers.
Just now the cold of coming winter held pride of place,
and the dark woodlands were crowned with the feathery
whiteness of newly fallen snow. But though impressive the
outlook was unyielding in its severity, and the girl shuddered
and, for relief, was glad to return to speech.



"Yes; he's coming along up."



Tug watched the distant figure for some thoughtful
moments.



"He's a great feller," he said at last. But there was no
real appreciation in his tone. Then he laughed. "I should
say he'd need to be a great feller to get a good-looker girl
to come right along up to this devil's playground with him."



Audie's troubled eyes softened.



"He's a great fellow," she said simply.



Tug laughed again.



"I s'pose that's why they call him 'Leo.' Guess most
fellers' nicknames have a meaning suggested by their characters.
Leo-Lion. Maybe they're right. I'd sooner call
him 'Bull.'"



"Why?"



Audie was interested. Yet she understood there was no
sympathy, and little enough friendliness in this hard,
cynical man.



"Just his way of tackling life." Tug watched the great
figure as it came slowly up the slope. His eyes were keen,
shrewd, speculative.



"He does tackle it," agreed Audie warmly.



"Yes. He gets right out to meet things. He's a fighter.
I'd say he's a born 'kicker.' He doesn't fancy the things
that come easy. He's after a big piece of money, but"       he
laughed       "he don't want it easy. That's where we're
different. It seems to me there's enough weakness in the
world for a man to live on, and there's surely enough money
for the overflow to dribble into your pockets, if you only
hold them open right. That's my way; but it's not his.
Say," he quizzically surveyed the girl's flushed face, "guess
you'd follow him to hell       if he asked you?"



Audie shrugged her handsome shoulders, but her eyes
were soft.



"I've followed him here, which is the cold edition of it.
I don't guess I'd need persuading to get up against the
warmer side."



"No. But it's taking life hard."



"Guess we have to take life hard sometimes. It's mostly
the way of things. Life comes by degrees. And you can't
help any of it. Three years ago I was acting in a New York
theater, getting a hundred dollars a week salary. I wore
beautiful clothes. I had heaps of friends, men and women.
I lived on the best, and never knew what it was to cook a
meal, or do a chore. Two years ago I was 'barnstorming'
at Dawson in       well, they call it a theater. Now       now I
am here."



"With a man we call 'Leo.'" Tug studied the girl's
beautiful face, her superb figure, that would not be denied
even under the coarse clothing she was wearing. She did
not appeal to him as a woman. She was too pronounced a
type. There was a decided boldness about her. Even her
beauty was aggressive. But he was sufficiently observant
to be interested in the woman's reason lying behind her
actions.



"And why not?" demanded Audie, with a quick flash of
her big eyes.



Tug smiled coldly.



"Just so. Why not?"



"Maybe I haven't given up as much as you might think."
Audie's eyes were intently fixed upon the approaching
figure. They were alight with the fires of passion. "Leo
is bound to make good. He can't fail. That's the man.
He would win out under any circumstances."



Tug nodded.



"Sure. By fair means or              "



"He'll win out," cried Audie sharply.



Tug's broad shoulders lifted indifferently.



"Sure. He'll win out."



It was not the man's tone; it was not the man's words;
it was his manner that made Audie long to strike him. His
cynical expression was infuriating as he moved off to meet
the approaching Leo.



Audie watched him go with brooding, resentful eyes. She
saw the two meet, and, in a moment, the sun broke through
the clouds of her anger. How could it be otherwise when
she beheld the contrast between the men, which so much
favored her Leo. A wave of pride thrilled her. In face
and form, as well as character, her man was something of a
god to her.



They came towards her, Leo moving with an active,
swinging stride, while the other moved with the almost cat-like
stealth which the use of moccasins ever gives their
wearer. Leo was a large man in the early stages of manhood.
He was twenty-five years of age, but, from the
unusual cast of his rugged features and the steady light in
his keen gray eyes set beneath shaggy, tawny brows, he
might well have borne the burden of another ten. It was
a wonderful face. Such a face as rarely fails to appeal to
a woman of Audie's type. As Tug had said, he was a
fighter; and the fact was written largely in every line of his
features. It was the face of a man of passionate resolve;
a man who would not be denied in anything he undertook.
Nor was it a harsh face. His eyes looked out with an utter
fearlessness, but there was a gleam in their depths which
baffled. Whether that latent fire was inspired by good or evil
it would have been impossible to tell. Perhaps it was the
memory of that strange light which had inspired Tug's doubt.



For the rest his physique was large and extremely
powerful. He wore a close, curling fair beard which accentuated
the thrust of his square chin, and from beneath his
slouch hat flowed the mane of waving hair which had originally
inspired his nickname.



The woman only had eyes for Leo as they came up to
the sled, and for the time at least all her troubles and regrets
were forgotten. She had no words to offer. She was content
to be a silent witness. The affairs of life in such desperate
regions must be left in men's hands, her woman's sphere
extended only to the inside of their squalid home.



She watched Leo pass a critical eye over the sled. Then
his deep voice expressed his approval.



"You've fixed things neat," he said, without great interest.
Then his eyes settled upon the stout canvas bag lashed
securely on the forepart of the sled, and his whole
expression instantly changed.



The change was as curious as it was sudden. All unconcern
had passed, and his eyes shone with a deep fire which
told of some straining emotion stirred in the depths of his
soul. He pointed at the bag. Nor was his hand quite
steady.



"That's a great 'wad,'" he said. Then, half to himself,
"a dandy 'wad.'"



"Yes." Tug gazed thoughtfully at the parcel of gold,
which represented the result of his and his partner's years
of isolation in the white wilderness of the north. "It's a
goodish 'wad,'" he agreed with satisfaction.



The bigger man was lost in a profound contemplation
of the gold that was his quest also. For a moment or two
neither spoke. Then Leo withdrew his gaze with a sigh, and
turned to the waiting woman.



"Here, catch!" he cried. He pitched a seven-pound trout,
which he had just taken from the creek, across to her.
"It'll make dinner," he added. "Guess we'll not get many
more. The creek'll be solid ice in a week." Then he
abruptly moved up towards Tug's hut. "You best get
things fixed, and I'll bring Charlie out."



Leo's manner had become all unconcerned again. These
two men were about to pass out of his life. The fact of
their existence, their coming or going, had very little real
interest for him. They did not influence his concerns one
iota. But Tug left the sled and followed him.



Tug was the first to reappear from the hut. He was clad
for the long trail, and bore in his arms the pile of furs with
which to shut out the deadly breath of winter from the body
of his sick partner. Behind him came Leo carrying the
attenuated body of the sufferer as easily as he might have
carried a baby.



He deposited his burden in the sled, and looked on while
the other buried the sick man beneath the warmth-giving
furs. At last all was in readiness and Tug stood up. His
whip was in one hand, and his gee-pole in the other. He
was ready to "mush" his waiting team on.



"You'll only make the head of the Shawnee Trail,
tonight," Leo said in his confident way, after a narrow
inspection of the overcast sky. "You're going to get
snow       bad."



"We'll camp there       if we do," replied Tug cheerfully.
"If we don't       we'll make Mt. Craven, and shelter in the
woods."



Leo shook his head.



"You'll only make the head of the Shawnee." Leo bent
over the sick man to wish him good-bye. "So long," came
the weak response from amidst the furs. Tug swung out his
whip and the dogs stood up alert.



"So long, folks," he cried. Then he glanced round at
the woman with a grin. "Guess I'm off to that land of
plenty, Audie."



The jest on his lips became a heartless challenge under
which the girl perceptibly winced. But even if her wit had
served her to retort, she was given no chance. It was
Leo who took him up with a quickness of understanding
almost surprising; and though his manner was quite
without heat there was a subtle, underlying bite in his
reply.



"You've got to travel more miles than one to get there,"
he said. "So long."



Tug laughed without any enjoyment.



"I'd say this country's a hell of a piece       from anywhere,"
he retorted.



He turned at once and shouted at his dogs.



"Ho, you, Husky! Demon! You, too, Pinto! Mush, you
devils! Mush on!"



The dogs responded on the instant. They strained at
their harness, and promptly leaped into a swift run, bearing
the laden sled away in a dense flurry of soft snow.



Leo and Audie looked after the departing outfit, until
the speeding sled reached the foot of the long slope and
disappeared behind a snow-laden scrub of undergrowth.
Then the man stirred.



"It's getting near food," he said, in a matter-of-fact
tone.



But Audie gave no sign of hearing him. Her face was
turned away. She was still turned in the direction of the
vanished sled. Her eyes were crowded with tears, and all
the old longing and terror were upon her again.



"Audie!"



The summons came without any softening. The man's
only answer was a deep, choking sob. Leo turned at once;
neither was there any sign of impatience in his voice as he
questioned her.



"What are you crying for?"



The sound of his question broke the spell of the woman's
overwrought feelings. She choked down her sobs and her
tearful eyes smiled round upon him, although her cheeks
were still wet.



"Because I'm a fool. Because I've always been a fool,
and       always shall be."



Leo half smiled and shook his head.



"We're never fools when we think we are," he said calmly.
"The truth lies in the reverse."



Audie sighed. Again the corners of her pretty mouth
drooped, and her brows drew ominously together.



"I       I was thinking of       of the places where he's going to.
I was thinking of the       the good time he'll have. I was       oh,
I was thinking of the winter that's coming to us here
and       and of what I've got to              "



The man drew a deep breath, and something like a shadow
crossed his strong features. His gaze wandered away
towards the creek, where for so long he had been laboring
to lay the foundations of that wonderful structure of success
he purposed to achieve.



"You're scared," he said deliberately, at last. "You're
scared to have your baby up here       alone." Then his eyes
came back to her. "Guess I can't blame you       no one could.
We       didn't reckon on this." He waited for a moment.
"What do you want me to do?" he asked at last.



For a brief moment the girl's big eyes brightened with
hope. But the moment passed, and tears again fell upon
her soft, round cheeks.



"Do? Oh, Leo, I       I want to go where there's light, and       and
hope. I       I want to go where there's help for me."
She shuddered. "Yes, I'm scared. I'm terrified. But it       it
isn't only that. It's       oh, I don't want our baby to be born
in this awful country. Think       think of its little eyes opening
on       on this wilderness. Besides              "



She broke off, her tearful eyes filled with doubt.



"Besides       what?"



There was no denying the directness of this man's mind.



"It       it doesn't matter. I              "



"But it does."



Audie had stopped to pick up the fish; but she left it
where it was. She understood the uselessness of further
denial. She had long ago learned her lesson. This man,
young as he was, was utterly different to all the men she
had ever met. Sometimes she was afraid of him; sometimes
she would have given worlds never to have set eyes on him.
But always she knew that somehow her fate was linked
with his; and above all she knew that she loved him, and
under no circumstances would she have had it otherwise.



His love for her she never considered       she dared not consider
it. In the remote recesses of her woman's soul,
recesses hidden so well that even she, herself, rarely visited
them, recesses the contemplation of which filled her with
dread and trepidation, she held the hideous truth that his
regard for her was incomparable with the devotion she
yielded to him. But even with this subtle conviction, with
this painful truth ever vibrant in her happiest moments,
she was woman enough to be able to thank her God that
she was permitted to live on the fringe of his life, his only
companion in the rough hut which was their home. She
would have him just as he was       yes, a thousand times
sooner than yield up the love she bore him.



She knew now that a crisis in their lives had arrived.
She knew that she had gone too far to retreat. Therefore
she took her courage in both her hands.



"It's       it's the baby," she cried haltingly. "He       oh, yes,
he, I am sure it will be a boy       will       will have no father, if       if
he is born up here."



It was out. She could get no further; and she stood clasping
her hands to steady the trembling she had no power
to check.



The verdict of this man, whom she looked to as the arbiter
of her fate, was slow in coming. With each passing moment
her apprehension grew till she longed to cry out at the
torture of the suspense. He was thinking earnestly, swiftly.
He knew that she had confronted him with a problem that
might well change his whole future. Therefore he considered
without haste, without the least emotion.



At last his keen eyes turned upon her up-turned face,
and what she beheld there warned her of the calm judgment
he had brought to bear.



"Yes," he said thoughtfully. "And," he went on, after
a moment, "maybe he'd have no mother either."



For a moment puzzlement was added to the woman's
trouble.



"You mean              ?"



Again Audie broke off. A sudden understanding had
come. His point of view was wholly in another direction
from hers. He was not thinking of their moral obligations
towards the little, unborn life. He was thinking of her; of
what the unassisted birth in these outlands might mean
for her.



She was startled. Then a rush of feeling swept over her
that would not be denied.



"I       I wasn't thinking so much of       of myself," she cried
eagerly. "I meant              "



"I know," he interrupted her. "You meant we are not
married."



"Yes, yes. That's it." She came to him and seized one
of his strong hands in both of hers, and her eyes were pleading
up into his. "Oh, Leo, don't you understand what it
means to him? Won't you? I never thought of it before.
How should I? All I wanted in the world was to be with
you. All I wanted was to be your devoted companion.
That's why I       I made you bring me up here. Yes. I know.
I made you bring me. You didn't want to. I knew then,
as I have always known, as I know now, that       that I was
merely a passing fancy to you. But I did not care. I
believed I could make you love me. I blinded myself utterly,
purposely, because I loved you. But now I realize something
else. I realize there is another life to be considered.
A life that is part of us. It is that which appalls me. Now
I see the terrible consequences of my folly, to remedy which
I must add to your burden, or give up forever all the happiness
that has been mine since I knew you. Oh, Leo, I
cannot bring a bastard into the world. Think of it. The
terrible shame for the boy       for his mother. Don't you see?
Give our little one a father, and never as long as I live will
I cross your path, or make any claim on you. You can let
the memory of my love lose itself amid all the great
schemes that fill your thoughts. All I want, all I hope for
is that you may go on to the success which you desire more
than all things in life, and may God ever prosper you."



The man released his hand deliberately, but without
roughness. The calculating brain was still undisturbed by
the self-sacrifice of the girl. He had solved the problem to
his own satisfaction, through the only method he understood.



"You don't need to worry yourself, Audie," he said, in
his blunt way. "The boy       if he's a boy       shall have a
father. And I don't guess you need to cut yourself out of
my life. We'll start down this day week. You've got to
face the winter trail, but that can't be helped. We'll get
Si-wash's dogs. He's a good scout, and knows the trail
well. He'll take us down."



The woman's face had suddenly flooded with a radiant
happiness, the sight of which caused the man to turn away.
In a moment her thankfulness broke out, spasmodic, disjointed,
but from the depths of her simple soul.



"You mean that?" she cried. "You mean       oh, may God
bless every moment of your life, Leo! Oh, thank God       thank
God!"



She suddenly buried her face in her hands, and tears of
joy and happiness streamed down her cheeks.



Leo waited for her emotion to pass. He stood gazing
out down at the creek. His eyes shone with that peculiar
fire which in unguarded moments would not be denied. Then
after a few moments the sound of sobs died down, and the
man turned.



There was a marked change in him. The fire in his eyes
was deep and somber. Audie, glancing into his face, knew
that he was deeply stirred. She knew that for the first time
in her companionship with him the restraint that was always
his had been relaxed. The soul of the man had risen superior
to the domination of his will.



"Listen to me, Audie," he cried, in a voice grown suddenly
thick with an emotion she had never before witnessed in him.
"You said you knew you were merely a passing fancy to me.
That's not quite true. It's true I never calculated to marry
you. But I liked you. I don't suppose I loved you in the
way you would have me love you. No, I liked you, because       you
are a woman. Just a woman full of all the extraordinary
follies of which some of your sex are capable, but       a
woman. It's difficult, but I must tell you. I've always
known that the time would come when we must have a
straight talk. I have no real love to give to any woman.
My whole mind and body are absorbed in another direction,
which is utterly opposed to all sentiment. What shall I
call it? Ambition? It's scarcely the word. It's more than
that. It's a passion." His eyes shone with deep feeling.
"A passion that's greater than any love man ever gave to
woman."



"Yes, all my life I've fostered it," he went on abstractedly,
"from away back in the days of early boyhood. God knows
where I got it from. My father and mother were respectable,
dozy, middle-class folks in New England, without a
thought beyond the doings of their little town. They had
no ambition. Their life drove me frantic. I must get
out and do. I must take my place in the battle of life, and
win my way to the forefront among the ranks of our
country's millionaires. That is the passionate dream of my
life which I intend to achieve. That is the wild ambition
that has eaten into my very bones. It is part of me. It
is me. It is a driving force which I have created in myself       and
now it is beyond my control. I am the slave of my
self-created passion, as surely as any drug fiend is a slave
to the wiles of his torturer. I could not defy its will if I
desired to. But I do not desire to. Do you understand me?
Do you understand when I say I have no love to give to any
woman? I am eaten up with this passion which leaves no
room in mind or heart for any other.



"Maybe you think me a heartless brute," he continued
after a moment's pause, "without feeling, or sympathy.
Perhaps you're right. Maybe I am. I don't know. Nor
do I care. I doubt if you can possibly understand me.
I don't understand myself. All I know is, nothing I can
remove will ever stand in the way of my achievement. I
have no real scruples, and I want you to know all this now       now
with our whole futures lying before us. This problem
is not as difficult as you seem to think. There is no particular
reason why I should not marry you. On the contrary
there is every reason why I should. I have had a good year,
so good that it might astonish you if you knew the amount
of gold I have taken out of the creek. We shall go down
to the coast with twice the amount Tug possesses. Tug
never knew how well I was doing."



He smiled faintly.



"However," he hastened on, "my plan had been to leave
here next spring, to avoid the winter journey, that was
all. There will be no work done all the coming winter. So
what does it matter if we make the journey six months
earlier? It will help you, and does not hurt me. So       don't
worry yourself any more about it, but just make your
preparations for departure this day week."



The man's usual calm had returned by the time he finished
speaking. He had settled the matter in his own way, and
his manner left nothing more to be said.



Audie understood. Her eyes were alight with a rapturous
joy and devotion, but she realized how little he desired the
outburst of gratitude she was longing to pour into his
unwilling ears. In spite of the coldness with which he had
told her he could never love her, this was probably the
happiest moment of her life. She held herself tightly and
strove to speak in the same calm manner he had used at
the last.



"Thank you, Leo," she said simply. Then she added with
an emotion that would not be denied, "I pray God to
bless you."



Leo nodded.



"Right ho!" he said coldly. Then he picked up the trout.
"Guess we'll get food."






CHAPTER II



THE ROOF OF THE NORTHERN WORLD



Si-wash was a great scout; he was also an Indian of
independence and decision, both qualities very necessary
in the snow-bound country such as he lived in. But Si-wash
understood men very well; particularly the curiously
assorted samples of whitemen who sought the remoteness of
the Yukon in those early days when the news of its wealth
was only just beginning to percolate through to civilized
countries. It was for this reason he was as putty in the
hands of the man Leo.



When consulted Si-wash protested against Leo's contemplated
journey over the winter trail to the coast, especially
with the added burden of a white woman. He drew a
picture of every difficulty and danger his fertile brain could
imagine, and laid it before the cold eyes of the big man.
Encouraged by the silence with which his stories were
received he finally threw an added decision in his definite
refusal to hire his dogs, and conduct the party over the
perilous road.



Then Leo rose from his seat on the floor of Si-wash's hut,
and invited him to visit his workings on the creek bank.
Si-wash went, glad that he had been able to dissuade this
man who possessed such cold eyes, and so unsmiling a face.



At the creek Leo spoke quite seriously.



"Si-wash," he said, as they stood beside the frozen, snow-laden
stream, "I am disappointed in you. I have brought
you here to show you your grave. There it is       under the
ice. If you don't hire yourself and dogs to me, if you don't
accompany us to the coast, I'll drown you in the water under
that ice, where it's so cold that all the fires of hell, where
your spirit will surely go, will never be able to thaw you out,
though you remain there forever, as you undoubtedly will."



Si-wash both liked and feared Leo. But he hated cold
water, in fact water of any sort, and feared talk of hell still
more; so there was no further discussion. Si-wash accepted
his money in advance; and, nearly a month later, the travelers
were scaling the perilous heights of the watershed
which is really the roof of the northern world.



Once foot is set on the long winter trail, all rest of mind
and body is left behind. Days and nights, alike, become
one long nightmare of unease. Every hour of the day carries
its threat of danger. Every foot of the way is beset by
shoals for the feet of the unwary. And the night       the long
northern night       is a painful dream crowded with exaggerated
pictures of dangers so narrowly escaped during waking,
and vivid suggestions of added terrors which the morning
light may reveal.



It is called the Shawnee Trail; vain enough appellation.
There is no trail; there never has been a trail; nor will there
ever be a trail, so long as the northern winter holds its fierce
sway in due season. It is just a trackless wilderness, claiming
thoroughfare by reason of the impassability of the rest
of the country in that region.



There is no room for life in such a world, for there is no
rest or relief. Existence is an endless struggle against the
overwhelming odds of an outlaw nature. The great white
land is broken and torn. It rises and falls, or plunges
precipitately in the manner of a storm-swept ocean; but
ever the journeyer is borne upward, ever upward, to the
barren crests of the watershed which dominate the melancholy
spectacle of Nature's wasted endeavor.



For the most it is a silent land; nor is there movement
to break the awesome stillness, unless it be the frequent
presence of storm. Otherwise the calm is like the silence of
the grave, without a whisper to waken the echoes of the
riven, age-worn crags, or a movement to stir the hidden
valleys into a seeming of life. It is the stillness of outer
darkness, lit only by a wintry sheen, like the death-cold
stare of wide, unseeing eyes.



Such thoughts and feelings stirred the woman traipsing
easily over the smoothly pressed snow-track left by the
laden sled. She moved with the curious swing of the snowshoer,
leisurely, comfortably. The gee-pole in her hand
was an unnecessary equipment, for her path was fully tested
by those who understood far better than she the dangers
of the road before them.



Audie's eyes were looking out ahead at the men and the
dogs. She knew she had no other responsibility than to
keep pace. For the rest she knew that the burden of their
journey rested on shoulders more capable of bearing it. So
her mind was given up to thoughts which could never enter
the men's heads. And those thoughts were full of the
unutterable desolation of this untamed world.



Si-wash headed the dogs. A great incline of smooth, soft
snow mounted up to the crotch of a great hill, where twin
peaks rose sharply, towering above, and a wide pathway
was left between them. It was a beacon of the trail, marking
one of the roughest stretches yet to be traveled. Beyond
this, five miles further on, the scout had marked a camping
ground.



Just now he was a little anxious in his silent Indian way,
and the sign of it was in his furtive watchfulness, as he
peered from the road to the burnished light of the desponding
sun.



Leo, swinging along beside the sled, was quite unaware
of his guide's unease. The monotony of progress left him
free to think whithersoever his active brain listed. For the
time it led him on, on into dreams of the future, a future
than which he could imagine no other. His fortune, or that
which stood for the foundations of it, lay strapped at the
tail of the sled, and the knowledge of its presence, the sight
of its canvas wrapping stirred him to a gladness which no
monotony of the long trail could diminish. For him this
was the moment of passing, when the foundations had been
carefully laid and the first scaffold pole was about to be
set in place round the structure of fortune he intended to
build.



The harsh voice of Si-wash struck unpleasantly on his ears.



"Look!" he cried, pointing at the drooping sun with a
mitted hand. "It the be-damn sun-dogs. Him look, an'
look lak hell. Him much be-damn sun-dogs."



The man's irritability seemed quite uncalled for. The
sun was shining over the still world with its usual coppery
splendor; a gleaming ball of ruddy fire centering a wide
halo of brilliant light, which, in its turn, was studded with
four magnificent jewels of light       the fiercely burning sun-dogs
which Si-wash so bitterly cursed. But Leo understood
the full significance of what he beheld. He, too, felt inclined
to curse those ominous wardens of the ineffective northern
sun.



"Storm," he said, as he came up beside the Indian.



"We camp. Five miles," said Si-wash presently. "Five
mile, long piece. Yes. Storm, him come quick."



The men moved on in silence, side by side. Audie had
heard their talk. She, too, had looked across at the stormy
sun, but she had no comment to add.



They were nearing the summit of the hill. The laboring
dogs moved with heads low, and lean quarters tucked well
beneath them. Their pace was the same as ever, only their
effort was greater. With each moment the gap came down
towards them, and, at last, they trod the shoulder under
foot. Then Si-wash's sharp command rang out, and the
five great burden bearers of the north dropped in their
traces, and sought their well-earned rest on the feathery
softness of untrodden snow.



The men surveyed the view from the great height at which
they stood.



For long moments no word was spoken. Then the Indian
held up a warning hand.



"See, hark!"



A curious sigh, almost as if the great hill were shivering
under the biting cold of the atmosphere, seemed to drift
out upon the sparkling air. It died away, somewhere in
the distance behind them.



Then Si-wash spoke again.



"We camp quick." He pointed away out at the far
side of the valley confronting them. "We mak dat valley.
See dat hill? We come so. We mak round it. It bad.
So. Long, deep fall. Dogs haul 'em long side hill. Very
bad. So we mak 'em before storm. Good. After hill mush
wood. Tall, big. It is we camp."



Without waiting for reply he turned to the dogs.



"Ho, you damn huskies. Mush!"



In a moment the dogs leaped at their traces, and the
journey went on.



The end of the passage came quickly; and, as it did so,
and the scout took the first step of the descent, another
sigh, longer drawn out this time, sharper, a sigh that spoke
of restless discontent, shuddered down the mountain side
and passed on ahead of them. A moment later a tiny eddy
of snow was caught up in its path and vanished amidst the
sparkling air particles glistening in the sun.



Again the Indian's voice broke the silence. But this time
it was to urge the dogs faster. He had said it was five miles
to where they could camp in safety; and five miles, with a
storm coming on, was, as he said, a "long piece."



But since the second breath had swept down the hillside
a change seemed to have come over the aspect of the day.
It was subtle. It was almost indescribable. Yet it was
evident. It may have been that the air had warmed by a
few degrees; it may have been that the sun's labored light
had diminished. Certainly there was an added grayness
settling upon the icy world. Yes. Something had certainly
changed in the outlook, and it was a change which
threatened, and told of the dread storm to come.



The dogs raced down the long hillside under the urgent
commands of the Indian. A mile, one out of five to be
accomplished, was devoured by scurrying feet. Then came
the first real challenge of the storm. It was a swift, fierce
blast which swept after them, as though enraged at the
attempt to escape. In wanton riot it sent a dense flurry of
snow like a fog whistling about them, and, for the moment,
blotted out all view of the goal Si-wash had set for himself.



The men had no words, but their thoughts were sufficiently
in common. The swift-rising storm had banished every other
consideration from their minds. Audie closed up on the
sled, and her action spoke for itself.



Another blast rushed at the speeding travelers. It came
across them. For a moment it seemed to pause in its rush
as though it had reached the object of its attack. It swung
round in a fierce whirl, round and round in growing fierceness,
picking up the snow and bearing it aloft in a gray fog,
like fine white sand. It dashed it in the faces of the men,
it beat fiercely upon the thick coats of the racing dogs, it
swept it under the fur hood of the woman, and painfully
whipped the soft flesh of her cheeks.



The hiss of its voice was not allowed to die out. Reinforcements
rushed to its aid. They came with a long-drawn
moaning howl sweeping down from the distant hill,
now grown vague and shadowy behind them, and added to
the rapidly growing fog.



Harshly above the howl of the storm Si-wash's voice
shouted into Leo's ear.



"The gar-damn blizzard. It hell!"



But Leo made no response. He had no answer for anybody.
All his mind was centered upon the goal he longed
for. Just now the woodland bluff, Si-wash had spoken of,
seemed the most desirable thing in the world. He was not
thinking of life or death. They were considerations that
never troubled him. He was thinking of what the wrecking
of their transport might mean to him.



Si-wash, being only a half-civilized savage, was thinking
of those things which did not trouble his white companion;
and, being simply human, he thought of the woman, the
burden of whose presence he had deplored.



He turned and shouted at her to come up abreast of
them, fearing a stumble might mean death to her in the
storm; and in the same breath, the same tone, he hurled
a string of blasphemous commands at his dogs.



Almost blinded by the whipping snow, Audie staggered to
the side of the Indian. So cruel was the buffeting of the
storm she would have fallen, but for the timely succor of
the man's outstretched hands. Already the downward rush
was left behind, and the level of the valley was under their
feet. Ahead of them, lost in the gray of the storm lay the
incline which was to lead them to the treacherous shoulder
of the hill they had yet to pass. Neither dogs nor men
could see it, and their only guidance was the wonderful
instinct of the savage brain of the Indian.



With unerring judgment he led the way, faltering not
even for a second in his decisions; and soon, far sooner than
seemed possible, the tautened traces, and crouching gait of
the dogs, told that his judgment had not erred. The ascent
had begun.



The steady pull went on for an hour; a grinding, weary
labor in which every inch of the way was only accomplished
under the cruel lashing of a merciless wind, and with eyes
more than half blinded by the powdered snow. The wind
seemed to attack them from every side; now from ahead;
now from behind. Now it whistled down the hillside on
their right; now it came up with a vicious scream from the
depths of the canyon which dropped away beside them on
the left of the harsh, hummocky path. The heavy wrappings
of furs about their mouths were a mass of ice from
the frozen moisture of their hard breathing, while the dense
hoar-frost on their lashes had to be wiped away lest their
lids froze together as their watering eyes blinked under the
force of the wind. It was such a journey as matched the
sterile land through which they were passing; such a journey
as only the hardened folk of the northern world could dare
to face.



At last the ascent was accomplished, and with the relaxing
of effort came the first warning of the dangers with which
they were surrounded.



It was the horror-stricken cry of the woman. In the
blinding snow she had approached the edge of the path too
nearly. Her feet shot from under her, and, for a moment,
absolute destruction threatened. Again came the prompt
succor of the Indian. Again he clutched her, and held her.
Then he gathered his strength for an effort, and the next
moment she was sprawling in safety at the feet of her lover.



"Ho, you damn-fool woman!" Si-wash cried, in a manner
that merely expressed his own fears, and had no insult in it.



Leo helped Audie to her feet. A moment later his deep
voice shouted above the howling of the wind.



"If she can fall, what about the sled?"



The Indian's reply was full of the philosophy of his race.



"Sure," he cried. "It easy."



The whiteman's next act spoke far more than any words
could tell. He dropped back to the tail of the sled to guard
his precious possessions. His first, his only consideration
amidst the perils of that road was his gold. The woman
bearing the burden of her devotion to him, must fight for
herself.



Each passing moment brought added perils. The path
up here was shorn of its loose covering of snow, swept away
to the depths below by the all-mastering gale. The surface
left was little better than a sheet of glare ice, hummocky
and studded with roughnesses caused by broken ice frozen
upon its surface. The snowshoes of the travelers left them
fairly secure from slipping, but the wretched dogs had no
such help. They fought for foothold till their weary feet
were left torn and bleeding.



But the hill was passed and the track was no longer an
ascent, and at this altitude the snow fog had lightened to
gray mist which left the Indian less troubled. His silent
blasphemy against the powers that ruled the storm ebbed
gently. Its flood had passed. That was his way. The
wall on his right was a sure guide, and at the end of it lay
the haven where he hoped to eat and sleep. So long as he
could see he had no fear whatsoever of the country to which
he was born.



But with all this confidence the dangers were no less. The
track sloped perilously towards the edge of the precipice
on the left. It narrowed, too, so that there was no room
for more than two people abreast. Leo understood these
things, as only a man can whose mind is beset with dread
for the safety of his possessions. Therefore there was
something fierce and threatening in his sudden shout at the man
who was leading the dogs. There was something else in it,
too. There was a terrible fear, which sounded strangely in a
man of his strength of purpose.



"Stop! Curse you, stop the dogs!" he cried wildly.



The shout brought the dogs to a stand, and the Indian
dropped back.



"What is?" he demanded. But he needed no answer.



The tail of the sled was at the very brink of the precipice,
supported only by the thrust of Leo's gee-pole, to which he
clung with all the strength of his great body.



The Indian and the woman flung themselves to the rescue,
and, in a few moments, the sled was resting safely at the
inner side of the path. Then the Indian, as though imparting
pleasant intelligence, assured his comrade.



"It more skid, bimeby," he observed confidently. "It
worse       bimeby," he added, turning again to the dogs.
"Mush on, you devils!" he cried. "Maybe we freeze."



There was no longer any ease of mind for the whiteman.
Time and again the sled skidded, and each time he saved it
from destruction only by inches. That stretch of level
became a nightmare to him, and only the passionate endeavor
of his labor made his nervous tension bearable. His pole
was at work every foot of the way, guiding, staying, holding
that incessant skid.



So they struggled on, floundering their way yard by yard,
the dumb burden bearers fighting for a foothold at every
step. It almost seemed as if they, too, understood their
own danger from the skid, and were driven by their apprehension
to unaccustomed efforts. They tore at the unyielding
surface of ice with claws broken and bleeding, and, by
sheer tenacity, ground out a purchase.



The drop to the woodland valley below was nearing. Si-wash
called a warning to the man behind.



"We near come by end," he shouted. "Then him go down
lak hell."



With this brief information the whiteman had to be content,
for Si-wash promptly returned to his dogs, and finally
took his place at the head of the sled. Presently the sled
jolted. It tilted forward as the leading dogs of the team
vanished down the slope. Then, in a moment, the run began.



The change came all too suddenly. The sled gained a
furious impetus. Leo dashed forward to thrust a brake
at its head. Si-wash was already there with his pole thrust
deep in the snow. The two men joined forces, and, for a
moment, the pace was steadied.



Then something happened. It was disaster; the worst
disaster that could have befallen at such a moment. Leo's
pole, strained possibly by the work it had already done,
bent. It cracked; and broke off short. In a moment he was
left behind sprawling in the snow. Before Si-wash could
readjust his pole to the center of the nose of the sled the
vehicle swung out stern first. It swept on at a great speed,
and the dogs raced to keep out of its way. In another
moment its impetus carried it to the brink of the precipice.
It swept on, half poised in mid-air. Then, with a clatter
and scrunch, it fell over the side, almost sweeping the heavy
dogs from their feet.



It was a desperate situation. The straining dogs held for
the moment by reason of their great weight, and in that
moment the Indian and the woman were able to reach them
and throw their own weight into the balance. Even then
it was a desperate uncertainty. Could they hold it? Could
they recover the fallen vehicle carrying such an enormous
weight? But the problem solved itself in its own way.
Just as the great figure of Leo loomed up on the scene of
the disaster, the strain on the traces slackened, and the
dogs were left standing still. There was no longer need to
struggle.



Si-wash rose from the ground and released his hold.



"Wot is't?" he asked, in a stupid way.



Leo was leaning over the edge of the precipice, gazing
down with eyes that strained to behold the safety of that
which he most prized in all the world. He made no answer.



Si-wash came to his side. He dropped upon his stomach
and peered down at the gray depths beneath. For a long
while he was silent. Then, at last, as his companion stirred,
he spoke in the curiously indifferent manner of his kind.



"The pack. Him haf gone. Him drop long way."



Leo was on his feet before he had finished speaking. He
turned away and looked out into the gray fog. Presently
he glanced down at the man beside him. Then his eyes
rested on the dogs. Audie, watching him, saw a strained,
dreadful expression growing in his eyes. There was a
subtle fire lighting them; a fire she dreaded to look upon.



Then he began to speak. And as he spoke a wild, untamed,
impotent fury swept through his head, sweeping away
all thought, all reason. Words, foul, blasphemous, raving,
leaped to his tongue and found expression. He cursed the
Indian; he cursed the woman, the dogs, the sled. He cursed
the storm and the country. He cursed furiously, impotently
every form of life that came within the range of his distorted
vision. He cursed his God.






CHAPTER III



THE DRIVING FORCE



Through the tattered pinewood branches the northern
sun's cold rays sought to light the gloomy aisles below. It
was like the furtive peeping of curious eyes into mysteries
forbidden. On the ragged outskirts its staring light had
power; but within the dim recesses it was swallowed up,
devoured by the impenetrable gloom of ages, where the woodland
depths refused to yield their secrets.



Yet these woods were the haven of many a weary traveler.
Since ever the foot of man had trod the watershed, none had
failed to seek shelter amid these stately shadows; and at
all times they lent a sure retreat before winter's storms to
the lesser animal life. No storm could search the deepening
valleys; no blizzard could more than stir the mighty canopy;
no roar of wind could break the grave-like silence, just as
no sunlight had ever yet solved the riddle of its impenetrable
heart.



Two men and a woman sat huddled over a crackling fire,
at a spot where dozens of fires had burned before. It was
cold, bitterly cold, even here where the fierce winds had
scarcely power to stir the air. But, even so, the cold could
not add one iota to the icy misery of, at least, two of those
who watched the miserable effort of the fire to achieve where
ages of sunlight had failed.



Beyond the rays of the firelight the meager paraphernalia
of a camp loomed up in the twilight. A low tent of
rough-tanned hides had been carefully pitched. It was a stout
enough shelter of crude Indian workmanship, and it doubtless
served its purpose well in a land of storm such as these
northern heights of the world. Near by was an up-turned
sled in the course of repair, and again the stout crudeness
of workmanship bespoke the Indian hand. The long, rawhide
traces were strung out upon the bed of pine-cones and
needles which covered the ground, just where the harness
had been flung from the shoulders of the weary dogs, who
squatted about between their human masters, staring and
blinking at the pleasant warmth of the fire with luxurious
confidence.



The men were silent, and the woman watched one of them
with anxious, troubled eyes. She was longing to speak, to
say something that might salve the wounded heart of her
lover. But there was nothing, nothing, she knew, that would
ease his pain, and restore to his burning, despairing eyes
their wonted look of masterful confidence. She knew that,
for the time, at least, hope had been hurled from its high
pedestal in his heart, and it was beyond her puny woman's
strength to restore it to its setting. She yearned to comfort
as only a loving woman can, but she was far too well versed
in the curiosities of Leo's dominant, almost violent nature,
not to realize the futility of such an effort.



So she watched him with hopeless gaze. She saw the fixed
stare of his bloodshot eyes boring unseeingly into the pitiful
embers of fire. She saw the thick veins standing out upon
his temples, and understood the passionate regret and resentment
driving him; and as she watched these things, estimating
them in her own timid way, she wondered and marveled
at the power of gold upon the human heart, and at the terrible
effect its loss could have on a strong man's mind.



While she watched the brooding figure her mind went back
to the moment of disaster when the sled had fallen. For
just as long as she lived those moments would remain vividly
in her memory. When Leo had discovered that half the
load had torn itself from its fastenings, and had been swallowed
up by yawning depths below he went suddenly
demented. She knew it. Never in her life had she witnessed
so dreadful a change in anybody. Even now the impotent,
almost idiotic ravings and cursings of the man rang in her
ears. It was terrible. She shuddered at the recollection.
Then what followed was no less horrible to one who had
always known her lover for a sober-minded, purposeful man.
In the midst of the storm, with the wind raging about them,
and the gray fog blinding their eyes, he had stood by threatening
her, and refusing to raise a hand in the task of saving
the wreck with its remaining half of the cargo.



The toil of those hours. The weary hopeless toil. And
it had been accomplished by the Indian and herself under
the shadow of this man's insane threats against them both.
Once during their struggle, just when the sled was almost
within reach of safety she had been driven in self-defence,
and in defence of the faithful Si-wash, to hold the maniac
at bay under cover of a revolver, whilst the task was
completed.



Her life had been strangely checkered, she had passed
through many adventures that rarely befall a woman belonging
to the life of civilized communities, but the worst
moments she had ever known were incomparable with that
struggle on the brink of, for all she knew, an unfathomable
chasm.



The shadow of that struggle was still upon her. She
could not shake it off. She was dreading every passing
moment, longing to hear the calm tones of her lover she was
used to, but fearing lest the insanity inspired by the loss
of his gold had not yet passed.



So she waited, watching, watching for the sign that was
to tell her of the easing of the straining brain, watching
the dreadful stare of his eyes, as they gazed upon nothing
of what they beheld, with a brain lost in a terrible contemplation
of the hideous thoughts passing behind them.



Si-wash was silent, too. But that was his way, the way
of his race. His impassive face yielded no indication of
what was passing behind it. If he feared his companion's
mood he gave no sign. Possibly he did not. Possibly he
realized that here, here on the wild, chaotic trail he was
master; certainly that his chances were equal with the other.



The fire burned low. Si-wash kicked the embers together
with his moccasined foot. Then he rose and shuffled to the
wood pile and replenished it. For a moment he watched
the flicker of the flames as they licked round the dead,
inflammable bark, and in desperation Audie broke the awful
silence.



"When'll the sled be ready for the road again?" she demanded,
without serious interest.



Si-wash's eyes drifted to the cumbersome vehicle.



"I finish him two days," he said, holding up two fingers
to impress his assurance upon her.



"Most of the food was saved," Audie went on. "It was
the other things that were lost."



The Indian nodded.



"Sure. We freeze but for fire. Him cook-pots go. Only
one him saved. Blanket him go. So him go the              "



"Go and get wood, you red son-of-a-moose," cried Leo with
sudden vehemence. "Don't stand there yapping like a
yellow cur."



The man's bloodshot eyes blazed up furiously into the
Indian's face. For a moment Audie feared another outbreak
such as she had witnessed before. She even feared for
Si-wash's wretched life. But the Indian understood his
companion's mood and moved silently off to obey. He
admitted to himself that the man was mad; and he had a
curious dread of people who were possessed of such a devil.



Leo watched him disappear in the gloom of the woods.
Then he turned back impatiently to the fire. He hunched
himself up, resting his chin upon his hands, and his elbows
on his knees. The mention of their losses had again driven
him hard, but, curiously enough, now the eyes of the watching
woman saw that his mood had changed for the better.
His were less straining, and the veins of his temples no longer
stood out like twisted cords. She began to hope. She felt,
dangerous as it might seem, that it would be far better that
he should talk, whatever pain such talk might cost her. Far
better than that he should sit silently nursing his despair.



The idea became fixed in her mind, and she cast about
for an opening. Her instinct belonged to her sex; she knew,
none better, the burden of dreary thoughts hugged to a
silent bosom. It was difficult. Leo was at all times aloof.
His armor of reserve left her still a stranger to his inmost
feelings and thoughts, so that she scarcely knew how to
approach the task she contemplated.



She was spared her trouble, however. It was Leo who at
last broke the silence and made possible that very purpose
the contemplation of which filled her with so much doubt.
He stirred, and swiftly aimed a vicious kick at a log protruding
from the embers of the fire. The response was a shower
of sparks flying upward. Then he turned to her and began
talking rapidly.



"I       I sometimes feel as if I could blame you for all       this,"
he began, in a low, harsh tone. "But I don't. I've
still got sense enough for that. And it's lucky       lucky for
you."



The woman's face paled under the beaver cap pressed
low down upon her head. The threat was the more terrible
for the simplicity of the manner in which he uttered it.



"How could I be responsible?" she asked, while her heart
chilled within her.



"How?" Leo laughed without mirth. "I tell you I don't
blame you       and yet I might. I did not intend to make this
journey in winter."



Audie understood. She knew he was making this journey
for her sake. Therefore she remained silent. How could
she deny the blame, which, she knew in her heart, he set
at her door?



"Say, I wonder if you know what this means to us       to
me," he went on, in a tone of suppressed passion. "No, you
don't       you can't. Guess it's not likely. You just remember
we've still enough food for the journey which is to bring us
where your child can be born in       in decency. You know
we have no money. But that don't mean a thing to you,
because you guess there's a man's hand ready to get busy in
your service. You've no thought for anything else, because       because
I guess you're a woman."



He caught his breath sharply as though laboring under
a stab of intense bodily pain.



Then he laughed a short harsh laugh.



"If you could only look into my brain       my heart       my
feelings, maybe you'd realize something of the destruction
that's been done there by the loss of my gold. Oh, I'm no
miser, greedily hungering after the precious stuff. It's not
that." He paused and looked steadily at her. "I s'pose
you can't realize what it means to have the concentrated
hopes of years suddenly dashed to a thousand atoms. No,
course you can't. You can't see, you can't feel these things,
because you have never got up against those hills of success,
which confront every man of purpose who's determined to
cut himself a path which is to lead him right up to the       top
of things. I've got busy that way, and the walls have
fallen in and well nigh broke me up. That's what's happened.
But I'm not down and out       yet. Not quite. No.
I want to get right up and hurt some one in return. I want
to hit out and       hurt. I want to do things by way of       retaliation.
Guess there's nothing to       to retaliate on but
those very walls that have so nearly crushed me.



"That's the way I'm feeling now. But I don't guess it's
all. Not by a sight. Guess I've been well nigh mad. Maybe
I was mad. I don't know. I don't care. Anyway I am mad
no longer. How long my sanity will last I can't say. All I
know is I daren't look back. If I did       well, I wouldn't
gamble a heap on the result. No, I got to look forward.
Maybe that'll save me."



Audie nodded. The fear of him was dying out of her.



"I think I understand       all," she said, in a low voice.
"Yes, look ahead, it will be best for you. Don't let thought
of our       our boy concern you now; forget everything       but
that goal you spoke of."



Just for a moment the man's eyes softened. He was not
insensible to the utter self-effacement in the woman's desire
to help and comfort. But they hardened again almost at
once.



"I'm not going to let       anything       interfere," he said almost
brutally. "My plans are fixed. Now listen. To-morrow
I get right back to Sixty-mile Creek. Anyway I
start out for it. I'll have to go on foot. Maybe I shan't
ever reach it. Anyway that don't matter. If I do I'll
remain there until I have washed up as much gold as I
have lost. It may take a year       two       three. It don't
matter how long."



"But              " Audie broke in with wide, horrified eyes.



Leo stopped her with a swift gesture.



"It's no use shouting," he said harshly. "I tell you my
mind's made up. You'll go on down to the coast with
Si-wash. You'll be able to get the help you need there."



"Yes, yes, I can manage. I can get to my sister in San
Sabatano."



"Good. You'll go on then. I can trust Si-wash. He's been
paid. You'll have food enough, and you'll travel light. If he
fails you, and I survive, if I hunt the world over I'll kill him."



Audie's eyes lit. It was the one expression of feeling Leo
had displayed which she could take to herself.



"Then afterwards       God knows when       I'll come and
marry you. It's the best we can do. It's all I can promise.
We're plumb up against it. Whatever happens, I'm going
to marry you. That goes."



Audie breathed a deep sigh of heartfelt gratitude. The
ice had been broken. She knew that Leo's mental balance
was restored. It mattered nothing to her at that moment
that she had to face the world alone with her burden of
motherhood. It mattered nothing that the shame she had
so dreaded was still to be hers. The future had no longer
any terrors for her. How should it? The man she had
always known had once more resumed sway in the mind so
recently distracted to the verge of madness. Her lover was
once more the ruthless, powerful creature she had followed
into the wilderness, was ready to follow into the wilderness
again if he would only permit her.



"Must I       must I go on to the coast? Is there need?"
she said, in a low, pleading voice, after a moment's silence.
"If you are going back, cannot I go back, too? There's
the sled. Why go on foot? Let me return with you, Leo."



The man shook his head, and his negative was as irrevocable
as any spoken words. If he understood the devotion
prompting her he gave no sign.



"Your life shan't be risked that way," he said. "The
child must be born where you can get help. That's       our
duty. It's my duty that you reach the coast in safety as
far as the matter is humanly possible. Si-wash'll have to
fix that. After that I'm helpless       I haven't a cent in the
world or I would give it you. You'll have to go on to the
coast, and I       I return alone."



Audie bowed her head submissively. She knew he was
right under the existing circumstances. Anyway, right or
wrong, she was ready to submit to his will. More than that
she was glad to do so. Her big eyes stared thoughtfully
into the blaze of the fire. There was no more to be said. She
was content to sit there in silence, dreaming her dreams;
those dreams which the silent northern world so mysteriously
fosters, to cover up its own nakedness and make life possible
upon its sterile bosom.



Later on the shuffling of Si-wash's moccasins scrunching
upon the pine-cones made itself heard. He came with a
great load of firewood upon his broad back. Leo watched
him deposit it and replenish the fire. Then Audie set about
preparing a meal, and the dogs were fed from the store of
frozen fish, which, by a trick of Fate, had been saved in
preference to their precious store of gold. After that, as
the twilit woods were swallowed up in the darkness of night,
Audie vanished into the tent, and was seen no more.



The solitude of the tent was preferable to the silence
round the fire. She had permitted her lover to dispose of
her life as he chose, but she passionately longed to return
with him to the north, whatever the dangers to herself and
her unborn child. All she cared for was this hard, unyielding
man. So long as she had him she could think of and consider
those other things which now seemed so small in her
life. Without him they were utterly swallowed up by the
desolation of all her thoughts and feelings. She wanted him.
She wanted this love of hers. Nothing else in the wide world
really mattered. He was going out of her life. She knew it.
She knew more. He was going out of her life for ever. It
was a haunted, despairing woman that sought the warm furs
which the man had given up to her use. And the eyes that
finally closed in slumber were stained with tears wrung from
the very depths of her warm, foolish heart.



For long hours after the woman's eyes had closed in
troubled sleep the two men hugged the warmth of the fire.
They had neither blanket nor bed. All that had been saved
had been given to the woman. The fire stood between them
and the bitter cold of the northern night, and beside it was
their couch of rotting pine-cones. But they were hardened
to the deadly winter, and, so long as they could keep the
frost out of their flesh, nothing much mattered.



They smoked in silence, each man busy with his own
thoughts; and it was nearly midnight when Si-wash gave his
friend the benefit of his profound cogitations.



He had just replenished the fire, and finally drawn up
the broken sled as an added protection against the bitter
breath of the night breezes. Then he returned to his place
and squatted upon his haunches, hugging his knees with his
clasped hands, while he puffed at the reeking black clay pipe
which, in the manner of his race, protruded from the center
of his mouth.



"I mak 'em long piece way. No plenty wood. I mak 'em
mile       two mile." Si-wash held up two fingers.



Leo looked up quickly at this breaking of the silence.



"Sure," he said. "Wood scarce."



Si-wash nodded.



"Plenty scarce." Then after a long pause: "Other man
find him. Burn 'em all up."



Leo eyed his companion. Then he grinned unpleasantly.



"Guess there's only one damn-fool outfit on this
trail       hereabouts              "



The Indian went on smoking, and nearly a minute passed
before he shot a quick, sidelong glance at his white friend.



"No. Two," he said; and the inevitable two fingers were
thrust up again before Leo's eyes.



It was the white man's turn to pause before replying
now.



"Two?" he said, half incredulously.



The Indian nodded, and again held up two fingers.



"How d'you know?" Leo's question came sharply.



"Smoke," returned the Indian; and his one hand described
a series of circles upwards.



"You mean       a camp fire? Where?"



Leo was more than interested.



"So. Back there. Big piece. One       two       three mile."
Si-wash held up three fingers in deliberate succession.



Leo's interest seemed to suddenly die out. He had no
further questions to ask; and, a moment later, he leaned forward
and knocked the ashes from his pipe. Then he rose and
moved over to the sled. Here he sat down and supported his
back against an iron strut, and stretched his legs out beside
the fire. In a few moments he was asleep.



Si-wash remained where he was. He made no preparations
for sleep; but he slept, every now and then waking up to
replenish the fire. And so the long hours crept on toward
the gray dawn.





Daylight had come. Leo yawned and stretched his
cramped limbs. Si-wash was still beside the fire. He had
melted a pot of snow, the only pot that had been saved from
wreck on the hillside. He was making tea, boiling it, as
is the fashion of all Indians. The smell of it pervaded the
camp and reminded Leo that he was hungry.



In half an hour breakfast was over, and Si-wash proceeded
with his work on the sled. Audie waited for the commands
of her lover. But none were forthcoming. For a long time
Leo sat lost in thought, watching the skillful fingers of the
Indian at his work, while the fierce sled dogs fought and
played around in their untamed, savage way.



The man's expression was quite inscrutable. He was
thinking neither of the Indian nor his work. His mind was
on other matters, matters which set him puzzling and speculating.



At last he rose and picked up the rawhide rope, which
was lying beside the diminished wood pile. He stood for
a moment contemplating it. Then he absently stretched
it out on his powerful hands, and finally coiled it up.



"Guess I'll climb around and gather wood. So long,
Audie," he said briefly.



The next moment the girl's longing eyes were watching
his retreating figure as the gray distance swallowed it up.



For a long time she stood thus. Then she started and
looked around. It was the Indian's voice that had startled
her.



"Him heap good feller. Him no come back bimeby."



The girl's eyes widened with sudden fear.



"What do you mean?" she demanded, with a clutching at
her heart.



The Indian's features relaxed into something approaching
a smile.



"Him crazy, sure!"






CHAPTER IV



LEO



Leo gazed about him as he left the woodland shadows
behind. All sign of the recent blizzard had passed. The
world was white, cold, and bathed in the gleaming sunlight
of the northern winter. The air was warmer than it had
been for days, an unusual phenomenon after such a storm.



For a moment his unexpressive eyes lifted to the shining
sky. There was nothing to suggest anything in the nature
of one of those rapid changes of weather so much a feature
of winter in this region, and the prospect seemed to satisfy
him. From the sky his glance drifted to the jagged horizon,
and here it searched closely in every direction. For a long
time he stood studying every rise and depression in the
glacial ocean of hills and valleys; then, slowly, his interest
began to wane.



Now a definite disappointment became apparent in the
frown that depressed his strong brows. He moved out from
the edge of the woods and skirted them until a fresh vista of
bald, snow-clad hills presented themselves to his searching
eyes. For a time his scrutiny lacked something of its
original interest. Then, quite suddenly, it became fixed on
one spot, a deep depression, shadowed, and definitely marked,
an almost black patch in the white setting of the surrounding
world.



In a moment all his interest had revived, and he concentrated
all his efforts to read the meaning of that which he
beheld.



"He wasn't lying, after all," he muttered at last. And
his words gave a key to his recent moments of waning
interest.



He knew that the black patch he was looking at was a bluff
of woods lying in the narrow valley between two high hills,
a bluff of woods such as those which lay behind him.
Whether they were larger, or just a small, isolated cluster of
trees did not concern him. He was watching a spiral of thin
smoke, a faint shadow against the dark backing, as it floated
upwards and drifted away, quite invisible after it broke the
sky line. He knew that this was the smoke Si-wash had told
him of. He knew, as Si-wash had known, that it was the
smoke of a camp fire. He wondered whose, and, wondering,
he moved out without any hesitation in its direction, determined
to ascertain whose hand had lit the fire; a matter
which had seemed all unnecessary to the Indian's mind.



Just for a moment he glanced again at the sun, and took
his bearings. Si-wash had said three miles at most. Three
miles; it was little enough to concern himself about. He
knew that unless he encountered unlooked-for difficulties he
would be able to cover the distance, and make the return
journey in less than four hours.



So he set off, adopting a course much as the crow might
fly. That was his way in all things. He rarely sought to
spare himself by seeking the easier route in anything. His
goal always assumed a definite point straight ahead of him,
so why make the journey longer for the sake of a little ease?
Time enough for such deviations when stress of circumstances
demanded.



His way took him down a long, easy slope, where, at
moments, banks of snow mounted up to many feet in height,
and at others the earth lay bare, swept clear by the force of
the recent storm. Then it was possible for him to travel
swiftly, nor was he put to inconvenience from the fact that
he was without his snowshoes.



The depression was quickly passed and terminated in the
abrupt rise of a low bald hill whose base was surrounded by
a low, shabby scrub. At first glance the hill had a curious
resemblance to a monk's shaven crown, but a closer inspection
revealed that here was one of those broken hills suggesting
the ruin of a one-time magnificent mountain, which must
have succumbed under the fierce blastings of one of Nature's
passionate moments. The bald crown was a broken sea of
torn and riven rocks, which might well have been the result
of gigantic operations with dynamite.



The obstruction gave him no pause. Again deviation
never entered his head. With infinite purpose he attacked
the ascent which amounted to a laborious and even perilous
struggle. There was no faltering, and soon he was so far
involved that any thought of yielding to the difficulties he
encountered became quite out of the question. To return
would have been far more difficult than to continue the
advance.



The ascent occupied an hour of great physical effort,
but at last he stood at the summit breathing hard from his
exertions. Here he paused and surveyed the distance.
Again was it characteristic of him that he had no longer
interest in his immediate surroundings, or the difficulties he
had already surmounted. His whole thought was for that
which lay ahead, for those difficulties which still remained
to be overcome.



The descent of the hill, though it appeared to be no mean
accomplishment, was far shorter, and far less abrupt than
the upward climb had been. Nor was he sorry for the
respite, while still there was no shrinking in him from whatever
hazard Nature might have chosen to offer. He had
calculated that such was the case, for the whole trend of
the land was upward, bearing on up to the crystal peak
between which the crowding woodland ahead lay pinched.
His eyes wandered on with his thoughts which carried him
out in the direction of the tiny ribbon of smoke, still gently
rising from the heart of the woods to vanish in the sparkling
air above.



He remained for one brief moment while he made a rough
estimate of the distance he had yet to go; then, without
wasting a precious moment, he dropped upon the first rugged
step of the descent. The work was harder than might have
been expected, far harder. And the rope he had brought
with him frequently stood him in good stead while making
those big drops, which, from the distance, seemed so insignificant
and easy. But it was never his way to consider
difficulties seriously until he found himself in their midst.
At all times the needs of the moment were sufficient, and he
was firm in the belief that there was no difficulty in human
life where an advantageous way out did not lay waiting for
the seeker. His mood was the dogged persistence which
urges a man on without consideration or thought for anything
else in the world but his own all-mastering purpose.



It was this mood which had first driven him to the northern
wilderness, where he hoped to acquire the necessary foundations
for his fortune in the least possible time. It was this
intensity of purpose which had blinded him to the possibilities
of burdening himself with the care of a woman. It was this
crude driving force which, in face of stupendous difficulties,
not to say impossibilities, had decided him to return on foot
to Sixty-mile Creek. These things were part of the man.
He could not help them.



So it was in the case of his search for this mysterious
camp. He was urged to make it, irresistibly urged, and he
could have given no definite reasons for his actions.



Slowly there came a change in the man's whole attitude.
It was a subtle change, and one wholly unrealized by himself.
As he gained way over the broken path before him
a strange eagerness became apparent in all his movements,
in his expression, in the quick, searching glance of his eyes.
The deliberate manner in which he had made the ascent now
gave way to an impatient eagerness which frequently placed
him at considerable risk, and even peril. Often, where the
slower process of the rope's assistance would have been
safest, he trusted to hands and feet, and even to a jump,
with a considerable uncertainty as to where he was going
to land. But he took the risks, urged on by this strange,
unacknowledged desire to reach his destination quickly.



The broken hill was left behind him after less than an
hour's hard struggle; and when, at last, he stood upon the
comparatively smooth upland, with the distant fringe of
woodlands high up above him, he realized that his estimate,
as had been Si-wash's, of the distance, was considerably at
fault. He had still full three miles to go amidst the hills
and valleys made by snow banks swept up by the storm,
before the mystery of that thread of smoke could be fully
solved.



But the way was easy, and he hurried on. The brief
day was passing rapidly. Strangely enough all thought of
time had passed from him. It no longer occurred to him
that he had to return to his own camp to make his preparations
for his contemplated journey back to the creek. He
had become solely absorbed with the quest in hand. That,
and that alone, seemed to matter.



Half an hour's tramping brought him within full and
intimate view of the edge of the woods; and, as he drew
near, a further change crept into his manner. Once he
paused, more than half hidden by a snow bank, and gazed
up at the towering crests of the aged pines. He was impressed.
These woods were of far greater extent than those
which had served him as a shelter from the storm. They
towered dizzily, and spread out an immense distance along
the sides of the two mountains, between which they had
seemed so pinched; and somehow their immensity depressed
him with a feeling of the smallness of human life.



It was from this moment that the fresh change in him
took place. He left the shelter of the snow bank with a
curious crouching gait, and eyes furtively watchful. The
reason of the change was quite unapparent, even to himself.
He knew that he was searching for a sight of fellow-creatures;
but what he did not know was that it was inspired
by an active instinct to avoid contact.



He crept on from the shelter of one snow bank to the
shelter of another. He moved along over the shallows of
snow so that his moccasined feet gave out no sound. And
his whole progress bespoke an almost frantic desire that his
approach should not be witnessed from the woods.



Nearer and nearer he drew, and, as the shadows came
down toward him, his pace increased almost to a run.
Finally the last sheltering snow bank was left behind and
a low broken scrub replaced it. He breathed a deep sigh;
the sigh of a man who is relieved beyond words. The gray,
familiar gloom of the forest overshadowed him, and he was
content. Just for a few moments he paused for breath.
Then his restless spirit urged him on, and, plunging forward,
the solemn twilight of the forest swallowed him up.



For quite a while he hurried on like a flitting shadow in
the midst of a world of shadows. Then, finally, he paused
listening. The grave-like silence was quite unbroken by any
sign of life. Nothing came to him stirring the echoes of that
ages-old world. He strained hard for some familiar sound
that might guide him to the spot where the mysterious camp
lay. But no such sound was forthcoming.






CHAPTER V



THE SHADOW OF DEATH



A deep stillness prevailed while the man stood in profound
contemplation of the figure beneath the covering of furs.
The silent woods suggested the calm of a shadowed sepulcher.
The shrouded figure lying at his feet completed the suggestion.



Tug's eyes, if unsympathetic, were at least anxious. The
sunken features of his companion filled him with a curious
feeling of superstitious awe at the stealing, subtle approach
of death. Death, in the abstract, had no terrors for him.
The sight of a life suddenly jolted out of earthly existence
would have disturbed him not at all; but this steady march,
this almost imperceptible progress, stirred those feelings of
superstition which underlie all human life.



He noted the hungry shadows of an unearthly blue which
surrounded the sunken eyes, and filled the hollow sockets.
The greenish tinge in the pallid flesh revolted him; the lips,
so drawn, with all their ruddy ripeness gone, left him with
a feeling of positive nausea; while the utter helplessness in
the way the trunk collapsed beyond the rough pillow supporting
the lolling head, left him shrinking at the thought
of the speeding life whose ebb he was powerless to check.



Well enough he knew that death was hovering well within
sight. Poor Charlie, the companion of his fortunes, was
rapidly passing away. There was no help he could bestow,
no real help. All he could do was to minister to each whim
expressed in the thin, struggling voice; for the rest the
march of Death must go on. For many days the end had
been steadily approaching, and now the icy breath in the
shadow of Death's hovering wings seemed to add a chill to
the wintry air, and freeze up the heart in his own robust
body.



Tug's expression was one of hopeless incompetence. He
wondered, as he had wondered for days, what he could do
to help the sufferer. He knew that pneumonia had laid its
clutch upon the poor wretch's lungs, and all treatment for it
was a riddle to which he found no answer.



His eyes lifted from the dying man, and he stared about
him vaguely. They took in the squatting dogs, reveling
in the comfort of the flickering firelight, well sheltered from
the breath of winter by the canvas screen he had erected
to shelter his sick companion. The sight of these luxuriating
beasts annoyed him; and, with a vicious kick at the nearest,
he sent them scuttling into the background.



Then he glanced at his diminished store of wood. Here lay
the only service his helplessness permitted his thought to
rise to. Yes, he could still strive to keep the cold, that
stealing cold which Charlie had cried out against so bitterly,
that cold which he had declared had eaten into his very
bones, from his dying friend. So he moved over to the pile
and replenished the fire with liberal hand, till the last stick
in his store had found its way to the hungry flames. Then,
with a curious patience, almost gentleness, he once more
tried to administer the fragrant, but less savory soup, which
was always kept simmering in the boiler on the fire.



It was curious to watch this powerful specimen of virile,
unsympathetic manhood endeavoring to assume the indescribable
gentleness of the nurse. It fitted him as ill as
anything well could, yet he did his best. And no one knew
better than he that his patient was beyond such clumsy,
well-meaning efforts. The lips remained closed, as did the
sunken eyes, and no words of rough encouragement seemed
to penetrate to the dull brain behind them.



At last Tug put the pannikin aside, and dropped the tin
spoon with a clatter. He could do no more. Again he rose
to his feet and stood helplessly by.



"Poor devil," he muttered. "His number's plumb up."



At the sound of his voice there came a slight movement of
the lolling head. Then the great eyes opened slowly, and
stared up at the muttering man in an uncanny, unseeing
fashion.



"Sure."



The one word, spoken in the faintest of whispers, told
Tug that the dying man's intellect remained unimpaired,
and the knowledge left him annoyed with himself that he
had spoken aloud.



"I'm kind of sorry, Charlie," he blundered. "I didn't
just guess you could hear."



"I've       known it       days." The other struggled painfully
with his words.



Tug had no answer for him, and Charlie went on in his
halting fashion.



"It       don't       matter. I was thinking of my       folks."



"Sure. I know." Tug sighed in a relief he could not
have explained.



He waited.



For some time the sick man made no answer. It almost
seemed as if his straining intellect had been overtaxed, for
the glazing eyes remained immovable, and, to the waiting
man, he might have been already dead.



He bent over him, his anxiety driving him to reassure
himself. It was his movement that again broke the deathly
spell. Slowly a gleam of intelligence struggled into the
staring eyes, and the man's lips moved.



"It's my share       my       share       of the gold." He gave a
short quick gasp. "I want them       to       have       it. It       was       for
them."



Tug nodded.



"I know. You always said you wanted it for your folks.
I'll       see they get it. Is       there anything else?"



"No. Say              "



Tug waited. As the silence remained he urged the dying
man.



"Yes?"



"It's no good. They       they       won't       get       it."



"What d'you mean       they won't get it?" Tug's face
flushed. He felt that his promise was doubted. A promise
given in all good faith, and under the spell of that dreadful
thrill, which never fails to make itself felt in a promise to
the dying. "I've given my word. Isn't that sufficient?"



"Sure. But              " The man broke off gasping.



After a while the struggle eased and his whispering voice
became querulous.



"It's       it's       cold. The       the fire's going       out."



Tug glanced quickly at the fire. It was burning brightly.
Then he remembered he had used up the last of the fuel.



From the fire he turned to the dying man again. He
understood. It was the march of Death, that cold he complained
of. His hard face struggled painfully for an expression
of sympathy.



"Yes," he said. "I'll go and collect more wood. I       I
didn't notice the fire going down. We must keep the cold
out of you."



The lolling head made a negative movement.



"You       can't. It's       it's       all       over me. I'll              " Another
shuddering sigh, half shiver, half gasping for breath,
passed through the man's body. Then the thin eyelids
closed, and no effort on Tug's part could produce any
further sign of life.



For a long time he endeavored, striving by words of encouragement
to persuade the weary eyes to open. But they
remained obstinately shut. The man's breathing was of the
faintest, too; a sign which Tug felt was full of omen. He
hated his own helplessness; and he cursed under his breath
the madness of his attempt to save his companion by making
this wild journey. Back there on Sixty-mile Creek he felt
that though the man had been doomed, this sudden collapse
into pneumonia might have been averted. He had been
foolish, criminally foolish to make this mad attempt; and
yet              



He moved away. No, he could do nothing else, so he
might just as well go and gather wood. He had half the
day in front of him. It would be better to do something
useful than to remain there watching and talking to a man
practically dead. Anyway it would be more wholesome.
He knew that the dread of Charlie's death was growing on
him. For some unaccountable reason it was attacking his
nerves. The woods seemed to be haunted with strange
shadows he had never felt the presence of before. He must
certainly get to work.



From the far side of the fire he glanced back at the ominous
pile of blankets and furs. He saw the man's head move.
It lolled over to the other side. It was the only sign of life
he gave. The eyes remained closed, and the ashen lips were
tightly shut.



The movement, the vision of that deathly figure suddenly
set the strong man's skin creeping. He hurried away,
almost precipitately.






CHAPTER VI



ALL-MASTERING PASSION



Not a movement disturbed the tomb-like peace of the
aged woods; no sound broke the profound silence. It was
as if even Nature herself were held in supreme awe of the
presence of Death.



In the absence of all restraint Tug's dogs crept toward
the fire, and crouched within the radius of its pleasant
warmth, their great muzzles resting between outstretched
paws, their fierce eyes staring steadily at the ruddy flicker
of the leaping flames. Maybe they were dreaming of those
savage ancestors from whom they sprang; maybe memories
of fierce battles, of gluttonous orgies, of desperate labors,
were crowding pleasantly under the charm of the moment's
ease. But twitching ears bespoke that curious canine alertness
which is never relaxed.



The moments passed rapidly; moments of delight which
rarely fall to the lot of the wolfish trail dog. It was an
oasis of leisure in lives spent betwixt the labor of the trail
and the settling of fierce quarrels, which, to the human
mind, possess no apparent cause.



Then again, in the briefest of seconds, the whole scene was
changed. It came as one of the dogs lifted its head gazing
intently at the pile of furs under which the sick man lay.



It was a tense moment. Every muscle in the creature's
powerful body was set quivering, and a strange, half pathetic,
half savage whimper escaped its twitching nostrils. Every
head about the fire was abruptly lifted, every ear was set
pricked alertly, and each pair of fierce eyes stared hard in
a similar direction.



There was no sign of movement among the furs, no change
of any sort, nothing whatsoever to arouse such tense ferocity,
even alarm. But those things were there in every eye, in the
pose of each savage creature, in the slow rising of harsh
manes until they bristled high upon every shoulder.



One dog rose to its feet.



Each dog rose slowly in turn; slowly and watchfully.
And now a further change became apparent in their attitudes.
All ferocity suddenly died out, leaving only alarm,
a desperate, currish terror. Manes still bristled like the
teeth of fine combs, but ears were flattened to lowered heads,
and great whipping tails curled under, between crouching
hind legs, while lifted lips left gleaming fangs displayed in
currish snarls.



Yet the sick man's bed at which they stared still remained
undisturbed. The man beneath the blankets had not stirred.
He was still, so still. It was as if these brutish eyes beheld
something invisible to the human eye; something which
crushed their hearts under an overwhelming burden of fear.



For nearly a minute the statue-like tenseness of attitude
remained. Then the spell was broken. One dog, the largest
of all, the leader of the team, the oldest in the craft of the
trail, oldest in years, and, possibly, far the oldest in canine
wisdom, squatted upon its haunches and licked its lips. One
by one the rest followed its example, and, finally, with sighs
as of relief, they returned again to their luxurious basking in
the firelight.



But the leader did not attempt to return to the charmed
circle of the fire. It seemed as if he realized a sense of
responsibility. Presently he rose, and, with gingerly tiptoeing,
moved away from his companions. He edged warily
toward the sick man's bed. He drew near, snuffing at the
air, ready to draw back instantly should his wisdom so
prompt him. Nearer and nearer he drew, and with lowered
muzzle he snuffed at the edge of the bed. With stealthy,
creeping gait he made his way toward the pillow, snuffing as
he went. Then, as his greenish eyes rested upon the man's
lolling head, he again squatted upon his haunches and licked
his lips. The next moment a low whimper broke the silence.
It grew louder. Finally the dog's great head was lifted, its
muzzle was thrown high into the air, and the whimper was
changed into a long-drawn-out howl of amazing piteousness.
It was doling the death warning of its race.



A chorus of whimpered acknowledgment came from the
fire. The other dogs stirred restlessly, but that was all.
The fire was too pleasant, such moments as were just now
theirs were all too few in their laborious lives for them to
emulate the mourning of their leader. So they resettled
themselves and went on with their dreaming.



Then the mourner gave up his office. This tacit refusal
to join him had rendered his position untenable. So, not
without resentment in his heart, he, too, returned to the
fire, and, with a sense of duty duly performed, once more
buried his nose between his paws, and gave himself up to
profound meditation.



But it was not for long. Within five minutes every dog
was on his feet again thrilling with a wild feeling of passionate
resentment. There was no mistaking their mood at
this fresh disturbance. There was no craven slinking, there
were no currish snarls. Each dog was on his toes ready to
battle with a tangible foe, such as they now anticipated.



For some moments the reason of the disturbance was not
apparent. Their supersensitive hearing reached beyond
the range of that of their human masters. But at last the
sound of muffled footsteps awoke dimly the echoes of the
woods. A man was approaching. He was walking swiftly,
moving along with the soft crunch of hurrying, moccasined
feet.



His shadowy figure loomed up out of the gray twilight of
the woods; and, just beyond the camp, he halted and hurled
a string of deep-voiced curses at the growling dogs. Instantly
the chorus of canine displeasure ceased, and the
creatures backed away from the forbidden pleasures of the
fire. These animals acknowledged no definite master, but
they obeyed man. For such was their teaching upon the
trail.



Now the man came on fearlessly, searching the camp with
quick, furtive eyes that had no scruples. It seemed deserted,
except for the dogs, the memory of whose presence about
the fire further convinced him that it must be so. Without
hesitation he began a closer examination; and the first thing
to interest him was the sled, with its rough harness spread
out just where the dogs had been freed from their traces.
Instant recognition leaped into his eyes.



"Tug's!" he murmured. Then, after a pause, he added,
"I wonder."



His interest rose swiftly, and his quick-moving eyes
passed on to the bed, with its pile of furs. Just for a
moment he hesitated. It was almost as if some premonition
of what lay beneath them gave him pause. Then, with a
movement almost of defiance, he stepped toward it and
dropped on one knee beside the pillow. Again there came a
pause, but his turned ear explained it. He was listening.
Listening for the sound of breathing. But no sound came
to him; and, at last, with no great gentleness, he turned back
the cover.



An ashen face with staring sightless eyes looked up into
his; and for long moments he remained bent over it, lost
in a profound study of what he beheld. Then slowly he
raised one powerful hand, and, with something like shrinking,
pressed an outstretched finger against the dropped jaw. It
yielded to his touch, and the mouth shut, but the moment
the pressure was relaxed it slowly reopened, and resumed
its deathly gape.



"Dead!" he muttered; and the meaning of the camp
puzzled him no longer.



He raised his head and glanced from the empty sled,
empty of all but the store of dog food, to the tent, and a
wild passionate light shone in his eyes. His whole expression
had changed, merged into one of desperate desire. The
dead man was instantly forgotten. All speculations were
forgotten for the moment, absorbed in the thought of the
possibility of the return of the living Tug. His busy brain
was full of excitement which set his pulses hammering, and
the blood rushing through his veins. But he had not stirred
from his place beside the dead.



He turned his head much in the manner of a man hunted,
and dreading his own shadow. His eyes peered out into
the gray twilight of the forest. He was listening, too.
Listening for that sound which was to tell him of the return
of the owner of the camp. But no sound reached him. He
saw that the dogs had crawled back to the fire, and their
attitude further told him that they were still unaware of
any approach.



His eyes came back to the tent and a torrent of thought
poured its flood through channels which seemed bursting
under the sudden pressure; and through it all passed a vague
wonder as to what God or devil had inspired him to seek
out the mystery of this camp.



But he sought no answer. He desired no answer. He
knew that an irresistible passion was driving him, a passion
he had no desire to thwart, a passion he hugged to himself
and whose influence warmed him to an almost insane joy.
And under its strange driving he became active. A hundred
thoughts swept through his brain, each finding expression
in his swiftly moving eyes.



Again he surveyed the camp. The dogs still hugged the
now low-burning fire. From the fire he turned to the spot
where the fuel store had evidently been kept. There was no
more wood, and the axe was gone, and thus he accounted for
Tug's absence. Furthermore he understood that he might
return at any moment. Therefore if he were to act at all it
must be at once.



He rose to his feet and moved swiftly across to the tent,
and as he went the memory of all he had lost upon the trail
swept over him. He told himself he had been robbed, robbed
just as surely as if human hands had wrested from him the
prize he had toiled so desperately to win. This came in
answer to the voice of conscience; but conscience had no
power against the driving force which was the whole substance
of his life. Some strange fate had driven him toward
an opportunity that he was not the man to miss. Charlie,
that mild, harmless partner of Tug was dead; and Tug       well,
Tug was probably living, but he had never been a friend
of his. He had always felt subtly antagonistic toward him.
What mattered if       if he robbed him? Yes, that was what he
intended. He would rob him, and              



He raised the flap of the tent and passed within, letting
the curtain fall behind him.



Not a sound broke the stillness outside. The dogs stirred
without sound. Their ease was passing. It was almost as
if they knew that the law of club and trace was soon to claim
them again.



In a few moments Leo reappeared. A fresh change had
come over him. His work was in full progress, and now the
light in his eyes was less straining, less passionate. Now he
was once more the man of purpose, keen, swift-thinking,
ready. The passionate obsession that was his was once
more under control, its desire having been satisfied in the
acquisition of the bag of gold he now hugged in his arms.
The keenest essence of his thought was at work. Possibility
after possibility opened out in a series of pictures before
his mind's eye, and, with swift slashes, like the progress of
the surgeon's knife, his brain cut them about, extracting
every detail of importance, assimilating the living, the vital
points.



Though powerless to resist the temptation held out to
him, he knew full well its meaning. He knew what possible
consequences hovered on the horizon of his future. The
morality of his act concerned him not at all, but those other
considerations demanded his closest attention. All his plans
must be reorganized. Now there was no need to return for
laborious years on Sixty-mile Creek, and a great joy flooded
his heart at the thought. He could take up his plans where
they had been broken by the disaster in the storm. But there
must be a difference. There must be considerable modification.
He thought of Audie, and at once the necessary modifications
unrolled before the keen pressure of thought he was
laboring under.



Audie and the Indian could still go on, he thought, as
his eyes surveyed the five great husky dogs with satisfaction
All that had been arranged for her could remain       for the
present. She was still to remain a part of his life. He
had given his promise, and he was more than satisfied to
fulfill it when the time in his affairs came for such fulfillment.
Then there was Tug. Tug must be provided for; and as the
thought came to him a grim, half smile twisted the corners
of his compressed lips. Yes, he would leave him written
instructions, which, if he knew the man, would not be ignored.



These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind in the
midst of action. He saw the whole situation as plainly and
simply as though Providence itself had ordained the whole
scheme. There was only one thing that could upset it       Tug's
premature return. But he set the thought aside. He
would not contemplate it. That must take care of itself.
He would deal with it when it occurred.



Reluctantly enough he bestowed Tug's store of gold upon
the sled, lashing it doubly secure after his disastrous experiences.
Then he stored bedding and food upon the vehicle.
He provided a sufficient but light enough load, for he knew
he must travel fast and reach the coast long before those
others. Si-wash was behind him, and Si-wash knew every
inch of the trail, whereas he only had a vague knowledge
which might fail him at any moment.



Within half an hour the pack on the sled was complete,
and the great dogs stood in their harness ready to do the
behests of their new master as willingly as those of the old.
But the last item of his program still remained to be attended
to. Leo searched his pockets and found the stub of
a pencil, but no paper rewarded his efforts. For a moment
he was at a loss. Then he bethought him of the tent, and
passed beneath the flap. In a few moments he returned with
a sheet of waterproof paper, such as is used to line biscuit
boxes, and he sat down on his pack and began to write. And
all the time he was writing the grim twist of his lips remained.
He seemed to find some sort of warped humor in what he
was doing.



His writing finished he secured the paper on the front of
the tent where it must easily be seen. Then he stood off
to read it.





"My Dear Tug;



"I find it necessary to commandeer your gold. Mine is at
the bottom of a precipice ten miles back, if you care to make
the exchange. Si-wash will tell you where. I suggest you
either wait here till they come along, or go back to my camp
in the woods, beyond the broken hill, and join Si-wash there.
Anyway you can travel down with him. They have dogs and
camp outfit, and I have left here sufficient food, etc., for your
needs. I have found you a better friend than I ever hoped to.
So long. Good luck.



"Leo."





Leo read his note over with evident satisfaction. He had
no scruples whatever. He saw in one direction only.
Straight ahead of him, his eyes turning neither to the right
nor to the left of the path of life he had marked out for himself.
He believed that the battle must always go to the
strong; sentimentality, pity, were feelings he did not acknowledge.
He knew of their existence, and deplored them
as the undermining germ responsible for the disease of decadence
which has wrought the destruction of more than half
the great empires in the world's history. And what the
world's history had not taught him he had gleaned from the
lives of great men, as he saw greatness. Greatness to him
meant conquest, and the world's conquerors had been men
utterly devoid of all the tenderer feelings of humanity. They
had embarked upon their careers thrilling with the lust of
the ancient savage, or the ruthless courage of the animal
kingdom, qualities which he regarded as the essence of life, as
Nature had intended it. So he gave himself up to a similar
course. He would rather be a king by savage conquest, than
the hereditary monarch of a race whose vitality is slowly
being sapped by the vampire of sentimentality.



He picked up Tug's gee-pole, and gave one swift final
glance over the camp. Then, stooping, he covered the
staring face of the dead man with a blanket and turned to
the dogs.



A sharp command and the traces were drawn taut. Another,
and the journey had begun. The dogs, fresh from
their week of idleness, strained at their breast harness, and
the sled moved slowly, heavily over the dry bed of the forest.
But it soon gained impetus, and the twilit shadows of the
primordial forest quickly swallowed it up.



As the scrunch of the pine-cones under the steel runners
died away the calm of ages once more settled upon the woods.
The dying fire burned lower and lower, and the deathly stillness
was unbroken even by a crackle of sputtering flame.
The solitude was profound and full of melancholy.



The minutes crept on. They lengthened into an hour.
Then far in the distance, it seemed, came the soft pad as
of some prowling forest beast. But the pad quickly changed
to the soft scrunch of moccasined feet, and, presently, a
man, bearing a great load of wood upon his broad back,
came on through the dusky aisles of the forest.






CHAPTER VII



DEAD FIRES



Tug did most things with a smile; but it was never the
happy smile of a pleasant nature. Nor was it even a mask.
It was an expression of his attitude toward the world,
toward all mankind. His eyes conveyed insolent contempt;
and his smile was one of the irritating irony and cynicism
which permeated all his thoughts and feelings.



But his smile was for those looking on. There were times
when another man looked out of the same eyes; a man whose
cold heart loomed up ugly and threatening out of those
deeper recesses of feeling which the shrewd might guess at,
but were rarely admitted to.



Tug was a man whose selfish desire was above and before
all things. He was of that temper which saw injustice and
wrong in every condition of life obtaining, in every established
institution of man, even in the very edicts of Nature.
It was impossible for him to see anything but through the
jaundiced light of his own utter selfishness. Every condition
over which he had no control contained a threat, which, in
his view of things, was directed against the fulfillment of his
desires. He wanted the world and all its possibilities for
comfort, pleasure, profit, for his own, without the effort of
making it so; and had he obtained it he would undoubtedly
have grumbled that there was no fence set up as a bar to all
trespassers upon his property.



He detested the thought that others held possessions
which he had not. But it was not his way to air his grievance
from a personal point of view. He adopted a subtler
course, and a common enough course among men of his
class. He cloaked his own selfishness under a passionate
plea for those others similarly debarred, railing at the injustice
of the distribution of the world's benefits, and storming
against class distinctions and all the lesser injustices
which went to make up the dividing line between capacity
and incapacity. In short he was, though as yet unprofessed,
a perfect example of the modern socialist whose
utter selfishness prompts methods and teachings which are
the profoundest outrage against the doctrines of the Divine
Master, who demanded that man should love his neighbor
as himself.



Tug had not the moral courage for an open fight, and
here he was far inferior to the greater adventurer, Leo.
Leo would drive roughshod over everybody and everything;
the whole wide world if necessary. He would gain his end
by the frank courage of the fighter, which must always
command a certain admiration, even if condemnation goes
with it. But Tug had no such qualities. It was for him
to wriggle and twist, using anybody and anything, by subtle
underhand workings, to achieve a similar purpose. But
again, even in his purpose he was Leo's inferior. Leo's
desire was for victory, victory in the great struggle of
modern life, and not for the fleshpots which that victory
would entitle him to. Tug desired victory, too, but it was
that he might taste the sweetest morsels which those fleshpots
contained. Whichever way the struggle went there
could be little doubt as to who would claim the applause
from the balconies at the fall of the curtain.



When Tug reached his camping ground he found himself
in a land of dead fires. The cold, gray ashes were everywhere
about him. Life had gone; hope had fled. And the
charred embers of the camp-fire in the center of it were the
symbol of the ruin.



His quick eyes took in the picture, while his cold heart
read something of the meaning of what he beheld. The
absence of his dogs first drew his attention, and this was
swiftly followed by the realization that his sled was nowhere
to be seen. Then his eyes caught the notice which was
written on biscuit paper and secured to the front of his
tent. He threw down his burden of dead wood, which had
still remained upon his back, and stood in front of the
message Leo had left him.



For long minutes he stood while the words, the bitter,
ironical sentences, sank deep into his selfish heart. Here he
was treated to the very attitude he loved to assume himself,
and it lashed him to a cold, deadly fury. Again and again
he read the message and each time he read it he found fresh
fuel with which to build the icy fire of his rage. The theft
itself was maddening, but strangely enough the tone of
impudent triumph in which Leo addressed him drove him
hardest. All that was worst in him was stirred, and the
worst of this man was something so malignant and unsavory
that the absent Leo might well have shrunk before its pursuing
shadow.



No word passed his lips; no expression changed his features,
except for the sudden cold pallor which had spread
itself over them. Words rarely expressed his deeper feelings;
he was not the man to storm in his despair. His whole
mind and body were concentrated in a deadly desire to find
a means of coming up with the man who had injured him.
With each passing moment the words of the message
gravened themselves deeper and deeper upon his mind, until
they filled his whole thought, and left him panting for revenge.
As long as he lived that message would float before
his mind's eye, that message which told him of the dead fires
about him, that message staring out at him upon the wreck
of all his hopes. Yes, as long as he lived that moment would
stay with him. As long as he lived he would wait for the
ruin, even the life of the man who had wronged him.



Suddenly he made a movement with his moccasined heel.
It was his only expression. The pine-cones crushed under
it; and to him it was the life of the man, Leo, he was crushing
out.



With a steady hand he reached out and removed the paper
from its fastenings. He folded it deliberately, carefully, and
bestowed it in an inner pocket. Somehow its possession had
suddenly become precious to him, and a certain contentment
was his as he turned away and seated himself on an upturned
box.



It might have seemed curious that he made no attempt
to search his camp. It would have been natural enough.
But that was the man. In his mind there was no need for
search. The message, he knew, told the truth, and the blow
had fallen upon a nature that would not uselessly rack its
feelings by vain hopes such as a search might inspire. Besides,
he knew this man Leo. He knew him, and hated him;
and in his hatred he believed that the thought of his vain,
searching would give his despoiler malicious pleasure.



For long he sat there before the dead fire. His comrade
remained unheeded. He was thinking, thinking desperately
in his cold fashion. And curiously enough the possession
of that paper helped to inspire him. Already he contemplated
it as a sort of token that, in the end, he would return
an hundredfold the injury done him. Yes, it should be
his mascot through life, it should be a guiding star to his
whole career. It should be his inspiration when the moment
came. No thought of any law entered his mind. He knew
that the crimes of this bitter northern world were beyond
the reach of the laws of civilized man. No, the only law
that could serve him was the law that each made for himself.
He would make his own law       when the time came.
There would be no mercy. Mercy? He smiled. And it
was a smile so cruel and cold that it might well have damped
the courage of the great Leo himself.



Night closed down before Tug stirred from his seat; and
when the movement came it was inspired by the bitter cold
which had eaten into his stiffening joints, and the gnawings
of hunger to which he had been so long oblivious.



He rose abruptly. The present was with him again, the
dread present of the bitter northern trail; and he set to
work with all the deliberation of a man who understands the
needs of the moment, and has no thought beyond them. He
rekindled the fire, and boiled the water for his tea. He prepared
the dried fish and cooked it. Then he sat down and
devoured his meal with all the relish of a hungry man without
a care in the world.



But he did not seek his blankets afterwards. The fire had
warmed his bones, and the food had satisfied his craving
stomach. So he remained where he was, smoking and thinking;
dreaming the ugly dreams of a mind devoid of any of
the tenderer thoughts of humanity.



Hours passed, and the long sleepless night dragged on
toward a gray, hopeless dawn; and, by the time the black
woods began to change their hue, and the gray to creep
almost imperceptibly down the aged aisles, his last plans
were complete.



Then he arose and stretched himself. He put his pipe
away, and replenished the fire with the last of the wood,
finally setting water thereon to boil. Then, picking up his
axe, he moved off into the deeps of the wood.



In half an hour he returned with a burden of rough-hewn
stakes which he flung down beside the fire, while he prepared
his breakfast. He devoured his meal hurriedly, and within
another half hour was at work upon his final tasks.



He stored all his property inside the tent, removing the
furs and blankets from his dead comrade. It almost seemed
like desecration. Yet Tug knew what he was at. It would
not do to leave the body encased in warm furs. The man
would have to be buried       later. In the meantime the cold
would freeze the body, and preserve it until such time.



Now the purpose of his stakes became evident. Even
Tug, selfish and callous as he was, acknowledged his duties
to the dead. He knew the prowling scavengers of the forests
too well to leave his comrade without sufficient protection.
So he proceeded to secure the body under a cage of timber
which would defy the attacks of marauding carnivora.



With Charlie left secure his work was complete. Broad
daylight was shining among the rugged crowns of towering
pines. The moment had come for his departure. He would
obey the letter of Leo's instructions. He would follow the
path he had marked out for him. Afterwards he would
choose his own path; a path which he knew, somewhere in
the future, near or far, would eventually bring him within
striking distance of the quarry he intended to hunt down.






CHAPTER VIII



SI-WASH CHUCKLES



It was Si-wash who first witnessed the approach of the
newcomer; and he at once realized that it was not the return
of his friend, Leo, the man whom he still liked, in spite of
the madness which he believed now possessed him.



So he watched thoughtfully from the shadow of the fringe
of the forest. He peered out over the white plain upon
which an ineffective sun poured its steely rays, while he
studied the details of figure and gait, which, in a country
where contact with his fellows was limited, were not likely
to leave him in doubt for long.



Presently he vanished within the woods. He went to
convey his news to the waiting woman, the woman whose
heart was full of a dread she could not shake off, whose love
was silently calling, calling for the return of the man who
was her whole world.



But his news must be told in his own way, a way which,
perhaps, only an Indian, and those whose lives are spent
among Indians, can understand.



He came to the fire and sat down, squatting upon his
haunches, and remained silent for some minutes. Then he
picked up a red-hot cinder and lit his black clay pipe, which
he produced from somewhere amidst the furs which encased
his squat body.



"We go bimeby," he said, after a long pause. "No storm       no
snow. Him very fine. Good."



Audie's brooding eyes lifted from the fire to the Indian's
broad face. All her fear, all her trouble was shining in
their depths. The man saw and understood. But he did
not comment.



"We can't go       yet," she said. "We must wait. Leo will
come back. Oh, I'm sure he'll come back."



The Indian puffed at his pipe, and finally spat a hissing
stream into the fire.



"Maybe," he said.



The woman's face flushed.



"Maybe? Of course he'll come back," she cried with
heat. "He       he has gone to collect wood."



The Indian nodded and went on smoking.



"Him fetch wood. Sure," he said presently. "Him go
day       night       morning. Si-wash fetch wood. One hour       two       three.
Then Si-wash come back. Si-wash not crazy."



Suddenly Audie sprang to her feet. Her eyes flashed,
and a fierce anger swept through her whole body.



"Leo is not crazy. Don't dare to say he is," she cried
vehemently. "I       I could kill you for saying it."



The Indian gave no sign before the woman's furious
threat. He smoked on, and when she had once more dropped
to her seat, and the hopeless light in her eyes had once more
returned, he removed his pipe from his mouth.



"Si-wash       you kill 'em. It no matter. Leo, him crazy
still. You stop here       an' freeze. So. It much no good."



The man's good humor was quite unruffled, and Audie, in
spite of her brave defence of her lover, despairingly buried
her face in her hands.



"But he will come back, Si-wash!" she cried haltingly.
"Say he will. You know him. You understand him. He
must come back. Say he must. He can never travel this
country on foot, without food or shelter. Oh, say he must
come back!"



But Si-wash was not to be cajoled from his conviction.
He saw the woman's misery, but it meant nothing to his
unsentimental nature. Leo had gone. Well, why should
she worry? There were other men in the world. This is
what he felt, but he would not have expressed it so. Instead
of that he merely shook his head, and spoke between the
puffs of his reeking pipe.



"Leo no come. But the other, him come. Tug, him come
quick. Maybe him speak of Leo."



In a flash the girl's beautiful eyes shot a gleaming inquiry
into the man's coppery face.



"Tug? Tug coming here? It's       it's you who're crazy.
Tug is miles away. He must be getting near the coast by
now. He must be safe by now, safe with his precious gold."



"Maybe him not safe. Maybe him lose him gold, too."



"You mean              ?"



Audie caught her breath as she left her inquiry unfinished.



"Nothing. All same Tug him come here. I see him.
Hark? Sho! That him       he mak noise."



The Indian turned slowly round and stared out into the
twilit woods. Audie followed the direction of his gaze and
sat spellbound, listening to the sound of hurrying feet as
they crushed the brittle underlay of the woods. The
Indian's dogs, too, had become alert. They were on their
toes, with bristling manes and deep-throated grumbling at
the intrusion.



As Tug came up Si-wash rose and clubbed the dogs
cordially. In a moment they had resumed their places
beyond the fire circle, and, squatting on their haunches,
licked their lips and yawned indifferently.



"Tug!"



Audie was on her feet staring at the apparition of the man
she had believed was even now nearing the coast.



Nor did the man's usual ironical smile fail him.



"Sure. Didn't you guess I'd get around after       what has
happened?"



Audie eyed him blankly as he waited for her to speak.
The Indian, with his eyes fixed upon the fire, had not stirred
from his seat. For the moment he was forgotten by these
white people. He moved now. It was a slight movement.
Very slight. He merely thrust one of his lean hands inside
his furcoat.



His movement was quite unnoticed by the others, and as
Audie stared, quite at a loss for words, the man went on       



"Well? He's got away with it. Maybe you're       satisfied."



Tug's smile was unequal to the task. The cold rage
under it made its way into his eyes. And as she listened a
curious change crept into Audie's eyes, too. Si-wash, with
his attention apparently on the fire, was yet quite aware of
the change in both, and his hand remained buried in the
bosom of his furcoat.



Audie had suddenly become very cool. She pointed at
the box which had been Leo's seat.



"You'd better sit down," she said coldly. "You seem to
have something to tell me."



"Tell you?" Tug laughed. "Do you need telling?" he
asked, as he dropped upon the seat.



Audie resumed her place at the opposite side of the fire.



The Indian smoked on.



"You'd best tell us all you've got to tell," Audie said,
with cold severity. "At the present moment you appear to
be quite mad or       foolish."



Her manner had the effect of banishing the man's hateful
smile. He stared at her incredulously, and, from her icy
face, his eyes wandered to the motionless figure of the silent
Indian.



"What the hell!" he cried suddenly. "Do you want to
tell me that you don't know what Leo's done? Do you want
to tell me the whole lousy game isn't a plant, put up by the
three of you? Do you want to tell me              ?"



"I want to tell you, you're talking like a skunk. If you've
got anything to tell us tell it in as few words as possible, or       get
out back to your camp."



It was a different woman talking now; a very different
woman to the forlorn creature who had appealed to Si-wash
a few minutes ago. Just for a second the Indian's eyes
flashed a look in her direction, and it was one of cordial
approval.



But neither of the others saw it, and if they had it is
doubtful if either would have understood. For the mind of
Si-wash was one of those deep, silent pools, far more given
to reflection than revealing their own secrets.



Tug stared brutally into the woman's face. Audie was
displaying a side to her character he had never witnessed
before. She was alone with him       the Indian didn't count
in his reckoning       she had no hesitation in dictating to him,
even, as he chose to regard it, insulting him. His astonishment
gave him pause, and he pulled himself together. Then
he found himself obeying her in a way he had never thought
of doing.



Suddenly he thrust his hand into the bosom of his clothing
and withdrew it swiftly. His whole action was the impulsive
result of a rush of passionate feeling. Nor did it require
his words to tell of the condition of mind he was laboring
under.



"Read that," he cried furiously, "if you are as ignorant
of his doings as you make out. Read it, and       and be
damned."



He flung out his arm across the fire, his hand grasping
the biscuit paper on which the fateful message was written.
Quite undisturbed by his brutality Audie took the paper and
unfolded it.



"It was left fastened on the front of my tent while I was
away fetching wood," Tug went on bitterly. "I came back
to find my dogs gone, my sled, half my stores, Charlie dead,
he had been dying for a week, and       and that paper. Read
it       curse it, read for yourself."



The Indian never once lifted his eyes from the fire, the
warmth of which was an endless source of comfort to him.
He was thinking, thinking of many things in the deep, silent
way of his race.



Tug waited impatiently while the woman devoured the
contents of the message. She read it once       twice       even a
third time through; and while she read, though her expression
remained the same, all her emotions were stirred to fever
heat. She was thinking swiftly, eagerly, her brain quickened
to a pitch it had never realized before. Her love for Leo
was urging her the more fully to grasp the position in which
his latest act had placed him.



This outrage against the man, Tug, in no way lessened her
concern for her lover, for his welfare. The primitive woman
was always uppermost in her. She cared not a jot that
Tug had been despoiled. Leo was well, Leo was alive and
safe. But was he safe       now?



A sudden alarm along fresh lines startled her. The
meaning of what she read took a fresh complexion. Leo
had robbed       robbed this man. What must follow if it were
known?



For a moment this alarm shuddered through her body.
Then she steadied herself. Her mind suddenly became very
clear and decided. She suddenly saw her course clear before
her, and her voice broke the tense silence round the crackling
fire. She read the message for the fourth time. Read it
aloud slowly.



As she proceeded the impassive face of the Indian remained
unchanged. He was listening       listening acutely,
but so still, so indifferent was his attitude that the chafing
Tug scarcely realized his presence.



Audie's voice ceased, and for a moment no one spoke.
Thin with a muttered imprecation Tug held out his hand.



"Give me the                paper," he cried roughly.



Audie did not appear to hear him.



"Pass it over!" he demanded, still more roughly.



The woman looked up at him. Then she held the paper
out, as though to pass it across to his outstretched hand.
The next moment it dropped from her fingers and fluttered
into the heart of the fire.



With a wild ejaculation Tug sprang to rescue it, but
even as he rose to his feet he stood transfixed. The muzzle
of a revolver was covering him, and behind the muzzle was
the copper-hued visage of the forgotten Si-wash.



"Let 'em burn," he said, in his low guttural tones. "Him
writing heap bad med'cine."



The paper curled up and burst into flame. Tug, furious
but helpless, watched the hungry flames devour it. Then,
as it crumbled away into the red heart of the fire, Si-wash
returned to his seat. But his revolver remained upon his
knee, and his thin, tenacious fingers gripped the butt of it
firmly.



"Si-wash is right," said Audie coldly. She had not risen
from her seat. "Leo was foolish to write that. Still, I am
glad       now       that he did. It has told me what to do. You
see, he said nothing when he went from here, and I thought
I should never see him again. Now I know that I shall.
Now I know that he is well and safe       yes, safe, since that
paper is destroyed. Well"       she looked her visitor squarely
in the eyes       "what are you going to do? You are welcome
to avail yourself of our transport, as Leo suggests       under
conditions."



Tug's fury held him silent. His busy brain was searching
for a means to escape from the dictation of this woman,
for a means by which to assume domination of the position
for himself. As yet he could see none.



So Audie went on with the tacit approval of her faithful
comrade.



"You can travel with us, but you will carry no firearms.
You see, I don't anticipate that your feelings are particularly
kindly toward us. Anyway we'll take no chances. You
can go home to your camp now. To-morrow morning, if the
weather holds, you can join us. We'll meet you in the open,
somewhere near your camp. Mind, in the open, and you'll
come to us with your hands up. We shall then search you
for weapons. After that, if things are satisfactory, we'll
take your outfit on our sled, and you can travel with us.
Remember, Leo's welfare is my one care. Well?"



Tug rose. In a moment the Indian's gun was covering
him.



"Look 'im over for gun       now," Si-wash said, addressing
Audie in his brief guttural fashion.



Audie nodded.



"You'd best put up your hands, Tug," she said, with a
smile, as she rose from her seat. "Si-wash is a dead shot."



Tug obeyed. His hands went slowly up, and Audie
passed round the fire, and undid his fur coat. As she did
so her eyes sparkled.



"You've got them both on," she said, unstrapping the
ammunition belt supporting two revolvers about his waist,
"That'll simplify matters. You see, I know them. One is
Charlie's, and the other yours. They are the only guns you
possess. Good. Now you best go."



But the compelling gun of the Indian could no longer
keep Tug silent, and his pent anger broke out in harsh
abuse.



"You               !" he shouted. "You think I can't get back
on you, but I can. I will. I'll get your man, Leo, if I
wait years. I'll break him       I'll break the life out of him.
I'll              "



"Maybe." There was a hard glitter in Audie's eyes as
she interrupted him. "One thing, you've got no evidence
against him. Charlie is dead, and       that paper is burnt.
It is your word against his. When you meet it will be man
to man, and I don't guess there's a doubt who's the best man.
You best go home now."



Tug made no attempt to obey. He was about to speak
again       to hurl some filthy epithet at the woman, who had
outwitted him for her love's sake, but the Indian gave him
no chance. In a second the threatening gun was raised
again.



"Go 'm quick! Dam quick!" Si-wash cried savagely.



Tug's eyes caught the threatening ring of metal. For a
moment he hesitated. Then he turned and strode off.



The steady eyes of the Indian watched him until the woods
had swallowed him up. Then he turned, and followed silently
in his wake, while Audie remained to dream fresh and more
pleasant dreams before the fire.



Half an hour later she looked up as her comrade and
champion returned.



"Gone?" she asked, with upraised brows.



"Sho'! Him go." Si-wash crouched down over the fire
and spread his hands out to the warmth. Presently he
looked up with eyes twinkling with subtle amusement.



"Him big feller, Leo. Good. Him much gold       now. So.
Tug him no good. When him find Leo, Leo kill him. Leo big
feller."



As he finished speaking a curious sound came from somewhere
deep in his throat. And though his impassive face
remained unmoved, though not a ghost of a smile was apparent,
Audie knew that the man was chuckling with suppressed
glee. She, too, felt like laughing, and it was the
first time she had so felt since the hideous nightmare of the
storm, and its accompanying disaster.






CHAPTER IX



IN SAN SABATANO



San Sabatano was not a big city, but it was a very busy
one. At least its citizens thought so, and their four-sheeted
two-cent local news-sheet fostered their belief. No doubt a
New Yorker would have spoken of San Sabatano as a "Rube"
town, an expression which implied extreme provincialism
in the smallest possible way. It also implied that its citizens
had never turned their eyes upon those things which lay
beyond the town-limits, within which they had been "raised."
In short, that they knew nothing of the life of the great
world about them, except what their paper told them in
one single column. Naturally enough one column of the
worlds news against twenty or more columns of local interest
gave readers a false perspective, especially when every citizen
of any local standing usually found a paragraph devoted
to his own social or municipal doings.



But then the editor was a shrewd journalist of very wide
experience. No, he had not been "raised" in San Sabatano.
He had served his apprenticeship on the live journals of the
East. He understood men, and the times in which he lived.
More than all, he understood making money, and the factor
which his women readers were in that process. So the
world's news was packed into obscure corners, and San
Sabatano was the hub around which his imagination revolved.



So it came about that this individual had for months
darkly hinted that the San Sabatano Daily Citizen had something
up its editorial sleeve with which it intended to stagger
humanity, and startle its readers into a belief that an echo
of the San Francisco earthquake, or something of that
nature, had reached them. He told them that the mighty
combination of brain that controlled the Daily Citizen and
guided San Sabatano public opinion had given birth to an
epoch-making thought; a thought which, before long, when
the rest of a sluggish world read of it, would lift San
Sabatano as a center of enterprise, of learning, of culture,
to the highest pinnacle of fame known to the world.



San Sabatano stood agog with breathless expectancy for weeks.



Then came the humanity staggerer.



It occupied a whole page of the Daily Citizen. The type
was enormous, and had been borrowed for the occasion.
Fortunately it came in a slack time. The citizens of San
Sabatano had been so long held agog that nothing much
else had been doing to afford the editor local copy. Therefore
the epoch-making brain wave had full scope, and the
use of a prodigal supply of black and red ink.



It was a competition. Yes, a mere competition.



That was the first disappointing thought of everybody.
It almost seemed as if the staggering business had fizzled.



Then digestion set in, and hope dawned. Yes, it was not
so bad. By Jove! As a competition it was rather good.
Good? why, it was splendid! It was magnificent! Wonderful!
What was this? A competition for women clerks.
Speed and accuracy in stenography and typing. Twelve
prizes of equal value. Five hundred dollars each, or a
month's trip to Europe, including Paris, Vienna, Berlin,
Rome, London. And the final plum of all. The winning
twelve to compete among themselves for a special prize in
addition. A clerkship in the office of the Daily Citizen at
two hundred dollars a month, an office to herself, and a
year's contract!



Yes, if he hadn't staggered humanity, the editor had
certainly set excitement blazing in hundreds of young feminine
hearts, and upset the even tenor of as many homes.



For weeks, pending the trial of skill, that astute individual
nursed his scheme and trebled his circulation. Nor was it to
be wondered at that many times during the preliminary
stages of organization, as he watched the increasing daily
returns of his precious paper, he sat back in his creaking
office chair and blessed the day he married the wife, whose
sister had just won a similar competition somewhere at the
other side of the continent.



At the closing of the entries it was found there were just
two thousand competitors. Success for the scheme was
assured, and quarts of ink told the gaping multitude that
this was so.



Then came the day of the competition. It was to be held
in the Town Hall. So well was the interest and excitement
worked up that, all unpremeditated, half the smaller business
houses were closed for the day; a fact duly commented upon
in the later issues of the paper.



The competition lasted all day, and it was late at night
when the last weary, palpitating competitors finally reached
homes, which were still in a state of anxious turmoil.



There was no news of the winners that night. There was
none the next morning. Nor the next. The editor knew
his business and talked columns in his own praise, and in
praise of the manner in which the women of San Sabatano
had responded to his invitation.



A week passed, and then a special edition brought the
long-awaited announcement which dashed the hopes of one
thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight bursting feminine
hearts. It was a simple sheet, with a simple heading. No
splashes of colored ink. It gave the list of the twelve winners
of the competition in dignified type, and invited them
to meet at the editor's office at noon next day, to compete
for the coveted special prize.



Among the names of the winners was that of Monica
Hanson.



The following day Monica attended the final competition.
She did her utmost, spurred on by the driving necessity which
had just been thrust upon her brave young shoulders. Now
she was sitting in the San Sabatano Horticultural Gardens
waiting for the evening issue of the paper which was to tell
her, in cold, hard type, the news which was either to crush
her eager young soul in despair, or uplift her to realms of
ecstatic hope and delight.



Oh, the teeming thought of those straining moments. It
flew through her brain with lightning-like velocity, spasmodic,
broken. One moment she had visions of pleasures hitherto
denied her in a solitary career, eked out on a wholly inadequate
pittance doled out to her monthly by her dead mother's
solicitors in far-off New York. At another she was obsessed
by the haunting conviction that such good fortune was
impossible. Yet she felt she had done well in the examination,
and, anyway, she would certainly take that five hundred
dollars she had already won in preference to the European
tour. It would mean so much to her, especially now       now
that this fresh call on her resources had been made.



After long disquieting moments she finally sprang up from
her seat. Her nerves were getting the better of her. She
thought she heard the raucous call of the newsboy. She
listened; her pretty brows drawn together in plaintive doubt.
Yes, no       her heart was thumping under the white lawn shirtwaist
she was wearing, in spite of the fact that it was still
winter. But winter in San Sabatano was as pleasant as
many another town's summer. In all the history of that
beautiful southern Californian town the thermometer had
never been known to register freezing point.



She made a pretty picture standing there amid a setting
of fantastic tropical vegetation. The cacti, great and small,
with their wonder-hued blooms and strange vegetation, were
a fitting background to the girl's golden beauty. She was
quite southern in her coloring, that wonderful tone of
rich gold underlying a fair almost transparent skin. Her
waving, fair hair shone with a rich, ruddy burnish, crowning
a face of perfect oval, lit with eyes of the deepest blue, which
shone with pronounced intelligence and strength.



No, her nerves had not played tricks with her. It was
the newsboy. She could see him now, just beyond the park
gates. He was selling his papers all too fast. So, with
tumultuous feeling's, and a heart hammering violently against
her young bosom, she darted off to catch him.



She reached the gates and slackened her pace to a decorous
walk. The boy had just handed an elderly man his paper,
and was searching for the odd cents of change waited for.
Having paid his customer off he looked admiringly up into
Monica's pale face.



His shrewd eyes grinned impishly, and he winked abundantly,
so that the whole of one side of his face became
painfully distorted.



"Say, ain't you Miss Hanson, Miss?" he inquired, with the
effrontery of his kind.



Monica's heart beat harder. But she replied with an icy
calmness.



"Yes. That's my name. But              "



The boy's eyes sparkled.



"Then I guess the paper is sho' worth 'two bits' to you,"
he cried, thrusting the folded sheet at her. Then his feelings
and covetousness getting the better of him, he added, "Gee,
five hundred dollars, an' two hundred a month! Say, how
do it feel gettin' all that piled suddenly on to yer, Miss?"



In a flash Monica's dignity had vanished.



"What       what do you mean?" she cried, almost hysterically.
"I              " Her fingers trembled so violently that she
tore the paper nearly to ribbons struggling to open it in the
breeze.



The boy grinned.



"Gar'n. You ain't smart any. Guess you best hand me
that 'quarter' an' I'll show you wher' to look."



He was as good as his word, and handed her another paper
folded at the right spot, nor, to his credit, did he wait for
the money in advance.



"You won it sho'," he said, and waited while in a daze
Monica read the wonderful news       



"'We have much pleasure in announcing that the winner
of our Special Prize of a position on our staff at $200 per
month is Miss Monica Hanson, whose wonderful speed, etc.,
etc.'"



Monica waited for no more. Snatching at her satchel she
opened it and drew out a single one-dollar bill, and pushed
it into the willing hand of the expectant boy.



"Keep the change," he heard her say, as she almost flew
down the sidewalk of the tree-shaded main street.



The boy looked after her. Then he looked at his dollar
bill.



"Wal, guess she ain't got all the luck goin'," he murmured
philosophically, as he pocketed the well-worn note.



Monica hurried on at a pace, though nearly a run, far too
slow to suit her mood. Never, never in her life had she felt
as she felt now. Never, never. It almost seemed as if the
whole world were before her with loving, outstretched arms
and smiling face, waiting to yield her all that her young
heart most desired. In a vision every face that passed her
by in her rush home seemed to be wearing a happy smile.
Even the trees overhead rustled whispered messages of delight
and hope to her in the evening breeze. This was certainly
the one moment of moments in her brief seventeen
years of life.



She had hoped, she had dared to hope; but never in her
wildest thoughts had she really expected to win this wonderful
good fortune. Two hundred dollars a month for a year!
Five hundred dollars capital to work upon! And all this
added to the pittance which thus far she had lived on while
she studied stenography. It was too, too wonderful.



She thought of all she could do with it; and at once there
grew on her joyous horizon the first threatening cloud.
There was her sister, the dearly loved, erring, actress sister
who had come back to her out of those terrible wilds in the
far north of Canada.



Thank God this good fortune had come in time to help her.
Poor, poor Elsie, or Audrey, as she called herself on the
stage. What terrible troubles had been hers. Deserted by
the man she loved, left alone with an Indian, and another
unfortunate white man, to make her way back to civilization.
The thought of her sister's sufferings smote her tender young
heart even in the midst of her own rejoicings. She had always
disliked and feared Indians hitherto, but now, since
she had listened to her sister's pitiful story of her husband's
leaving her, and of the wonderful loyalty and generosity of
the Indian, Si               what was his name? Ah, yes, Si-wash       somehow
she warmed towards them. It seemed wonderful to
think of an Indian having such generosity as to give poor
Elsie the money to get to San Sabatano from Juneau out
of the payment he had received in advance from the journey
from Sixty-mile Creek. Why, it must have taken nearly all
he had.



Monica in her impulsive way felt that she would like to
repay him, to shake hands with him, and thank him. But
her sister had told her that he had gone back into the
northern wilderness, which nothing could ever induce him
to leave for long.



It was a strange life and they were strange people. Even
her sister had acquired something of the reticence and
somberness of the world she had left behind her. Poor Elsie.
She seemed to have made such a mess of her life. She had
been doing so well, too, in New York. Why had she thrown
it all up to marry this man, Leo, and wander off to the
Yukon? What a funny name, Leo. It seemed to be his surname,
too. Leo; it was all right for a first name, but       Elsie
had insisted that it was his name, and the one she liked to
call him by.



And now, here she was fretting her poor heart out for him.
Oh, it was a shame. Men were perfect brutes. And to leave
her under such conditions, and at such a time. She blushed
as she thought what she would feel if her husband had left
her when she was going to have her first baby. The thought
left her anxious. But even her anxiety for her sister was
lessened by the knowledge of her own good fortune. She
remembered the nurse, who was even now up in the small
apartments she occupied, and the doctor she had engaged.
A week ago she had trembled at the thought of how she was
to pay these people, and provide her sister with even the bare
necessities of a confinement. Now, now it was different,
and a fresh wave of thankfulness for her good fortune flooded
her simple heart.



Yes, her sister should have every care. Everything she
could do to make her happy and comfortable should be
done. And then, when the baby came, wouldn't it be delightful?
She would be its fairy god-mother. She hoped he
would be a boy. Fancy Elsie with a son. Wasn't it wonderful?
And she       she would give him every moment of her
spare time from the office. Ah, that wonderful thought       the
office.



So her thoughts ran on, keeping pace with her feet. The
wonders of the new world opening out before her eyes were
inexhaustible, and long before she was aware of the distance
she had covered she found herself at the door of the cheap
little apartment house where she lived on the top floor.



There was no elevator, and she ran at the stairs, taking
them two at a time. Her good news would not wait. She
must tell her poor sister. She was dying to pour all the
happy story into her ears, and watch the wistful smile grow
upon Elsie's troubled, handsome face.



On the sixth landing she stood breathlessly fumbling in
her satchel for her key, when the door opened and the nurse
appeared holding up a warning finger.



"Come quietly," she whispered. "The doctor is with her
now. It came on quite suddenly. I hope things will be all
right, but       she's in a bad way."



In a moment all the joy and hope died out of Monica's
tender heart. All the castles, all her dreams, fell into a
tumbled ruin. Her sister, her beautiful, brave sister was in
danger. She knew it. She knew that the nurse's words
covered far more than they expressed. Oh, it was cruel,
cruel.






CHAPTER X



A PROMISE



Three hopeless days since the coming of that brief moment
of overwhelming joy. The reaction had been all too
terribly sudden for a young girl on the threshold of life.
Monica sat at her dying sister's bedside crushed under a
great grief.



Those terrible three days. The demands made upon her
by the reporters of the Daily Citizen. The interviews she
had had to endure with the editor. The letters she received.
Some from strangers; some from acquaintances. Letters of
congratulation; letters full of burning spite from some of
the unsuccessful competitors; vampire letters demanding
sympathy and practical help, pouring out stories of misery,
sorrow and suffering. All these, in her simplicity, she felt
it her duty to answer; and she must answer them with smiling
words of hope and comfort. She must at all times keep
a smiling face.



To the reporter she had to talk and laugh while her heart
was breaking. To the editor she must offer her most engaging
smile that his personal goodwill be assured at the outset
of her career. Nor, for one moment, did she permit a sign of
the aching heart underneath it all.



At the end of those three days she was an older woman by
far than twice her seventeen years. She was learning from
the book of life in a manner that left her almost despairing.
How much she learned. That smiling world she had gazed
upon as she ran home with her wonderful news was no longer
smiling, its face had resumed its wonted expression which
was careworn, lined with suffering, and sorrow, and regret;
and was terribly, terribly old. She had learned something
of what her success meant. She knew now that her success
meant failure to hundreds of others. She knew that so it
must always be. The successful path must be lined with a
tangle of weeds of suffering and hope abandoned. For every
success there must be, not one but hundreds of failures; for
such was the law of Life.



Thus she was robbed of her joy and thrown back upon the
grief which lay across her own threshold.



The verdict had been given that morning by the doctor;
and corroboration of it was in the steady eyes of the nurse.
Her sister, her well-loved, admired elder sister was dying.
She was dying not as the happy mother of a beautiful son,
but as the deserted wife left to starve for all her husband
cared. She was dying a broken-hearted creature whose wonderful,
generous nature had been made the plaything of a
cold, unscrupulous villain. All this Monica told herself over
and over again as she sat beside the silent, uncomplaining
woman during those long hours of waiting for the end.



Her beautiful eyes were red with weeping, her pale cheeks
looked so wan with the long hours of silent watching. The
nurse was still there to do her work, but most of her work
was now the care of the little life in the bed that had been
put up at the other side of the room, rather than with the
woman who had given up her life that her love might yield
her absent man this one last pledge.



Poor little Monica was alone, utterly alone with her grief.
There were no warm words of kindly comfort to soften her
troubles. There was no loving mother's gentle hand to
soothe her aching head. The world was there before her,
hard, unsympathetic. She must face it alone, face it with
what courage she might, doing the best she knew amid a
grief which seemed everywhere about her.



An infantile cry from the other bed startled her. She
rose and passed across the room. The child seemed to be
asleep, for its breathing was regular, and the cry was not
repeated. She gazed down upon its tiny, crumpled face,
and her young heart melted with a curious yearning and love
for the little life that was robbing her of a sister. It was so
small. It was so tender       and       and it had cost so much.
She longed to take it in her arms and press it to her girlish
bosom. She loved it. Loved it because it was her sister's
and soon would be all she had in the world to remind her of
the generous heart from which life was so swiftly ebbing.



"Monica!"



The girl started and looked round. The dying woman's
eyes were wide open.



"Come here." The voice was low, but the words were
quite distinct. It was the first time she had spoken for more
than twelve hours.



Monica passed swiftly back to her place at the bedside.



"Oh, Elsie, Elsie," she cried, "I'm so glad you have spoken.
So, so glad."



A faint smile flickered gently over the sick woman's emaciated
features.



"Are you?"



"Yes, yes. Oh, Elsie, you feel better, stronger, don't you?
Say you feel better. I       I know you do."



Monica's last words came hesitatingly, for even while she
was speaking a negative movement from the sick woman told
her how vain were her hopes.



"It is no use, Mon. But I'm perfectly easy       now. That's
why I called you. I want to talk about       him. You       you       love
my little son, don't you?" There was pleading in the
voice as the woman asked the question. "I saw you bending
over him just now, and       and I thought       hoped you did."



"Oh, Elsie, he is yours. How could I help but love him?"



The words came impulsively, and Monica dropped a warm
hand upon the transparent flesh of her sister's. Her action
was promptly rewarded by a feeble pressure of acknowledgment.



"I       I knew you would."



After that neither spoke for some moments. Tears were
softly falling down Monica's pretty cheeks. But her sister's
eyes were closed again. It was almost as if she were gathering
her strength and thoughts for a final effort.



Presently Monica grew alarmed. She dashed the tears
from her eyes, and bent over the bed.



"Shall I fetch nurse? Is there anything I can do?" she
asked eagerly.



The big eyes opened at once, and the light in them was
a calm smile. The dying woman looked almost happy. To
Monica's growing understanding of such things her happiness
might have been the inspiration of one who sees beyond
the narrow focus of human life; whose swiftly approaching
end had revealed to her tired eyes a glimpse of the wonderful
world she was approaching, that golden life awaiting all,
be they saint or sinner.



"I don't want any one but you, dear       now." The voice
was tired, but a sense of peace was conveyed in the gentle
pressure of her thin fingers upon the soft warm flesh of her
sister's hand. "I       I want to tell you of       things. And       and
I want you to promise me something. Oh, Mon, as you
love me, as you love my boy, I want you to give me your
promise."



Monica seated herself on the edge of the bed and tearfully
gave her promise with all the impulsiveness which her love
inspired.



"You only have to tell me what it is. I could promise you
anything, Elsie. I have only one desire in the world now;
it is to       to help you."



Her sister's eyes closed for a moment. Then they opened
again.



"Raise me up a little, dear. Put a pillow behind my shoulders.
I want to       to       see the bed over there. I want to see
my little son, his       his boy. That's better." She sighed contentedly
as Monica raised her up, and her big eyes at once
fixed themselves upon the other bed. There was nothing to
be seen but the carefully arranged bed clothes, but, for the
time at least, it was sufficient.



"I want to tell you the things I never told you before. I
want to tell you about Leo; and I want to talk about my       my
boy. Leo and I were not married."



A little gasp of horrified dismay escaped the young girl.
She was so young that as yet her ideals of life were still
intact. The thought of such a thing as her sister now spoke
of had never entered her innocent head.



"Ah, that       that hurts you," the other went on. "I knew
it would. I       I       that's why I lied to you before. I lied
when I said Leo was my husband. Oh, Mon, don't let it make
any difference to us now. The time is getting so short."



"Nothing could ever make any difference between us,"
Monica said, in a low voice. "I was startled. You see              "



"I know. Ah, my dear, my dear, you don't know what it
is to love as I love. I met Leo a long time ago, when I was
an actress. He knew me as Audrey Thorne, an actress, and
I       I wanted to marry him. But       you see he had nothing
on which to keep a wife       an extravagant woman as I was
then. So, he went away, and       and I followed him. You
must think me utterly, terribly bad       but I loved him. I followed
him right up into the wilds of the Yukon, and       and
I lived with him."



"Poor, poor Elsie." Monica's dismay had passed, and
she gently squeezed the hand she was still holding. The
pressure seemed to give the other courage to proceed.



"You mustn't pity me too much. I       I was very happy.
I was very happy until I knew about       my little son. It
was then that I realized the awful sin I had committed. It
was then I knew the cruel wrong I had done to that unborn
life. I       I think I was nearly distracted when it all came
upon me." Her voice had risen. It was almost strident
with emotion. "For weeks I thought and thought what I
could do to remedy my wrong, and at last I took my courage
in both hands. I told Leo, and       and asked him to marry
me       for the child's sake."



"For the child's sake?"



The admission which the words implied filled the simple
Monica with something like panic.



"You see, Leo never loved me as I loved him."



"Oh, Elsie, Elsie!"



"Yes, dear, I forced myself upon him."



The tragedy of her sister's life had almost overwhelmed
the girl. The whole pitiful story wrung her heart with its
pathos, its shame. Her sister. Her beautiful, clever sister.
Oh, it was too, too dreadful.



After a while Elsie roused herself again. There was a
lot yet to be said, and she knew her time was short.



"I am all to blame. You mustn't blame Leo," she said
earnestly. "He was a good man to me. I know you think
he has deserted me. But he hasn't. That is not him. He
promised to marry me, and, had I lived, he would have kept
that promise. We were coming down country for that purpose."
She paused. "Then something happened which made
it necessary for him to go on ahead. That's how I came to
make the journey with the Indian. It       it couldn't be helped.
You       you mustn't blame Leo. He will be looking for me.
Is very likely looking for me now. But it is too late. That
is why I want you to promise me something."



Monica waited. She could find nothing to say. She was
learning another of the bitter lessons which life has to teach
when the book is once opened. Presently the other went
on       



"You see, neither of us can now remedy the wrong I have
done my little son. As I said, it is too late. I shall be gone
before Leo can marry me." The big eyes became eager.
They looked up with piteous straining into the gentle face
before them. "Do you see? Oh, Mon, do you understand?
My boy       our boy has no father; and very, very soon will
have no mother. Oh, Mon, what can I do, what can I say?
Can       can you help me?"



But Monica was gazing helplessly before her. The
warmth of her love for her erring sister was no less. But
she was thinking, thinking, striving with all her might to
seek a solution to the painful tangle of her poor sister's
life.



"I       I       can't               Tell me, Elsie       tell me anything I can
do for him. I don't seem able to think for myself," she cried
hopelessly at last.



Something of Monica's difficulty seemed to communicate
itself to the other. Her brows drew together in perplexity.



"It is so hard," she said suddenly. "I have thought and
thought, and I can only see one possible hope       only one.
That hope is       you."



"How? Oh, Elsie, tell me how. What can I do?"



With a sudden effort the mother propped herself up with
her elbows behind her. Her dying eyes were burning bright
with feverish light. All the hope of her poor dying soul
looked up into her sister's face as her final appeal rushed to
her lips.



"How? Why, why, by taking him as your own son.
How? Oh, Mon, his own mother is taken from him.
Then give him another. Make him your own child       whose
father is dead. It would be easy for you. You married
young, and your       your husband died       died at sea. He will
never know differently. No one will question it. Oh, my
dear, don't you see? Bring him up as your own child, born
in wedlock, and never let him know his mother's shame.
Promise me, your sacred promise to a dying woman, that he
shall never know, through you, his mother's shame, and his
own disgrace. Promise it to me, Mon, it is the only thing that
can give me peace now. Forget everything I have told you.
Forget the disgrace I have brought on you. Forget
everything except       except only your promise. Promise!
Promise!"



Her fingers tightened almost painfully upon Monica's
hand. She was laboring under a fierce emotion, almost sufficient
to bring on a collapse. The feverish eyes were bloodshot,
and a hectic flush burned on her thin cheeks.



The impulse of the moment was upon Monica, and she
leaned forward. Her other hand was tenderly raised to the
woman's moist brow, in a loving, soothing manner.



"I promise, dear; I promise on my sacred word that what
you ask me shall be done. Henceforth he shall be my son.
Nor shall he ever know through me the cruel wrong the
world has done to you. I promise you, Elsie, dear, freely,
freely. And all my life I will strive to keep the real truth of
his birth from him."



"Thank God!"



The reaction was terrible. The dying woman fell back
on her pillows, and her features suddenly became so ghastly
that Monica sprang from her seat in wild alarm. She ran
to the door to summon the nurse. But the voice from the
bed stayed her.



"No, Mon, not yet." Then the dying woman added with
an irresistible appeal, "Give me my boy, for       for a few
minutes. After that              "



Monica ran to obey with an only too thankful heart. But
her instinct warned her that the end was not far off. She
laid the sleeping child tenderly by its mother's side, and
placed her thin arm gently under its shoulders. She felt
maybe she was doing wrong, but       poor Elsie.



Elsie's eyes thanked her, but her voice remained silent.
And for a long while there was an unbroken quiet in the
room.



Monica moved to the window and stood with her back
turned to the bed. Somehow she felt that these moments
were too sacred for another's eyes to witness. Slowly fresh
tears gathered in her eyes, tears of sympathy and love, and
one by one they rolled unheeded, slowly down her cheeks.
And as they fell the last moments of her sister's life ebbed
peacefully away.






CHAPTER XI



TWO STRANGERS IN SAN SABATANO



Monica's life suddenly became filled to overflowing. She
was no longer a child, but a woman of a maturity that was
almost absurd in one so young. The happy, irresponsible
girlhood she had so long enjoyed in her mother's modest
uptown apartment had quite gone. Whatever the future
might hold of happiness for her, certainly freedom from the
more serious cares of life would never again be hers.



Five years ago she and her mother had bade Elsie good-bye
in the same humble apartment, when the elder girl had left
San Sabatano to go on the stage in New York. Monica was
twelve then. Twelve; and her young eyes and younger mind
were filled with a boundless envy and admiration for the beautiful
sister who was to bask in the wonderful limelight of
the stage, and wear clothes far beyond the beauty of all
dreams; and jewels       jewels, whose splendor was incomparable
to the beauty of her lovely, lovely Elsie. Had she only
known it she was very near the truth when she thought of
the jewels her sister would wear.



Her mother was one of those quietly good women who
contrive to inspire their children with something of their
own qualities by example rather than precept. Neither Elsie
nor Monica ever knew what it was to receive one of those
harsh reprimands so common among mothers of less understanding,
of less ability. Her children must grow up guided
rather than driven. All their lives this had been her method.
Therefore it came as a terrible shock to her when the more
wayward of the two, perhaps, in a sense, the bolder spirit
of the two, suddenly announced her intention of leaving the
sheltering dovecote, where money was never very plentiful,
to earn her living in the flamboyant world of the stage.



True to her methods, and with, perhaps, a deeper understanding
of her child, and the uselessness of refusal, the
mother's permission was not long withheld. It was a reluctant
enough permission, but given without any outward sign
of the disapproval she really felt. Moreover, she was convinced
of the rightness of her attitude. The girl, she knew,
would live her life as she understood it. Her only duty remaining,
therefore, was to equip her with all the knowledge
of the world that lay within her simple range of understanding.
For the rest the child's fate was in the lap of the gods.



But she never seemed to quite get over the parting. For
a long time she bore up with great fortitude, and her devotion
to Monica became a wonderful thing. It was almost
as if she feared that she, too, her one remaining child, might
be taken from her, and swallowed up by the hungry maw
of the outside world.



She heard regularly from Elsie for some time. Elsie was
getting on quite well. Then letters became less frequent.
And, finally, about the time that Elsie met Leo, they ceased
altogether. It was then that the signs of break-up began to
show in the patient woman at home.



She had died quietly and quickly of heart failure just a
year ago. Monica's grief was profound. But she was too
young for any lasting effect to remain with her. She lived
on in the apartment without any thought of leaving it. The
whole thing seemed the most natural in the world to her.
Her mother's solicitor wrote her, and offered her a home
with his family, but, with prompt decision, she refused it.
She told him that if her mother's affairs permitted it, she
would rather remain in San Sabatano, where she had all her
girlhood's friends, than break new ground among strangers.
Her mother's affairs yielded her the barest living, so she
remained, determined to make a way for herself in the world,
her own world, as other girls of her acquaintance had done.



Now she had reached the second, and, in many ways, the
greater change in her life. Where, before, only her childish
affections had been bruised and crushed at her mother's death,
now she realized that she had all too suddenly passed from
the sunlit paths of innocent childhood, to the harsher road
down which all the world was journeying; struggling,
jostling, each striving to seize for themselves the easier, the
pleasanter paths along which to make the journey of life.



But the change in her was subtle. There was no outward
effect, there was no disturbing of the wholesome, happy
nature that was the very essence of her being. The change
was in an added knowledge, a quickening of naturally alert
faculties. She realized that some strange force had suddenly
plunged her into the midst of a life which demanded quick
thought and swift action, so that her pulses might be kept
beating in perfect time to the pace at which life sped on about her.



She realized that she had suddenly become one of life's
workers, and that grave responsibility was already knocking
at her door. From the very beginning she accepted the
new conditions gladly. She felt an added zest to the fact of
living. The old days of dreaming were gone. Every moment
of her waking hours was filled with thought, keen,
practical thought; and the demand thus made on her found
her ready and able. There was no fluster, no confusion of
any sort. Her healthy brain was quick and incisive, characteristics
quite unsuspected even by herself. Not only was
this so, but, with the added pressure, there came a quiet
desire to test her newly discovered powers to the uttermost.



There were other changes, too, changes of almost equal
importance. She found herself witnessing the progress of
affairs about her with an entirely new understanding of them.
All her understanding of the precepts of her youth received
revision; a revision which was inspired by the story her sister
had told her on her deathbed. The shock at first had been
a little overwhelming, but, young as she was, her ready brain
quickly assimilated the facts, and set itself to the task of
readjusting its focus.



There was no bitterness, no horror at her discoveries. She
simply realized that here was a small slice of life cut out
by the same ruthless knife which no doubt served hundreds
of similar purposes among the rest of mankind. Who
was she to criticize, who was she to condemn? Her knowledge
was all to come, and maybe, as she went on, she would
discover that such tragedies were part of the real life which
up to now had been entirely hidden from her.



She had no blame for her dead sister. Her memory was
as sacred to her as if she had lived the most perfect life of
purity under the social laws governing man's relationship
to woman. Her love once given was not a thing to be
promptly rescinded by the failure of its idol. The idol might
fall, and become besmirched in the unsuspected mire, but her
frank, kindly hands were ready to set it up again and again,
and perhaps in time her broader knowledge would teach her
how to secure it from further disaster.



Perhaps the first real warning of the change in her came at
the moment she considered her sister's funeral. Here undoubtedly
a shock was awaiting her, and, in a moment, there
leaped into her focus a teeming picture of almost endless
complications. Just for an instant all her nerves were set
jangling, and an utter helplessness left her painfully distressed.
Then the feeling as abruptly passed, her mind
cleared, and, one by one, she found herself reviewing each
detail of the situation, and marking out the course she must
adopt.



First and foremost her sacred promise to the dying woman
stood out in all its nakedness, entirely robbed of its cloak of
impulse and affection, in which it had been clad at the time
of its making. And from that promise, radiating in every
direction, she saw boundless possibilities for more than
unpleasant consequences.



She knew she must make up her mind swiftly, and she did
so in an astonishing manner. A sleepless night found her
in the morning ready with her plans all clear in her mind.
She still had nearly three weeks before taking up her new
position in the office of the Daily Citizen. This would be
ample time to put everything in order. It was necessary
to take the doctor into her confidence. He had been their
doctor for as long as she could remember. He had attended
her mother in her last illness, and knew their whole family
history as well as she knew it herself. Therefore she did
not anticipate any difficulty with him.



So the third morning after her sister's death she visited
him at his house, and confided sufficient of her sister's story
to him to enlist his sympathy, without any breach of the
confidence reposed in her. She pointed out her own position,
and begged his help in hushing the whole matter up.



Dr. Bernard Strong was a man of wide sympathy and
understanding, and in giving his promise of help, pointed out
the gravity of the position which her quixotic promise had
placed her in.



"My dear," he said, "this is almost a terrible business for
you. Here you are, bound to this town for at least a year,
with a newly born infant in your care, which you cannot
explain away, without breaking your promise to poor Elsie.
You are known. You have many friends. What in the
world are you going to do?"



It was then that Monica displayed the quick, incisive
working of her suddenly aroused mental faculties. She told
him in brief, pointed words the plans she had made during
the long, wakeful night.



"It does not seem so       so very difficult," she said.



Then she plunged into the details of her schemes. She
pointed out that her tenement was a weekly one, which she
could get rid of as soon as Elsie was buried. This she would
do. Then she would take rooms far out on the outskirts of
the town. She would first find a house for the baby in the
country, a few miles out, where he was not likely to be
brought into contact with the townsfolk. That would be a
start. After that she would meet any emergency as it arose.
The help she wanted from him was to arrange the funeral,
with all the secrecy possible, and see that the law was complied
with in regard to the baby. His registration, etc.



The quick practical manner in which she detailed all the
minor details to this man of experience filled him with a
profound admiration, and he told her so.



"It is astounding to me, Monica," he said kindly, "that
you, a girl of seventeen, can handle such a matter in the
calm manner you are doing. Perfectly astounding. You
certainly ought to do well in this business career you are
about to begin. Really you have made things seem less       er       formidable.
But, my dear child, I feel I must warn you.
You see, I am so much older," he went on, with a smile.
"I have seen so much of the world       the sadder side of the
world, that I cannot let this moment pass without telling you
of the rocks I can see ahead, waiting to break up your little
boat. Your tale of an early marriage and all that, if the
boy becomes associated with you in the minds of people in
the town, will never do. At once they will think the worst,
and then       what of your position on the Daily Citizen? Then
when the time comes for you to marry? What then?"



"I shall never marry       now," was Monica's prompt and
decided reply.



The doctor shook his head.



"It is so easy to say that. Believe me, my dear, you have
tied a millstone about your neck that will take your utmost
strength to bear. I even doubt if you will be able to bear
it for long. You are about to embark on a career of falsehood
which will find you out at almost every turn. It is
quite terrible to think of. Poor Elsie did you the greatest
wrong, the greatest injury, when she extracted that promise
from you. And," he added, with a wry smile, "I fear, from
my knowledge of you, you will carry it out to the bitter end       until
it utterly overwhelms you."



Monica stepped off the veranda of the doctor's house with
none of the lightness of gait with which she had mounted it.
She realized the gravity of her position to the full now, and
knew that, without breaking her sacred word to a dying
woman, there was no means of remedying it. But she was
quite determined, and walked away with her pretty lips
tightly compressed, her blue eyes gazing out unflinchingly
before her. Nothing should turn her from her purpose.
It was Elsie's trust to her. It was the cross she had to bear.
Come what might she would bear it to the end, even if at the
last its weight were to crush the very life out of her.



The next three weeks passed rapidly. Monica had no
time to look back upon the trouble which had so involved
her, she had little enough time to gaze ahead into the wide
vista of troublous rocks the doctor had promised her. In
fact she had no time at all for anything but the crowding
emergencies of the moment, and keeping the well-meaning
friends and curious neighbors as far from the secrets of her
inner life as possible.



Nor was it easy; and without Dr. Strong's help many of
her difficulties would have been well-nigh insurmountable.
But he was as good, and even better, than his word. The
whole of the funeral was achieved without any unnecessary
publicity, and Monica and the doctor were the only mourners.
Then the latter found a home for the boy on a farm, three
miles out of the town, where a newly born babe had just died,
and so, in the end, everything was accomplished just as
Monica had planned, without one unnecessary question being
asked. Thus, by the time the winner of the special prize
took up her duties in the office of the Daily Citizen, of all
San Sabatano, Dr. Strong alone shared Monica Hanson's
secret. A secret, it was her future object in life to keep entirely
hidden from the world.



Monica entered upon her duties with a lighter heart than
she had known for weeks. Everything was as she could
wish it. All traces of her sister's shame had been carefully
covered. Practically no sign was left to delight the prying
eyes of the curious scandalmongers. Her future lay before
her, wide, and, to her, illimitable.



Her aims and ambitions were fixed plainly in her mind.
She must succeed; she must rise in the commercial world;
she must make money. These things were not for herself.
No, she required so little. They were for him, for the little
life so cruelly wronged at its very outset. Henceforth her
own life would be devoted to his. Her whole thought would
be for him and his welfare, not only for the child's sake, but
in memory of the love she had borne her dead sister.



How well the editor of the Daily Citizen had judged the
competitors for the special prize was quickly demonstrated.
Monica's zeal was backed by the suddenly aroused acuteness
of an unusually clever brain, and, before a month had passed,
the complacent individual in the editorial chair had excellent
reason for again congratulating himself. He had intended
from the outset that the winner of the princely prize and
unusual salary should earn every cent of it, but he found
in his new clerk an insatiable hunger for work, and a capacity
for simple organization quite astounding, and far beyond
any demand he could make on it.



In this beginner he quickly detected a highly developed
germ of commercial instinct; that germ so coveted, so rare.
He tried her in many ways, seeking in a more or less fumbling
way for the direction in which her abilities most surely
pointed. Stenography and typing, he quickly saw, were
mere incidents to her. She had other and larger abilities.
Frequently in dictating letters he found himself discussing
matters pertaining to them with her, and she never failed to
center her mental eye upon the point at issue, driving
straight to the heart of the matter in hand. The man was
frankly delighted with her, and, in the shortest possible time,
she became a sort of confidential secretary, whose views on
the organization of his paper were often more than useful
to him.



It was about this time that the editor's sanctum was invaded
by a stranger; a big stranger of quite uncommon appearance.
The man was simply dressed in good store clothes,
which covered a powerful, burly figure. But the chief interest
lay in the man's face and head. It was a strong face. To
use Mr. Meakin's own description of him to his young clerk
some time later, he possessed a "tow head and a face like
emery cloth."



He gave no name, in fact he refused his name. He came
to insert an advertisement in the paper, and to consult the
editor upon the matter.



His objects were so definite that, in spite of the refusal
to give his name, Mr. Meakin decided to see him. Monica
was away at dinner, or he would probably have turned him
over to her. However, when the man finally appeared the
editorial mind was pleased at the study his unusual
personality offered him.



The stranger very nearly filled up the doorway as he
entered the inner office.



"Guess you're the editor?" he began at once, dropping into
the chair Mr. Meakin kicked towards him.



"Sure," Mr. Meakin was always sparing of words to
strangers.



"Ah."



Then, so long did the man remain silent that the editor
found it necessary to spur him on by a method he usually
adopted in such cases. He pressed the button of his dummy
telephone with his foot. The bell rang out, and he lifted the
receiver to his ear.



"Hullo! Who is it? Oh, that you, Allards? Oh, is it
important? Well, I'm engaged just now. I shan't be three
minutes. Yes, I'll come right along then. Goo'-bye!"



He looked across at his visitor as he put the receiver up.



"Sorry to interrupt you. I didn't just get what you
said."



A flicker of a smile passed across the visitor's serious face.



"It's of no consequence," he said. "Guess I must have
been thinking aloud. You see it's kind of a fool trick having
the button of that dummy 'phone in sight under the table.
Guess the feller who fixed it was a 'mutt.'"



"Eh?" Mr. Meakin's face went suddenly scarlet. He
was about to make a hasty reply, but changed his mind, and
laughed with a belated sense of humor.



"It's served its purpose anyhow," he said genially. "What
can I do for you?"



The stranger responded to his humor at once.



"Don't guess you can do much. Maybe you can tell me
a deal. I'm looking for some one who's lately come to this
city. A lady. Maybe you get a list of visitors to this city
in your paper."



"At the hotels       yes."



"Ah, I don't guess she's stopping at an hotel. Came to
visit her sister. Her name's Audrey Thorne."



"Audrey Thorne," Mr. Meakin searched the back cells of
memory. He seemed to have heard the name at some time
or other, but for the life of him he could not recall where.



"Guess I'm not wise," he said at last, with a thoughtful
shake of his head, while he eyed his visitor shrewdly. "Anyway,
if I knew of the lady, tain't up to me to hand information
to a stranger       without a name."



The stranger promptly rose from his seat.



"Just so," he said, with a sharp clip of his powerful jaws.
"I'll ask you to read this over," he went on, producing a
sheet of paper from his pocket, "and say what it'll cost to
have it in your news-sheet for a week."



He handed the paper across the desk, and Mr. Meakin
admired the bold handwriting in which the advertisement
was set out.



"'Will Audie send her address to Box 4926 P. O. Winnipeg?
Sign letter in full name.       Leo.'"



Mr. Meakin read it over twice. Then he looked up keenly.



"Guess it'll cost you ten dollars," he said. "Sunday edition
two dollars extra. In advance."



The stranger paid out the money without comment and
moved towards the door. Then he looked back.



"There'll be no mistake. It's particular," he said
deliberately.



"There'll be no mistake."



"Thanks." The stranger pocketed the receipt for the
money with some care.



The door closed behind the man who signed himself as
"Leo," and Mr. Meakin heard him pass down the passage to
the outer office. Then he turned to the stack of local copy
at his elbow.



He was quite used to strange visits from stranger people,
so he thought no more of the matter until nearly an hour
later when Monica returned from her dinner.



As she entered the wholesome, airy apartment, with its
soft carpet and comfortable furniture, he looked up
quickly.



"Say, Miss Hanson," he said, holding out a pile of proofed
copy. "This needs classifying. It goes in tomorrow's issue.
Get it through before four. Say, and you might hand this
in to the advertisement department. A guy with a tow-head,
and a face like emery cloth handed me twelve dollars for a
week       and Sunday. Reckon he's chasin' up his lady friend,
and she's guessin' to lie low."



He passed her Leo's advertisement, and went on with his work.



Monica waited for any further instructions to come, and,
as she stood, glanced down at the sheet of paper containing
the advertisement. In a moment her attention was riveted
upon it, and a sickening feeling stole through her whole body.
Then her pulses were set hammering with a nervousness she
could not control, and she felt faint.



At that moment Mr. Meakin happened to look up.



"Well?" he inquired.



Then he became aware of the pallor of the pretty face he
was accustomed to admire, when Mrs. Meakin was safely
within the walls of their home on the outskirts of the city.



"Say, you're not well," he exclaimed kindly.



Monica promptly pulled herself together.



"It's       it's just the heat," she stammered. "I'll       go and
see to these. Anything else?"



"Nothin' else just now. Say, don't worry too much if
the heat              "



But Monica had fled before he finished his well-intentioned
admonition. Once in her own office she flung herself into
the chair at her desk, and sat staring at the ominous sheet of
paper.



"Leo!" she muttered. "Whatever am I to do? Whatever
am I to do?"



For a long time the pile of copy remained untouched while
she struggled with the problem confronting her. She viewed
it from every aspect. And with each fresh view it troubled
her the more. What was her duty? What was the right
course to pursue? This man was Leo. Elsie's Leo. She
had no doubt of it. Leo, the father of Elsie's boy. If Elsie
had lived she would have welcomed him. But Elsie was dead.
Elsie was dead and carried with her her promise never to let
the child know his mother's shame. Ought she to tell the
father of this child? Ought she to give him up? It would
be an easy way out of all her difficulties. Yet she had promised
to bring him up as her own.



No, she would not give the boy up. It was plainly her
duty to keep him, and       yes, she knew it       her desire. But
equally she had a duty of some sort to fulfil by this man.
He must not be left in ignorance of Elsie's death. He must
be told that or he would haunt this town, and become an
everlasting source of disquiet to her. Yes, there was a duty
to herself as well. She must safeguard herself; safeguard
the child. And with this conclusion came an inspiration. She
would write to him on her typewriter, and leave the letter
unsigned.



So she passed the advertisement on to its department,
and, on a plain sheet of paper, sent the briefest possible
message to the post office, Winnipeg.



"Audie died in child birth."



There was neither heading nor signature, and she determined
to have it mailed from another town. The more she
considered it the more her message pleased her. She was
keeping her promise to her sister, and fulfilling what she
believed to be her duty to the man. He had asked for news
of Elsie; well, here was news which was the exact truth.



Her work was duly completed by four o'clock, and she
awaited a call from Mr. Meakin. There would be a number
of letters to take down, she knew, when his editorial work
was finished for the day. In the meantime she had leisure to
reflect upon the visit of the man, Leo.



It was curious. Almost a coincidence that he should call
when she was out. Had she been in it would have fallen to
her duty to have interviewed him first. As it was she had
missed seeing him. It was a pity. She ought to have seen
him. Yes, she would have given half a month's salary to have
seen him              



A bell rang; but it was not Mr. Meakin's bell. It was
from the outer office. She took up the 'phone at once. Could
it be              ?



"Hello! Oh! Some one to see Mr. Meakin? Who is
it? What's that? Austin Leyburn? What's that? He's
dressed funny? All right, send him in to me. Right."



Monica put up the receiver and waited. It was not Leo,
and she was disappointed. Austin Leyburn. She didn't
know the name.



There was a knock at the door, and, in answer to the
girl's summons, it was thrown open by the small boy who
piloted visitors.



"Mr. Austin Leyburn, Miss!"



Monica indicated a chair as the door closed behind her
visitor. He took it without hesitation, and she found herself
gazing upon a most extraordinary object. He was obviously
a powerfully built man with a keen, alert face and narrow
eyes. He was smiling at her with a curiously ironical smile
which rather annoyed her. But his general appearance was
deplorable. His clothes were so unclean and ragged that,
even among tramps, she never remembered seeing anything
quite like them. They were patched and torn again in a
dozen different places, and it would have been impossible to
have described their original color with any accuracy. Yes,
there could be no doubt he was a tramp of some sort. Yet
when he spoke his manner was not that of a tramp. However,
as a precaution, Monica kept her foot over a push
button which did not belong to a dummy 'phone.



"If you'll state your business, I'll inquire if Mr. Meakin
will see you," she said, in her most business-like way. "He's
very busy. You see, the paper will be going to press soon."



"I don't guess I need to worry the boss if you happen to
know about things." The man's manner was sharp, but his
smile remained. Monica became interested. There was nothing
of the usual whine of the tramp here.



"I deal with all inquiries," she said simply.



"Confidential?"



"That depends on the nature of the confidence."



"Ah. Maybe what I'm after won't be reckoned confidential."



"If you'll              "



"Just so, Miss. Well, see here, maybe it isn't a heap except
to me. I'm after a feller who calls himself Leo," he said
distinctly. Monica started. The man's quick, smiling eyes
saw the start and drew his conclusions. "I see you know
him. I knew he'd been here. Came this morning. You see
he's after a woman belonging to this city. I guessed he'd get
around. I'm on his trail and want him bad. Maybe you
can put me wise where he's stopping?"



Monica shook her head with a calmness she was by no
means feeling.



"I shouldn't tell you if I knew. You're quite right, I
know the man       by name, but that's all. You see, we know
many people by name       but there our information to
strangers ends."



"So." Mr. Leyburn eyed her coldly. "Maybe Mr.
Meakin, as you call him, will              "



"Mr. Meakin will tell you no more. In fact, if this is
your business Mr. Meakin will not see you."



Monica pressed the bell under her foot.



The man laughed harshly.



"Well, it don't matter. Guess I'll come up with him sooner
or later. Maybe he'll look into this office again another
day." He rose, and his hard eyes shone with a metallic
gleam. "If he does       you can just tell him that Tug is on
his heels. He's looking for him bad. So he best get busy.
Good-day."



The small boy threw open the door, and stood aside to
allow the visitor to pass out. Nor, in spite of the curious
threat in the man's words, could Monica help a smile at the
impish manner in which the boy held his nose as the man
passed by him.



The stranger's visit left an unsavory flavor behind him.
Monica was disturbed, and sat thinking hard. She was striving
hard to raise the curtain which shut out her view of the
life lying behind all these people. She was striving to
visualize something of that life with which poor Elsie had
so long been associated. A number of vague pictures hovered
before her mind's eye, but they were indistinct, unreal. She
could not see with eyes of knowledge. How could she? Was
not this life belonging to another world? A world she had
never beheld, never been brought into contact with? No, it
was useless to try to penetrate those dark secrets which she
felt lay hidden behind the curtain she was powerless to draw
aside.



Yet she knew these things had not come to her to be set
aside and forgotten. They had come to her for a purpose.
What was that purpose? She tried to see with her sister's
eyes. What would Elsie have done, with Leo       threatened?
Ah, that was it; that was the purpose. Her sister's responsibility
had devolved upon her. Elsie would have taken some
action to help       Leo. What would she have done?



She thought and puzzled for a long time. Then she
pressed the bell under her desk once more. An inspiration
had come.



When the boy appeared she demanded the proofs of the
day's advertisements.



She waited impatiently until the boy returned, and then
kept him waiting while she hastily extracted the one she required
from the pile. She read it over carefully. Leo had
worded it to suit her purpose well. Suddenly she took up
her blue pencil. She dashed out the word "Winnipeg" and
substituted "Toronto" in its place. And without another
glance at it handed the papers back to the boy.



"That's all," she said briefly.



But the boy was full of the impertinence of his kind.



"Toronto?" he read. "Say, Miss, ain't that the place they
have ice palaces an' things?" he demanded, with a grin.



Monica was in no mood to answer his questions.



"Take them back," she said sharply.



As the boy slouched off she leaned back in her chair with
a sigh of relief. She had done her best to put the man calling
himself Tug off the track of his quarry.





PART II






CHAPTER I



AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS



Monica Hanson stood in front of the full-length mirror in
her bedroom. For a long time she stood viewing her fair
reflection with a smile at once half humorous, half tearful.



Thirty-five!



It sounded terrible as she muttered the age she knew
herself to be. Thirty-five! Yet the perfect blue eyes were
not a day older, as they looked back at her out of the glass.
There was no hardening in their depths; there were no
gathering lines about their fringed lids. Perhaps there was
a deeper, wiser look in them; a look suggesting a wider
knowledge, a more perfect sympathy with the life into which
they had peeped during her years of struggling. But there
was no aging in them. The rich, ripe mouth, too, so wonderfully
firm, yet gentle, the broad, intelligent forehead with
its fair, even brows. There was not one single unsightly line
to disfigure these features which displayed so much of the
strong character which lay behind them. Her wealth of fair,
wavy hair, which since her earliest days had been her one
little conceit, her constant joy and pride, was faultlessly
dressed, nor had she ever yet found in its midst one of those
silver threads whose discovery never fails to strike terror
into the heart of an aging woman.



No, she beheld nothing in her reflection to cause her a
single pang, a single heartache. Yet her heart was aching;
and the pain of it was in the smile which came back to her
from her reflection.



Had Monica only known it, the years had been more than
kind to her. With a little more womanly vanity she would
have understood that her girlish attractions had been increased
a hundredfold. Not only had the years matured
her figure to perfections which can never belong to early
youth, but they had endowed her with a beauty of soul and
mind, far more rarely found in one of such unusual physical
attraction.



But such ponderings before her glass were useless, perhaps
harmful. It was all so impossible. So she turned away
with a little impatient gesture, and, picking up the letter
lying on her bed, she passed through the folding doors into
her sitting-room beyond.



The winter sun was shining in through frosty windows;
that wonderful winter sun which brightens and makes joyous
the Canadian dead season, without shedding sufficient
warmth to disturb the thermometer from its despairing
depths of cold.



She crossed to the window, and stood beside the heat
radiator while she read her letter for perhaps the twentieth
time. It was quite short, and intensely characteristic of
the writer. Monica understood this. The lack of effusion
in no way blinded her to the stormy passion which had
inspired it.





"Dear Monica:



"I am going to call on you at 4 o'clock this afternoon, if
you have no objection. If you have, 'phone me. I simply
cannot rest until the subject of our talk the other night is
settled.



"Yours,
                            "Alexander Hendrie."





There was a wistful longing in her eyes as the woman
looked up from the brief note. The subject of their talk.
He could not rest. Had she rested, or known peace of mind
since that evening? She knew she had not. She knew that
come what might that calm which belongs to a heart untouched
by love could never again be hers. She knew that
love, at last, had come knocking at the door of her soul; nor
had it knocked in vain, in spite of the impossibility of it all.
She had not 'phoned. Instead she had spent two hours over
her toilet to receive the man who was her employer, and had
now become her lover.



No one knew better than she the happiness that might
have been hers in her newly found regard for this great
wheat grower of Alberta, had things only been different.
She loved him; she had admired him ever since she came into
his employ, but now she loved him with all the long-pent
passion of a woman who has for years deliberately shut the
gates of her soul to all such feelings.



She knew her love must be denied. There was no hope
for it.



The trials she had gone through for the sake of her pledge
to her dying sister were far too vividly in her mind to leave
her with any hope for this love of hers. She must crush it
out. She must once more steel herself, that her faith with
the dead might be kept.



She dropped upon the ottoman beside the window, and,
gazing out on Winnipeg's busy main street, gave herself up
to profound thought. Her incisive brain swiftly became
busy, reviewing the career which had been hers since       since
young Frank, her beloved boy, the child who had cost
her a sister's life, had become her one object and care.



Her deep eyes grew introspective, and her pretty lips
closed firmly.



She had not traveled an easy road during those years.
Far from it. The rocks prophesied by the kindly doctor
had been quickly realized. They had come well-nigh to
wrecking her craft at the outset. Only that its ribs were so
stout, and the heart that guided it so strong, it must inevitably
have been doomed.



So much for her youthful conceit; so much for the boundless
optimism of her years. She was caught among the
very first shoals that presented themselves in the ebb tide
of her fortunes six months before the completion of her
contract on the Daily Citizen. Would she ever forget the       yes,
tragedy of that moment? She thought not.



Everything had gone along so smoothly. Her fears had
been lulled. There was no sign to point the coming of the
disaster. Yes, that was it. There had been overconfidence.
The complications at her sister's death had been forgotten.
There had been no unpleasant developments to remind her
of the pitfalls with which she was surrounded. So she had
grown careless in her confidence. In the warmth of her
girl's heart, her rapidly growing love for the little life in her
charge, she found herself spending every moment of her
spare time with the child she intended to teach to call her
"mother."



They were happy days. The joy of them still remained.
Nor, for all the trouble they had caused her, did she regret a
single one of them. But her indiscretion grew, and so the
blow fell.



It was on a Sunday. In the afternoon. She remembered
it well; a glorious sunny day in early summer. She was
pushing the baby coach along the sidewalk of the broad country
road toward the city. She had paused to readjust the
sunshade over the child's head. When she looked up it was
to discover a light, top buggy, drawn by a fast trotter,
rapidly approaching. Mr. Meakin was driving it, and beside
him sat his little, chapel-going wife.



They saw her and promptly pulled up; and instantly
Monica knew that trouble was knocking at her door. Mrs.
Meakin did not like her. She did not approve of her husband's
secretary; and Mrs. Meakin was one of those narrow,
straight-laced puritans, who never cease to thank Providence
that they are so pure.



"Why, it's Miss Hanson," she promptly exclaimed. "And       oh,
the lovely baby. Why              " She looked at Monica's
scarlet face and broke off.



Mr. Meakin took up the greeting in the cordial fashion
of a man who is well disposed.



"Say, Miss Hanson, it's a hot day for you to be pushing
that coach. You surely ought to be around an ice cream
parlor with one of your beaus. Not out airing some friend's
kid."



But Monica's confusion only increased under the sharp
eyes of Mrs. Meakin, which never left her face.



"A baby can't have too much of this beautiful air," she
said helplessly.



"Why doesn't its mother look after it?" demanded Mrs.
Meakin.



"She's       she's busy."



Monica's attempts at evasion were so feeble, she had so
little love for subterfuge, that, to a mind as prone to suspicion
as Mrs. Meakin's, the word "mystery" quickly presented
itself.



"Whose is it?"



The inevitable question seemed to thunder into the
wretched girl's ears.



Whose is it? Whose is it? It was useless to lie to this
woman, whom she knew had no love for her. So on the
spur of the moment she did the only thing that seemed
possible, seeing Mr. Meakin was her employer. But she did
it so badly that, even while she spoke, she knew her doom
was sealed.



"She belongs back there." Monica pointed at the distant
farm house.



"That house?" cried Mrs. Meakin sharply. "Why, that's
Mrs. Gadly's. I              " She turned abruptly to her husband.
"We'd better drive on, or we'll be late back for
supper, and that will make us late for chapel."



With a flourish of his whip, and a cheery good-bye, Mr.
Meakin set his "three-minute" trotter going again, and
Monica was left to her dismay.



She knew. She needed no instinct to tell her. It had all
been written in Mrs. Meakin's icy face. The woman would
find out all about the baby she had seen her husband's secretary
with. She would smell out the whole trail with that
nose which was ever sharp for an evil scent.



She continued her walk thinking hard all the while, and
finally took the child back to its nurse at the usual time.



Mrs. Gadly met her at the front door, and Monica put a
sharp question.



"Has Mrs. Meakin been here?"



"She surely has, mam," replied the woman, smiling. "And
a God-fearin' woman she is. I've known her years an' years.
I didn't jest know you was her good man's secretary. She's
a lady, she is; a real, elegant lady. An' she was all took up
with the baby, an' the way I'd looked after him. She said as
it was a great thing for a woman who 's lost her baby to
have the care of another woman's child, kind o' softens the
pain. An' when I told her as you paid me so liberal for
it              Why, mam, you ain't faint? Ah, it's the sun; you
best come right inside and set down."



It had been a terrible moment for Monica. She knew
that her career in San Sabatano had suddenly terminated.
The God-fearing Mrs. Meakin would have no mercy on her,
particularly as she was her husband's secretary.



She returned to her apartments that evening with her
mind made up to a definite course; and, on the Monday
morning following, before she went to her office, she looked
up her contract with the Daily Citizen. She took it with
her. She knew that the thing she was about to do was a
tacit admission of the child's parentage. But she intended it
so to be, since truthful explanation was denied her.



Mr. Meakin was amiability itself. But there was evident
relief in the sigh with which he accepted the return of the
girl's contract.



"I'm real sorry, Miss Hanson, real sorry," he said sincerely.
"But I guess you're right, seeing things are as they
are. You see, Mrs. Mea       you see, San Sabatano has notions.
I'd just like to say right here, though, I'm the loser
by your going. I'm the loser by a heap. An' whenever
you're wanting a reference I'll hand you a bully one. Just
you write me when you need it. Meanwhile the cashier'll
hand you a check for salary, right away."



Yes, whatever his wife's attitude toward her, Mr. Meakin
stood her good friend, for, on her departure, the cashier
handed her a check for three months' salary       which she had
not earned!



After she left San Sabatano her fortunes, for a while, became
more than checkered. Her "ups" were few, and her
"downs" were considerably in the ascendant. For a long
time her youth prevented her obtaining work in which there
was any scope for her abilities and ambitions, consequently
the salaries were equally limited in their possibilities. Often
she had to accept "free lance" stenography and typing, and
not infrequently auxiliary clerk work of a humdrum and
narrowing order. But to none of these things would she
definitely commit herself, nor would she permit them to shut
out the sun of her ambitions. She would keep on working,
and watching, and waiting, for that opportunity which she
felt was bound to come in the end.



Thus, with each reverse in the stern battle she was fighting,
she grew wider in her knowledge of life as it was. Her
upbringing had blinded her, and her own simple honesty
and faith had further narrowed her focus. But these things
were passing, and her view widened as the months lengthened
into years.



But her trials were many. Not the least of them was
when, as Miss Hanson, it was discovered she was always
accompanied by a boy with blue eyes and fair hair, practically
the color of her own. Nor was there any chance of
quieting the voice of scandal, when it was known that the
particular child always called her "mother."



Twice this occurred in boarding houses of an ultra-respectable
tone, which, on the whole, was not so damaging
as it was annoying. But when her supposed offence attacked
her livelihood, as, on more than one occasion, it very soon
did, it was with heartache and grief that Monica realized
that a drastic change must be brought about.



She knew that, for his own sake, she must temporarily
part with the boy. It was imperative that she earn the
money necessary for his education, and, with this scandal
attaching to her, that would very soon be made impossible.
Furthermore, she realized that he was rapidly growing to
years of childish understanding when it would be hopeless,
and even dangerous, to attempt to answer the multiplicity of
questions regarding his supposed father which flowed from
his lips, without giving a damaging impression to his young
mind. Later, when he grew up, she would tell him the false
story which she had hardened her heart to, and trust to
Providence that it might satisfy, and have no evil consequences.



It was a terrible blow to part from him. She loved the
boy, whom she had had christened Frank Burton, with all
the profound affection of her ardent nature. He was possibly
more precious to her than her own son might have been,
if only for the fact of the pains she was at to keep him, and
the trials which his upbringing brought her.



Then, too, she was never quite without a haunting fear
that at any time some unforseen circumstance might arise
and snatch him from her care. Besides these things, the boy
inherited all his mother's generous nature; all her loyalty;
and, in a hundred other ways, reminded her of the sister she
had loved. To Monica he was the sweetest creature in the
world, and the parting with him came well-nigh to breaking
her heart.



But it proved itself for the best. It almost seemed as if
Frank's going were in some way responsible for the change
of fortune which so quickly followed. Within a month,
Monica secured an excellent position in a Chicago wheat
broker's office at the biggest salary she had ever earned.
Furthermore, she remained in this place for a year, with
unqualified success. Thence she went to another wheat
operator's office. Then on, from post to post, always advancing
her interests, and always in the wheat world. Truly
the boy's going away to school seemed like the first stepping-stone
to the successful career she so ardently desired.



So Frank's education was completed in the manner Monica
most desired. Her experience in the world of wheat inspired
her with definite ideas as to his future; ideas in which, fortunately,
he readily concurred.



No one knew better than Monica the fortunes to be won
from the soil, and she was at pains to impress on his young
mind that such fortunes were far more honestly and easily
earned than in the commercial world to which she belonged.



Therefore at the age of fifteen Frank repaired to an agricultural
institution to learn in theory that which, later, he
was to test in practice.



It was during his career at the agricultural college that
Monica first became the secretary of Alexander Hendrie,
the greatest wheat grower and operator in the west of
Canada. He was a man she had known by reputation for
several years, ever since she first stepped within the portals
of the wheat world. She had never come into actual contact
with him before, but his name was a household word wherever
wheat was dealt in. Besides being a big operator on the
Winnipeg and Chicago markets, he owned something like
thirty square miles of prairie land in Alberta under wheat
cultivation, and was notorious for his scrupulous honesty
and hard dealing. It was a saying in the world of which
he was the uncrowned king that it was always safe to follow
where he led, but only to follow. Of course he was a millionaire
several times over, but there was no ostentation, no
vulgar display with him. He lived a sparing, hard-working
life, and in such an employ Monica felt that she had reached
the goal of her career.



The manner of her meeting with him was curious, and
almost like the work of Fate. But the manner of her engagement
as his secretary was still more curious, yet characteristic
of the man.



It happened on the railroad. She was returning from the
west coast with her then employer, Henry Louth, one of the
most daring of the Chicago wheat men. Perhaps a better
description of him would have been "reckless," but the newspapers
reported him as daring       until after his death.



Like many another speculator in the past, this man had
become disastrously involved in a wild endeavor to corner
wheat. But he found, as others had found before him, instead
of completing the corner he hoped to make, he had only
created a Frankenstein which threatened him with destruction.
So far did he suddenly find himself involved that only
financial assistance on an enormous scale could have saved
him from ruin. His thoughts turned at once to Alexander
Hendrie, who was then in Vancouver. He was the only man
who could afford him adequate help. There was nothing for
it but a desperate rush across the continent on his forlorn
hope, and he undertook the journey at once, accompanied
by Monica.



But like the majority of forlorn hopes inspired by ill fortune,
the journey ended in dire disaster. When Louth put
his proposition to the millionaire he learned to his horror
that this man was actually the head of the syndicate who
had been his undoing. It was an absurd blending of comedy
and tragedy, yet the situation was wholly characteristic of
the methods of Alexander Hendrie. The work had been
carried out with all the subtlety of the astute mind which
had lifted the man to his present position. It had been
carried out by secret agents, and never for one moment had
his name been allowed to figure in the affair. But it was
Hendrie who was responsible for the shattering of the edifice
of monopoly Louth had so recklessly attempted to set up;
and the latter set out on his return journey a broken and
beaten man.



Monica would never forget that journey, and all it meant
to her. While the train was held up by a heavy snowfall
at a place called Glacier, in the Rocky Mountains, Henry
Louth, in his private car, took the opportunity of shooting
himself. The sensation, the hubbub, the excitement the
affair caused was intense; and Monica attended him during
his dying moments, afterwards watching at his bedside until
his body was removed by the authorities.



It was during this latter period, when the excitement
had died down, and all was quiet again, that a large man
entered the car from another part of the train. He came
straight to the bedside and looked gravely at the dead man.
Then he turned to the beautiful woman beside the bed, and
looked at her with unsmiling eyes.



She knew him at once, and returned his look unflinchingly.
It was Alexander Hendrie. She recognized the strong,
rugged face of the man, and his abundant fair hair.



In a moment a cold resentment at the intrusion rose up in
her, and, for the life of her, she could not restrain the impulse
to give it expression.



"Well?" she inquired. "Are you satisfied?"



"How?"



The man displayed no emotion. His ejaculation was the
expression of a mind preoccupied.



"You       you are responsible for this."



Monica's challenge came with biting coldness. But
Hendrie only shook his head.



"Wrong. Guess you don't understand. Maybe most
folks       who don't understand       will say that. But I'm not
responsible for       that." He indicated the dead man with a
contemptuous nod. "I was on a legitimate proposition to
prevent the consumers of wheat being plundered. I'm losing
money by what I've done. Guess he hadn't the grit to stand
the racket of his dirty game. Men like him are well out of it."



Monica dropped her eyes from the steady gaze of the
iron man before her. Somehow she felt ashamed of her
impulsive accusation. In his concise fashion he had given
her a new understanding of what had happened.



"I hadn't seen it that way before," she said, almost
humbly.



Hendrie nodded.



"You were his secretary," he said, with a subtle emphasis.



"Yes."



Again the man nodded.



"I've heard of you."



Then he turned as if about to go. But he did not go.
He paused, and again his steady eyes sought hers.



"Guess he's dead. I need another secretary. You can
have the job."



This was Monica's first encounter with a personality
which had a strange and powerful attraction for her.



Two weeks later she found herself in her new position,
established in the millionaire's palatial offices in Winnipeg
at, what was for her, a princely salary.



At the end of nearly two years she was still with him, a
privileged, confidential secretary; and at last the woman in
her was crying out against the head which had for so long
governed her affairs. The woman in her had been too
strenuously subjected in her eighteen years of a commercial
career. She had shut her ears to every cry of rebellion for
the sake of her quixotic pledge. But now they were too
loud, too strong to be any longer ignored, and their incessant
pleading found an almost ready ear.



Alexander Hendrie had offered her marriage. He had
done more. This apparently cold commercial machine had
shown her a side of his nature which the eye of his world was
never permitted to witness. He had thrown open the furnace
doors of his masterful soul, and she had witnessed such a
fire of passionate love that left her dazed and powerless
before its fierce intensity.



And she       she had needed little urging. The wonderful
attraction of this personality had ripened during her two
years of service. She no longer worked with every faculty
straining for the handsome salary he gave her; she worked
for the man. Her whole heart was wrapped up in his achievement.
Yes, she knew that he stood before even her love for
the boy whom she had taught to call her "mother."



That was her trouble now. That was the one all-pervading
drop of gall in her cup of happiness. Dr. Strong
had warned her, and now she was torn by the hardness of her
lot as she gazed upon the frowning crags which loomed up
on her horizon.



She rose and crossed the room to her bureau. She picked
a letter up that was lying on the top of it. It was the last
letter she had received from young Frank, from the farm he
was on, not far from Calford, just outside the little township
of Gleber. She read it through again. One paragraph
particularly held her attention and she read it a second
time.



"I've met such a bully girl. Her name's Phyllis Raysun.
She's just about my own age. It was at a dance, at a farm
twenty miles away. We danced ten dances together. Oh,
mother, you will like her. She's fine. Pretty as anything,
with dark eyes and dark hair              "



Monica went back to her seat at the window. There was
a smile in her eyes, but there was trouble in them, too. She
understood that Frank was grown up. He was grown up,
and like all the rest of young people his thoughts were turning
toward girls and matrimony.



Frank was still in ignorance of the facts of his birth. She,
Monica, was his "mother," so far as he knew, and he understood
that his father was dead. This was the belief she had
brought him up to. This was the belief she hoped to keep
him in. But now, all too late, she was realizing through such
letters as these that a time must soon come when he would
want to know more; when the preliminary lies her sister had
forced her into must be augmented by a whole tissue of
falsehood to keep the secret of his mother's shame from
him.



Her determination to shield her sister was still her principal
thought.



At all costs her promise to the dying woman must be kept.
There should be no weakening. She would carefully prepare
her story. Lies       it would all be lies. But she could not help
it. She felt they were lies for which there was a certain
justification, lies which possessed no base object, but rather
the reverse.



But now had come this fresh complication in the person
of Alexander Hendrie. Here was something she had never
even dreamed of. He became something more than a complication.
He was a threat. She could not marry him.
She must definitely refuse him. And then              



Despair took hold of her and wrung her heart. Marriage
she knew was forever denied her. She had known it while
she dressed herself and prepared to receive the man she loved
that afternoon. She had known it even while she rejoiced
in her own attractiveness, and the thoughts of the love she
had inspired.



She turned to the window with a deep sigh and stared
hopelessly out of it at the keen winter sunshine.



To contemplate marriage with a man as passionately in
love as Alexander Hendrie, a man as strong, as masterful as
he, with the existence of her boy to be explained away, would
be rank madness. It was hopeless, impossible. It could
not be.



No, she knew. She needed no prompting. Her course
lay clear before her. She dared not sacrifice the hard struggles
of those eighteen years for this love which had at last
come into her life. She knew now how she had sacrificed
herself on the altar of affection when she pledged herself to
the care of her sister's child. That sacrifice must go on to
the end, come what might. It was hard, hard, but she resolutely
faced the destiny which she had marked out for herself.



That was why she had not telephoned to her employer to
put him off. That was why she had specially prepared her
toilet to receive him. She would definitely refuse to marry
him. But she would rather lacerate her already wounded
heart by the painful delight of an interview, than shut out
of her life this one passionate memory under the cold seal of
an envelope.



It was her woman's way, but it was none the less sincere,
none the less strong.






CHAPTER II



ALEXANDER HENDRIE



Had Monica only known it her weakness lay in the very
strength of that loyalty which held her to her promise to her
dead sister. She was far too honest to deal successfully in
affairs which demanded the smallest shadow of subterfuge.
At the best she could only hope to lie blunderingly, and to
blunder in falsehood leads to sure disaster.



So she had no real understanding of that which lay before
her, the endless troubles she was preparing for herself and
those belonging to her. The pity of it. One could almost
imagine the Angel of Truth wringing his hands, and weeping
for the mistaken honesty which clung to a quixotic promise
given eighteen years ago to a dying woman.



It was a nervous, troubled woman who started at the
clang of the bell at her outer door. She turned with terrified
eyes to the silver clock which stood on her bureau. It was
four o'clock. Four o'clock to the minute; and instinctively
her hands went up to her hair, and nimble fingers lightly
patted it.



For a moment she stood irresolutely staring before her.
She seemed in desperate doubt, as though laboring under
desire to greet her visitor, while instinctively fearing the outcome
of his visit. The next moment her silken skirts rustled
as she hurriedly passed out to her front door.



Alexander Hendrie followed her into the sitting-room, and
promptly its femininity gave way to the atmosphere which
his personality seemed to shed upon all that encountered
it.



It was not an essentially refined personality, it was too
rugged, too grimly natural, too suggestive of Nature in her
harsher moments to possess any of the softer refinements
of life. A bald, broken crag set in the midst of a flower
garden of perfect order would rob its surroundings of its
delicate charm and trifling beauties. So it was with the man,
Hendrie, in the essentially feminine room which was Monica's
care. He dwarfed the refinements of it with a magnetic
claim for his own rugged picturesqueness.



He was a man of something over six feet in height. There
was not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon his muscular,
erect form, which was clad in the simple fashion of a well-tailored
man who takes but little interest in his clothes. But
these things were almost lost sight of in the absorbing interest
of his rather plain face.



An artist painting the picture of a Viking of old would
have reveled in such a face, and such a wealth of waving
fair hair. He would have caught the look of confidence, the
atmosphere of victory which lay in every detail of the strong
mold in which his features were cast.



It was a face full of faults, yet it was such a combination
of strength and mentality that no eye trained to the study of
physiognomy could have resisted it. The lines in it were
pronounced. Yet every line was a definite indication of
the power behind it. There was a contemplative light shining
in the keen gray eyes which told of perfect control of all
emotions; there was a definite indentation between the fair,
ample brows, which suggested a power of concentration.
The nose was broad and pronounced, with curiously sensitive
nostrils. The cheekbones were lean and broad. The mouth
was broad, too, but firmly closed, and quite free from the
least suggestion of animal sensuality. Yet it was a hard
face; not hard in the sense of cruelty, it was hard in its
definite, almost relentless purpose.



Monica realized something of all this as she brought a
large rocker forward for his use; and her heart failed her
as she remembered the mission that had brought him to her
apartment.



"You're pretty comfortable here, Monica," he said, glancing
round with a faintly approving smile, as he dropped into
the rocker.



The woman followed his glance with a responsive smile.



"Thanks to you," she said readily, without noting one
detail of the tastefully arranged furnishings which had
brought forth his comment.



The man's brows went up in swift inquiry.



"How?"



Monica sat down. She was glad of the support, but her
manner was perfectly easy.



"The generous salary you pay me       of course."



Hendrie shook his head.



"I never pay generous salaries. Those who receive my
salaries earn them."



Monica laughed. Slowly confidence was returning.



"That's so like you," she said. "I wonder if I earn $5000
a year. I have often worked twice as hard for half the sum."



"Quite so. But what was the work? From my point of
view you earn the money, and perhaps more, by carrying
the confidence I always know I can place in you. But, say,
don't let's discuss the economy of commerce. Guess I came
here on a different errand."



Monica averted her gaze. She looked out of the window
she was facing.



"Yes," she said, with a sudden return of all her old
apprehensions.



The man leaned forward in his chair. His hands were
clasped together, and his forearms pressed heavily on his
knees. There was a faint flush on his cheeks, and the usual
contemplative light had passed from his eyes, leaving them
alight with a growing fire of passion.



"Tell me," he cried suddenly, a deep note in his voice.
"Have you anything to say to me? Anything about our
talk the other night?"



Monica kept her eyes averted. She was summoning all
her courage, that she might the more successfully bruise and
beat down her own love for this man.



She shook her head without daring to face him. She
knew, she felt the heat of passion shining in his gray eyes.



"It       it       can't be," she said, stumbling fatally.



She waited, hardly knowing what to expect. As the man
remained silent the beatings of her heart seemed to have
suddenly become so loud that she thought he must surely
hear them; and hearing them, would understand the cowardice
she was laboring under.



Had she dared to look at him she must have seen the
marked change her refusal had brought about. The same
passionate fire was in his eyes, there was the same flush upon
his cheeks. But there was an added something that was
quite different from these things, something which she
might have recognized, for she had witnessed it many
times before in her intercourse with him. It was the
fighting spirit of the man slowly rising, the light of battle
gathering.



He smiled, and his smile was strangely tender in a man
of his known character.



"Is that all?" he asked at last. "Is that your       final
word?"



"Yes," she almost gasped, and desperately faced him.



Then she abruptly rose from her seat and moved toward
the window. She had seen more in his eyes than she could
face, and still remain true to her decision.



"But's       it's insufficient, Mon."



The man rose from his chair and followed her. He came
near, and stood close behind her. She could feel his warm
breath on the soft flesh which was left bare by the low neck
of her costume. She trembled, and stood helplessly dreading
lest he should recognize the trembling. Then she heard his
low voice speaking, and her whole soul responded to the fire
that lay behind his words.



"I love you, Mon. I love you so that I cannot, will not
give you up. I love you so that all else in my life goes for
nothing. All my life I've reveled in the constant joy of
anticipation of the success I have achieved. All my life I
have centered my whole soul on these things, and trained
brain and body for a titanic struggle to the top of the financial
ladder. And now, what is it, if       if I can't win you, too?
Mon, it's simply nothing. Can't you understand what I feel
when I say that? More than all the wealth and position I've
dreamed of all my life I want you       you. What is it? Why?
Tell me why it       can't be."



But Monica could not tell him. She knew she could not;
and she knew that she could not go on listening to the strong
man's pleadings without yielding.



Suddenly, in something like desperation, she turned and
faced him.



"I tried to make it plain to you the other night," she cried,
with a complaint that made her voice almost harsh. "I tried
to tell you then that I could not marry you. But you
wouldn't listen to me. You laughed my refusal aside. You
told me you would not give me up. I can only reiterate what
I tried to tell you then. Why       why urge me when I say I       I
cannot marry you?"



"Cannot?"



"Yes       cannot, cannot!"



In desperation Monica added emphasis to her negative.



"There can only be one reason for 'cannot,'" said Hendrie,
with an abrupt return to calmness. "Are you married?
Have you a husband living?"



The woman's denial flashed out without thought.



"I am not married. I never have been married."



In a moment she realized the danger of so precipitate a
denial. The man's face lit more ardently than ever, and he
drew closer.



"Then you must take that word back, and say you       'will not.'
But you can't say that," he smiled gently. "Why
should you? Yes, I know you don't dislike me. You've
always seen me as I am. I'm no different. Say, Mon, I'm
not here to bully you into marrying me. I'm here to plead
with you. I who have never in my life pleaded to man or
woman. I want you to give me that which I know no money
can ever buy, no position can ever claim. I want your love.
I want it because I love you, and without you nothing is
worth while."



He was very near her now. He was so near that Monica
dared not move. She could only stand helplessly gazing out
of the window. As she remained silent he urged her again,
placing one powerful hand gently upon her shoulder.



"Tell me, do you dislike the hard, unscrupulous financier
that men are only too ready to villify?" he asked, with a
gentle smile of confidence. "Do you?" His hand moved till
it dropped to the woman's soft, rounded upper arm.



"Mon," he continued, "I want you so much. Tell me you
don't       dislike me."



Monica's courage was swiftly ebbing. The task she had
set herself was too hard for her. She was too simply human
to withstand the approach of this great love. The touch of
the man's hand, so gentle, so almost reverent, had sent the
blood coursing through her veins in a hot, passionate tide.
All her love for him surged uppermost, and drove her headlong
to a reckless denial.



"No," she cried, in a low voice. "How could I dislike
you? What does it matter to me what men say of you?
You have been the essence of goodness to me       oh!"



The exclamation came without fear, without resentment.
It was the suddenness of it all. In a moment she lay crushed
in the man's powerful arms; his tall figure towered over her,
and his plain face looked ardently down into hers while he
poured out a passionate torrent of words into her willing
ears.



"Then I'll take no refusal," he cried, with a ring of triumph
and joy in his deep voice. "Look up, Mon, look up,
my dear, and tell me that you don't love me. Look up, and
tell me with your eyes looking right into mine, and I'll believe
you, and let you go. Look up, my darling, and tell me.
You can't       you can't. Say       it's useless to try. Quit it,
Mon, quit it. You love me, I know. I feel it here, right here
in my heart, here, Mon, here," he cried triumphantly.
"Right where your beautiful head is resting."



He moved one hand from about her, and deliberately
lifted her face so that he could gaze down upon the eyes
hidden beneath the deeply fringed lids.



"Come, Mon," he cried tenderly. "Speak up. Say, I can't
just hear you. I want to hear you say you don't love me,
you hate me for this. No? Then you must kiss me."



He bent his head, and drew her face up to his. And an
exquisite joy flooded Monica's heart as he rained burning
kisses upon her lips, her eyes, her hair.



So they remained for many minutes. He, speaking words
which were ample caresses, she, listening like one in a wonderful,
heavenly dream.



But at last she stirred in his arms, and finally released
herself. Then, with flushed face and bowed head, she flung
herself upon the ottoman beside her with something almost
like a sob.



Hendrie waited for a moment. Then he drew up a chair
and sat down, and deliberately removed the hands in which
her face was buried.



"What is it, Mon?" he inquired anxiously, but in his firm,
decided way.



"I       I don't know," she cried, with the desperate helplessness
of a child. "You       you've made me love you, and       and
it's all wrong       all wrong."



Hendrie smiled confidently.



"Is it? Ah, well, you do love me. That's all that matters       really."



She stared at him with suddenly widening eyes. Then
she, too, smiled a tender, shy smile that still was full of
trouble.



"I'm afraid       I do," she said. "But I didn't mean you to
know              "



"Afraid?"



Hendrie's smile was good to see. But it passed quickly,
and he went on in the manner of a man always accustomed
to dictate.



"Now listen, Mon. We are going to be married without
unnecessary delay. How soon can you be ready?"



In a moment Monica realized the utter folly of what she
had done. In a moment it swept over her, threatening and
almost paralyzing her faculties. She paled. Then a deep
flush leaped into her cheek, and, in a fever of apprehension,
she pleaded for a respite.



"No, no, not yet," she cried, with a sudden energy which
quite startled her lover. "I cannot marry you until       until              
You see," she blundered on, "there are so many things.
I       I have responsibilities. There are              "



Hendrie mercifully broke in upon her, and perhaps saved
her from betraying in her hysterical apprehension those very
things she wished to keep from him.



"Don't be scared, Mon," he said quickly. "It's for you to
say. It's right up to you. I shan't rush you. See. Think
it over. I've got to go west to-morrow. Guess I'll be away
a week. Say, this day week. You'll get it all fixed by then.
I'll get right back and you can tell me when you'll marry me.
You see, I just want you       whenever you're ready."



It was impossible to withstand him, and, in desperation,
Monica realized that it was worse than useless to pit her reason
against a love she desired more than all the world. She
felt utterly helpless, like one swept off her feet by an irresistible
tide. There was a recklessness, too, in her blood now,
a recklessness flowing hotly through veins which for so long
had been left unstirred in their perfect calm, and somehow
the joy of it had intoxicated her reason and left her unable
to adequately control it.



Later it would be different. When he had gone she would
be able to think soberly, and she knew she would have to
think hard to repair the damage of these moments. She
would wait till then when the toll was demanded of her, and
now       now? These moments were too sweetly precious to
deny. She would not, she could not deny them. So, while
she knew that every fraction of the penalty would be demanded
of her later, she thanked her God for this love that
had come to her, and abandoned herself to its delight.






CHAPTER III



THE PENALTY



It was a changed woman who restlessly paced the narrow
limits of her sitting-room four days later. Monica was
awaiting another visitor; again she was awaiting the ominous
clang of the bell at the front door. But her feelings were
very different now. The timid shrinking, the mere thrill of
troubled apprehension with which she had awaited the coming
of the man who had changed all those things into a wild,
reckless joy, was nothing to the desperation with which she
contemplated the coming visit. She knew that the penalty
was about to be exacted, the toll, for the stolen moments
when she had permitted the woman in her to taste of the
sweets which surely she had a right to.



The sober moments she had anticipated had come; oh,
yes, they had come as she knew they inevitably must come.
She had faced the consequences of the weakness she believed
herself to have displayed in all their nakedness, and she saw
before her such a tangle, the contemplation of which had set
her head whirling, and filled her heart with despair.



She was torn between her loyalty to the living, and her
duty to the dead. She was torn between that which she
knew she owed to herself, and all those other obligations
which could be summed up as part of the strong moral side
of her nature. She was seeking a central path which might
satisfy in some degree each of the opposing claims. She was
committing that fatal mistake of seeking the easiest road,
with the full knowledge that it was a mistake. She had
tasted life, and now she was powerless to continue the sacrifice
she had for such long years marked out for herself.



The habit of years was strong upon her. There was
something almost superstitious in the way she clung to the
promise she had so rashly given her sister. She could no
more outrage that than she could deny the love that had
come to her so late. Therefore she saw nothing but that
perilous middle course open before her.



She had sent for her boy, the man       yes, he was a man
now       whom she had been at such pains to bring up with
lofty aspirations, and a fine sense of love, and honor, and
duty. She told herself she was going to lie to him, lie to
him with all the heartless selfishness of an utterly weak and
worthless woman. She tried to smother her conscience by
reminding herself that she had always seen the necessity of
ultimately lying to him, and now only the motive of the lies
was changed. She told herself these things, but she did not
convince herself. She knew that originally her contemplated
lies were that he might be kept from the knowing of his
mother's shame, and as such might even have found justification
in the eyes of the Recording Angel. Now it was different;
their motive was purely one of self, and for such there
could be no justification.



So she was desperate. All that was best in her was warring
with the baser human side of a really fine nature. She
suffered agonies of torture while she waited for the coming
of the man who would gaze at her with wide, frank, trusting
eyes, while she lied something of his simple faith and youthful
happiness away.



Was there wonder that she dreaded his coming? Could
it be otherwise? She could see no other course than the one
she had decided upon. She was blinded by her newly found
love for the man, Hendrie; she was blinded by her promise to
a dead woman. Frank must be persuaded into the background.
He must remain hidden, lest the breath of scandal
reach Hendrie, and she be robbed of the happiness she so
yearned for. He must be made the sacrifice for her selfish
desires.



In the midst of her desperate thought, the signal rang out
through the apartments. Oh, that bell; how she hated its
brazen note. But now that the moment of her trial had
come there was no shrinking, no hesitation. She passed
swiftly to the door and opened it, and, in a moment, was engulfed
in a bear-like embrace by a great, fair-haired
young giant who, tall as Monica was, quite towered over
her.



"Why, mother," he cried, as he finally released her, "I
never had such a rush to get here so soon. Guess your wire
set me on the dead jump. I drove twenty-five miles to the
depot in under three hours, to catch the east-bound mail, and
nearly foundered old Bernard's best team. But I'd made up
my mind to              "



Monica's eyes shone with admiration and love.



"That's so like you, Frank, dear," she cried. "Come right
in and sit down. You're such an impulsive boy. But I'm
glad you've come       so glad."



The delight at the sight of her beloved boy had almost
died out of Monica's eyes as she finished speaking. It had all
come back to her       the meaning of his visit.



Frank flung himself into the same rocking chair in which
Alexander Hendrie had sat, and gazed up at the beautiful
woman he called "mother" with a radiant smile on his
handsome, ingenuous face.



"Gee, I'm tired," he exclaimed. "Two nights and a day
in the train. I didn't come sleeper. I didn't want to rush
you too much. So I just dozed in the ordinary car where
I sat."



In spite of everything Monica's delight in this fatherless
boy was wonderful. All her love was shining in her eyes
again as she exclaimed       



"Oh, Frank! You didn't come sleeper? Why not? You
shouldn't have considered the expense."



The boy laughed joyously.



"That's so like you, Mon, dear," he promptly retorted.
He always called her "Mon" in his playful moods, declaring
that she was far too young and pretty to be called "mother."
"You really are an extravagant woman to have a growing
and expensive family."



"Growing?" Monica laughed happily. "I hope not.
Goodness! You always find it more convenient to sit down
when you're talking to me."



The boy nodded.



"That's because I'm tired       and hungry," he said lightly.
"You see I haven't eaten since breakfast. Got any lunch?"



"Lunch? Of course. Oh, Frank, really you're not to be
trusted looking after yourself. Of course I've a lunch ready
for you. It's just cold. I don't trust the janitor's cooking
except for breakfast."



"Bully! I know your lunches. Come along."



The boy sprang from his seat, and, seizing Monica about
the waist, was for rushing her off to the dining-room.



Monica abandoned herself to the delights of the moment.
The boy could not have been more to her if he had really
been her son. Her eyes were full of a maternal adoration.
He was so tall, she thought; and his bright, shrewd, good-natured
blue eyes full of half-smiling seriousness. Was
there ever such a face on a boy? How handsome he was with
his finely cut, regular features, his abundant fair hair, which,
since he had been on the farm, had been allowed to run riot.
And then his hugely muscular body. Eighteen! Only
eighteen! Little wonder, she thought, this Phyllis Raysun
was ready to dance so often with him.



"You're much too boisterous," she chided him, smiling
happily.



"Never mind. Mon," he cried, "take me to the ban               Oh,
I forgot. Your wire was 'rushed.' You wanted to see
me at once. That's why I nearly killed Bernard's team.
There's       there's nothing wrong, is there?"



The blue eyes were serious enough now. He had come to
a standstill, with his arms still about Monica's waist, half
way across the room.



But now it was Monica's turn to urge. All the joy had
gone out of her eyes. He had reminded her of the tissue of
falsehood she had prepared for him. No, no, she could not
tell him yet, and, with all a coward's procrastination, she
put him off.



"I'll       I'll tell you about it when you've eaten," she said
hastily. "We've       we've got to have a serious talk. But
not       now. Afterwards."



Frank gave her a quick, sidelong glance.



"Righto," he said simply. But a shadow had somehow
crept into his eyes. So deep was the sympathy between
these two that he promptly read something of the trouble
underlying her manner.





Frank was seated on the lounge beside the window. His
attitude was one of tense, hard feeling. His blue eyes were
full of bitterness as they stared out at the coppery sheen of
the telegraph wires, which caught the winter sunlight, just
outside the sitting-room window.



Monica had just finished speaking. For some minutes
the low pleading of her voice had reached him across the
room. She was as far from him as the limits of the room
would permit. Such was her repulsion at the lies she had to
tell him that she felt the distance between them could not be
too wide.



Her story was told. She had branded herself with her
sister's shame. The curious twist of her mind held her to
her promise, even to this extent. Now she waited with
bowed head for the judgment of this youth of eighteen who
had been taught to call her "mother." And as she sat there
waiting she felt that her whole life, her whole being was made
up of degraded falsehood.



The story was as complete as she could make it. The
work was done. Her sister's name, and ill-fame, had been
kept from her son.



As the moments passed and no word came in answer,
Monica's apprehension grew, and she urged him. She could
face his utmost scorn better than this suspense.



"That is all, Frank," she said, with a dignity she was
wholly unaware of.



The man stirred. He stretched out his great limbs upon
the couch and drew them up again. Then he turned his eyes
upon the waiting woman. They were unsmiling, but they
had no condemnation in them. He had fought out his little
battle with himself.



"So I am a       bastard," he said, slowly and distinctly.
"Frank; oh, Frank! Not that word."



The boy laughed, but without any mirth.



"Why not? Why be afraid of the truth? Besides, I have
always known       at least suspected it."



Monica suddenly buried her face in her hands. He had
known. He had suspected. And all these years she had
endeavored to keep the secret from him. The thought of it
all hurt her as much as if the shame of it were really hers.



Presently he left his seat and came to her side.
"Don't worry, mother, dear," he said, with one hand tenderly
laid upon her shoulder. "You see, we never talked
much of my father. You were never easy when you spoke of
him. I guessed there was something wrong; and being young,
and perhaps imaginative, I found the truth without much
guessing. Still I didn't ask questions. It was not up to me
to hurt you. What was the use. I knew I should hear some
day, and quite made up my mind how to act." He smiled.
"You see, if you told me I knew I could bear it almost       easily.
I should have far less to bear than you who told it,
and       and that showed me how small a thing it was for me       by
comparison. If it came through other sources I should
have acted differently, particularly if the telling of it came
from       a man."



He paused, and Monica looked up at him with wondering
admiration.



"I want to tell you, mother," he hurried on, blushing painfully
with self-consciousness, "that only a great and brave
woman could have told her son       what you have told me. And       and
I honor you for it. I want to tell you it's not
going to make any difference between us, unless it is to
increase my       my love. As for me       I don't see that it's
going to give me sleepless nights, so       so just let's forget
it."



Frank's manner became hurried and ashamed as he finished
up. It seemed absurd to him that he should be saying
such things to his mother. Yet he wanted to say them. He
intended to say them. So he blundered as quickly and
shamefacedly through them as he could.



To his enormous relief Monica sighed as though the worst
were over. But her sigh was at the wonderful magnanimity
of this huge boy. He started to return to the lounge. Half
way across the room he came to a sudden stop, and a look of
perplexity drew his brows together. In his anxiety for his
mother he had forgotten. Now he remembered. Suddenly
he turned back.



"You didn't send for me so urgently to tell me this?" he
demanded. "This would have kept."



Monica shook her head decidedly. She caught a sharp
breath.



"It would not have kept. It       it had to be told       now."



"Now?"



"Yes."



"Why?"



"Because I am going to be       married."



"Mother!"



There was no doubt about the man's dismay. He stood
there hardly daring to believe his senses. His mother was
going to be married after       after              



"But, mother, you don't mean that? You're not serious,"
he cried, his ingenious face flushed, his whole look incredulous.



Something of the woman's resentment against the unworthy
part that had been forced upon her suddenly found
expression.



"Yes, I mean it," she cried sharply. "Of course I mean it.
I am in no mood to trifle. Why else should I have sent for
you now to tell you the miserable story you have just listened
to, unless it were that my coming marriage made it imperative?"



The flush deepened upon the man's face.



"But you can't," he cried, with sudden vehemence. "You
daren't! Oh, mother, you must be mad to think of marriage
now       I mean with       with my existence to be accounted for."



"That's just why I have sent for you."



Monica sprang from her seat and ran to him. She reached
up, and placed both hands upon his shoulders and gazed
pleadingly into his face.



"Don't fail me, Frank. Don't fail me," she cried, all her
woman's heart stirred to a dreadful fear lest, after all, she
should lose the happiness she was striving for, had lied for,
was ready to do almost anything for. "You don't know
what it means to me. How can you? You are only a boy.
It means everything. Yes, it means my life. Oh, Frank,
think of all the years I have gone through without a home,
without any of those things which a woman has a right to,
except what I have earned for myself with my own two hands.
Think of the loveless life I have been forced to live for all
these years. Frank, Frank, I have given up everything in
the world for you, and now       now I love this man       I love him
with my whole soul."



Her head was bowed, and the agitated boy led her back
to her seat. He was beginning to understand things. His
honest eyes were beginning to look life in the face, and to see
there phases quite undreamed of in his youthful mind.



"I think I am beginning to understand, mother," he said
simply. "Tell me more. Tell me what you want of me. I       you
see, all this is a bit of a shock. I don't seem to know
where I am. Who is the man?"



"Alexander Hendrie."



"Hendrie? The man you work for? The man who owns
all those miles of wheat up our way? The millionaire?"



Frank's eyes shone with a sudden enthusiasm as he detailed
the achievements of the wheat king. For the moment
he had forgotten the reason of the mention of his name.



"Yes, yes." Something of his enthusiasm found an echo in
Monica. "Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it wonderful? Can you
wonder that I love him? Such a king among men. All my
life I have longed for achievement in the commercial world.
To me it is all that is worth while. This man has it. He is it.
I have been his chief secretary for two years. I have had a
most intimate knowledge of all his affairs, of the man. I
have helped in my little way toward his success. I love this
man, and he loves me. He will not hear of my refusing him.
I intended to because of you, but       but he is too strong for
me. He has bent my will to his, and I       I have yielded. Nor
was it all unwillingly. Oh, no. I was ready enough to yield
in spite of              "



"Does       he know of my existence?" Frank demanded. His
eyes were bright with alertness.



Monica's eyes widened.



"Of course not! If he knew of you my poor dream would
be shattered for ever. That is the terrible part. That is
why       why I have had to tell you everything."



"I see."



The man flung himself on the couch and clasped his hands
behind his head. He was thinking hard. Bit by bit all that
was in his mother's mind was coming to him. He let her go
on talking while he readjusted his new focus.



"Listen to me. Let us look at this thing from your point
of view. You know all we have striven for in setting you up
in life. We have been scraping and saving that you should
be properly equipped. Now we are saving to buy you an
adequate farm. You have got to do big things with that
farm. You must go further than merely making a living,
and marry, and bring up a large family. You must rise.
You must become a wheat king, too. If I marry Alexander
think of what it will mean to you. I shall be able to do these
things for you almost at once. You shall start on the best
farm money can buy. There will be no stinting. You can
have everything. And you will rise as I want you to; as
you want to. You, too, will become a power in the wonderful,
wonderful field of commerce. Oh, when I think of it it makes
me desperate at the thought of losing it all."



Frank remained lost in thought for some moments longer.
Then he suddenly looked up as though he had come to a
final decision.



"Look here, mother. I suppose I haven't had experience
enough to grasp the moral side of this thing. I       I suppose
there is a moral side to it," he said, with something almost
like helplessness. "But it seems to me that       that Hendrie's
eyes must never light on me, as       as any relation of yours.
Is that it? You want me to know just how the position
stands, and then hustle into the background, into my hole,
like       like any gopher."



Monica sighed. The ready understanding of the boy was
saving her worlds of painful explanation.



"I'm afraid that's what it comes to, Frank, though it
sounds dreadful put that way. It sounds as if we were conspirators
scheming to get the better of Alexander. Yes, it
sounds awful. And yet              "



Frank gave the first sign of impatience.



"Does it matter what it sounds like? I don't think so," he
said sharply. "You love this man, mother, and you want to
marry him. Very well, marry him. I will never jeopardize
your happiness. It is small enough return for all the sacrifices
you have made for me. I promise you Hendrie shall
never know you are my mother. I promise you never to
come near              "



"No, no, Frank. I don't want that," Monica cried desperately.
"I could not bear that. I must see you sometimes,
and later, when       when things have settled down              "



Frank shook his head.



"You are taking a grave risk, mother," he said earnestly.
"Far better let me pass out of your life       altogether."



"No, no! I would rather never marry than that. Promise
me that you will come and see me, and I will see you whenever
opportunity offers. Promise me, or              "



"All right, mother," replied the man, with his gentle, affectionate
smile. "You go ahead. You can always rely on
me for anything. And I give you my word of honor your
husband shall never know that I am your son."





That night Frank Burton leaned back in the upholstered
seat of the ordinary car on the west-bound train. He made
no attempt to read the Winnipeg Free Press which lay open
on his lap. He was busy forming conclusions. One of them
was that life was by no means the simple affair it had seemed
to him two days ago.



But he came to a more important conclusion than that.
He tried to view things from his mother's standpoint, from
the point of view of her feelings, and, while he deplored the
gravity of the risk she, as a woman, was taking, he acknowledged
that he would have done the same himself.



He thought of Phyllis Raysun       his Phyllis       and went hot
and cold as he tried to picture what his life would be if he
were never to see her again. He knew, in the recklessness of
his youthful courage, he would take any risk rather than
lose her.



Yes, love was a great and wonderful thing. He had just
made the discovery. His interview with his mother had
opened his eyes to the state of his own feelings. Love?
Why it was more than worth any risk. To him, in the first
flush of his eighteen years, it was the very essence of life.
It was all that really mattered. And he almost laughed when
he thought of the shock he had experienced when he had been
deliberately told he was a       bastard.






CHAPTER IV



THE BLINDING FIRES



Hendrie stood with one foot on the burnished rail of the
anthracite stove which augmented the heating apparatus of
Monica's sitting-room. He was smoking a cigarette in the
pensive manner of a perfectly contented man. His eyes idly
wandered over the simple but dainty furnishing of the room,
while his mind, that wonderful mechanism with which he had
carved his way to a mighty fortune, was busy dreaming
dreams of the future, which, for once, contained no thoughts
associated with the amassing of his immense wealth.



He was contemplating rather the spending of money than
the making of it. He was thinking pleasantly of those contracts
which he had already given out for the colossal alterations
which were being made in the mansion he owned out
West, upon his wheat lands. He was thinking of the palatial
residence which he had just purchased here, in Winnipeg,
and of the wonderful decorations that he had already arranged
should be executed by the finest decorators in New
York.



He intended that nothing should lack for the delight and
luxury of his bride. His whole being was permeated with a
passion such as he had never believed himself capable of.
And, for the moment, he was tasting the ripe delights of
a wonderfully successful career. He loved more madly
than any youthful lover; he loved for the first time in
his strenuous life, and the exquisite joy of being able to
give out of his overflowing storehouses intoxicated him.



He was a fine-looking figure as he stood there in his perfectly
fitting evening clothes. His spare frame suited the
refreshing smartness of such a costume, which softened the
harsher lines of his build, and even seemed to add to the
fascination of his rugged features.



He was awaiting Monica's pleasure while she arrayed herself
in the adjoining room. Nor did he display the least impatience.
He was rather enjoying the delay than otherwise.
It afforded him those moments of delightful anticipation
which rarely enough find their equal in realization. He
watched her beautiful personality moving through luxuriously
conceived pictures of their future life together. He
saw her the head of his princely establishments, the woman
of gracious presence and perfect form, a dazzling jewel in the
crown of social success he intended eventually to wear. Nor
were these dreams the outcome of mere selfish vanity. It
pleased him to think that she was to become that perfect
pivot upon which his life should revolve. He knew she was a
good woman, a phrase he used only in the loftiest sense. He
felt that to serve her, to minister to her happiness, was a
wonderful delight and privilege, and that, in living for it, he
had not lived in vain.



No, he was not impatient. There was no reason for impatience,
even in face of that truly feminine delay to which
Monica was treating him. He had come for the verdict she
had promised him, and he knew that it was to be favorable to
his desires. So he had made his arrangements with the decision
of a man who is unaccustomed to denial. They would
dine out together, and afterward spend the evening at the
theater.



He threw his cigarette end into the stove. He was about
to light a fresh one when a sound caught his ear. He suddenly
dashed the unlighted cigarette after the other, and
stood erect, waiting. Yes, the soft rustle of skirts moving
toward the dividing doors was unmistakable. Monica had
completed her toilet, and was coming to him.



A frank delight shone in his steady eyes as they turned to
the folding doors. His lips were parted in a smile. Such
was the ecstasy of his feelings that it seemed as if the whole
earth, the whole universe were acclaiming his happiness.



Her hand was upon the door handle. He strode hastily to
her assistance, and flung the doors wide. Nor was his action
one of mere conventional politeness. It was the impulse of
one who felt that the future could hold no happier service
than the care of this woman's well-being.



Monica was in full evening dress, an exquisite picture of
perfect womanhood. From the crown of her beautiful head,
with its wonderful halo of soft, waving fair hair, to the
soles of her satin slippers there was not a detail in her figure
or gown that could offend. In Hendrie's eyes there was
nothing on earth comparable with her.



Her eyes shone with suppressed excitement, and her usually
delicately tinted cheeks were a trifle pale. Her bosom, so
deliciously rounded, rose and fell a shade more rapidly than
usual with the emotions of the moment, but these were the
only outward signs she gave of the great love stirring her
woman's heart.



Hendrie stepped forward.



"Mon!"



In a moment she lay panting in his arms, and his kisses
melted the pallor of her cheek.



"Mine! Mine!" he cried, with a deep note of emotion in
his voice. "Mine for ever!" he went on, his powerful arms
crushing her yielding body to him.



There was no verbal answer. Monica remained passive.
The joy of those protecting arms had left her speechless.
But her warm lips were nevertheless eloquent, and he was
satisfied.



After a few delirious moments his embrace relaxed. Quite
abruptly his hands unclasped about her. He raised them
to the warm flesh of her shoulders, and, gently grasping
them, held her at arms' length from him.



His head was bent forward, and his passionate eyes
searched her face, but they could not penetrate the fringed
lids which were lowered before her eyes lest he should see too
deeply into the secrets of her woman's soul.



"Mon, my Mon," he cried, in a low voice. "Look up.
Look up into my eyes and tell me. Look up, and tell me you       love
me, with all your soul. Look up, and tell me that
you'll give up all the world       everything       for me. I can't
do with less," he went on hotly. "If you could only see into
my heart you'd understand. But you can't. There's nothing
and no one in the world for me but you, and I want you       all.
D'you understand, Mon? I want no less, and you must
tell me now       now       that this is your love for me, as it is mine
for you."



He paused, waiting for his answer, but remained gazing
with devouring eyes upon the beauty that so ravished his
senses. At last the eyelids slowly lifted. The doors of the
woman's soul were opened, and he gazed within. And while
he gazed her opening lips thrilled him as his ears drank in the
answer that came from them.



"I love you, dear," she murmured, with a softness indescribable.
"I love you       best in all the world."



Then a shy smile lit her fair face, and she clung to him,
hiding it against his breast.



"Best in all the world," he repeated ardently. "Mon, it's
good to hear. So good. Say, and you're my best in all the
world. You always will be. You are before all things in
my life."



Then came long, silent moments, moments in which heart
beat to heart and no spoken word but must have robbed
them of something of their rapture. They were moments
never to come again as long as both might live. With all the
strength of mature years they loved for the first time, and
the ripeness of imagination swept them with a perfect storm
of delirious joy. They were moments when soul is laid bare
to soul, and every nerve and sense is tuned in perfect sympathy.
They were moments when the glad outpourings of
two hearts mingled in a common flood which swept unchecked,
unguided, speeding on to that far dreamland of perfect bliss.



Such moments are mercifully brief, or the balance of mind
would soon stand in mortal jeopardy. So it came that later
on the harmonious flood, speeding distantly from its source,
lessened its frantic speed, and gently fell to a stream of calm
delight.



They sat together talking, talking joyously of all those
things which concerned the merging of their two lives. For
Monica all her troubles, all her self-inflicted tortures were
past and done with. There were no shadows. There was
nothing on the horizon of her life to mar the sheen of a perfect,
sunlit sky.



For the man those moments meant the crowning of his
life's ambitions, the crowning of all that was best in him.
He asked no more of the gods of fortune. So the tension of
the force which always spurred him was relaxed, and, for the
time, at least, he lay supine in the arms of his own dreaming
senses, basking in the realms of Love's pleasant sunlight.



Then the spell was finally broken. Sanity was reawakened
by the ticking clock, which stood among the trifling ornaments
upon Monica's desk. The man became aware of its
hands. The irresistible march of time would not be denied.
He nodded at the accusing face without any enthusiasm.



"It's nearly seven," he said, with a smile. "Shall we go,
or shall we              ?"



His voice was caressing, and its caress was hard for the
woman to resist. She knew that it was only for her to shake
her head, and these moments of delight would be prolonged
indefinitely.



The temptation was great. Then, with all a loving
woman's understanding of such things, she decided that the
sparing of such moments would keep the store longer.



"We'd better go," she said decidedly. Then she deferred
to him. "Don't you think so?"



Hendrie smiled happily. It was a new pleasure to find
himself obedient to another's whim.



"Yes," he said, promptly acquiescing. "You run along and
get your wraps, while I go and see if the car is ready downstairs."



With a final embrace Monica hurried into her bedroom.



Hendrie prepared to depart downstairs. But a final glance
at the clock arrested him, and he stood staring at the desk.



Slowly a flush crept into his lean cheeks, and the softness
of his steady eyes gave place to the usual cold light with
which the man was accustomed to face his world. The coldness
changed again to a curious sparkle       a sparkle which
would not have found its way there with any other eyes to
witness it.



He took a step toward the desk and picked up an embossed
silver photograph frame and stared down at the picture
it contained. For a moment he only noted the details of
the face it portrayed.



It was the picture of a man, a handsome, powerfully built
young man, dressed in flannels. The sweater he wore enhanced
his wonderfully athletic figure, and added a fine setting
for the well-poised head. The photographer had done
his work well, for never had Alexander Hendrie looked upon a
more perfect picture of magnificent manhood.



The glitter in his eyes hardened, and slowly a deep intense
fire grew in their depths. His brows drew together, and he
glowered with something like deadly hatred upon the offending
picture. Suddenly he replaced it upon the desk, and,
with a nervous thrust, his hands sought his trousers pockets,
while he deliberately took a step toward the door. But he
went no further. He swung about, and picked up the frame
again.



At that moment Monica re-entered from the bedroom.



A sudden terror leaped into her eyes as she recognized the
silver frame in his hand. One swift glance of his hot eyes
left her terror apparent to him. He needed no more. A
furious rage mounted to his brain. It was a rage of jealousy.
The first passion of jealousy he had ever known, and he felt
as though he were going mad.



But a powerful restraint, the habit of years, served him.
With one jerk of his muscular fingers the back of the frame
was torn out, and the photograph removed. Then the frame
fell to the floor, and its glass was shattered.



"Who's picture is this?" he demanded.



Monica strove to steady her shaking limbs. She cleared
her throat.



"Why       that's       that's the son of an old friend of mine,"
she cried desperately. "I've known him all his life."



The man deliberately tore the picture across. He tore it
across again. Then he walked over to the stove. He opened
it. One by one he dropped the fragments of Frank Burton's
picture into the heart of the glowing coal. Then he reclosed
the door.



The next moment Monica was in his arms, and his eyes
were devouring her beautiful, frightened face.



"Guess you'll know him no more," he cried, with a laugh,
which only seemed to accentuate the fury of his jealousy.
"No more. There's just one man in this world for you now,
and that man is              "



He broke off and released her. Then, with a sudden return
to his normal manner, and all sign of his mad jealousy passed,
he led her toward the door.



"Say, there's going to be no more shadows around, no
more shadows to       spoil things. The car's waiting       ready."






CHAPTER V



IN THE SPRINGTIME



A gray twilight stealing across the sky heralded the coming
of day. It was spring upon the flooded prairielands of
Canada; a season which is little more than a mere break between
an almost sub-tropical summer and the harshest winter
the world knows.



In the shadows of dawn the country looked like one vast
marshland, rather than the rich pastures and fertile wheat
country, which, in days yet to come, will surely fill the
stomach of the whole human world. Wide stretches of water
filled the shallow hollows; those troughs between the mountainous
rollers of grass, where the land rose like the swell of
a wind-swept ocean.



These wide expanses of water were all that was left of snow
to the depth of several feet; and in their turn would soon
enough be licked up by a thirsty summer sun. This was the
annual fertilizing process which left these hundreds of thousands
of square miles capable of a harvest which might well
set weeping with envy the toil-worn husbandman of older
countries.



Just now it was the feed ground of migratory visitors
from the feathered world. Also it had consequently become
the happy hunting-ground of every man and boy in the neighborhood
capable of carrying a gun. They were all there,
waiting in perfect silence, waiting with a patience which
nothing else could inspire, for the golden light of day, and
the winging of the unsuspecting birds.



The dim, yellow streak on the eastern horizon widened, and
the clacking of perhaps a hundred thousand tongues
screamed out their joy of life. Doubtless the affairs of the
day were being discussed, quarrels were being satisfactorily
adjusted, courtships were in progress, hasty meals and fussy
toilets were being attended to. Doubtless in such a vast
colony as had settled in the long hay slough, which looked like
a broad, sluggish river, the affairs of life were as important
as they are among the human denizens of a city. The clatter
and hubbub went on, and left the rest of the world indifferent,
as such clatter generally does.



Old Sam Bernard and his pupil, Frank Burton, were among
the waiting guns. The light was not yet sufficient, and the
geese had not yet begun to rise. They were both armed with
ten-bore, double-choke guns, the only weapons calculated to
penetrate the heavy feathers of such magnificent game. Both
were lying full-length upon the sodden highlands which lined
the slough, thrilling with the inspiring tension of keen sportsmen.
Their half-bred spaniels crouched between them, their
silky bodies quivering with joyous excitement, but their well-trained
minds permitting no other demonstration. It was a
moment worth living for, both for men and dogs.



At last there came a heavy whirring sound down at the
water. In a moment a great gray bird sailed up, winging in
a wide circle toward Frank's deadly gun. It was the signal
waited for. The dogs beat a tattoo with their feathered front
feet. A thrill shot down the two men's spines. Both raised
their guns, but it was the sharp crack of the younger man's
which sent the bird somersaulting to the ground.



Now the whole length of the slough became alive with
whirring wings and snapping guns. The panic of the birds
was complete. The air was full of cumbersome speeding
creatures, winging their way across the danger zone in their
unhappy quest of safety. Everywhere they paid the heavy
toll demanded of them; and in less than half an hour five hundred
brace and more had fallen to the forty-odd guns waiting
for them.



But the shoot did not finish there. That was the first rush.
That was the pot hunting. The real sport of the morning
came with the scattering and high flying of the terrified
birds, shooting which required the greatest keenness and skill.
Here the older hand had all the best of it, for coolness and
judgment alone could fill the bag. The shoot went on well
into the morning, and not until the birds became so wild that
they utterly refused to come within range did the counting
of the bag begin.



By ten o'clock Sam Bernard and his pupil were returning
home to the old man's farm in a buckboard laden down with
nearly a hundred birds. It had been a great shoot, and
Frank's enthusiasm was almost feverish.



"It's the greatest game," he declared. "Forty-seven
brace! Say, Sam, shall we get any more of 'em to-morrow?"



Sam flicked the mare with the whip as he shook his gray
head.



"Guess not," he said, slowly rolling a chew of tobacco into
the other cheek. "They've smelled powder, an' I'd sure say it's
a bokay they ain't yearnin' to sniff again. They'll be miles
away by mornin'."



"Seems a pity," murmured the blue-eyed giant beside him.



The old man's eyes twinkled.



"Maybe so," he observed. "I used to feel like that. Guess
I don't now.



"You mean a second go wouldn't be so       fine."



The gray head nodded.



"Guess when I die I don't fancy no resurrectin' racket. I
can't say but what I've lived most every day of my life       but
ther's nothin' on this earth worth repeatin'       not even
shootin' up a flock o' foolhead geese."



Frank's eyes became pensive.



"P'raps you're right."



The farmer chirruped at his horse.



"It's jest a notion," he said indifferently. Then he pointed
out ahead with his whip. His wife was standing waiting for
them at the door of the farm house.



"There's the gentlest soul living," he observed, with a
smile. "Guess she couldn't wring a chicken's neck to save
her life. But she'll sure handle these birds, an' reckon 'em
up, with as much delight as a cannibal nigger smacks his lips
over a steak off his pa's quarters."



This man who was teaching him the business of farming
was always a source of amusement to young Frank, and he
laughed cordially at the absurdity of his comparison. Nor
could he help watching the old farm-wife as they drove up.
True enough the sight of the well-filled carry-all gladdened
her eyes.



"Guess I don't need to ask no fool questions about your
sport," she cried. "Say, ain't they great? Look at 'em, all
bustin' with fat. They'll make real elegant eatin'. They
surely will. How many? Forty-seven brace? Why don't
you say it right? Ninety-four birds. The pore harmless
birdies. I'd surely say you're the two worstest villains on two
legs. But they'll make elegant eatin'. They will that."



The two men exchanged smiling glances as they unloaded
the buckboard. Then, as the choreman took it away to the
barn, Mrs. Bernard remembered what was, perhaps, the most
interesting thing in the life of the Canadian farmer. A
neighbor had brought out their mail from Gleber that morning.
She dived into a capacious pocket in her ample print
skirt, and her russet face smiled up into Frank's blue eyes.



"My, but them birds has surely set me daft an' forgettin',"
she cried. "Here's your mail, boy Frank," she added, pulling
out a bulky envelope. "Jest one letter. An' it's a female
writin' on it. Always a female writin'. You surely are some
with the gals."



Frank took his letter with a smile at the old woman's genial
chaff. As he was about to pass into the house to change his
wet clothes Sam called out       



"You don't need to hurry. Jest read your mail, an' when
you're through changin', guess we'll get right on down to the
forty-acre patch. We'll need to finish seedin' there this
week. Say              "



"Yes." Frank paused in the doorway.



The old man grinned as he glanced in the direction of the
cold storehouse, whither his wife had gone with some of the
birds.



"It don't make no difference to a woman," he said. "Don't
matter if it was your Gran'ma instead of your Ma that was
writin' you, she'd guess it was a sparkin' letter from some gal.
Women is queer most ways."



"Sure, Sam," Frank replied soberly. "Guess that's why
we like 'em."



"Like 'em? Well, I'd smile."



Up in the attic, in the pitch of the roof, which served
Frank as a bedroom, he sat down on the side of his bed to
read his letter. The little place was homely and clean, but
there were no comforts. There was not even a chair. Just
the bare necessities, and they were ample for a youth as plain
and cleanly living as its present occupant.



For some moments the letter remained unopened in
Frank's hand, and it was, perhaps, the first time in his life
that he had reluctantly contemplated his mother's handwriting.
He certainly was reluctant now. It was not that
he was not at all times delighted to receive word from her,
but he knew, and was apprehensive of the contents of this
bulky package. It was the first letter he had received from
Monica since her marriage to Hendrie, which he knew had
taken place nearly a month previously.



How many times had he tried to convince himself of his
pleasure in his mother's contemplated happiness? How many
times had he argued and debated with himself, pointing out
the naturalness, the desirability of it from a worldly point
of view? How much his mother deserved the happiness he
knew was now hers. He looked at the whole thing without
thought of self; he looked at it with all the generosity of
a goodly nature; he looked at it with eyes just beginning to
open upon the life moving about him; and though he reassured
himself again and again, he knew that he regretted
her action, and regretted it more than all for her own sake.
It oppressed him with a sense of coming disaster which he
could not shake off.



He had not had an easy time since his flying visit to
Winnipeg. Far from it. His devotion to his mother had
fought and conquered the natural resentment and bitterness
her story of his birth had inspired. But the effect of that
battle remained. He knew that he was not as other men,
he knew that he was not entitled to the same privileges as
they. In a measure he was an outcast among his kind,
and the finger of pitying scorn must always be leveled at
him wherever the truth of his parentage became known.



It was a painful blight under which to set out to face the
world, and he felt like the leper of old, driven by the rest
of a wholesome world to hide in the dim recesses of a wilderness,
whither the eyes of man might not see him, and contact
with his fellows became impossible.



These were his feelings, but he had no thought of putting
such ideas into practice. Nor had he any intention of allowing
them to embitter him. He was young, his life, and a
great capacity for its enjoyment, lay all before him. He
would forget. He would make himself forget. He would
live like all those others he saw about him. He would work,
play; he would love. For in spite of the accident of his
birth all these things were part of the life given him.



At last he tore open the envelope, and, in a moment,
became absorbed in its contents. Here were the same warm
words of affection he was accustomed to. The same ardent
desire for his welfare; and, through it all, and through
the sober accounts of her marriage, and the progress of her
new life, which was all she could desire, ran that thrilling
note of joy which told him of the completeness of her happiness.



And yet he was not satisfied.



The shadow was there lurking about him. It was in the
corners of his sunny room, it floated about his head like an
invisible pall, the presence of which depressed him. Nor
could he rid himself of its oppressive weight.



The last page of his letter he read twice over, and, at the
second reading, he knew the source whence the shadow had
sprung. The danger for his mother lay in him. In his simple
existence. He knew it. Not only did he know that her
danger lay in him, but he knew that some sort of disaster
would come through him. He rose and paced the floor, and
as he paced he swore to himself that he would destroy his
life rather than she should ever suffer through him.



After a while, his feelings became relieved, and he turned
again to that ominous last page, so full of kindly thought
for him.





"I believe I am on the track of the very farm for you. It
is a fine place, my agent tells me, dear boy. It consists of a
whole section of land, with more to be acquired adjoining.
Furthermore, it has three hundred and twenty acres already
fenced, and some excellent buildings. It also has a water
front of half a mile on Fish Creek with plenty of excellent
timber. This is going for $7000. The agent assures me it
is a gift at the price. It was built by two rich English boys
who got tired of it, and went back home. Now, I shall be
at Deep Willows, our great farm, on May 15 by myself.
Alexander has to be in Chicago then. He wanted me to
go with him, but I persuaded him to let me go to Deep
Willows by myself that I might enjoy exploring its magnificence.
This, of course, was just an excuse so that I
could meet you there and discuss the farm, and see about
these things. You must run over as soon after that date as
possible. It's less than thirty miles from Gleber, so you can
easily manage it."





There was more of it, much more, but Frank did not read
further. He looked up with troubled eyes. Here, here was
the threat overshadowing them both. He saw it in the
subterfuge by which his mother was seeking to meet him.
He saw it in the fearless manner in which she deliberately
refused to shut him out of her life. Why not send him the
money, and let him conduct his own affairs independently
of her? It would, at least, be safe. And, in the midst of
all his trouble, absurdly enough, he remembered Sam Bernard's
remark: "Women is queer most ways."



He smiled in spite of himself, but his smile did not for a
moment ease his anxiety for his mother.



Suddenly he heard the familiar voice of Sam calling up
the narrow stairs to him       



"Ho, Frank! You ready?"



Frank thrust the letter in his pocket, and, regardless of
the fact he had not yet changed his clothes, hastily called
back       



"Coming right along!"



Downstairs the old man's twinkling eyes greeted him.



"Guess your mail took a heap o' readin'       you ain't
changed."



Frank smiled back at him.



"No," he said abstractedly, for he was thinking of other
things.



"Jest so," retorted the old man promptly. Then, with a
shrug: "Anyway, love letters are warm enough to dry
most things. Say              "



"It was from my mother."



"Ah."



"And I want to ask you if you'll give me the afternoon
off. I'd like to go across to the Raysun's."



The old man eyed him shrewdly.



"I didn't reckon to, lad," he said, after a moment's
thought. "You see the seedin' needs to get on. But I
guess you best go. Letters from your Ma generly need
talkin' over with your best gal       'fore you're married."



The old man's quiet geniality was quite irresistible, and
Frank thanked him warmly. The more surely because he
had come very near to guessing the purpose he had in
making this visit. But his purpose was rather in consequence
of, than to discuss his mother's letter. It was a
purpose he had impulsively decided upon for no better
reason than that all subterfuge was utterly repulsive to
him, and he felt that before it was too late Phyllis must be
told the painful truth about himself.



In some measure his sudden decision comforted him, as
he thought of the secret fashion in which it was demanded
of him that he should visit his mother. At least there
should be no such lack of openness between himself and the
girl he hoped some day to make his wife.






CHAPTER VI



LIFE THROUGH OTHER EYES



Phyllis Raysun was quite a remarkable girl when her
parentage and simple, yet strenuous, upbringing were considered.
Her beauty was quite decided, and was admitted
even by those female souls who were really fond of her.
She was dark, with large, dark eyes, deeply fringed with
black lashes, almost Celtic in their depth and sleepy fire.
And with it all she wore an expression of keenness and
decision at all times. She was tall, of a height which always
goes so well with a purposeful face such as hers; and the
delightful contours of her figure were all the more gracefully
natural for the absence of corsets. But wherein lay
the unusual side of her personality was the unconventional
views of life she already possessed at the age of eighteen
years. The breadth of them was often quite disconcerting
in one so young, and frequently it made her the despair of
her plump and doting, and very ordinarily helpless mother.



Perhaps her mother's helplessness may have accounted in
some measure for Phyllis's unusual mental development. It
may have had a pronounced influence upon her, for they
two were quite alone. Years ago, when she was an infant,
her father had died, leaving her mother in sorely straitened
circumstances.



From her earliest years Phyllis had had to think for
herself, and help in the struggle against poverty. Then,
as she grew older, she realized that they possessed a wholly
neglected property which should yield them a living. So
she set to work on the farm, and, little by little, she wrested
from the soil that profit, which, as the years went on, gradually
lifted them both from the depths of penury to a
frugal comfort. Now the farm was nearing prosperity, and,
with the aid of a hired man, Phyllis worked it with all the
skill of an expert and widely experienced farmer.



Her mother was simply a chorewoman; a capable enough
woman in this lowly capacity. She could never hope to rise
above it. Nor was Phyllis ever disturbed by the knowledge.
She valued the usefulness of her mother's work too well,
and, besides, she loved the helpless old body, and delighted
in the care of her as though she were some small child of
her own.



Phyllis had spent her morning out seeding, as every other
farmer in the district was doing, while her hired man was
busy with plough and team breaking the last year's fallows.
The work was arduous and monotonous, but the girl felt
neither of these things. She loved her little homestead with
its hundred and sixty acres, and she asked nothing better
than to tend it, and watch, and reap the results. She was
robust in mind and body, and none of the claims of this
agricultural life came amiss to her.



But during the past six months a new interest had come
into her life in the shape of a blue-eyed male giant of her
own age; and from the moment she first set eyes upon him
an added glow lit the heavens of her consciousness. She
did not recognize its meaning at first. Only she realized that
somehow the winter days were less dark and irksome, and an
added zest became apparent in the everlasting looking forward.



But by degrees he became an intimate in her life, and,
finally, almost part of it. It was a wonderful time for
Phyllis. Through it all he was always associated with the
first apparition she had had of him. In her dreaming mind,
as she went about her work, she always saw him as she had
seen him then, sitting on the back of a beautiful East-bred,
golden chestnut horse, disconsolately viewing the distance
with questioning blue eyes, seeking a direction he had absolutely
lost.



That was her first meeting with Frank Burton, and somehow
she had been glad, from the first moment she set eyes
on him, that hers had been the opportunity of relieving him
from the dilemma in which he had found himself.



Since then their friendship had ripened quickly. The
pulses of youth had been quickly stirred, and almost before
Phyllis was aware of it that glorious early spring day had
dawned when the great golden sun of love had burst upon
her horizon, and turned a chill, snow-clad world into a perfect
poet's dream of delight.



Without a second thought she engaged herself to the
boy, and the boy engaged himself to her. They loved, so
what mattered anything else in the world? Their blood
ran hot in healthy veins, and the whole wide world lay before
them.



Phyllis was returning at midday with the old mare that
hauled her seeder. As she came she was reckoning up the
time which the rest of the seeding would take. This year
an added twenty-five acres was to be put under crop, and
time in spring was always the farmer's nightmare. She had
completed her figures by the time she drew near the house,
when, looking up, with satisfied eyes, she beheld the figure of
the man, whose presence never failed to raise a smile of
delight in her eyes, standing at the door talking to her
mother.



"Ho, Frank!" she cried out joyously.



The man turned at once and answered her greeting, but
the smile on his handsome face had little of the girl's unqualified
joy in it. Her sensitive feelings quickly detected
the lack, and she understood that there was something amiss.
Frank came swiftly across to her, and relieved her of the
mare, which he led to the barn while Phyllis walked at his
side.



"I just felt I had to come over, Phyl," he said impulsively.
"I couldn't pass another night until I had seen you and told
you all. I'm       I'm utterly miserable. I              "



They had reached the barn and Phyllis halted.



"You put the mare in, and feed her hay," she interrupted
him quickly. "Dan will feed her oats and water her when
he comes in."



Her manner was studiously matter of fact. She had
realized at once that Frank's condition must not be encouraged.
So she remained outside the barn, and waited
for him.



The boy found her sitting on the tongue of the wagon
which stood close by, and the misery in his eyes deepened as
he surveyed the charming, pensive face he loved so dearly.



"Come and sit here, Frank. Then you can tell me about
it."



Phyllis looked up at him in that tender, mothering way
she had learned in her years of care for her only parent.



The man obeyed, and, for the first time since he had left
Sam Bernard's farm that morning, a genuine smile of something
like contentment lit his hitherto somber face.



"Phyl," he cried suddenly, "you       you make me feel better
already. You       oh, it's wonderful the influence you exercise
over me. I              "



He broke off, and, seizing her two hands, bent over and
kissed her on the lips.



"That's better," the girl exclaimed happily, when he had
released her. "When two people really love each other they
can generally manage to set the worst of any shadows scooting
off to the dark places they belong."



The man smiled in spite of himself.



"But       but it's serious. It really is. It's simply awful."



The girl's eyes were just a shade anxious, but her manner
was lightly tender.



"Of course it is. It surely is. Say, Frank, everything's
awful that makes us unhappy. And I guess something's
made you real unhappy. Now, just get very busy and tell
me all about it."



The man sat with his great body drooping forward, and
his hands clasped, and hanging between his parted knees.



"Unhappy? It's       it's worse than that. I       I came over
here to tell you that       that you can have your promise back       if
you want it."



It was out. He had blurted it clumsily he knew, but it
was out. And now he sat fearing to look up into the truthful
eyes he loved so dearly.



Phyllis drew a sharp breath. She looked straight ahead
of her for one brief moment while her sunny cheeks paled.
Then the soft color came back to them, and, presently, a
very tender, very wise pair of eyes studied his dejected
profile.



"And if I don't want it       back?" she said gently.



Frank raised his miserable eyes and looked straight into
hers.



"But you will when you know all," he cried, almost passionately.
"I know it. I feel it. I know that a good, honest
girl like you could not bear disgrace. No disgrace has ever
touched you, and, through me, no disgrace ever shall. When
I asked for your promise I did not know all I know now.
If I had I would rather have cut off my right hand than
attempt to win your love. And now       now I know that I
had no right to it. I have no right to any good woman's
love. I       I have no right to anything. Not even to my
name."



"Frank!"



Another sharp intake of breath came with the girl's exclamation.



"Yes, I mean it," the boy went on, with passionate misery.
"I have known it for six weeks, and I should have told you
before, but       but I hadn't the courage, the honesty. I       I
have no legitimate father. I       I am a bastard."



He made his final statement with his eyes upon the ground.
To see this great, honest boy bowed with such a sincerity
of misery was too much for Phyllis.



"You didn't win my love, Frank," she said, with eyes
that were tenderly smiling. "I gave it to you       quite unasked.
I gave it to you such a long       long time ago. I
think I must sure have given it you before ever I saw you.
And       and as for my promise, I guess that was given most
at the same time       only I just didn't know 'bout it. I don't
think I could take my promise back if I felt that way. But
I don't       not if you'd like to keep it."



"Phyl, Phyl!" The boy's eyes were shining, but his sense
of right made him protest. "You don't know what you're
doing. You surely don't. Think of it. I       I have no real
name. Think what folks'll say when they know. Think
of the disgrace for you. Think of your girl friends. Phyllis
Raysun marrying a       bastard. Oh, it's awful."



"You do love me, Frank, don't you?"



The girl's question came so simply that Frank turned in
astonishment. The next moment she was in his arms, and
the joy of his hot kisses pervaded her whole body.



"Love you? Love you?" he cried. "You're all the world
to me."



Presently she released herself from his embrace and smiled
up into his face.



"Then what in the world else matters to       us?" she demanded
frankly.



Then she went on, looking straight before her at the
tumbled-down sod house which had been her home ever since
her birth.



"Listen," she said. "You are illegitimate. I won't have
that other word. It's brutal, and it's not right anyway.
Do you ever think of our poor little lives? I do       often.
Guess I've thought so much I wonder folks make all the
to-do they do about lots of things that can't possibly matter.
What is life? Why, it's a great big machine sort of
thing that none of us, the wisest, don't know a thing about.
Why is it? Where does it come from? What is it? Is
it? No, not the wisest man in all the world can answer one
of those questions right. He can't. He can't. And yet
everybody gets busy making crazy little regulations for
running it. Do you see? We're built and developed by this
wonderful, wonderful machine thing, and then we turn right
around and tell anybody, even, yes, the wonderful machine
thing that made us itself, how we should live the life which
has already been arranged for.



"Frank dear," she hurried on eagerly, "it's almost funny,
only it's all so plumb crazy. Do you ever go to Meeting? I
mean church?"



"I'm afraid I don't," Frank admitted ruefully.



"I do," cried the girl. "Oh yes, I do." Then she laughed.
"It's more funny than you'd expect, if       if you only think
about it. I always think a lot when I go. It makes me
think, but not in the way the parson would have me. I
always start thinking about him. It seems so queer, him
standing up there talking Bible stuff, and telling you what
it means, just, for all the world, as if he'd wrote it, and
knew all about it; just as if he was a personal friend of that
great machine thing that keeps this world buzzing around
and sets us feeling, and doing, and happy, and miserable.
Then he gets paid like any hired man for talking to us all,
just as if we were silly folk who couldn't think just as well
as him. But he don't really think far. He just tells you
what he's told to tell you by those who pay him his wages,
and if he told you anything else he'd lose his job, and maybe
have to plow for a living, and then be told by some other
feller every seventh day he was a fool and a sinner.



"Then you go to another church       or meeting house. It
used to make me real bad one time. But it doesn't now,
because I'm getting to understand better. Well, at the
other place they tell you all different. And while you're
listening it makes you think the other feller's a fool, and       and
ought to be making hay, or maybe eating it. Then
you get mazed up with so much contradiction about Life,
and God, and all the other things, so you find another
church. Then that feller gets up and tells you that none
of the others have got it right       no one else in the world but
him, as the representative of his particular religion. And
he asks you to help him send out missionaries, and things,
to tell everybody that don't think the same as him they're
fools and worse, and       and       they're all going plumb to hell       wherever
that is.



"Now what does it all come to, Frank?" she cried, with
eyes glowing and cheeks flushed with enthusiasm. "Why,
just this. We're born into this world, which is a wonderful,
wonderful place, through none of our doing. A big God,
somewhere, gives us our life, and implants in us a wonderful
sense of right and wrong, and we've just got to use it the
best we know. We don't know anything beyond the limits
of understanding He's given us, and He doesn't intend us
to know more. He just seems to say, 'Go right along and
work out your own salvation; and when you've done, I'll
come along and see how you've been doing, and, maybe, I'll
fix it so your failures won't happen in the newer lives I set
going.' That's how it seems to me. So you don't need to
listen more than you want to what other folks, no wiser than
yourself, tell you of what's right and what's wrong. You
don't; because they don't know any better than you       and
that's a fact. So when you come and tell me you're disgraced,
just because your pa and momma weren't preached
at by a feller all dressed in white, and they didn't have bells
ringing, and she didn't have a trousseau, and the folks didn't
get around and make speeches, and pile a shower of paper
stuff down their backs, I say you're not. None of it matters.
Nothing in the whole wide world matters       so long as we
don't let go our hold on that sense of right and wrong which
the good God gave us. That's all that really does matter
to us. It's no concern of ours what folks who came before
us did, or the doings of folks who're coming after. We've
got to do our work. We've got to love and live till it pleases
our great big God to tell us to stop. And I'm most sure if
we do that, and hold tight to our sense of right and wrong,
and act as it prompts us, we're just doing His Will       as He
wants us to do it."



Frank sat staring in wide astonishment at the girl's flushed
face and bright, enthusiastic eyes. But the effect of her
words, her understanding of things, upon him was none the
less. He felt the great underlying truth in all she said, and
it brought him a measure of comfort which his own lack of
real thought had left him without.



"Phyl!" he almost gasped.



The girl broke into happy laughter.



"Say, Frank," she cried, "don't tell me I'll       I'll go to
hell for it all. I       I couldn't stand that       from you."



The boy shook his head. He, too, joined in the laugh.
He felt he wanted to laugh. It was as though she had suddenly
relieved him of an intolerable burden.



"I wouldn't tell you that, Phyl," he said, with heavy earnestness.
"You'll go somewhere, but it won't be       to hell."



"And       and you don't want me to take my promise back?"
she asked him, her gray eyes sobering at once.



"No, dear, I just love you more than ever." He sighed
in great contentment. "And we'll get married as soon       as
soon as mother buys me the farm she's going to. She's
written me about it to-day."



"Ah, yes, that farm." Phyllis rested her chin upon her
hand, and gazed out at the old house abstractedly.



"It's to be a swell place," the boy went on.



"I'm so glad, Frank," she replied absently. Then she
recalled her dreaming faculties. "And       your momma's giving
it to you? She must be very rich."



Frank flushed and turned his eyes away.



"She has a good deal of money," he said awkwardly.



The girl seemed to understand. She questioned him no
further.



"She must be a good and kind woman," she said gently.
"I hope some day I may get       to know her."



"I              "



Frank broke off. The promise he was rashly about to
make remained unspoken. He knew he could not promise
anything in his mother's name       now.






CHAPTER VII



HAPPY DAYS



Angus Moraine was a dour, hard-headed business man
such as Alexander Hendrie liked to have about him. He
was also an agriculturalist from his finger-tips to his back-bone,
and the millionaire's great farm at Deep Willows
owed most of its prosperity to this hard, raw-boned descendant
from the Crofters of Scotland.



When he heard of his friend and employer's forthcoming
marriage he shook his head, and his lean face took on an
expression of added sourness. He saw visions of his own
sphere of administration at Deep Willows becoming narrowed.
He felt that the confidence of his employer was
likely to be diverted into another channel. This meant more
than a mere outrage to his pride. He knew it might affect
his private pocket in an adverse degree. Therefore the news
was all the more unwelcome.



Pondering on these matters while on a round of inspection
of the far-reaching wheat-lands which he controlled, he abruptly
drew up his sturdy broncho in full view of a great
gray owl perched on the top of a barbed wire fence-post.
He sat there surveying the creature for some moments, and
finally apostrophized it, feeling that so uncanny and secretive
a fowl was an admirable and safe recipient for his confidences.



"It's no sort of use, my gray and ugly friend," he said,
in his wry way. "Folks call Master Alexander the Napoleon
of the wheat world, and I'm not saying he isn't. But
Napoleons generally make a mess of things when they marry.
Their business is fighting, or       they wouldn't be Napoleons."



Quite apart from his own interests he felt that Hendrie
was making a grave mistake, and, later on, when he learned
that he had married his secretary, his conviction became
permanent. This time his disapproval was directed at the
map of Alberta, which hung upon his office wall. He shook
his bony forefinger with its torn and dirty nail at the silent
witness, his narrow eyes snapping with angry scorn.



"Female secretaries are pernicious," he cried angrily.
"They're worse'n a colony of gophers in a wheat patch.
You want a temperature of forty below to keep your office
cool with a woman working in it. Hendrie always hated
the cold."



But his apprehensions did not end there. Later he learned
that Deep Willows was to be Monica's future home, and
the place was to be immediately prepared for her reception.



This time the telephone over which he had received his
instructions got the full benefit of his displeasure.



It was cold and calm, and thoroughly biting.



"I'll need to chase a new job, or the old one'll chase me,"
he muttered, and the thermometer of his feelings for women,
as a race, dropped far below the zero at which it had hitherto
stood.



But there was far too much of the old Crofter's blood in
Angus's veins to let him relinquish the gold mine which
Hendrie's affairs were to him. However he disliked the new
conditions of things he kept his feelings to himself, or only
permitted their expression before silent witnesses. With
all the caution of his forefathers he awaited developments,
and refrained from any precipitate action; and, later on,
he was more than glad he had exercised such restraint.



The necessary preparations were duly put in hand, and
Angus supervised everything himself. Every detail was carried
out with that exactness for which Hendrie's manager
was noted. He spared no pains, and that was his way. His
native shrewdness had long ago taught him how best he
could serve his employer's interests, and, consequently, his
own. Implicit obedience to the millionaire left him with
enormous pickings, and the building up of Hendrie's miniature
world of wheat had left him comparatively a rich man,
with small agricultural interests scattered all over the north-west.
He was not the man to turn and rend the golden calf
he worshiped, nor to attempt to cook his own tame golden
goose in the fire of his displeasure. Besides, deep down in
his rugged heart, he was utterly devoted to his employer.
So he gave Monica and her husband a royal welcome to
Deep Willows.



After all Monica was not permitted to explore Deep Willows
by herself. Hendrie contrived to get his business in
Chicago temporarily adjusted, and, as a surprise, explained
at the last moment to his bride that he could not bring himself
to permit her going to Deep Willows for the first time
without him.



The news at once pleased and terrified Monica. Her
thoughts flew to Frank, and her appointment with him, and
it became necessary at once to despatch a "rushed" wire to
put him off. When this had been done she felt more at ease,
and abandoned herself to her pleasure in the thought that,
after all, her husband was to accompany her to the home
which she had decided should be theirs.



But it left her with a fuller understanding of the difficulties
and dangers with which she was beset. She realized
that an added caution was needed. That it would be so easy
to make a slip, and so run the risk of wrecking her newly
found happiness.



Yes, there was no denying it, she was utterly happy during
those first weeks of her married life, and frequently she
found herself wondering how she had had the courage to
face the long years of her spinsterhood.



It had been worth waiting for. She had married the man
of her choice, the one man in all the world who appealed to
her as the very essence of all that was great, and strong,
and lovable in manhood. Here was no weakling to appeal
to her sense of motherhood, but a powerful, commanding,
yes, even ruthless personality, upon which she could lean in
times when her woman's heart needed such strong support.



Then, too, she saw a side of his character which the world
was never likely to see, and her pride and delight in the
privilege were wholly womanly. To her he was the lover,
tender, passionate, strong. And his jealous regard for her
was an added delight to her woman's vanity and love.



The thought of his power in the world, his Napoleonic
methods of openly seeking his adversary in the world of
finance and crushing him to his will only made the intimacy
of their lives all the sweeter to her. She was ambitious,
ambitious for him, ambitious to stand at his side on every
plane to which he soared.



Then came her arrival at Deep Willows; and at once she
learned to her delight the chief reason of her husband's
accompanying her.






Then Came Her Arrival at Deep Willows




She had expected a fine farm, built as farms were built
in this new country. She had expected a great place, where
comfort was sacrificed to the work in hand. She had expected
the rush and busy life of a great commercial undertaking,
wonderful organization, wonderful machinery, wonderful,
crude buildings for the surer storing of crops. But,
though she found all the wonders of machinery, all the busy
life she had expected, all the buildings, she found something
more, something she had not been led to expect in a man of
Hendrie's plain tastes.



A miniature palace was awaiting her. A palace standing
in its own wide grounds of park-like trees and delicious,
shaded gardens. She found a home in which a king might
have dwelt, one that had been designed by one of the most
famous architects of the day.



It was set on the banks of a river, high up on a rising
ground, whence, from its windows, a wide view of the almost
illimitable wheat-fields spread out before the eyes, and, directly
below, lay the roaring falls where the water of the
river dropped churning into a wide gorge. Truly the setting
of this home was as nearly perfect as a prodigal nature
could make it.



The land in its immediate vicinity had no regularity; it
was a tumbled profusion of natural splendor, perfectly
trained in its own delightful disorder. The farm buildings
were nowhere visible from the house or grounds. They were
hidden behind a great stretch of woodland bluff so that
nothing should spoil the view from the house. All that was
visible was the wheat, stretching away in every direction
over the undulating plains as far as the eye could see, centering
about this perfect heart, and radiating to a distance
of something like five miles.



Such was the home which Monica's love for Hendrie had
brought her; and the man's joy in offering it for her acceptance
was a thing to remember all her life.



There was that light of perfect happiness in his gray eyes
as he stood in what he called the office, but which was, in
reality, a library furnished with every luxury unlimited
wealth could command. He held out a long blue envelope
on which her name was inscribed.



"Now, Mon," he said, in a sober way which his eyes belied,
"I guess you've seen most all, and       and I've been real happy
showing it you. Make me happier still by taking this.
When you've read the contents, just have it locked away in
your safe deposit. It's       it's a present for a good girl."



Monica drew out the papers and gasped out her delight
when she discovered that they were a deed of gift to her of
Deep Willows. The house, furniture, and the grounds as
separate from the farm.



"It's       it's too much, Alec!" she cried. "Oh, I can scarcely
believe it       scarcely believe it."



The man's face was a study in perfect happiness as he
feasted his eyes upon her beautiful flushed face. The power
to give in this princely fashion touched him more nearly
than perhaps any other feeling, next to his love for her.



But his commercial instinct made him laugh.



"You'll believe it, dear," he said dryly, "if ever you get
busy paying for its up-keep out of your marriage settlement."



That night Monica realized that the culminating day of
her love and ambitions had drawn to a close. Such a day
could never come again, such moments could never be experienced
twice in a lifetime. Her good fortune had come
at last, come in abundance. She was the wife of one of the
country's richest and most successful men. His love for her,
and her love for him was perfect, utterly complete. She
owned a home whose magnificence any prince might envy.
What more could she hope, or wish for? All that the world
seemed to have to offer was hers. It was all too wonderful       too
wonderful.



Then, strangely enough, in the midst of her content, her
thoughts mechanically drifted to other scenes, other days.
They floated back to the now dim and distant struggles that
lay behind her, and at once centered round a blue-eyed, fair-haired
boy whom she had mothered and watched grow to
manhood.



She slept badly that night. Her sleep was broken, fitful;
and every time she slept it was to dream of Frank, and
every dream was of trouble, trouble that always involved
him.



A week later the call of business took Hendrie away. Such
were his interests that he could never hope to remain for
long in any one place. He went away after a brief, characteristic
interview with Angus Moraine.



It occurred in the library.



"Angus," he said, "I want you to get a grip on this.
Henceforth my wife represents me in all matters to do with
this place. She's a business woman. So I leave her to your
care. But remember, she's       me."



At that moment Angus Moraine's cup of bitterness was
filled to overflowing. He had seen it coming from the outset,
and he cursed softly under his breath as the millionaire
took his departure.



With Hendrie's going, Monica's thoughts were once more
free to think of that other interest in her life. Nor was she
the woman to abandon any course she had once embarked
upon. If it had been Hendrie's pleasure to give to her, it
was no less her pleasure to complete the equipment of Frank,
which had been her life's endeavor. Now, with all the means
ready to hand, she decided to act at once. So, to this end,
she wrote him full and careful instructions.





Some days later a stranger registered at the Russell
Hotel, in Everton, which was a small hamlet situated on
the eastern boundary of Hendrie's farm. He was tall and
young, blue-eyed and fair-haired, and he registered in the
name of Frank Smith.



On the same day Angus Moraine received word from
Monica's order, "small hell" reigned among his foremen
the day. She said she intended to explore the country
round about; she wanted to see something of its people.



With the coming of this order Angus understood that he
was no longer master at Deep Willows, and his resentment
was silent but deadly. He had foreseen the position. He
had foreseen this ousting, he told himself, and now it had
come. At no time was he an easy man, but he was reasonably
fair and just to those who worked under him. It was
only in moments when things went wrong with him that the
harsh, underlying cruelty of his nature was displayed. Things
had gone wrong with him now, and, on the day he received
Monica's order, "small hell" reigned amongst his foremen
and overseers. Just now he was going through an unhappy
time, and he was determined that something of it should be
passed on to those within his reach.



After a long day of arduous work he finally threw off the
yoke of his labors, and prepared for his usual evening
recreation. He had a fresh horse saddled, and rode off
down the river towards Everton.



Here it was his nightly custom to foregather, and, in his
choice, he proved something of his Scottish ancestry. He
rarely missed his evening whisky in the office of the little
hotel. It was his custom to sit there for two hours or so,
reading papers and sipping his drink, listening to, but rarely
taking part in, the gossip of the villagers assembled. The
latter was partly from the natural unsociability of his disposition,
and partly from pride of position. Here he was
looked upon as a little king, and he was as vain as he was
churlish.



He drew near his destination. In the dusk the few odd
lights of Everton shone out through the bluff of trees, in
the midst of which the village was set. The man's habit
was very strong. He always rode at a rapid gallop the
whole of the six miles to the village, and he always drew his
horse down to a walk at this point, where the private track
from the farm converged with the main trail. The main
trail was an old trading route of the Indian days which cut
its way through the heart of Hendrie's land. It followed
the south bank of the river and crossed the water at this
point. It was for the purpose of avoiding this ford that
the private road had been brought into existence.



Likewise, at this point, Angus always filled and lighted
his pipe, a rank-smelling briar, well burnt down on one
side. There was always reason for what he did. He rode
hard to give himself ample time for his evening's recreation.
He walked his horse at this point to cool him off. He lighted
his evening pipe here because he was beyond the range of
the fields of wheat, and though there was no fear of fire at
this season of the year, he preferred the habit to the risk
of inadvertently setting fire to the crops when they were
ripened.



He pulled up his horse and struck a match, and, instantly,
in the stillness of the evening, became aware of approaching
wheels. He heard horses take the water at the ford; and
so unusual was the phenomenon at this hour of the evening
that he looked down the converging trail to see who was
driving into the village.



He heard voices, and so still was the evening that their
tones came to him distinctly. Two people were evidently
in the vehicle; a man and a woman.



The horses had ceased to splash. He heard them coming
up the slope, and, almost unconsciously, he drew back into
the shadow of the trees. This left him with his view of the
other trail shut off, but, ahead, he could see the convergence,
and when the vehicle passed that point it would be in full
view.



He waited. The horses were abreast of him, beyond the
trees. Suddenly the sound of their hoofs died out. They
had come to a standstill, and he heard voices again.



"Oh, Mon, it's been a glorious day. You are good to me.
Was there ever such a woman in the world?"



It was a man's voice speaking. Angus had caught the
name "Mon," and his ears strained doubly hard to
hear all that passed between them. Now the woman was
speaking. He heard her laugh, a laugh he perfectly well
knew.



"Don't talk like that, you silly Frank," she cried. "But
it has been a day, hasn't it? We've had it all to ourselves,
without one single cloud to mar it. You'll be all right now.
You can get back to the hotel and no one will be the wiser
for our meeting. I'll write you when it is safe to come over
again. It must be soon. I want you with me so much, and
it is perfectly safe when Alec is away. Good night, dear
boy."



Angus heard a sound and recognized it. She had kissed
the man.



The blood mounted to his head. Then it receded, leaving
him cold. He sat quite still.



A moment later he heard the man walking toward the
junction of the roads. Then he heard the scuffle of horses'
hoofs as the vehicle was turned about. And again he heard
the animals take the water.



Still he sat on.



Presently he beheld a tall, burly figure in tweeds emerge
from the other trail. He was a powerfully built man, and,
even in that light, he could see the thick, fair hair under the
brim of the stranger's prairie hat.



"So that's your game, mam, is it?" he muttered. "I
guessed Hendrie had made a mess of things marrying his
secretary. I       wonder."



He waited until the man had gained considerable distance.
Then he lifted the reins, and permitted his impatient horse
to walk on towards the village.






CHAPTER VIII



ANGUS HEARS SOME TALK



Angus Moraine's whole attitude toward Monica underwent
a sudden change. That his feelings changed is doubtful.
His feelings rarely changed about anything. However,
where before an evident, but tacit antagonism underlaid all
his service of the new mistress of Deep Willows, now he only
too readily acquiesced to her lightest wish, and even went
far out of his way to obtain her confidence, and inspire her
good feeling toward him.



The unsuspicious Monica more than appreciated his
efforts. He was her husband's trusted employee, he was a
big factor in her husband's affairs, and it seemed good that
she should be taken thus readily to the bosom of those who
served the man she loved.



Her days were hours of delight that were all too short.
Yet with each passing moment, she felt that she was safely
drawing nearer the completion of those plans which she had
long ago designed for Frank. She knew that when finally
settled, they would leave her without the tiniest shadow upon
her horizon.



The affairs of the farm she intended purchasing were well
in hand. She and Frank had inspected it together, and
both had approved. Now it was only for the lawyers, whom
Monica had been careful to let Frank employ to complete
the arrangements, and for the money she must provide to
be forthcoming.



In the meantime there was much to discuss, much to plan
for the future, and, with Hendrie away, Monica did not hesitate
to see Frank as often, perhaps more often than was
necessary. Her husband always kept her posted as to his
movements, and thus she was left perfectly safe and free
for the repetition of these clandestine visits.



Had she only known that Angus had recognized her and
witnessed her parting from Frank after inspecting the new
farm, her peace of mind would have known none of the ease
it now enjoyed. But she remained in ignorance of the fact,
and the astute Scot was determined to give her no cause for
suspicion. Thus had he adopted his fresh attitude, but for
what more subtle reason it would have been difficult to say.



The change in his manner extended in other directions.
It did not affect those who worked under him, but, to those
whom he met during his evening recreations, it came well-nigh
as a staggering surprise.



For some evenings no one commented upon it. Perhaps
his geniality was so extraordinary that men doubted their
senses, and wondered if it were not a delusion brought on
by their mild, nightly potions. But it continued with such
definite persistence that remark at last found expression.



The first mention of it came from Abe Hopkinson, who
dealt in dry-goods and canned "truck." He was sitting
with his feet thrust upon a table in the office of the Russell
Hotel early one evening. For some time he had been reflectively
chewing. Suddenly his face flushed with emotion.
He could stand the doubt no longer.



"Say," he cried, thumping one heavily shod foot upon the
well-worn blotter, and setting the inkstand rattling, "wot's
hit old leather-belly?"



His inelegant inquiry was addressed to the company generally.
Pete Farline, famed for his bad drugs and antiquated
"notion" department, breathed a deep sigh of relief.



"I'm glad you ast that, Abe," he said. "I've been troubled
some. Guessed I'd have to hit the water-wagon a piece."



Sid Ellerton looked up from the pages of a cheap magazine.



"Meaning the whisky souse from Scotland, via Deep Willows?"
he asked vaguely, and returned to his reading.



A fair-haired little man, by name Josh Taylor, who spent
his winter days dissecting frozen beef, and his summer evenings
in his butcher's store smashing flies on the sides of beef
with the flat of a knife, mildly reproved him.



"Guess you read too much fiction, Sid. It makes you
ask fool questions. Who else would Abe be talkin' of but
that haggis-faced moss-back from the Hebrides? Ain't he
made us all feel queer these days an' days? Say, he's gettin'
that soft I get around dead scared he'll get a fancy to kiss
me."



Abe grinned over at Josh's hard face, with its unshaven
chin, and his hair standing rigidly on his bullet head.



He shook his head.



"I'd say Angus is soft, but              "



A titter went round the room as Abe broke off. He had
just seen the reflection of Angus Moraine in the broken
mirror which adorned the opposite wall. He was standing
in the doorway. Abe sat wondering how much of their talk
the Scot had overheard when that individual's voice terminated
the moment's merriment.



"Feeling good, boys?" he inquired, in his new tone of
amiability.



Pete hastily jerked his feet on to the top of the cold stove,
assuming a nonchalant air.



"Feelin' good, Mr. Moraine?" he exclaimed. "Why, I'd
say. Say, this tarnation country's settling that rapid I had
a new customer to-day. Guess I'm figgerin' to start a drug
trust."



Angus smiled with the rest as he moved across to his
usual seat, a rigid armchair under the lamp bracket on the
wall. The table bell was within his reach, and he struck
it, and picked up an illustrated Sunday paper more than a
month old.



"Who was your customer?" he asked indifferently.



"Why, a guy that's been gettin' around a heap lately.
He stops in this house when he comes. Dresses in fancy
store clothes, and wears fair hair and blue eyes. Guess he's
maybe twenty or more. Calls himself Frank Smith. He
was buyin' fancy perfume for a lady."



Sid looked up.



"First got around soon after Mrs. Hendrie come to the
farm," he said, and lost himself promptly in the pages of his
magazine.



"I've seen him," Angus said quietly, without lifting his
eyes from the absorbing colored illustrations. "A flash-looking
feller."



"That's him," cried Pete quickly. "He ain't unlike Mr.
Hendrie, only bigger. Guess he's a deal better to look at,
too. Maybe he's a relation of the lady's."



"Maybe," muttered Angus indifferently. Then, as the
hotel proprietor, who was also bartender and anything else
required in the service of his house, appeared in answer to
the bell, he ordered whisky, and nodded comprehensively at
the company. "Take the orders," he said shortly.



But this was too much. Such a sensation could not be
endured without some outward expression. Pete's feet fell
off the stove with a clatter, and kicked the loose damper
into the iron cuspidor. Abe swallowed his chew of tobacco
and nearly choked. Sid Ellerton dropped his magazine,
and, in his endeavor to save it from the splotches of tobacco
juice on the floor, shot the chair from under him. Unfortunately
the chair struck Josh violently on the knee as it
overturned, and set the hasty butcher cursing with a fine
discrimination.



However, these involuntary expressions of feeling subsided
in time for each man to give his order, and Lionel K. Sharpe,
the proprietor, precipitated himself from the room with
his head whirling, and a wild fear gripping him lest Mr.
Moraine's bill should be disputed at the end of the month.



Abe took a fresh chew, and Pete's feet returned to the top
of the stove, but Josh's knee still ached when the drinks
arrived. Nor did poor Sid's loss of interest in a love story,
so hopelessly smeared with tobacco juice, prevent him brightening
visibly as he received his refreshment.



The little man raised his glass to his lips and toasted his
host.



"Here's 'how,' Mr. Moraine, sir," he said, with a smile,
feeling that, after all, there were still compensations for the
loss of a besmirched love story.



The chorus was taken up by the rest of the company, and
they all solemnly drank. Somehow there was a pretty general
feeling that it was not a moment for levity.



"Smith stopping here now?" inquired Angus, setting his
glass down a moment later.



Abe turned to the tattered register.



"Booked in yesterday," he said, thumbing down the page
which contained the list of a whole year's guests. "Ah       paid,"
he added, running his eye across to the "remarks"
column. "Guess he's gone. I'd say that perfume was a
parting gift to his lady friend, Pete."



"And who may she be?" inquired Angus, innocently turning
the page of his paper.



No one answered him. An exchange of glances went
round the room, carefully leaving the manager out.



Presently Angus looked up.



"Eh?" he demanded.



Abe cleared his throat.



"Guess I don't know of any female running loose around
here. They've most all got local beaus," he said, while he
shifted his position uncomfortably.



Sid caught his eye and shook his head.



"Can't say," he observed. "I see him once with a gal.
They wer' a long piece off. She was tall an'       an' upstandin'.
Didn't just recognize her."



"Guess I see him with her, too," put in Pete, almost
eagerly. "Seen him several times with her. They were way
out riding. I was too far off to see them right."



"She was tall, eh?" said Josh reflectively. "Guess that's
who I met on the trail driving with him. Maybe she belongs
to one of the farms."



"Maybe," muttered Angus dryly. "Anyway, I don't guess
it's up to us to worry our heads gray over him and his lady
friend. But it's good to see folks coming around. This
place is surely going to boom, fellers. It's going to be a
great town. Hendrie's working on a big scheme that's going
to bring the railway through here, and set values going up
sky high. Don't say I told you nothing. I've closed a deal
in town lots for myself, and if you've got any spare dollars
I'd advise              "



He broke off and looked across at the doorway as another
townsman came in. It was Charlie Maybee, the postmaster.



"Evening, boys. Evening, Mr. Moraine," he cried, his
genial face beaming cordially on everybody. "Say, Mr.
Moraine, I guessed maybe I'd find you. I got some mail here
for Mrs. Hendrie. It's local, and addressed to the post-office.
We don't get mail much that way, so I thought
I'd hand it to you. It'll save the lady comin' along in
for it."



He produced the letter and handed it to Angus while
accepting his invitation to drink.



"Mailed locally?" the manager inquired casually.



"Yes, This morning."



"Ah."



The keen-eyed Scot intercepted another exchange of
meaning glances, and looked from one to the other with
some severity.



"Say," he cried, with a sudden and studied return to his
usual dour manner, "some of you boys seem to be saying
one thing and       thinking another. Maybe you know something
about this letter."



An instant denial leaped to everybody's lips, but Angus
was playing his part too well for these country town-folk.
He maintained his atmosphere of displeasure and suspicion,
and finally the impulsive butcher cleared his throat.



"Pshaw!" he exclaimed nervously. "What's the use
beatin' around? We're all good friends right here, an' we
all feel that we owe Mr. Hendrie a mighty lot for what he's
doing for this city. An', I guess, when there's things goin'
on that don't seem right by him it's up to us to open our
mouths. We don't know a thing about that letter, Mr.
Moraine, but it just fits in with things we do know       all of
us. We know that just as soon as Mr. Hendrie disappears
from the farm some other feller appears, and his name's
Frank Smith, and he mostly gets around riding and driving
with Mrs. Hendrie. That's what we know."



The butcher's forehead was beaded with perspiration as
he came to the end of his statement, but he stared defiantly
round at the disapproving faces of his friends.



Angus fixed him with a stern eye.



"You surely do know a lot," he exclaimed, with angry
sarcasm. "And I want to tell you that I know a lot       too.
This is what I know. What you're saying is a damned
scandal. Do you get me? A damned scandal," he reiterated.
"And if I told Mr. Hendrie he'd have you all for
criminal libel       or worse. Now, see here," he went on, after
a dramatic pause, "I tell you plainly       if I ever hear another
breath of the like of this yarn going around I'll see that
Mr. Hendrie has you all lagged for a pack of libelous rascals
who ought to be in penitentiary."



He finished up his angry denunciation by bringing his
clenched fist down on the table bell with a force that brought
Mr. Sharpe flying into the room on the dead run, and left
the shamefaced townsmen glowering upon the flaming face
of their unfortunate comrade.



But the sensations of the evening did not end here. Angus
furnished them with another, even greater than those which
had preceded it.



"Take the orders       again!" he cried, as though hurling a
challenge, and daring any one to refuse his hospitality.



And such was the apprehension his manner inspired in
the hearts of the gathered scandal-mongers, that all selection
was reduced to a general call for whisky, that being the only
refreshment their confused brains could think of under such
a dreadful strain.






CHAPTER IX



THE WHEAT TRUST



Monica leaned forward in her saddle as her well-trained
broncho came to a stand. She set her elbow on her knee,
and the oval of her pensive face found a resting place in
the palm of her hand. Thus she sat gazing out over the
golden world, which rustled and rippled in the lightest of
summer zephyrs, chanting its whispered song of prosperity
to the delight of her listening ears.



Summer was nearing its height and a perfect day shone
down upon the world. There was no cloud to mar the perfect
azure of the sky, or shadow the ripening sun. The
lightest of summer breezes scarcely stirred the perfumed air,
which she drank in, in deep breaths, her whole being pervaded
with the joy of living.



Everywhere about her spread out this rippling sea of
golden wheat. Far as the eye could see, in the vague heat
haze which hovered over the distant line of nodding grain,
it washed the shores of an indefinite horizon, a monument
to one man's genius, a testimony to the unflinching determination
with which he faced the world and wrested from
life all those things his heart was set upon.



A great pride stirred within her. It was a worthy labor;
it was magnificent. Was there another man in the world
comparable with this great husband of hers? She thought
not. His was the brain which had conceived the stupendous
scheme; his was the guiding hand which had organized this
vast feeding-ground of a hungry world; his was the courage
that feared neither failure nor disaster; his was the driving
force which carried him on, surmounting every difficulty, or
thrusting them ruthlessly from his path.



What other schemes yet lay behind his steady eyes awaiting
the moment of decision for their operation? She wondered;
and wondering smiled, confident in the knowledge
that he had yet worlds to conquer, and that she would share
in his victories. It all seemed very, very wonderful to this
woman who, all her life, had only known desperate struggles
for her bare needs.



Suddenly she sat up and flung her arms wide open, as
though in a wild desire to take to her bosom the whole world
about her. Then she laughed aloud, a joyous, happy laugh,
and set her horse galloping toward her home. She loved it
all, every acre of it, every golden ear, every red grain that
grew there. She loved it because of       him.



Her delight culminated as she reached the house. As the
man-servant stepped forward to assist her to dismount he
gave her the only information that could have added to her
happiness at such a moment.



"Mr. Hendrie is home, ma'am," he said. "He's in the
office, awaiting your return."



Monica sprang to the ground with an exclamation which,
even to the well-trained footman, conveyed something of her
feelings, and ran into the house. In a moment, almost, she
was in her husband's arms, and returning his caresses.



"I made home sooner than I hoped, Mon," he said, the
moment of their greeting over.



The woman's smiling eyes looked up into his face.



"Yes. And I'm so glad. You said not until Thursday
next, and this is only Saturday. You were full of a tremendous
business in your letter last Tuesday. Something you
couldn't trust to paper."



The man smiled, but his powerful features wore that set
look which Monica had long ago learned to understand
meant the machine-like working of the brain behind it on
some matter which occupied his whole attention.



"That's it," he said, in his sparing manner when dealing
with affairs. "Trust."



"Trust?" Monica echoed the word, her eyes widening
with inquiry.



Hendrie nodded.



"This has been a secret I've kept       even from you," he
said. "From the moment you promised to be my wife, why,
I just determined to turn all my wheat interests into one
huge trust. I determined to organize it, and become its
president for a while. After it's good and going       maybe
I'll retire from active service and       just hand over the rest
of my life to you, and to those things which are, perhaps,
more worth doing       than       than, well, growing wheat."



The woman's face was a study in emotion.



"Oh, Alec," she cried. "You       you are doing this for       me?"



"I'm doing this, Mon, because I guess you've taught me
something my eyes have been mostly blind to. I'm doing
this because I'm learning things I didn't know before. One
of them's this. The satisfaction of piling up a fortune has
its limit. Maybe I've reached that limit. Anyway I seem
to be groping around for something else       something better.
Guess I'm not just clear about things yet. But       well, maybe,
seeing you've made things look different, you'll help me       sort
it out."



While he was speaking Monica had turned away to the
window which looked out upon the beautiful stream far
below them. Now she turned, and all her love was shining
in her eyes.



"Oh, Alec," she cried earnestly, "I thank God that this
is so. With all my heart I thank Him that this wonderful
new feeling has come through       me."



After that the man's attitude changed again to the cool,
yet forceful method which had made him the financial prince
he was. Nor, as she noted the swift changing of his moods,
could Monica help remembering that other change she had
once witnessed. That moment when on the discovery of
Frank's picture in her apartments he had been changed in
a flash from the perfect lover to a demon of jealous fury.
She felt that she had untold depths to fathom yet, before
she could hope to understand the mysteries of this man's
soul.



She listened to him now with all her business faculties
alert. Once more he was the employer, and she the humble
but willing secretary.



"I have practically finished the preliminaries of this
trust," he said. "When it's fixed there'll be a bit of a shout.
Bound to be. But I don't guess that matters any. What
really does matter is the result, and how it's going to affect
the public. My principles are sound, and       wholesome. We're
not looking for big lumps of profit. We're not out to rob
the world of one cent. We are out to protect       the public
as well as ourselves. And the protection we both need is
against those manipulators of the market like Henry Louth,
and other unscrupulous speculators. In time I'm hoping
to make the trusty world-wide. Meanwhile eighty per cent
of the grain growers of this country, and the northwestern
states across the border, are ready to come in. For the rest
it's just a question of time before they are forced to. Such
will be the supplies of grain from our control in a few years
that we can practically collar the market. Then, when the
organization is complete, and the wheat growers are universally
bonded together, there's going to be no middle man,
and the public will pay less for its bread, and the growers
will reap greater profits. That's my scheme. I tell you
right here no one's a right to come between the producer
and the consumer. The man who does so is a vampire, and
has no right to exist. He sits in his office and grows fat,
sucking the blood of both the toiler in the field and the
toiler in the city. He must go."



Monica clasped her hands in the enthusiasm with which
Hendrie always inspired her. She knew he was no dreamer,
but a man capable of putting into practice the schemes of
his essentially commercial genius.



"Yes, yes!" she cried. "It is immense. I have always
known that if only a man with sufficient courage and influence
and capital could be found some such scheme might
be operated. And you       you have thought of it all the time.
It has been your secret. And now              "



"Now? Now I'm going to ask for your contribution."
Hendrie smiled. "Ah, Mon, I can't do without you. I am
going to set you a task that'll tax all your capacity and
devotion to me. You've got to run this great farm of ours.
Oh, you haven't got to be a farmer," he said quickly, at
sight of the woman's blank look. "You will have the same
army of helpers under you that Angus has. It will be for
you to see that the work is done. Guess yours will just be
the organizing head. I'll need Angus in Winnipeg. He is
a man of big capacity for the work I need. You see, I
know I can trust him in things that I could trust to no other
man."



Hendrie rose from his seat at the writing table, and
pressed a bell.



"I'll send for him now," he explained.



Monica came to his side, and laid a shaking hand upon
his shoulder. Habit was strong in her. She could not altogether
forget that he was no longer her employer. She
approached him now in something of the old spirit.



"Could not I do the work in Winnipeg?" she asked timidly.
"Would it not be wiser to leave Angus              ?"



Hendrie's keen eyes looked straight down into hers.



"We are battling with hard fighting men who demand
cent per cent for their money, and can only get a fair interest,"
he said. "They must be dealt with by men as hard
as themselves. No, it's not woman's work. Angus is the
hardest man of business I know. I can trust him. Therefore
I require him       even in preference to you."



Monica bowed her head. She accepted his verdict in this
as in all things.



"Yes," she said simply. "I think I understand." Then
she went on in a thrilling voice. "But I am glad there is
work for me to do. So glad. Oh, Alec, you are making me
a factor in this great affair. You have allotted me my work
in an epoch-making financial enterprise, and I       I am very
thankful."



Her husband stooped and kissed her. Then he patted
her on the shoulder, as he might have done when she was his
secretary.



"Good, Mon," he said, in the calm tone of approval Monica
knew so well. Then he went back to his seat.



At that moment Angus Moraine appeared in the doorway.
His coming was swift and silent, and, for the first time
since she had known him, his cold face and colder eyes struck
unpleasantly upon the woman who was to supersede him.



Hendrie looked up, and, in one swift glance, noted all
that Monica had seen in the manager's face without being
in the least affected by it. He knew this man better than
it is generally given to one man to know another. He adopted
no roundabout methods now.



"I'm going to take this place out of your hands, Angus,
my boy," he said easily. "I want you in Winnipeg. I have
a big coup on, which I will explain to you later. The essential
point is that I want you in Winnipeg. You must be
ready in one month's time. The appointment will be to
your advantage. Get me?" Then he smiled coolly. "A
month will give you time to arrange your various wheat
interests about here."



Angus displayed no emotion of any sort. That the
change was distasteful to him there could be no doubt. He
had expected some such result with Monica's appearance
on the scene. Nor did the millionaire's knowledge of his
private interests disconcert him. It was not easy to take
this man off his guard.



"Yes," he said simply, and left the other to do the talking.



But Hendrie turned again to his desk as though about
to write.



"That's all," he said shortly.



Angus made no attempt to retire. Just for one second
his eyes shot a swift glance in Monica's direction. She was
standing at the window with her back turned.



"Who supersedes me here?" he demanded. There was
no warmth in Moraine's somewhat jarring voice. Monica
looked round.



Hendrie raised his massive head.



"Eh? Oh       my wife." And he turned to his writing
again.



Angus abruptly thrust a hand into his breast pocket and
turned deliberately to Monica.



"I met Maybee last night       the postmaster," he said,
drawing a letter from his pocket. "He handed me this mail,
addressed to the post office, for you, Mrs. Hendrie. He
asked me to hand it to you. Guess I forgot it this morning.
P'raps it's not important       seeing it was addressed to the
post office."



For the life of her, Monica could not control the color
of her cheeks, and Angus was quick to note their sudden
pallor as he stood with the letter held out toward her.



She took it from him with a hand that was unsteady.
Neither did this escape the cold eyes of the man.



Monica knew from whom the letter came. She knew without
even glancing at the handwriting. Why had Frank
written? She had seen him two evenings ago, and settled
everything. She was terrified lest her husband should question
her.



"Did he do right       sending it up?" There was a subtle
irony in the Scot's cold words that did not escape the ears
of the millionaire. He looked round.



Without looking in her husband's direction Monica became
aware of his interest. With a great effort she pulled herself
together.



"Quite right, Mr. Moraine," she said steadily, now smiling
in her most gracious manner. "And thank you very much
for taking such trouble. It has saved me a journey."



Angus abruptly withdrew. Nor was he quite sure whether
he had achieved his purpose. As he passed out of the house
his doubt was still in his eyes. Nor, to judge by his general
expression, was that purpose a kindly one.



The moment the door closed behind Angus, Hendrie swung
round in his chair.



"Letters addressed to the post office? Why?" His steady
eyes looked up into his wife's face with an intentness that
suddenly reminded her of the dreadful display of jealousy
she had witnessed once before.



It was a desperate moment. It was one of those moments
when it would have been far better to forget all else, and
remember only her love for her husband, and trust to that
alone. It was a moment when in a flash she saw the deadly
side of the innocent deception she was practicing. It was
a moment when her soul cried out to her that she was
definitely, criminally wrong in the course she had marked
out for herself. And, in that moment, two roads distinctly
opened up before her mind's eye. One was narrow and
threatening; the other, well, it looked the broader and easier
of the two, and she plunged headlong down it.



She smiled back into his face. She held up the letter and
waved it at him. She was acting. She bitterly knew she
was acting.



"Ah," she cried, with a gayety she forced herself to. "You
must have your big secrets from me, I must have my little
ones from you. That's only fair."



Hendrie smiled, but without warmth.



"Why, it's fair enough, but       I told you my secret."



Monica's laugh rippled pleasantly in his ears.



"So you did. I'd forgotten that." Then she gave an
exaggerated sigh. "Then I s'pose I must tell you mine.
And I did so want to surprise you with it. You have always
told me that I am a       clever business woman, haven't you?"



Hendrie nodded.



"Sure," he said, his manner relaxing.



"You settled one hundred thousand dollars on me when
we were married       all to myself, 'to squander as quickly as
you like.' Those were your words. Well, I just wanted to
show you that I am not one to squander money. I am investing
some of it in a concern that is to show a handsome
profit. The letter is from the man who is to handle the
matter for me. Oh, dear, you've robbed me of all my fun.
It is a shame. I       I'm disappointed."



Hendrie rose, smiling. The reaction from his moment of
suspicion was intensely marked. He came over to her.



"May I see it?" he asked.



Monica risked all on her one final card.



"Oh, don't rob me of the last little bit of my secret," she
cried. Then she promptly held the letter out. "Why, of
course you can read it       if you want to."



She waited almost breathlessly for the verdict. If the
suspense were prolonged she felt that she must collapse. A
dreadful faintness was stealing over her, a faintness she
was powerless to fight against. But the suspense was not
prolonged, and the verdict came to her ears as though from
afar off.



"Keep your little secret, Mon," she heard her husband
say. "It's good to give surprises       when they're pleasant.
Forgive me worrying you, but       but I think my love for
you is a sort of madness       I              " She felt his great arms
suddenly thrust about her and was thankful for their support.






CHAPTER X



MONICA'S FALSE STEP



Alexander Hendrie spent only two short days at the
farm before he was called away on a flying visit to the seat
of his operations at Winnipeg. But during those two days
there was no rest for him; his business pursued him through
mail and over wire, and the jarring note of the telephone
became anathema to the entire household at Deep Willows.



The announcement of his going came as no surprise to
Monica. She was prepared for anything in that way. She
knew that in the days to come she was likely to see less and
less of her husband, the penalty of her marriage to a man
engaged in such monumental financial undertakings as his.
She was careful to offer no protest; she even avoided expressing
the genuine regret she felt. It was the best way
she could serve him, she felt, forgetful of the possibility of
her attitude being otherwise interpreted. To her, any such
display could only be a hindrance, a deterrent to him, and,
as such, would be unfair, would not be worthy of her as a
helper in his great schemes.



From the moment she learned that she was to take charge
of the farm at Deep Willows she began to prepare herself;
and with her husband's going, she was left even freer still
to pursue the knowledge she had yet to acquire for her new
responsibility. Her time was spent almost wholly out of
doors; and such was her enthusiasm that daylight was none
too early to find her in the saddle, riding round the remoter
limits of the farm, watching and studying every detail
of the work which was so soon to become her charge.



That she reveled in the new life opening out before her
there could be little doubt. Her rounded cheeks and serious
eyes, the perfect balance of her keen mind and healthfulness
of body all bore testimony to its beneficial effects
upon a nature eager to come to grips with the world's work.



She had quite shaken off the effect of that moment of
panic when the preservation of her innocent secret had
hovered in the balance. Well enough she knew how desperately
all this happy life of hers had been jeopardized by
the coming of Frank's letter through the hands of Angus
Moraine. Had her husband only taken her at her word,
opened it and read the heading, "Dearest mother"       well, he
hadn't. And she thanked her God for the inspiration of the
moment that had prompted her to offer him the letter to
read, and for the power and restraint which had been vouchsafed
her to weather the threatening storm of almost insane
jealousy she had witnessed growing in her passionate husband's
eyes.



But it had served her as a lesson, and she was determined
to take no further risks. It was absolutely necessary to
see Frank once more to hand him the purchase money for
the farm, and his starting capital. She dared not risk the
mail, and to pay him by check would be to court prompt
disaster. Yes, she must see him that once more, and, after
that, though it might wrench her feelings to the limit, Frank
must pursue his career with only her distant eye watching
over him.



So her mind was made up, swiftly, calmly, after a careful
study of the position. She arrived at her decision through
no selfishness. Rather was it the reverse. She was sacrificing
herself to her husband and her boy. To do otherwise
was to risk wrecking her husband's happiness as well as her
own, and to start Frank in life with Alexander Hendrie as
a possible enemy would be far too severe a handicap.



Now, as she rode round the western limits of the grain-lands
she was occupied with thoughts of the Trust, nor could
her devoted woman's mind fail to dwell more upon the man
than his work.



He had told her that his new aspect of life had been inspired
by her, and the memory of his words still thrilled her.
That she was his influence for good filled her with a great
and happy contentment. She felt that to be such to the
man she loved was in itself worth living for. But he had
plainly shown her how much more she could be to him than
that. Could any woman ask more than to be a partner in
the works his genius conceived? No; and in this thought
lay the priceless jewel adorning her crown of womanhood.



She was watching a number of teams and their drivers
moving out to a distant hay slough. Forty teams of finely
bred Shire horses moving out from the farm with stately
gait, each driver sitting astride of his nearside horse's comfortable
back. She knew the mowers were already in the
slough, where haying had been going on for days. It was
a fine string of horses, but it was the merest detail of the
stud which was kept up to carry on the work of the farm.
And beside all this horse power there were the steam plows,
reapers and binders, threshers. The wonders of the organization
were almost inexhaustible.



The horses passed her by and vanished into a dip in the
rolling plains. Their long day had begun, but unlike Monica,
they possessed no other incentive than to demonstrate
the necessity of their existence.



As yet the sun had only just cleared the horizon, and the
chill of the morning air had not tempered towards the heat
of the coming day. Monica felt the chill, and, as soon as
the horses had passed her, she lifted her reins to continue
her round.



At that moment she became aware of a horseman riding
at a gallop from the direction of the farm, and, furthermore,
she recognized him at once as Angus Moraine, evidently
about to visit the scene of the haying.



She waited for him to come up, and greeted him pleasantly,
in spite of the fact that, since the incident of the letter, her
feelings toward him had undergone serious revision.



"Good morning, Mr. Moraine," she cried, as the man
reined his horse in. "They're out promptly," she added,
following the trail of the haying gang with her eyes.



Angus looked after them, too, and his thin lips twisted
wryly.



"They need to be," he declared coldly. "There's one time
for farm work to start, Mrs. Hendrie       that's daylight."



"Yes. I suppose there's no deviation from that rule."



"None. And we pay off instantly any one who thinks
differently."



"There's no excuse?"



Angus shook his head.



"None whatever. If a man's ill we lay him off       until he's
better. But they never are ill. They haven't time."



Monica surveyed the Scot with interest. Her husband's
opinion of him carried good weight.



"You run this place with a somewhat steely rule," she
said. "These men are so many machines, the horses, too.
Each has to produce so much work. The work you set for
them."



Angus's eyes were turned reflectively upon the horizon.



"You're thinking I'm a hard man to work for," he said.
"Maybe I am." He glanced back at the miles of wheat, and
Monica thought she detected something almost soft in the
expression of his eyes. "Yes," he went on, "they're machines
of sorts. But the work any man on this farm has
to do is work I can do       have done, both in quantity and
kind. As for the horses, I'm thinking of building a smaller
sick barn. The one we've got is a waste of valuable room,
it's so rarely used." He shook his head. "There's just
one way to run a big farm, Mrs. Hendrie. It's the hardest
work I know, and the boss has got to work just as hard as
the least paid 'choreman.'"



"I think       I feel that," Monica agreed cordially. "The
work must be done in season. And it's man's work."



Angus calmed his restive horse.



"You're right, mam," he exclaimed, with almost unnecessary
eagerness. "It is man's work       not woman's." He
looked her straight in the eyes, and Monica accepted the
challenge.



"You mean I am not the fit person to step into your
shoes," she said, with a smile.



Her smile in no way disconcerted the other. He returned
her look, while his hard mouth twisted in its wry fashion.



"P'raps I was thinking that; p'raps I was thinking of
something else. I'll not say you can't run this show. But
I'll say a woman oughtn't to."



"And why not?"



Monica's demand came sharply, but even while she made
it she realized the man's hard, muscular figure as he sat
there in his saddle, with his thin shirt open at his bronzed
neck, and the cords of muscle standing out on his spare,
bare arms. She understood her own bodily weakness compared
to his strength, and acknowledged to herself the justice
of his assertion.



"Do you need to ask, mam?" Angus retorted, with just
a suspicion of contempt. "Could you handle these guys
when they get on the buck? Could you talk to 'em? Could
you talk to 'em the way they understand?"



Monica's eyes flashed.



"I think so."



"Then you're thinking ten times wrong, mam," came the
manager's prompt and emphatic retort. "You'll have hell
all around you in a day."



Moraine's manner was becoming more aggressive, and
Monica was losing patience.



"You're not encouraging, but you're quite wrong. I
can assure you I can run this farm with just as stern a
discipline as you. Perhaps you have yet to learn that a
woman's discipline can be far harsher, if need be, than any
man's. Evidently you have not had much to do with women.
Believe me, my sex are by no means the angels some people
would have you believe."



"No."



The man's negative came in such a peculiar, almost insolent
tone that Monica was startled. She looked at him,
and, as she did so, beheld an unpleasantly ironical light in
his cold eyes. She interpreted this attitude in her own
way.



"You seem to feel leaving your control here," she said
sharply.



The man's expression underwent a prompt change. He
was her husband's employee once more. The insolent irony
had utterly vanished out of his eyes.



"I do, mam," he said earnestly. "I feel it a heap       and
it makes me feel bad. That's       that's why I've told you       all
this."



Monica's resentment died out before the man's earnestness.



"I don't think I understand you," she said more gently.



"I didn't guess you would." The Scot leaned forward
in his saddle, and his face lit with something like appeal.
"You see, mam, you haven't taken a patch of prairie land
and turned it into the greatest single-handed grain-growing
proposition in the world. You haven't worked years and
years fighting men and elements, and beaten 'em, until you
can sit back and reckon your yearly crop to almost the
fraction of a bushel. And if you haven't done these things       why,
'tisn't likely you're going to understand how I
feel.



"I've thought a whole lot since your husband told me he
was going to take me off this farm; and I made up my
mind to talk to you. You see, it's no use talking to
Hendrie." The man laughed. "Hendrie? Why, you reckon
I'm a hard man, but I tell you when Hendrie's mind is made
up on anything he's harder than any rock or metal ever
found above or below this earth. I saw you go out this
morning, and I guessed you'd be along to see those teams
get to work, so when I was through, back at the office, I
came along quick to have this yarn with you."



"But to what end?" inquired Monica. His earnestness
and evident hatred of leaving the farm had told her all she
required. But she wanted to bring him quickly to his point.



"To what end?" he echoed. "Why, to ask you to persuade
your husband to leave me here. Oh, I'm not going
to buck," he went on, at sight of Monica's coldly raised
brows. "What Hendrie says goes with me       always. He's
made me what I am, and I've never known him to make a
mistake when he's promised me benefit. I like him, and so
what he says goes with me       always. But I tell you frankly
I hate giving up this farm I've built. Yes, I've built it       not
Hendrie. It's been his money       his scheme. But it's
been my work, and I       I just love it. That's all, mam; at
least that's all except, if you fancy doing it, you can persuade
Hendrie to leave me here."



Monica shook her head decidedly; and, after a thoughtful
pause, her answer came quite coldly.



"No," she said, with decision. "I can do nothing in the
matter."



In a moment cold anger lit Moraine's eyes.



"You won't       you mean."



Instantly Monica was stirred to a resentment as cold as
his own. But she held herself well in hand.



"How dare you say that to me? I tell you I can do
nothing. But, since you put it that way, I certainly will
do nothing. You acknowledge your loyalty to my husband
one minute, and seek to turn him from his well-considered
purpose the next. I certainly will not be party to such
poor service. Prove the loyalty you boast by accepting his
orders without demur, and, if I know anything of him, you
are not likely to suffer by so doing."



Angus displayed nothing of the penitent under Monica's
rebuke. His angry eyes looked straight into hers, and his
reply rapped out smartly       



"If you always serve Alexander Hendrie as loyally as I
have served him, and shall continue to serve him, you'll have
little enough on your conscience. Maybe I was foolish to
come to you at all. Anyway, I'm never likely to do so again.
And I'll just ask you always to remember I did come to
you and asked a simple favor, which carried with it no disloyalty
to your husband. I want you to remember that,
and to remember you refused me       for no sound reason."



He lifted his reins, and, crushing both heels into the
flanks of his raw-boned broncho, galloped off without waiting
for a reply.



Monica looked after him; and, somehow, as her thoughtful
eyes followed him out of sight, his challenge still rang in
her ears; just his challenge, that was all. His veiled, final
threat had left her wholly unnerved.



"If you always serve Alexander Hendrie as loyally as I
have served him, and shall continue to serve him, you'll have
little enough on your conscience."



Whatever had been his purpose the words were not without
effect upon her. They left her feeling uncomfortable,
they left her nervous and irritable, and she felt that her
dislike for this man was little less than his evident dislike
for her.






CHAPTER XI



WHICH DEALS WITH A CHANCE MEETING



Monica was more disconcerted than she knew, and finally
set her horse at a gallop across country, regardless of
whither her course might take her. Nor did she pause to
consider her whereabouts until the wheat lands were left several
miles behind her, and she found herself entering the
woods which lined the deep cutting of a remote prairie creek.
Here she drew rein and glanced about her for guidance.



She looked back the way she had come, but the wheat
fields were lost behind a gently undulating horizon of grass.
Ahead of her, far as the eye could see, the wide-mouthed
cutting of the creek stretched away toward a ridge of purple
hills. To the right of her was the waving grass of the
prairie, miles and miles of it, without the tiniest object on
it to break the green monotony.



She gazed out over the latter with mildly appreciative
eyes. Her ride had done her good. Something of the effect
of Angus upon her had worn off. She almost sympathized
with him as she dwelt upon the reason of his rudeness to her.



Presently she turned about. Her breakfastless condition
was making itself felt, and, anyway, she had wasted enough
time. She would return home and breakfast, and, after
that, with a fresh horse, she would continue her round of
the farm.



She was about to put her purpose into operation when
the sound of wheels coming up from the creek below drew
her attention. At the same instant her horse pricked its
ears and neighed. A responsive neigh echoed the creature's
greeting, and, the next moment, a single-horse buckboard
appeared over the shoulder of the cutting.



Instead of moving on, Monica was held fascinated by the
apparition. The spectacle of this solitary traveler was too
interesting to be left uninvestigated; and she smiled as she
gazed upon the girlish occupant of the vehicle. The
stranger's face was shadowed under a linen sunbonnet, and
her trim figure was clad in the simplest of dark skirts and
white shirt-waist. She was urging her heavy horse with words
of encouragement, alternated by caressingly emitted chirrups
from a pair of as pretty lips as Monica remembered
ever to have seen.



"Good morning," Monica cried cordially, as the vehicle
drew near. She sat smilingly waiting for the lifting of the
sunbonnet, that she might obtain a glimpse of the face she
felt sure was pretty beneath it.



The girl looked up with a start.



"My!" she cried. Then she remembered. "Good morning       mam!"



The final suggestion of respect came as the speaker realized
the perfect-fitting riding habit Monica was wearing.
Her eyes were round with wonder, but there was no shyness
in them. Equally there was no rudeness. Just frank, pleased
astonishment.



"I'm afraid I startled you," Monica said kindly, as the
girl drew up her horse. "You were so very busy coaxing
your horse."



The stranger smiled in response.



"He needs coaxing," she said. "The pore feller's pretty
old, and we've surely come some way."



"Not this morning," Monica protested, studying the girl's
face with genuine admiration.



She was not disappointed. The girl was a striking-looking
creature. Her dark hair and brows threw up into strong
relief the beautiful eyes which looked fearlessly up into her
face as she made her reply.



"Oh yes, mam," she said calmly. "You see, we started
from Toogoods' at four o'clock. I want to be home by
noon. Guess we'll make it tho'. Old Pete and I have made
some long journeys together."



"He looks a good horse," Monica hazarded. She knew
little enough of horse flesh, but she liked the look of this
girl and wanted to be agreeable. "How far have you to go
now?"



"Guess it's most twenty-two or thereabouts. Mamma'll
be worried some if I don't make home by noon. I don't like
worrying mamma, she's so good, and       and she's dreadfully
nervous."



"An invalid?" suggested Monica.



"Oh, no." The girl's eyes were still absorbed in the details
of Monica's dress. She had never seen anything quite
like it before, and her shrewd mind was speculating as to
this stranger's identity.



"Say, where you from?" she asked suddenly, in a quick,
decided manner. "Guess you belong to Deep Willows. Maybe
you're Mrs. Hendrie?"



"Quite-right       how did you know?"



The girl reddened slightly as she smiled.



"Why       your clothes. You see, we've all heard you're at
Deep Willows."



Monica laughed, and the girl joined in.



"My clothes       folks don't wear riding habits much about
here, I s'pose?"



"No, mam."



Monica nodded.



"Now, I may ask who you are. I didn't like to before,
but              "



The girl smiled frankly.



"You guessed it would be rude," she said quickly, "so
you let me be rude       instead."



Monica laughed a denial.



"Oh no," she said. "I just didn't think about it."



"But it doesn't matter, mam," the girl went on. "Nothing's
rude that isn't meant rude. I never mean to be rude. I
don't like rudeness. I'm Phyllis Raysun, mam. We're
farmers       mamma an' me. Just a bit of a farm, if you can
call it 'farm'       not like Deep Willows."



The girl's unmistakable awe when she spoke of Deep Willows
amused Monica.



But now she scrutinized her with an added and more
serious interest. So this was the Phyllis who had caught
her boy's fancy. This was the girl he described as "bully"       and
she was frankly in agreement with him. She longed
there and then to speak of Frank and learn something of
Phyllis' feelings toward him, but she knew she must deny
herself.



"I dare say it's a very happy little place for all that,
Phyllis," she said, deliberately using the girl's first name.
She meant to begin the intimacy she had suddenly determined
to establish at once. "Who works it for you? Your
father       brother?"



As she watched the changing expression of the girl's face
Monica thought her the prettiest creature she had seen for
years.



"Neither, mam." There was a slight hesitation over the
use of the respectful "mam." Monica's use of her own
name had slightly embarrassed her. "There's just mamma
and me, and we work it together. We've got a choreman,
but that's all. It's       it's only a quarter section."



"You two never do all the work yourselves       plowing?"
Monica cried incredulously.



The girl nodded. She liked this stranger. She was so
handsome, so good.



"Mamma an' me       mam."



Monica's eyes grew very soft. It seemed wonderful to
her this courage in two lonely women.



Suddenly she leaned forward in her saddle, and spoke very
gently.



"Would you like to oblige me       very much?" She smiled
into the girl's earnest face.



Phyllis flushed with pleasure.



"Why, surely       mam."



"Then don't call me 'mam,'" Monica said, in a tone calculated
to leave the girl with no feeling of shame at her respectful
attitude. Then she laughed in the way Phyllis
liked to hear. "You see, I am just the same as you, Phyllis       if
I do wear a tailored riding habit. We're both farmers       in
our way."



Phyllis blushed, but shook her head with a simple yet
definite decision.



"I won't call you 'mam' if you don't like it," she said
readily. "But I can't help thinking there's a big       big difference,
if you don't mind me speaking so plainly."



Monica's interest was sincere.



"Go on, child," she said. "I like to hear you talk. It       it
reminds me of some one I'm       interested in."



The girl's luminous eyes brightened.



"I wasn't going to say much       only              " she hesitated
doubtfully, "only I hear so many folk say there's no difference.
Most of them say it sort of spitefully, and you can
see they don't say it because       because they really believe
it. They sort of want to make out they're as good as anybody
else, and all the time most of 'em can't even think
right. It's just conceit, and spite, and envy. And, oh,
there's such a big difference all the time. Take two men.
Take our choreman, and your       your husband. Our man
can plow a furrow       but not so straight and true as I
can. I'd say he can clean a barn out right. Maybe he could
drive a team down a straight trail without hurting anything.
But that's all he can do. Say, he hasn't got brains enough
to wash himself wholesome and clean. Then look at Mr.
Hendrie. Was there ever such a great man? He doesn't
sit down and shout he's better than other folk. Maybe
he don't think he is. But he gets right up and does things
that come near making the world stare. And it's done out
of his own head. He thinks, and       and does. And if other
folks were as good as him they'd be doing just the same,
and there'd be nothing to wonder at in       in anybody. I
wouldn't be rude to you       indeed I wouldn't, but       but there's
a heap of difference between folk, it shows in the result of
their lives."



Monica was startled. She was filled with an intense wonder
at this youthful, humble prairie flower. Where did she
get such thoughts, such ideas from at her age?



She answered her very carefully. She felt that it was
necessary       it was imperative. Somehow she felt that this
child's brain, albeit immature, was perhaps superior to her
own.



"Well, Phyllis," she said, "there's a great deal in what
you say, but perhaps we are looking at things from different
points of view. I was thinking of the moral aspect. I
maintain a good woman's a good woman, whatever her station.
No clothes, no education can alter that. Every good
man or good woman is entitled to the same consideration,
whatever the condition of       of their lives."



Phyllis watched her new friend eagerly while she spoke.
She drank in her words, and sorted them out in her own
quaint fashion. The moment she ceased speaking she was
ready with her answer.



"Sometimes I think I'd like to see it that way," she said,
with simple candor. "Then sometimes, most generally, I
think I wouldn't. To me that sort of makes the good God
kind of helpless. And He isn't. Not really. You've just
got to look around and see what He's done to understand
that. Look at the trees, the prairie, the hills, the water.
See how He's provided everything for us all. Well, the way
you think makes out that He's just created us and all this.
He's made us all in the same pattern, and dumped us right
down here just for amusement, and sort of said: 'There
you are; I've done my best; just get right to it and see how
you can make out.' Well, when I look around and see all
He's done I kind o' feel we're all working out just as He
wants us to. We're not so much His children as we're His
servants, and like all servants we've got our places, some
high, some low. And according to our places we ought to
say 'sir' and 'mam' to those above us, just as we feel all of
us ought to say it to Him. Guess maybe I can't make it
all clear       maybe you'll think me a sort of fool child, but if
I live to be a hundred I'll feel I want to say 'mam' to you,
and 'sir' to Mr. Hendrie. And that's because any one must
see I'm not your equal, and never will be."



Monica was left with no answer. She might have answered,
but she was afraid to. She was afraid that any further
contradiction of such obviously wholesome ideas might affect
this simple nature adversely. Therefore she permitted herself
only to marvel.



"Who do you talk to about       these things," she asked
after a brief pause.



Phyllis flushed. She was afraid she had offended where
she had meant no offense. Monica's tone had been almost
cold.



"I don't generally talk so much," she said hastily. "I
like to think most       when I'm plowing, or working on the
farm. I talk to my beau sometimes," she added, with a
blush.



"You have a beau," said Monica, with a ready smile.
"But of course you must have       with your pretty face."



"Oh, yes, and we're going to get married soon," Phyllis
hurried on, basking once more in the other's smile. "His
mamma's going to buy him a swell farm and start him right,
and we're going to get married. Frank's awfully kind. He's       he's              "



"Frank? Frank       who?" Monica had no need of the
information, but she was anxious to encourage the girl.



"Frank Burton. He's much bigger than me, and he
thinks a heap. I just love him. I just love him so I don't
know what I'd do if I hadn't got him. He's only a boy.
We're the same age, and he's got the loveliest face."



"And when is he going to get this farm?"



"Soon. Quite soon. Then we'll be married. It's       it's
good to love some one and feel they love you," Phyllis went
on, almost abstractedly. "It makes you feel that you can
work ever so. The days get short, and the nights shorter
still. It makes the air all full of things that make you
want to laugh, and sing, and be good to everything       even
to spiders and       and bugs and things. Yes, it sets everything
moving quick about you, and all the time it's just
you, because you're full of happiness and looking forward.
The only thing that's slow is the time between seeing him."



Monica smiled, and Phyllis laughed happily.



The mistress of Deep Willows could have sat on indefinitely
talking and laughing with this frank, ingenious child, but
she knew that, however reluctantly, she must tear herself
away. Already the sun was high in the sky, and Phyllis
had to reach home by noon, while she had her round to complete.
So she lifted her reins, and her dozing broncho threw
up its head alertly.



"I think you'll be very happy with your beau, Phyllis,"
she said, gently. "You would make any man happy. If
this Frank Burton is all you say he is, and I'm sure he is,
I fancy you'll live to see the day when you have quite lost
your desire to say 'mam'       when you speak to me."



The girl shook her head seriously.



"I hope not."



Monica's smile was at thoughts which were quite impossible
for the other to read.



"I hope that day will come," she said. "So there we must
agree to think differently. Meanwhile, may I come and see
you, and will you come and see me?" Her eyes grew almost
pathetically appealing. "Will you?" she urged.



A flush of embarrassment swept over the girl's happy
face. In a moment she was struggling to express her gratitude.



"Oh, ma       Mrs. Hendrie," she cried. "Me come to Deep
Willows? I       I       oh, it would be too much."



"Will you?"



Monica had set her heart on obtaining this girl's promise.



"Oh       yes       if       if              "



"There must be no 'ifs,'" Monica cried. Then she urged
her horse nearer the buckboard and held out her hand.



"Good-bye, Phyllis," she said, lingering over the girl's
name caressingly. "I shall keep you to your word. And
I shall come to see you. Good-bye, my dear," she cried
again. "A pleasant journey."



The girl pressed the neatly gloved hand her new friend
hold out to her, and her old horse, after its welcome rest,
started off with added briskness. She was loath enough to
go, but she had yet many miles to travel before noon. She
called out a warm good-bye, and waved her small brown
hand.



"I surely will come," she cried, "I'll never       never forget."



Monica watched them go till the rattling old buckboard
dropped behind one of the rising prairie rollers. Then, with
a deep sigh, she set off toward her home.






CHAPTER XII



THE CLEAN SLATE



Monica's chance meeting with Phyllis Raysun was not
without its effect on both their lives. An effect both marked
and immediate in each case. The girl drove on home in a
state of considerable elation, and told her story of the "great
lady" to her sympathetic, if not very clever mother, Pleasant
Raysun. She told it not as one might speak of a passing
incident on her journey, but as an important factor in her
uneventful life.



"Mamma," she said, after a thoughtful pause, the story
having come to its commonplace ending, "it likely don't
sound great to you; maybe you'll forget about it, or, if
you don't, you'll say I'm just a sentimental girl whose feelings
get clear away with her. And maybe I am, maybe
you're right; but I don't think so. She's a lovely, lovely
woman, and somehow I kind of feel I'm all mixed up with
her already. I don't think folks make friends. Friends are
just friends. They are, or they aren't. Even if you don't
know them, they are your friends, waiting till the time
comes when you meet. That's how I feel about Mrs. Hendrie.
I       I'm sure we're friends, and always have been."



Pleasant Raysun was a plump body, whose dark eyes and
soft mouth were strangely opposed in their efforts to display
the character behind. She was just a gentle, soft creature,
quite devoid of any attainments beyond a capacity for
physical work, and an adoring affection for the daughter to
whom she looked for guidance.



"Maybe you're right, my dear," she said amiably, "you
generally are. How you know things beats me all to death.
Whoever would 'a' guessed Pop Toogood was sick all this
way off like you did? I'm sure I wouldn't. An' then about
buyin' a new plow an' binder by instalments. Who'd 'a'
thought o' that? It surely must be instinc', as you often
say, only wher' you get it beats me. I never had instinc'.
Nor did your pop. Leastways he never showed it me.
Sometimes I sort o' know when the coffee's just right       maybe
that's instinc'       which reminds me the hash must be
nigh overbaked."



She rose from her rocker and toddled across to the cookstove,
leaving her daughter to her reflections. She had no
power of entering into any of the girl's thoughts and feelings.
Her love for her offspring extended to an unreasoning
admiration for her capacity and beauty, the only practical
expression of which was a simple, loving care for her
creature comforts.



With Monica the effect of that meeting on the trail was
marked in a wholly different manner. She had at last seen
this girl whom her boy had told her of in such glowing
terms. She had seen, and she knew that she approved his
choice. As she listened to her talk, as she became aware of
her views upon matters on which she believed so few girls of
her age ever thought seriously, she became more and more
convinced that her boy had blindly stumbled upon the one
girl to be his helpmeet in the upward career they had marked
out for him.



Thus she spent the rest of her day with an added light
shining in upon Frank's future, and with it came a swift
decision to act promptly, and carry out her carefully considered
plans without any further delay. She felt it to be
best from every point of view. It would be best for Frank,
since it would leave him free to begin his real business of life
at the moment he selected; it would be best for her, since
she would then be free to enter upon her control of the farm
with a slate wiped perfectly clean of the last shadow of the
past which marred its surface.



So she sent word to Angus that she required the best
team of drivers and a buggy, since Hendrie's automobile
was away, to take her in to Calford the next day.



Her order was received without enthusiasm, but with considerable
suspicion by her husband's manager. So much
so that the company at the Russell Hotel that night were
treated to a more than usual morose severity on the part
of this local magnate. He wrapped himself in an impenetrable
and sour silence, out of which the most ardent devotion
to his favorite spirit could not rouse him.



Monica spent her last hours before retiring to bed in
writing a long letter to Frank. She chose the library, or
office, as her husband preferred to call it, for her correspondence.
She preferred this room to any other in the
house. Perhaps it was the effect of her long years spent in
a business career. Perhaps it was because it was so soon
to become the seat of her administration. Perhaps, again,
it was the thoughts of the man who had designed it for
his own accommodation that inspired her liking.



It was a luxurious place, and the great desk in the center
of it was always a subtle invitation to her. The subdued
light focusing down upon the clean white blotting pad, with
its delicately chased silver corners, never failed to please
her whenever she entered the room at night. Just now she
felt more satisfaction than ever as she contemplated ridding
herself of this last shadow which marred her happy outlook.



Her maid had insisted on changing her from her habit,
which Monica warmly regarded as her business dress, to a
semi-evening toilet of costly simplicity. This was a feature
of her new life which Monica found it difficult to appreciate.
She had looked after herself for so long that she rather
feared the serious eyes and deliberate devotion to the conventions
of the well-trained Margaret. There was one service
that she could not induce herself to submit to. It was that
of being prepared for her nightly repose. On this point
the mistress of Deep Willows was adamant, and Margaret
was unwillingly forced to give way.



Now she took her seat at the desk. She drew a sheet of
notepaper from the stationery cabinet, and, for some moments,
sat gazing at it, lost in pleasant thoughts of the
young girl she had met that morning.



It was curious what a sudden and powerful hold this
child of eighteen had taken upon her affections. She thought
she had never encountered any one of her own sex who so
pleased her, and she sat there idly dreaming of the days to
come, when this boy and girl would marry, and she could
subtly, almost unnoticed, draw them into her life.



Yes, it could be done; it could be done through Phyllis.
Frank was far too loyal ever, by word or deed, to jeopardize
her in her husband's regard. Everything was simplifying
itself remarkably. Fortune was certainly with her. She
smiled as she thought how they would come to her. A local
farmer and his wife, in whom she was interested. Her husband
would be rather pleased. He would undoubtedly encourage
her in her whim. Then, if he should recognize Frank
as the original of the photograph he had once torn up, that
would be easily explained and would be an added reason for
befriending the couple       seeing that Frank would then be
married. Oh, yes, a little tact, a little care, and she would
have a daughter as well as a son.



Then she would eventually get Alexander interested in
the boy. And when that was achieved she would begin to
develop her plans. Frank might be taken into some of her
husband's schemes, after which it would be easy stepping
upwards toward that fortune she had designed for him.



But she was suddenly awakened to her waste of time, and
her own physical tiredness, by the chiming of the little
clock in front of her, which was accusingly pointing the
hour of ten. It reminded her, too, of the early morning
start she must make in the morrow, so she snatched at a pen
to begin her letter.



Habit was strong with Monica. An ivory penholder and
gilt nib had no charms for her, so the humble vulcanite of
the stylograph of her stenography days was selected, and
she prepared to write.



But for once her humble friend refused adequate service.
It labored thickly through the heading, "My dearest
Frank," and, in attempting to punctuate, a sudden flow of
ink left a huge blot in place of the customary comma.
With a regretful expostulation Monica turned the paper
over and blotted it on the pad, and, after readjusting the
pen, went on with her writing, detailing her instructions
swiftly but clearly, so that no mistake could be possible.



In less than half an hour the letter was finished and ready
for dispatch. So she hurried away to bed, deciding to mail
it in Calford when she arrived there next day.





That night Angus returned to the farm about half-past
eleven o'clock. There was nobody up to receive him, except
the man to take his horse. Nor was his mood improved
by the realization that since Mrs. Hendrie's coming he had
been definitely robbed of his high estate. He knew he was
no longer the master of Deep Willows. In the eyes of the
staff of servants, brought from the East, he was one like
themselves, a mere employee. The thought galled him, but
he was not the man to publicly display his chagrin.



He let himself into his quarters which were situated in
an extreme wing of the building, lit the lamp in his office,
and flung himself into a chair. He sat there staring moodily
before him, chewing the cud of grievance which was momentarily
getting a stronger and stronger hold upon him.



He was not the man to submit easily, nor was he likely
to display any recklessness in dealing with the situation.
His nature was a complex affair, which combined many admirable
qualities oddly mixed up with a disposition as sour
and spleenful, even revengeful, as well could be. His
grievance now was not against Hendrie; there was a peculiar
quality of loyalty in him which always left Hendrie far
above any blame that he might feel toward others. It was
the woman he was thinking of. The woman who had usurped
his place; and all the craft of his shrewd mind was directed
toward her undoing.



Just now he was speculating as to her reason for suddenly
taking the long journey into Calford. He was considering
that, and, in conjunction with it, he was thinking of a telegram
which Maybee had handed him. It was addressed to
Monica, and the postmaster had assured him it was from
Hendrie, announcing his unexpected ability to return home
to-morrow. At first Angus had felt spitefully pleased that
Hendrie would meet his wife on the trail, but this hope had
been dashed by Maybee's subsequent information that the
telegram had been dispatched from a place called Gleber,
which he knew lay thirty odd miles to the northwest of
Everton, and in an almost opposite direction to Calford.
Now he was considering, while apparently doing his best
to deliver the message, how best he could arrange that Monica
should not see it before she went away.



His reason was not quite clear. Only he felt, in the light
of what he knew of Monica's clandestine meetings with Mr.
Frank Smith, that she was not taking this journey with
her husband's knowledge. More than that, he felt that she
had no particular desire to advertise it, and that when
Hendrie discovered his wife's absence explanations would
have to be forthcoming.



Angus was a great believer in his own instinct. What
he believed to be intuition had served him well on more than
one occasion, and just now he felt that his peculiar faculties
in this direction were particularly alert.



After some minutes of deep thought he rose from his chair
with a wry smile twisting the corners of his hard mouth. A
thought had come to him which might serve.



He made his way to the library and lit the lamp over the
desk, and as he did so he sniffed vigorously at the air. He
detected perfume, and glanced quickly around him. Then
his eyes fell on the blotting-pad where he was about to place
the telegram.



In a moment he saw that the pad had been recently used,
and the perfume told him by whom. He had no scruples
whatever. Monica had been writing letters, and he wondered.
He picked up the pad and carefully removed the uppermost
sheet of blotting paper. Reversing it, he held it before the
light, and studied it carefully. Then he replaced it, but, in
doing so, deliberately left the reverse side uppermost.



"Guess you ought to know better, my lady," he muttered,
his face genuinely smiling. "Thick pens are cursed things
for telling tales on a blotting-sheet."



He carefully placed the telegram exactly over the blotted
words "My dearest Frank," which now read as they had
been written by his unsuspecting victim. Then he forthwith
hurried back to his quarters, feeling in a better frame
of mind than he had felt all day.






CHAPTER XIII



HENDRIE'S RETURN



Angus Moraine's little plan worked out exactly as he
had anticipated. Monica did not visit the library before her
somewhat rushed departure the following morning. Her
preparations had been completed overnight, and there was
nothing left which required a visit to the room, where the
telegram had been deposited.



Her departure took place shortly after daylight, at which
hour even the chance visit of a servant to the library was
not likely to occur. Thus it happened that the envelope
and its contents remained in their place quite unheeded,
even by the girl whose duty it was to dust and set the room
in order, until two o'clock in the afternoon, at which hour
Alexander Hendrie returned.



The millionaire's return was the result of an impulse,
inspired by finding himself with something in the nature
of a "loose end." His business of the great trust had unexpectedly
taken him to meet a deputation of local grain-growers
at Gleber, just as he was about to leave Calford for
Winnipeg. From thence a flying visit to Deep Willows
was only a deviation of route whereby he might fill in spare
hours which, otherwise, he would have had to spend waiting
for the east-bound mail in Calford.



The idea of surprising Monica had pleased him. He
knew the delight it would give her, and, for himself, every
moment spent away from her was more than begrudged.
Absorbed as Hendrie was in his maelstrom of affairs, it was
curious how the human side of the man had developed since
his first meeting with Monica. He was still the colossal
money-making machine, but it was no longer his whole being
as hitherto it had been. There could be no doubt that
Monica was now foremost in his thoughts, and he loved with
all the strength of his maturity as jealously as any school-boy.



Consequently, on his arrival at Deep Willows, his disappointment
was of the keenest when he learned that
Monica had, only that morning, departed suddenly for
Calford. However, he was not the man to give way to such
feelings for long, especially with means of alleviating them
to his hand. His decision was prompt. There was only
one thing to do. He would go straight on and join her in
Calford, just as soon as sufficient petrol could be put on
board the car. With this resolve most of his disappointment
evaporated, and he passed on to the library, while a man
was despatched to notify Angus of his return.



Angus was on hand. He had arranged that this should
be so. He had no intention of missing his cues in the little
drama his own mischief had inspired. He meant to be an
actor in it, though possibly only taking a small part. For
the rest he would stand in the prompter's corner, and watch
the progress of his handiwork.



He responded to the millionaire's summons without any
undue display of alacrity. He left him ample time in the
library before presenting himself. His purpose was obvious
and well calculated. When he finally entered the room, he
came almost without any sound, turning the handle of the
door with what seemed unnecessary caution.



Again was his object plain. His first sight of Alexander
Hendrie was of a great man standing before a window examining,
with painful intensity, a large sheet of white blotting-paper.
This was as Angus had hoped, but there was
something else that gave him even keener satisfaction.



He was studying the man's head, with its wonderful mane
of fair hair. His face was turned three-quarters toward
him, so that the light of the window shone down on the
white surface of the paper.



He had seen Hendrie in most of his moods, he had studied
him a hundred times, but never, in all his long years of
association with him, had he witnessed such an expression
as he now beheld.



The fair, rather sunburned complexion was deadly pale,
the bushy brows were drawn harshly together, the lips, contrary
to their usual custom in repose, were slightly parted.
But it was the steel-gray eyes of the man that most held
and, perhaps, pleased Angus. There was no light in them
that suggested violent fury. They were cold, dreadfully
cold and cruel, like the steely gray of a puma's. There was
pain in them, too. But it was a pain that did not suggest
helpless yielding. On the contrary Angus recognized the
look he had once or twice seen before, when Hendrie had contemplated
crushing some opponent to his schemes. There
was an atmosphere about his whole expression that was
utterly merciless.



Angus moved across the soft carpet without any sound.
He halted in full view of the sheet of paper, bearing its impress
of those three tell-tale words with the culminating
blot. So engrossed was Hendrie that he did not appear to
observe his manager's approach, yet he gave no start, or
sign, when the latter's harsh voice broke the silence       



"You sent for me? I'd heard you'd got back."



Then a strange thing happened. Hendrie laughed without
looking up.



"Why, yes," he said. "I sent for you. You can tell the
man I shan't need the automobile."



Angus waited, studying the profile of the man beside him.
He felt that something was coming. The stillness, the unnatural
calm of the other was too pronounced.



Presently Hendrie looked up, and Angus mentally rubbed
his eyes. The man was smiling       smiling pleasantly. But
he did not put the paper aside.



"Sort of curious," he said, with a half humorous dryness.
"You never think of the blotting-pad you're writing on.
It's just there, and when you've written you just turn your
paper over and blot it. You do it a hundred times, and it
never seems to occur to you that you're doing       something
foolish. Guess the folks who used to use sand had more
sense."



Angus nodded. Something told him that his eyes were
clear enough now. He gazed meaningly at the paper.



"Guess Mrs. Hendrie being away, the maids just fancy
they can do as they please."



In a moment the change Angus had been awaiting came.
In a flash hell seemed to be looking out of the millionaire's
eyes.



"That's my wife's writing!" he cried, while one great
hand gripped the manager's shoulder with crushing force.



Angus stared into the man's livid face, and, as eye sought
eye, he knew that at last he was gazing into the torn soul
of his employer.






CHAPTER XIV



A MAN'S HELL



Desperate, silent moments passed while the terrible eyes
of the millionaire looked into, through, beyond, the almost
expressionless face of his manager. Then, at last, all at
once, his hand relaxed its painful grip upon the man's muscular
shoulder, and       he laughed.



His laugh was unaccompanied by any words that justified
the abrupt change. To Angus it brought a feeling of relief.
His imagination was not acute. It is doubtful if he realized
the lack of mirth, the hollow, false ring of that laugh. All
he knew was that he felt as though some living volcano
under him had suddenly ceased to threaten, and he was given
a respite. Alexander Hendrie walked across to the desk,
and flung his bulk into the sumptuously upholstered chair
that stood before it. He swung it round, and pointed at
a chair near by, and facing him, so placed that the light fell
full upon the face of its occupant.



"Sit down," he commanded, with cold authority.



Angus obeyed, waiting and wondering. Hendrie's present
mood was entirely new to him. He had stirred the fires in
this man, and must now watch, and wait, to see how they
burned.



But the result was elusive. Hendrie reached out and drew
the cigar cabinet toward him. With deliberate care he
selected a cigar, and pushed the cabinet within the other's
reach.



"Smoke," he said laconically; and Angus fingered one of
the priceless cigars tenderly.



Hendrie pierced the end of his cigar with elaborate care.
He lit it. Then he leaned back in the chair, and, locking his
fingers, rested his elbows upon the arms of it, while his eyes
remained upon the blotting-sheet in front of him.



Presently he looked round, and a swift, cold glance shot
into Angus Moraine's face.



"When I came in here I'd sent for you," he said. "You
were in your quarters       which was not usual at this time."
He paused. Then he went on. "Being in your quarters you
could have joined me in thirty seconds. You came after ten
minutes or so. When you came, you came quietly. Guess
you stole into the room       to see what I was doing. Why?
Because you had discovered this blotting-sheet       with its
writing. You'd found it, examined it, and placed it back in
the pad reversed; and       you knew it was my wife's writing.
Guess you've something to tell me       go ahead."



The directness of the challenge was so characteristic of
Hendrie that Angus was not wholly unprepared for it. The
keen analysis of his personal attitude disconcerted him,
perhaps, but, after a moment's thought, it left him comparatively
untroubled. It was only another exhibition of
Hendrie's wonderful mentality       that mentality which had
carried him soaring above the heads of all his rivals.



"How much d'you want to know?"



For a second Hendrie's cold, gray eyes lit, then his swift
command came with tremendous yet restrained heat.



"All, damn you, all!"



Angus flushed. There was no resentment in him at the
other's tone. His flush was inspired by some feeling of
satisfaction.



He pointed at the blotting-sheet.



"Guess that Frank has another name. Leastways I
should say it is 'Frank Smith,' who registers in that name
at the Russell Hotel in Everton       mostly when you're away."



The millionaire's eyes were intent upon the blotting-sheet.
He offered no comment.



"The townsfolk have seen him riding with Mrs. Hendrie       quite
a lot       when you're away. He's a big feller. Bigger
than you. He's got thick fair hair, and is a good-looker."



For a second, Hendrie's eyes lifted.



"Young?"



"Anything up to twenty-five."



Hendrie was no longer contemplating the incriminating
paper. He was gazing at it, and beyond it, searching the
cells of memory.



"Go on," he said. His cigar had gone out.



Angus eyed his employer squarely. Strangely enough a
a twinge of compunction was making itself felt. He drew a
deep breath. Somehow the atmosphere of the room had
suddenly become oppressive. His cigar had gone out, too.



"Yes," he said. "I saw that writing. I read it. I left
it so that when you came in you couldn't miss it. I did these
things because       of what I've seen."



"Seen?" Again the millionaire's eyes lifted in the other's
direction. It was only for a second. They were back again
in an instant, staring beyond the blotting-sheet.



"Yes. It was soon after Mrs. Hendrie came here. You
had gone away with the automobile. She wanted a buggy
and team. She wanted to study the country and people
she was living among. She was away all day. That night
I went into Everton. I came to the ford. Guess I heard
voices beyond the bluff that separated me from it. One was
Mrs. Hendrie's."



"The other?"



"A man's."



Angus paused. The oppressiveness of the room almost
stifled him.



"They had spent the day together. The woman was saying
what a great time they'd had together. She was arranging
when she would see him again. They parted. I heard
them kiss each other."



Hendrie swung his chair slowly round. He was smiling.
Angus was alarmed. For the first time in his life he experienced
a sensation of fear of another man.



"They       kissed?"



There was no emotion in the millionaire's voice. He might
have been asking a question of merely ordinary interest.



Angus nodded.



"Yes," he said. "I heard them. I wasn't mistaken, I'm
dead sure. Then they parted. Mrs. Hendrie got back
across the ford, on to the lower trail with the buggy. The
man traipsed on to the hotel. I saw him. It was the man
who registers there as 'Frank Smith.'"



"A big man, with thick, fair hair, and       a good-looker?"



Hendrie detailed the description as though registering
it in his memory, and comparing it with a picture already
there.



"Yes."



"Anything else?"



The millionaire reached for a match and relit his cigar.



"Only this business of going to Calford       with you away.
That on top of the writing. That writing was done last
night, I guess, and Mrs. Hendrie has mailed no letter since.
Maybe she's taken it with her. Maybe she's going to meet
him there. Maybe I'm only guessing, but I thought it time
you       knew 'bout things."



Angus breathed a sigh. He had done all he intended to
do, and now he       wondered.



The millionaire was searching his face with his cold,
keen eyes, but he was still smiling. It was that smile
which Angus feared. However, he faced the scrutiny,
watching the upward curling of the smoke from the
other's cigar, while he relit and puffed a little unsteadily at
his own.



"Well?" he said, after a long silence.



Hendrie withdrew his gaze and turned to his desk again.



"Better not cancel the car. I'll need it after all."



Angus rose.



"That all?"



Hendrie reached for a pen, and dipped it in the ink as
though about to write. He replied without looking up.



"That's all."



Angus moved toward the door. As he reached it the
millionaire's voice stopped him.



"Angus!"



The manager turned. Across the room he beheld a pair
of glowing eyes fixed upon him. He saw nothing else. They
seemed to occupy his entire focus, devouring him with their
merciless stare.



"If what you've told me is not true I'll       kill you."



The words were quietly spoken. They were spoken too
quietly. They came coldly to the departing man, and like
an icy blast they left him shivering. He knew they were
meant, not as a mere expression of anger, but literally. He
knew that this man would have no scruples, no mercy. No
one who had offended need expect mercy from him       not
even the wife whom he knew he loved above all things in
the world.



"They are true," he returned.



The basilisk eyes passed out of his focus as Hendrie's
head bent over the paper before him.



"We shall see."





As the door softly closed behind the manager, Hendrie
flung his pen down upon the writing-pad. He sat back in
his chair, and his eyes stared in the direction of the closed
door.



He sat quite still. His hard face had lost no color, there
was not a sign of emotion in it. His cold eyes gazed on a
dead level at       nothing. Never was there an exhibition of
more perfect outward control of a storming brain within.
He was thinking, thinking with the lightning rapidity of the
perfect machinery of a powerful brain. He was thinking
along lines all wholly unexplored and new to him, and such
was his concentrative power that no feelings were permitted
to confuse the flow.



His whole future was at stake. His whole life. Everything       everything
that mattered.



The time passed rapidly. Still that silent figure sat on.
The automobile was brought round, and a servant announced
it. It was kept waiting.



What agony of mind and heart Alexander Hendrie went
through as he sat there in his splendid library none would
ever know. That hell had opened before his startled eyes,
that the wounded heart within him had received a mortal
blow, there could be no possible doubt. But his sufferings
were his own. He had all the brute nature in him which
sends a dying animal to the remotenesses of the forest, where
no eyes can witness its sufferings, where it may yield up its
savage spirit beyond the reach of the pity and sympathy of
its fellow-creatures.






CHAPTER XV



PROGRESS OF AFFAIRS



Angus Moraine had done his work. That his motive in
enlightening his employer upon those matters which went on
in his absence was largely spleenful, even revengeful, there
could be no doubt. But, curiously enough, he had kept to
the baldest truth. He had neither exaggerated nor invented.
Perhaps he had felt that there was no need for
either. As he marshaled his facts they were so complete, so
entirely damning, that it is doubtful if imagination would
have served his purpose better. In spite of Hendrie's threat
against his life he was well enough satisfied with the effect
of his story upon his employer.



Later on, when Hendrie finally departed, he was still
more satisfied; for it was then, as the latter paced the broad,
flagged terrace fronting the entrance to the house, he had
walked at his side for more than half an hour, receiving final
instructions, and listening to some necessary details of future
plans.



Hendrie was going away, and Angus was to inform his
wife, when she returned from Calford, that he did not expect
to return for at least two weeks. In the meantime he
gave his manager a telephone number in Gleber! This
number would find him at any time, after his wife's return
from Calford. Further, he told him that the only message
he required from him was news of Mr. Frank Smith's reappearance
in Everton. He did not know, as a matter of
fact, that he would want it at all, but it must be sent. Furthermore,
on Mr. Frank Smith's reappearance in Everton,
Angus must hold himself on hand at the Russell Hotel.



"See here," Hendrie concluded, in his concise fashion.
"You'll need to be on hand at any moment while this man's
around. And       you must know his movements to the last
detail. Get me?"



Angus understood. Nor had he forgotten the coldly delivered
threat in the library.



"Well," the other went on, with a calmness that was still
the marvel of the Scot, "guess I'll get going. I'm going
right on to Calford to meet Mrs. Hendrie. She'd be disappointed
if I didn't look her up, having missed her here. So
long."



Hendrie entered the waiting car, and the two men parted
without a sign of that which lay between them. Angus
watched the machine roll away down the winding trail, which
followed the bend of the picturesque river bank. Then, as
it disappeared from view, he turned thoughtfully away, and
moved off in the direction of his quarters.



His years of association with the millionaire had taught
him much that the world did not know of that individual's
character. There were times, even, when he believed he
knew all there was to know of it. There were other times
when he was not so sure; just as there were times when some
trifling detail brought out a trait that was entirely new to
him. At such times he was wont to admit that the man was
unfathomable. That is what he admitted to himself now.
What did he contemplate? What subtle scheme was in the
back of his great head? There was some definite purpose,
he felt sure; some definite and, perhaps, deadly purpose.
And it was demanded of him to play his part in it, not with
eyes wide open, and with full understanding. But blindly
groping       in the dark.



He thought for long as he sat in his office. He considered
every detail of the instructions he had received. But the
ultimate object of them eluded him. However, his mind
was made up from the outset. Come what may, his life was
bound up with the life of this man. He would follow him
whithersoever he led, and, since it was necessary       blindly.





The supper-room in the Strathmore Hotel at Calford was
a blaze of light. The string band, screened off behind a
decorative display of palms and ferns, was playing the latest
and most popular ragtime. But the room, with its hundred
tables, was less than half full, in spite of the important agricultural
congress that was being held in this capital of the
wheat lands.



The truth was that the late meal was always at an
awkward hour in the hotels which catered for a wealthy
transient custom. The east and west-bound mails met at
Calford at eleven-thirty at night, just at the time when most
of the hotel guests were either preparing to start, or transacting
the last few details of their business before departing
on their transcontinental journeys.



But Monica was delighted at this absence of a crowd.
For her, it was one of those happy, utterly unanticipated
moments in life which are too precious to miss. Just as she
had retired to her room after dinner, a chambermaid had
announced the arrival of her husband.



Her journey had been taken quite openly. There had
been no secrecy about it. She was here purely on business,
the nature of which was her own. Therefore she had nothing
to fear, and was frankly overjoyed at this unexpected reunion.



Alexander Hendrie was in his best spirits. He explained
to her his journey to Deep Willows, and his subsequent disappointment
at not finding her there. Then, hearing that
she had driven over to Calford, he had followed her at once.
The journey, he explained, suited his purpose well, for he
must leave by the night mail for Winnipeg, and did not
anticipate returning home for ten days, or even two weeks.



So Monica spent a happy evening with her husband. His
manner was the brightest she had ever known. He never
questioned her presence in Calford, but took it for granted
she was "doing" the stores. He talked to her of his work
and informed her of the progress of the Trust. His hopes
and fears he talked of unreservedly, and Monica felt that
never was a woman so blessed with the perfect confidence of
such a husband.



Thus the brief evening was spent until the final meal of
the day came round. Monica required nothing more to eat,
and suggested that her husband's meal should be served in
her sitting-room. But Hendrie demurred, and it was finally
arranged that they should adjourn to the supper-room,
where Monica could partake of an oyster cocktail, while he
fortified himself against his journey.



As the meal drew to a close, and the man leisurely sipped
his coffee, he expressed his cordial regrets at his prolonged
absences from home.



"It'll soon be over, Mon," he said thoughtfully. "I can
see the end of things looming already. Such separations as
ours are not good, are they? I shall be glad when       things
are settled."



Monica gazed happily into his steady eyes.



"I'm simply yearning for that time to come, Alec," she
cried, her eyes shining across the table into his. "But these
separations will soon pass," she went on hopefully, "now
that I am going to be so busy. Do you know, I don't think
Angus thinks I'm capable of running the farm? But I'm
just going to show him that I am."



Hendrie's eyes looked a swift inquiry.



"Has he said so       to you?" he asked.



Monica remembered in time. She had no desire to injure
the man.



"Oh, no," she declared. "Only       only       I don't think he
trusts me. I don't think he has much of an opinion of
women."



At that moment a waiter approached.



"The east-bound mail has been signaled, Mr. Hendrie.
She's due in twenty minutes."



"Thanks." Hendrie nodded and turned to Monica.



"Angus is a curious fellow       but he's very loyal to me.
He would never do anything he considered detrimental to
my interests, and he'd surely see that no one else did. I
don't know about his opinions of women, but"       he smiled       "I
think he's sore at leaving the farm."



Monica nodded and smiled.



"I'm sure he is," she said, as they rose from the table.



They passed out into the vestibule where a man stood
waiting to assist the millionaire to the train.



"However, Mon," Hendrie said, smiling inscrutably. "I
don't think you'll find any lack of attention or consideration
on Moraine's part during my present absence. I've left
him definite instructions to help you in your study of the
farm. It's my wish you see everything carried out in the
work. And I've told him so. I don't guess he'll make any
mistake. And you, Mon       I want you to learn it all. Even
if things sometimes come amiss, or       or at awkward times,
and inconvenience you. I want you to promise me all this,
too."



Monica smiled joyously.



"Promise? Why, of course, Alec," she cried. "Why, if
I have to turn out in the middle of the night it will be no
great hardship."



"Splendid." Hendrie smiled, but his eyes avoided the
woman's. "Well, now       good-bye," he said, and held out his
hand.



For a moment Monica hesitated. Then she remembered
where she was, and they shook hands like two friends.



"Good-bye       dear," she murmured.



A moment later the waiter was enveloping Hendrie in his
light traveling coat.



With a nod and a wave of the hand he hastily followed
the man, and made his way through the revolving door,
which was the hotel entrance to the railroad depot.



Monica looked after him, feeling a little depressed. It
was the first time since her marriage that her husband had
left her with a formal parting. She knew it could not have
been otherwise in the vestibule of a busy hotel. It would
have been different had they supped in private       ah, well,
soon there would be no such partings as these.





In contrast to the brilliant surroundings of the Strathmore
Hotel the humble homestead over which Phyllis Raysun
reigned was a crude, even squalid affair. Poverty was
stamped all over it, that is, if lack of worldly possessions and
general dilapidation must be taken as the hallmark of
poverty.



Phyllis did not admit such to be the case. She claimed
a wealth which she would not have exchanged for the lot
of a royal princess. She was a healthy, happy girl, loving
and beloved, and she admitted she could ask no more of the
perfect life in the midst of which she found herself.



For her mother's occasional grumbles she would adapt her
mental attitude to a different focus. That weak but amiable
creature had different views. She had lived through that
life Phyllis was only just beginning, and therefore the golden
focus of youth was dimmed, and the buoyant hope of younger
life had resolved itself into a yearning for all those bodily
comforts which had somehow passed her by.



At such times when her mother's bitterness and complaint
found expression, Phyllis, with her ready understanding,
sought to comfort her, to encourage her. Some such desire
stirred her on a morning when a neighbor brought her a
letter from Frank. It was a letter passed on from hand to
hand, across country, without the service of the mail. Frank
would be over at the midday meal, and Mrs. Raysun was
deploring the poverty of their larder, as she prepared a stew
at the cook stove in their only living-room.



"It makes me fair ashamed, Phyl," the old woman cried
in distress, as she cut up the mixture of vegetables for the
simmering pot. "It surely does. To think of your beau
comin' over to a meal like this. And him a college-bred boy,
with elegant manners, and with a ma with thousands o'
dollars. I kind o' feel the shame's all on me       your mother."



Phyllis laughed in her buoyant fashion.



"Is it, momma?" she cried. "Where? How? Oh, you
dear old       old goose. If I was a princess with all the world
mine, and I gave half of it to Frank, I shouldn't be giving
him any more than       that stew. The best we've got is
Frank's, and we sure can't do more. And," she added tenderly,
"I guess Frank wouldn't want more." Then she
smiled slyly. "Frank would rather have one of your stews
here than oysters on the half shell in any other house."



"House? House, my dear? Call this hog pen a       house?"
cried Pleasant, a flush of shame dyeing her plump cheeks.



"It's a palace       to Frank and me       when we're eating
your stew in it. Yes, momma, and the meal's a banquet.
Oh, don't you see, dear? We're just two silly folks up to
our eyes in love with each other, and       and nothing matters.
Listen, momma. Frank's getting his money right away.
He's located his farm, and he's going to buy it in a week or
two. We're going to get married, and       and we're going to
move to the new farm just as soon as we've harvested our
crops here       all of us. You, too. It's a swell house, just
what you like. And we're going to have 'hands' to work
for us, and Frank's fairy godmother looking on and helping
us to be as happy as happy. Oh, momma, we won't grumble
a thing. Just let's remember that we've got to do our best
in whatever lot we find ourselves."



Pleasant Raysun could never resist her daughter's bright
hope for long. The girl never failed to put fresh heart into
her. Like all weak natures, she needed the constant support
of a heart stronger than her own. Phyllis understood this,
and the support was never begrudged, never withheld.



Nor was the girl's declaration lacking in confirmation
when Frank appeared. He had lost the last vestige of any
outward signs of the shame he believed attached to him
through his birth. Here again it was Phyllis who had dispelled
the ugly clouds which had threatened to envelop and
stifle him.



Now, as he came, he sniffed the air pervading the kitchen
with appreciation, and Phyllis smiled across at her mother.



"I didn't know I was hungry until now," he declared. "It
surely was a bright thought of mine letting you two know
ahead I was coming, Phyl. I bet five dollars it's a jackrabbit
stew. Any takers?"



He looked from one to the other with his happy, open
face, all smiles. Then, as Phyllis shook her head, he pretended
disappointment.



"No luck," he said, with an absurd air of dejection.



The girl admonished him in the lightest spirit of raillery.



"You don't want it all       the luck, I mean, not the stew,"
she said severely. "Anyway, you're not getting the stew
yet. Momma's particular how long it cooks."



"Not for nigh an hour," smiled Pleasant from the stove.



"Then I'll tighten my belt like a starving explorer," cried
the boy.



The old woman turned about, and waved a tin spoon at
them both.



"If you're that hungry you can't wait, Frank Burton, I
guess Phyl'd better take you out to the barn an' feed you
hay. There's more than hosses and cattle eats hay."



Phyllis laughed.



"There you are, Frank. That's deadly insult. What you
going to do 'bout it? Do you hear what momma's calling
you?"



The youth fingered one ear ruefully.



"They must have grown some," he said doubtfully. Then
he looked up with a laugh. "Guess maybe she's right,
though. Come on, Phyl, sweet hay's not half bad fodder for
a hungry               Say, if you come right along, I'll tell you all
about the farm while I eat it. How's that?"



Phyllis needed no second bidding, and, together, they
passed out of the kitchen.



It was a favorite place of theirs to sit outside the low
doorway of the sod-built barn. An old log served the girl as
a resting place, and the huge youth spread himself on the
ground beside her, propping his elbow on the same log, so
that his tawny head was nearly on a level with her rounded
shoulder.



"Phyl," he cried, as soon as they were settled, "mother's
a       a trump. It's all fixed. I've given old Sam Bernard
notice I'm quitting. The old boy's hard hit       in a way. I
believe he likes me some. I told him I'd come along back and
help him harvest. And I'm going to help you harvest, too.
But that's afterwards. First I'm going to see mother and
get the money, then I'm going to buy the farm. Then I'm
going to see certain things put in readiness for fall work.
Then I'm coming along back here, and we're going right in
to Calford to buy up fixings for our new home. Then, after
harvest, we're       going to get married. How?"



Phyllis smiled down into the eager, upturned face, with
that wise motherly little smile which was so much a part of
her attitude toward those belonging to her, those she loved.



"How? Why, then you're going to come right down to
earth and say it all over again," she said, with gentle eagerness.
"Say it all again, Frank, and say it slowly. I       I
don't want to miss any of it. It's all       all too good to miss.
Oh, I'm so happy I want to laugh and cry at the same time.
I       I want to take the whole world in my arms and hug it."



"Won't I do?" suggested the young giant, sitting up
promptly.



The girl nodded demurely.



"Perhaps, as       a substitute."



She bent over him, and placing her arms about his great
neck kissed him very tenderly.



She sighed as she released him.



"Now let's be sensible," she said soberly. "Now tell it
me all again."



She was promptly obeyed. But again Frank's enthusiasm
took hold of him, and he poured out in a rapid flow all his
hopes of their future. He ran over in brief review the many
trifling schemes he had already worked out in conjunction
with the running of their new farm. He rattled on over numberless
developments he proposed. He told her of the beautiful
red pine frame farm buildings, which must have cost as
much to build as he was paying for the whole place. He
spoke of the acres of splendid timber in glowing terms.
Then there was the river frontage, and, yes       actually       the
outcrop of a coal seam was jutting right out of its bank.



When he had finished, the girl's delight was shining in her
eyes.



"And       and when am I going to see it all?" she asked, as
he paused for breath.



The man's fair face flushed and beamed.



"Ah," he cried, "that's what I've been saving up. I never
suggested your seeing it before, Phyl, because       because              " his
eyes became thoughtful, "well       I didn't just want
to take a risk. You see, I was 'most afraid something might
happen to queer things. Guess I wouldn't disappoint you
for worlds. I'd a notion to wait till there was no chance of
anything going wrong with the deal. Say, you're going
with me to pay the money       you and your mother. Then
we're going on to see the farm."



The girl did not answer. She was gazing out at the barren
sky-line, all her happy soul shining in the wonderful light
of her eyes. Mutely she was thanking God for the love of
this man, thanking Him for the wonderful blessings He was
pouring upon her. Whatever else might come in the long
years of life before her, the memory of this moment would
live with her to her dying day. She was very       very happy.



After a while she drew a deep sigh, and, reaching out,
pointed away to the distant lines where the sharp horizon of
the prairie cut across the sky.



"Look!" she cried, in a thrilling voice. "Look, Frank,
over there in the East! There's not a cloud anywhere. It's
bright, bright. The sky's just blue with a wonderful color
that shines down upon a thankful world, watching and waiting
for the harvest. We're waiting for the harvest, too.
Perhaps ours isn't just the same harvest other folks are
waiting for. Maybe ours is the harvest of our souls. Let
it be an omen to us. Just as it is the omen the farmer looks
for. It kind of seems to me all blessings come from yonder.
Guess that's where the sun rises, bringing with it the hope
of the world. Hope and light. Yes, it kind of seems to me
everything good comes out of the East. That's how the
Bible tells us. We don't look west till afternoon, the afternoon
of life. That's because it's full of       decay. That's
where a tired sun just hangs heavily in the sky. A poor old
sun, looking kind of sad and weary. It's got so busy making
folks happy in the morning that its plumb beat, and can't
help itself against those banks of black cloud all fixed up
with deep angry light, trying to deceive the poor old thing,
and make it believe they aren't just going to swallow it right
up, and stifle it, and put out its light. No, this is still our
morning, so we'll look out east for all the good things to
come. It's very, very bright."



Frank mechanically followed the direction of the girl's
happy eyes. But his own feelings, though no less happy and
thankful, had no such means of expression.



"Yes," he said lamely. "It is bright, isn't it?"



"Bright?" The shining eyes looked down into his handsome
 face, and again they smiled with that sweet, motherly
tenderness. "Yes, dear."



Her simple agreement set the other racking his brains to
let her understand that he appreciated her mood. He
flushed as he reached for one of her hands and squeezed it.



"That's how I want to make it for you       always," he said,
with clumsy sincerity. "Just sunshine. We mustn't have
clouds."



The girl shook her head.



"But we must, dear," she said decidedly. "Say, Frank,
just think what life would be without them." Her manner
had once more drifted into that curious earnestness that sat
so oddly upon one of her years and happy temperament.
"Think of it. A whole long life spent in the glaring light of
a summer's day. It couldn't be done, Frank. It sure
couldn't. That way there'd be no sort of hope, no sort of
ambition, and       and our hearts would be all wilted up with a
terrible sickness. No, we want clouds, too       in their season.
Do you know, Frank, it's just in the dark, dark clouds that
hope hides itself. No clouds, no hope. And hope's just what
we live on. Happiness helps to make us strong, but too much
happiness would be the worst misery."



The youth beside her sat up.



"Phyl," he cried, helpless, "you do know an awful lot.
Say              " But Phyllis laughed and shook her head.



"I know I'm dreadfully happy," she cried. Then she gazed
seriously into his eyes. "Tell me, Frank, doesn't it make
you think       notions when you're dreadful happy?"



The other shook his head.



"I just feel       happy," he said. "That's all."



"It does me," Phyllis cried rapturously. "And it's times
like this that I just want to know       know       know, until there's
not a thing left       to know. Do you know, sometimes I've
a sort of crazy notion, there's some one       big       trying to
teach me lots an lots. He often seems to be around       'specially
when I'm not out plowing. I'm mostly happy then.
It's somebody very big       and wide       and he's always whispering
to me       just as if he was in the air of these plains              "



Frank threw out one great hand to stay her. A sudden
inspiration had penetrated his simple mind.



"I know," he cried, breaking in quickly. "That's not       somebody.
That's you. That's you, Phyl." He drew himself
up on to his knees in the excitement of his discovery.
"That's your soul talking to you, Phyl. It's feeling so good
it must tell you 'bout things. I know. I've had it. And you
sort of listen and listen, and you       you just know what it
says is       is right. And you don't need any one to tell you it
isn't, because       because you know it is              "



"Ho! you two folks, the stew's through!"



Frank swung round at the sound of Mrs. Raysun's voice
calling, and he flushed self-consciously as he realized the
ridiculousness of his attitude. Phyl sprang from her seat
and, catching hold of his great hand, helped him to his feet.



"Come along, dear," she cried, smiling merrily. "Momma's
stews are too good to keep waiting, even if our souls want
to tell us a whole heap that is good for us to know."



Then, as they walked side by side toward the house, she
drew a deep breath.



"Heigho!" she sighed. "And to think in a few weeks we'll
have left all this behind us for a lovely, lovely farm of our
own       a beautiful frame house       folks working for us and       and
money in the bank. Say, Frank, isn't it a beautiful
world? It surely is       some world."






CHAPTER XVI



IN THE MOONLIGHT



Angus Moraine flung down his pen impatiently. Leaning
back in his chair he turned toward the sunlit window, gazing
through it at the distant view of golden wheat as a man will
who seeks relief from intolerable thought.



His thought was intolerable. It was growing more and
more intolerable as the days passed and the time drew on
when he must hand Deep Willows over to his successor.



All the best years of his life had been spent in the making
of Deep Willows. All his energy, all that was best in him;
these things had been given freely, without stint, without
thought of sparing himself in the work, and he believed the
result to be a worthy achievement.



But it was not yet finished. He doubted if it would ever
be finished. He had dreamed his dreams, and those dreams
had carried him into realms of such colossal fancy that he
knew, if he lived to a hundred, the time would be wholly
inadequate for the fulfilment of his ambitions.



The wealth which must inevitably come in the process of
the achievement he had set himself was not the goal he desired
to win. He admitted the use of such wealth, and knew that
without it the rest must fall to the ground. But his dream
was of achievement alone. He had no desire to be remembered
for the fortune he had amassed. His absorbing passion
was to be thought of, by coming generations, for an achievement
unlike that of any other.



Deep Willows was the nucleus about which he had hoped
to build his edifice. Vaguely he saw it the center of a world
of wheat. He imagined the whole prairie lands of Canada
clad in the golden raiment of a perfect wheat harvest. Not
merely a farm, but a country of wheat, acknowledging a
single control. Nor did it matter to him whose the control
so long as his was the making.



This was his dream and now       he saw it fading before his
very eyes at the whim of the man he had so long and so
faithfully served. The thought of it was intolerable. Sometimes,
even, rebellion choked all his friendship, all his loyalty
to the man who had made something of the realization of his
dreams possible.



But there was just one shadow of hope left to him. It
was very slight, very vague, and he hardly understood
whither it led, he hardly knew if it were worth serious consideration
at all. But the feeling was there; nor would it be
denied. If only he knew what far-reaching scheme, with regard
to his wife, lay in the back of Hendrie's great head he
might feel easier. But he did not know, and, until such
schemes were put into practice, he was not likely to know.
Still the fact remained; Mrs. Hendrie had been appointed his
successor, and, since that appointment, she had fallen from
her high place in her husband's regard, or, at least, was tottering
on her exalted pedestal.



The thought gave him some slight satisfaction. If       if
only something would happen in time. If       only. He felt at
that moment he would willingly give half his possessions to
be able to search the hidden recesses of Hendrie's secret
thought and find out for certain       what was going to happen.



He sighed and stirred restlessly, and, as he did so, a horseman
rode past the window and pulled up at his door. Then
Angus Moraine did something quite contrary to his rule. He
rose swiftly from his chair, and, crossing the room hastily,
flung open the door. The horseman was a special messenger
he had sent into Everton.



The man was one of his foremen, a young Swede to whom
he generally entrusted any confidential duty.



"Well, Jan?" he demanded, with something like cordiality,
as the man flung out of the saddle.



The Swede dived one hand into the bosom of his loose
cotton shirt.



"One letter, boss," he replied, producing an ordinary
business envelope.



"Ah. Anything else?" There was eagerness in Angus's
inquiry as he took the letter and read the address in Hendrie's
handwriting.



"Guess I took a peek at the hotel register," Jan replied at
once.



"Yes?" There was a further quickening of interest in the
manager's tone.



"I see the name you wanted. Frank Smith. Guess he
registered in at dinner time."



The narrow eyes of the Scot lit.



"At dinner time?"



"Yep. That's how it was marked. Say              "



"Well?"



"He's a tall guy. Sort o' tow hair. Young. Maybe
round about twenty?"



Angus nodded.



"Then I see him, too. He was sittin' in the office."



"Good."



There was no doubt as to Moraine's approval now, and
Jan felt he had done well.



"Anything else, boss?" he inquired confidently.



Angus remained thinking for some seconds. Then he
shook his head.



"Nothing," he said finally.



The Swede mounted his horse. As he was about to ride
off Angus detained him.



"Send me over my horse," he said casually. "After that
you best get around and see they're setting those 'smudge'
fires right. We're going to get a chill to-night. We must
do what we can to keep the frost out of the crops."



The man rode off, and Angus turned back into his office.



The manager's mood had entirely changed for the better.
A sense of elation had replaced the desperate irritation of a
few moments before. Was something going to happen at last?
It almost looked like it. Frank Smith had registered at Everton,
and here was a letter from Hendrie. A letter. It was
not Hendrie's way to write letters with the telegraph handy,
and the telephone to his hand. He sat down and tore the
envelope open.



It contained eight closely written sheets of very thin paper,
and Angus smiled as he realized the writer's purpose. The
envelope had appeared quite thin. There had been nothing
about it to attract attention from the curious.



Straightening out the sheets he settled himself to the perusal
of his chief's letter. It was very long, and full of
carefully detailed instructions. Furthermore, it was dated at
Gleber, and it also informed him of Frank Smith's arrival in
Everton! But these things were only a tithe of what the
letter told him. It told him so much that his whole interest
was fully engrossed, and a curious wonder at the man who
had written it stirred within him. With his first reading of
the letter a wild hope leaped within him, and, by the time he
had finished his second reading, he realized that he need have
no further fears of being banished from Deep Willows.



The "something" he had longed for had happened. The
scheming mind of Alexander Hendrie had revealed itself to
him. After all, fortune was with him, and it was only necessary
for him to carry out the instructions set out in the letter
for everything to be as he wished.



But there was no time to indulge in the pleasurable reaction
inspired by his letter. His orders were imperative and
demanded prompt attention. Therefore he refolded the
pages and bestowed them safely. Then, when his horse arrived,
he set out at once in the direction of Everton.





Angus Moraine's fears of a summer frost looked like being
realized. The night closed down brilliantly fine, with a
threatening chill pervading the air. There was no wind, and
this was significant. To the weatherwise the sudden dropping
of the thermometer was possible at any moment, and
the farming world might easily awaken on the morrow to find
the harvest prospects destroyed, and the highest grade
wheat reduced to something little better than fodder for
hogs.



The full moon shone down upon the golden world with a
steely gleam upon its cold face, leaving the starry sheet of a
cloudless sky rendered almost invisible. It was a dreadfully
perfect night, one that might suit lovers, might inspire the
romantic, but was anathema to those who lived by the produce
of the soil.



The village of Everton was very still and silent amid the
woodland shadows in which it lay. The little wooden houses
were in darkness, and no sign of life was visible anywhere,
except at the hotel, where the yellow lamplight still battled
feebly with the overwhelming rays of the brilliant summer
moon.



At that moment the whole world seemed to be slumbering
peacefully, in the full confidence that no disturbing elements
were abroad. Peace       a wonderful peace, such as is only
known in close contact with the soil, seemed to reign everywhere.
But the mind and heart of man rarely shares in
Nature's gentler moods. In waking hours the great battle of
life is always raging, and in sleep, restless dreaming pursues
its victim. There is little enough of peace for striving
humanity.



It was nearly ten o'clock when the glass door of the hotel
was pushed open, and a tall man stood gazing out into the
brilliant night. The doorway was narrow, and he almost
entirely filled it up. The yellow lamplight from behind shone
dully upon his fair, bare head, and the cold moonlight shed
an artificial pallor upon his good-looking face.



He stood for some moments thus, and his expression was
scarcely happy. He seemed lost in some thought which gave
him little enough pleasure. Presently he stirred and thrust
the prairie hat he held in his hand upon his head, and drew
the brim well down over his eyes. Then with a hunch of the
shoulders, the deliberate movement as of a man spurring
himself to an unpleasant task, he stepped from the doorway
out into the full light of the moon.



He strode off down the trail, white in the brilliant light,
at the rapid, swinging gait of one whose destination is definite,
and who is anxious to reach it with as little delay as
possible.



Presently the woodland bluff in the direction of the river
swallowed him up, and even the faint sound of his rapid footsteps
became lost in the silence that seemed to close over him.



Scarcely had the last sound of his retreating steps died
out when the door of a near-by house opened and a man
stepped out on to the veranda. This house, like its fellows, was
in darkness. Nor was there any light by which to judge his
appearance, but that which was shed by the moon. However,
this revealed his size, which was much above the average, and
showed him to be a man of years and full proportions.



He waited for a moment, gazing about him, then, as another
figure appeared round the side of the hotel, he quickly
left his veranda and hurried across the intervening space to
join the newcomer.



After a few moments' earnest conversation they, too, set
off down the trail. But whereas the first man's movements
were devoid of any attempt at concealment, these two moved
cautiously, even furtively, as though they had no desire for
recognition.



Finally the woodland bluff swallowed them up, and all was
still again.



But it was not for long. Within ten minutes the hotel
door was again thrust open. This time the figure that appeared
was a perfectly familiar one. It was Angus Moraine,
and he was accompanied by the proprietor of the place.
There was apparently nothing unusual about him, except a
marked cordiality. He might simply have been terminating
his customary evening visit of recreation, for, as he appeared
a "hand" brought his horse round from the barn, and stood
awaiting the manager's pleasure to mount.



But for once Angus kept him waiting. His cordial mood
would not permit of a hurried departure, and he stood talking
to his companion for some moments.



"I certainly should think about it, Sharpe," he said earnestly.
"Guess I'm not a feller given to slinging hot air.
I'd start to build quick. Be first. When a place begins to
boom you want to be right there, and       collar the trade before
other folks get busy. You want to be the leading hotel,
and if my help in the way of patronage and recommendation
is worth anything to you       why you can have it."



Lionel K. Sharpe listened eagerly.



"It's real kind of you, Mr. Moraine," he said warmly.
"But I'm guessin'' it's a matter of capital. If this place is to
boom              "



"Capital?" Angus snorted. "Pshaw, man! It's nothing
to raise the capital."



"No       o." The hotel keeper looked dubious. Then he
brightened. "Say, maybe you don't fancy comin' in on the
deal yourself, Mr. Moraine?" He eyed his guest shrewdly.



The next moment he received a shock. Angus laughed.
And his laugh was the most cordial thing Lionel K. Sharpe
ever remembered to have heard emanate from the manager of
Deep Willows.



"Why, I hadn't thought of it," that individual declared,
when his mirth had subsided. Then he became quite serious.
"Say, it's not a bad idea though. You see, I'm here a sort of
fixture for life, and I guess it wouldn't be half a bad scheme
putting my odd cents into a bright enterprise in Everton.
Why, yes, I'll think it over, Sharpe, I'll surely think it over."



He stepped from the porch and took his horse from the
patient "hired" man, who promptly vanished to his rest in
the harness room of the barn. He sprang lightly into the
saddle.



"That's a good notion, Sharpe," Angus went on, as he
gathered up the reins. "Guess we'd run a cracking hotel
together. Well, so long. We'll talk it over later. So long."



He turned his horse about and set off down the trail, and,
in a few moments, he, too, was swallowed up by the woodland
shadows.






CHAPTER XVII



PAYING THE PRICE



The sumptuous library at Deep Willows held a great fascination
for Monica. She used it in her solitary moments, during
her husband's absences, more than any other living-room
in the great house. Perhaps the attraction was the suggestion
of office which the beautifully carved mahogany desk
gave it. There was the great safe, too, let deep into the wall
just behind it, with its disguising simple mahogany door.
There were the elaborate filing drawers, and various other
appurtenances necessary in a room where business was transacted.
Perhaps these things helped to remind her of other
days, days that had been often troublesome, but, nevertheless,
of a memory that was very dear.



But the official atmosphere of the room was very limited.
There was nothing official in the bookcases lining the walls,
containing their hundreds of volumes of modern and classical
literature. There was nothing suggestive of commerce in the
bronzes and marble statuary which adorned the various antique
plinths and pedestals. And the pictures, too, modern
certainly, but both oil and water colors were by the best living
masters. Nor were the priceless Persian rugs the floor
coverings one would expect to find on an office floor.



Monica loved the room. There was the character of the
man she loved peeping out from every corner at her, every
shelf of the bookcases. There was a simple, direct, almost
severe style about the place, which reminded her so much of
the strength of the man who had taken possession of her soul.



Something of this was in her thought as she sat there in
a comfortable rocker on this particular night. A book was
in her lap, but she was not reading. There was too much
rioting through her busy brain for her to devour the translation
of a stodgy, obscure Greek classic. She had taken the
book from its place almost at haphazard, as women sometimes
will, and her sincere purpose had been to read it. But her
purpose lacked the necessary inclination, the moment the
cover had been opened.



She made a beautiful picture sitting there in the soft lamplight.
Her elaborately simple evening gown was delightfully
seductive, and the light upon her fair face surmounted by its
crown of waving hair completed an attraction few men could
have resisted. The years had left no trace of their rapid
passing in her outward seeming, unless it were in the added
beauty of her perfect figure. She was happy, very, very
happy, and to-night even more so than usual.



To-night! Ah, yes, she had reason to be happy to-night.
Was it not the night when the culmination of so many little
plans of hers was to be reached? Little plans that had for
their inception the purest affection, the most tender loyalty
to the dead as well as the living? Monica was a woman to
draw the most perfect happiness from such feelings. The
mainspring of her whole nature was a generous kindliness, an
earnest desire for all that belonged to the better side of life.
She knew that she was about to launch two young people
upon the great rough sea of life, and the thought that her
hand was to pour the calming oil about their little craft was
something quite exquisite to one of her nature.



Her gaze wandered across at the mahogany door of the
safe, and she smiled as she thought that behind it lay the
oil awaiting her distribution. From the safe her eyes passed
on to the clock upon the desk. Its hands were nearing midnight.
She was glad. They could not move fast enough for
her just now.



The whole house was silent. The servants had long since
retired; even her maid, that stickler for her duties, had been
satisfactorily dismissed for the night. Angus had returned.
She had just heard him ride past the house on his way to
hand over his horse to the sleepy stable hand awaiting him.
There was nothing       nothing at all to interfere with her               Hark!



She started from her seat and darted across to the heavy
curtains drawn over the French window, which she had purposely
left open. The sound of steps approaching had
reached her. She stood for a moment with hands ready to
draw the curtains aside. Then she flung them open, and, with
a low exclamation, embraced the fair-haired young giant
who stepped in through the window.



"Frank, oh, Frank," she cried. "My dearest, dearest boy.
I'm so thankful you've come. I knew you wouldn't fail me
in spite of       of what you said in your letter."



The young man gently released himself, and glanced back
shamefacedly at the curtains which had closed behind him.



"That's just it, mother," he said, his honest face flushing.
"I       I just hate this backdoor business. Oh, I know it's all
right," he went on, as Monica shook her head. "I know
there's nothing wrong in it. How can there be? You are my
mother. It's not that. It's the feeling it gives me. You
don't know how mean it makes me feel."



"Of course it does, dear," Monica said soothingly. "It is
like you to feel that way. You have always been the soul of
honor, and you feel like a criminal stealing into another
man's house. But you are not trespassing, my dear. Don't
you understand? You are entering a house to which you
have every right. Is it not my home, and am I not your
mother?"



"Yes, yes," the man broke in, almost impatiently. "That's
where the trouble comes. You are my mother. What if       if I
were discovered? What if              ?"



Just for a moment a slight look of alarm shadowed Monica's
eyes. In the joy at seeing her boy again she had lost
sight of the risk this visit really entailed. But she recovered
herself quickly, and protested with a lightness she did not
really feel.



"Don't let's think of it. Alec is away, and the whole household
is in bed and asleep. The last person to go to bed here
is Angus Moraine, and he came in from town a few minutes
ago. So              "



"Angus Moraine?" Frank raised his brows inquiringly.
"He was at the hotel. I saw him there. I have seen him
often, and       I don't think I like him."



Monica smiled as she walked across to the safe.



"Sit down at that desk, dear," she said happily, "while I
hand you a wedding present, birthday present, coming of age
present, all rolled into one. Talking of Angus, I don't think
I like him either. But there, we two are very much the same
in our likes and dislikes, aren't we?" Then she glanced back
at the huge figure obediently settling itself at the desk while
she fumbled the combination of the lock. "We both like Phyl
Raysun, don't we?" she added slyly.



Frank jumped up from his chair, and his young face had
lost its last look of trouble.



"I'm so glad you like her, mother," he cried. "She's a
perfect delight. She's so       so wise, too. She's simply fearfully
clever. You noticed that. I remember you said so in
your letter. And       and isn't she beautiful?"



The safe door swung open, and Monica drew out a large
bundle of notes.



"She's as beautiful as only a lover's eyes can see her," she
said, with a smile. "She's such a delight, and so beautiful,
and so wise, that I'm adding a dowry to the amount I am going
to give you to start in business with. It's just a little
extra housekeeping money."



There was no doubt of Monica's happiness at that moment.
Her eyes were shining with the perfect delight of giving to
those she loved.



"Seriously," she went on, "I'm very pleased with Phyl       a
pretty name by the way. I'm so glad she is poor, and has
been brought up as she has. I don't think you could possibly
have made a better choice. I'm sure she's a dear girl. Remember,
Frank, you must always treat her well. She adores
you, and I want you always to remember that a good woman's
love is something to be treasured above       well, everything.
Though I am a woman, I warn you it is a priceless thing, and
something which, in its unreasoning devotion, in its utter self-sacrifice,
in its yielding up of all its most sacred thoughts and
feelings, comes straight from God Himself. Care for your
little Phyl very tenderly, Frank."



She sighed happily and glanced down at the notes in her
hand. Then she went on       



"Now let us consider something much more material.
Here is the money, dear. There are twelve thousand
dollars in this bundle for you, and another five thousand
for your Phyl, and all my love to you both goes with
them."



Monica laid the packet of notes on the desk in front of the
man, who stared up at her in wondering amazement.



"Oh, mother," he cried, "this is too good altogether. You
surely don't mean              "



But his protest was interrupted by the sharp ringing of
the telephone bell, and his amazed look was abruptly changed
to one of something like apprehension as he stared at the
wretched instrument.



But the sudden emergency found Monica alert. She
snatched up the receiver and placed it against her ear.





Two men moved silently along in the shadow of the house.
Their feet gave out no sound as they stealthily drew on
toward the library windows. They were not walking together.
One of them was leading by some yards, as though he were
the principal actor in the scene, and the other was there simply
to obey his commands.



The face of the leader was stern and set, but his eyes were
shining with a desperate passion which belied his outward
calm. The other wore a more impassive look. He was alert,
but displayed neither eagerness nor emotion.



The leader drew near the open French window and paused
listening. He could hear voices; a man's and a woman's, and
for a moment, wondered that the window had been left open.



Then the thought was quickly followed up by others of a
very different nature, while his ears strained to catch the
words passing beyond the drawn curtains. But the sound
was muffled, and though the temptation to draw nearer was
great he resisted it. He was waiting       waiting for something,
and the strain upon his patience was very great.



Then suddenly, faint and muffled, he heard the silvery
ringing of a telephone bell. He breathed a sigh as of relief,
and, signing to his companion to remain where he was, moved
cautiously forward until he stood within the opening of the
window.



Now he could plainly hear the woman's voice at the telephone.
It was sharp, a little bit unnatural, but it was plainly
recognizable and familiar, and, at the sound of it, the man's
teeth shut with a vicious snap.



"A letter, did you say? Oh! Yes, I heard you pass. I
was busy with some work.... Oh you must see me tonight?...
Oh.... Imperative I act on his instructions
to-morrow morning.... I see.... Well, if it's
so important I'll come along to your office.... No, don't
come to me.... I'll be with you in a moment....
You won't keep me more than a few minutes?... All
right.... It's no trouble."



The waiting man heard the receiver being hung up in its
place. Then the woman began speaking rapidly to her companion.



"Oh, Frank, what a nuisance," she cried, in unmistakable
annoyance. "It's Angus Moraine. He's had a letter from
Alec. It's full of important instructions which he wants me
to act on to-morrow morning, so I've got to get them to-night.
He says he saw a light in the library when he passed and was
relieved to find I was still up. It is a bother, dear, just when
I wanted to be with you. Still, he says he won't keep me more
than a few minutes. Just think of it, he had intended to come
and see me. Suppose he had."



The man's answer came at once.



"If he had the game would have been up all right."



The woman laughed.



"Yes. But he isn't coming. And to make sure I must
hurry. Now don't you go dear. It's going to be such a long
time before I see you again. I want to make the most of this
opportunity. You wait here. I'll be back directly."



"What if any one comes?" The question came sharply
from the man       and the eavesdropper's lips pursed grimly.



"No one will come," said the woman promptly.



"But suppose              ?"



"Well, if you should hear any one coming, if you should
hear anything that alarms your sensitive soul, why, then you
have the money, and all my love, take them both, and go the
way you came. In the meantime, in case              "



The man at the window writhed as he heard the distinct
sound of a kiss. The control he was exercising was strained
to its limits. The next moment the rustle of skirts, and, at
last, the closing of a door, told him all he had been waiting
for.



Suddenly he drew the curtains apart and closed them
sharply behind him.






CHAPTER XVIII



A MAN'S HONOR



"Well?"



The monosyllabic challenge bit through the silence of
the room. It was hard, cruel, and full of unmistakable
menace.



The man at the desk leaped from his seat and faced about,
glaring in the direction whence the voice had proceeded.






The Man Leaped from His Seat and Faced About




He faced the accusing figure of Alexander Hendrie with
a desperate, hunted look in his widening eyes, and, curiously,
in the horror of the moment, amid the turmoil of alarm
that filled his heart and brain, he found himself surveying
the intruder with a closeness of observation only to be
expected in moments of perfect tranquility.



His eyes caught the man's mane of hair, slightly graying
at the temples. He noted the cold gleam of the gray eyes
leveled straight at his. He realized the meaning of the
harsh, tightly compressed mouth, and the gripping muscles
of the wide, bull-dog jaw. There was a peculiar hunch to
the man's broad shoulders, which suggested nothing so much
as an animal crouching to spring. All these things he saw,
and read, and he knew that a merciless fury was raging
behind the calm mask of this husband of his mother.



In a flash his own nerve steadied, and a desperate calmness
succeeded the first shock of horror.



"Well?" he retorted, and moistened his parching lips.



To an on-looker, undisturbed by the tension of the moment,
a curious realization must inevitably have occurred. It
was the extraordinary likeness existing between these two.
The older man displayed the maturity of his years in his
increasing bulk, but the likeness was scarcely lessened by
it. There was the same hair, the same cast of feature.
The younger man's eyes were blue and his height was greater,
but the breadth of shoulder, the bone and muscle were
similar.



Yet neither of them realized the likeness. All their
thought was eaten up by a growing antagonism, antagonism
in one that was well-nigh murderous, and in the other,
simply that of a man, who finds himself pre-judged, found
guilty and sentenced for some crime of which he is wholly
ignorant and innocent.



Hendrie caught at the retort with lessening restraint.
He pointed at the open safe and the bundle of notes which
Frank still clutched in his hand.



"Red-handed," he said. Then as the incredulous youth
made a movement of protest, the other's hand slipped round
to his hip pocket with a movement not to be mistaken.
"Don't move," he said quickly.



Hendrie's command had instant effect. Frank stood quite
still. Then his appalled amazement found sudden and violent
expression.



"Good God!" he cried. "What do you mean? Do you
take me for       a low-down thief?"



Hendrie's eyes never once relaxed their cruel stare.



"What are you then?"



Frank glanced at the open safe, and his horrified eyes
came back to the pile of notes he was still grasping.



"You mean              " he began. Then indignation overcame
every other feeling. "This money was              "



Again he broke off, and this time a cold sweat broke out
upon his forehead. Only just in time did he realize what the
admission he was about to make would entail. Suddenly
he beheld the hideous trap gaping to ensnare him.



To say that his mother, this man's wife, had given him
the money, that her hand had unlocked the safe, that he
and she had been in that room together, would be to betray
her secret and yield up to the last man in the world whom
she wished should learn it, the story of       her shame.



His throat had dried up suddenly, and an awful sickness
pervaded his stomach. His imagination became fired.
What could he do? The possibility of such a situation had
never entered his head. He was helpless. Explanation
was denied him. He could only stand there, a convicted
felon, caught, as Hendrie had so mercilessly declared, "red-handed."
Not for one moment did he dream of taking the
other course. To betray his mother, the woman who had
devoted her life to him, it was out of the question. His
nature was incapable of such a thing. Cost him what it
might       even life itself       her honor was safe with him.



As the realization of his terrible position came to him,
a fresh anxiety grew; an anxiety that was wholly unselfish.
He dreaded lest she should return. He knew her goodness,
her generosity. That painful secret she had hugged to
herself for all these long years would be promptly yielded up
to save him. He prayed that her return to the room might
be delayed until       until              



He looked into the merciless eyes of his accuser whose
harsh voice broke the silence       



"You were going to say it was given you. Go on."



But Frank had no answer. A dogged silence seemed to be
the only thing possible, and Hendrie was left to do the
talking.



"You were going to say that that money had been given
you by some one       my wife?" He laughed without mirth.
"Guess you'd best finish your story. Shall I send for my
wife to corroborate it? How'd you fancy that? I'd think
a thief would have a better yarn than that. The money
was given you!"



The man's sarcasm goaded his victim beyond endurance,
and dogged silence gave way before it.



"You lie," he cried passionately. "I am no thief!"



The younger man's sudden heat was not without its effect
upon Hendrie. A flush crept over his level brows. It
dyed his cheeks, and added a fresh gleam of malignant hatred
to the cold cruelty of his eyes. He drew a step nearer, and
pointed at the chair.



"Sit down!" he commanded. And Frank found himself
mechanically obeying.



After a moment's pause, Hendrie went on with a deliberation
that contained an infinitely greater threat than any
passionate outburst could have conveyed.



"You're a thief," he cried. "Do you get me? A thief.
You're a low-down, dirty cur of a thief, not half as good
as the man who steals money. Say, you're the sort of skunk
who steals in through back doors chasing other men's womenfolk.
You came to steal my wife. You've been at the game
weeks. You've been watched       both of you       you and your
paramour. Back!"



In a wild fury Frank precipitated himself from his chair
to choke the filthy accusations in the man's throat. But he
was brought to a stand by the shining muzzle of a revolver,
held at his body.



He dropped back to his chair.



"Say, you can quit that right here," Hendrie went on.
"I'm ready for any play that way. You see, I fixed this
trap for you. Guess I was wise to your being here. Say,
you're going to pay for your gambol, my friend. Maybe
you don't know what you're up against. You're going to
pay       and pay bad. Maybe you don't know what my money
can do. It can do a heap, and I'm ready to spend my last
cent so you get the dose I want you to get.



"But you've made it easy for me. Plumb easy. I find
you here with my safe open, and a pile of money taken from
it. A safe robber, eh? The money in your hand, and you
got in through this window. Get me? Burglary. House-breaking.
Safe-robbing. When the law's fixed you right
for that, and you've served your term       then, why, I guess
there's more to follow. Say, you're going to get it good for
just so long as we both live. I'm going to beat you down,
down, down, till I've crushed you out of your rotten existence.



"Oh, I know you've not stolen that money," he went on
savagely. "I know that. I recognize you for the man
whose picture I tore up in my wife's rooms before I married
her. You're her lover, I know, but you're going to be treated
just as hard as the law can fix you for       those other things."



Under the merciless lash of the millionaire's tongue Frank
grew steadily calmer. But it was the calm of despair. Full
well he saw the hopelessness of his position. He had been
trapped beyond all chance of escape, and even ill luck had
worked for his undoing. As Hendrie paused he felt, though
he knew denial was useless, that he must make a final
effort.



"I tell you, you are wrong       utterly wrong," he cried
desperately. "I have never stolen anything in my life.
As for your wife, if you would only put this madness out
of your head you would see that there is only one man in all
the world she loves, and that man is you. Oh, I know it's
useless to deny anything while you are in this state of mind.
But it is as I say. You can do your worst with me. You
can employ your millions as you choose for my hurt, but
I tell you the day will come when you will regret it, regret
the wrong you are doing your wife       me, and would give
your right hand to undo the mischief you have wrought
through this       this insane jealousy."



The millionaire gazed at the earnest young face, and
slowly a smile grew in his eyes, a smile which only rendered
their expression more tigerish.



"Come," he said, in his level tones, "that's better. If
what you say is true guess the whole thing's up to you.
You'll have your opportunity in the prisoner's dock. Just
explain things to the court, to the press reporters, waiting
to telegraph the news all over America. Just tell 'em what
your relations with the wife of Alexander Hendrie are.
Call her a witness that she gave you that money. Do this.
I'll be satisfied for you to do it. But remember when you
get through with the court, you're not through with me."



He crossed the room and drew the curtains apart while
Frank's desperate eyes followed his movements. There was
no thought in the youngster's mind of anything but the
absolute fiendishness in the man's final proposal. The
heartless subtlety of it was tremendous.



Call his mother a witness! Call her a witness with a
ravening horde of reporters gasping for scandal. He understood
that Hendrie believed he would expose her to the shame
of this liaison, and so punish her by such a process. He
knew how little the man guessed the awakening such a course
would in all probability bring him.



In that moment Frank saw more clearly than ever the
necessity for silence and submission. But, realizing these
things, he saw, too, an added danger.



"One moment," he said, with studied calmness. He had
half read the other's intention as he moved the curtains.
"What will happen when       Mrs. Hendrie hears of my conviction.
Have you considered that?"



The millionaire glanced over his shoulder. A triumphant
light shone in his eyes.



"Guess I've considered everything. Your       paramour       after
to-night, will never see or hear of you again       unless
you call her as a witness at your trial."



He waited for the anticipated outburst. But it did not
come. To his surprise his victim's face was smiling, and
the sight of it set him searching for its cause.



Frank nodded.



"Right," he said, almost cheerily. "You can call your
man. I have no intention to resist       now."



The next moment a man stepped into the room through
the parted curtains. Frank surveyed him almost indifferently.
He recognized him as Douglas, the Sheriff of Everton.
It was a recognition that told him, had he needed to be
told, that the millionaire's purpose was no "bluff."



His heart sank, but his determination remained unaltered.
He thought of Phyllis, he thought of the farm he was to
have purchased, he thought of a hundred and one things,
and, though he gave no outward sign, he felt he could almost
have wept.



Presently he was roused by their touch as the cold irons
were slipped upon his wrists, and he heard Hendrie delivering
his charge to the sheriff.



Then he found himself standing up. Somebody passed him
his hat. Then he knew that he was walking beside the
sheriff, and passing out of the room by the window through
which he had entered it.





Alexander Hendrie gazed after the two retreating figures
until the ground seemed to swallow them up as they dropped
down to the lower level of the river-bank, where the trail
for Everton ran along it. Then he turned back to the room.



He crossed swiftly to the safe and closed it. He thrust the
packet of money into an inner pocket of his coat. Then
he set the chair at the desk straight. After that he passed
out through the window, carefully closing it behind him.





Ten minutes later a high-powered automobile was approaching
Deep Willows by the Everton trail. It only had
two occupants. The chauffeur was in the driving seat. Behind
him, surrounded by his baggage, and enveloped in his
heavy traveling coat, sat Alexander Hendrie.






CHAPTER XIX



THE RETURN OF ALEXANDER HENDRIE



"Guess he won't make home to-night, mam."



Angus Moraine broke the silence which followed on the
protracted, but absorbing discussion which had just taken
place in the stuffy precincts of his office.



Monica smiled. She was sitting in a well-worn chair,
Angus Moraine's own particular chair, which he had placed
for her beside his desk in the full light of the lamp, and
directly facing him.



"It's impossible to say," she replied, with the confidence
of her understanding of the man under discussion. "If
business does not interfere, and the mood takes him, Mr.
Hendrie will be home to-night."



Her manner was delighted. She was feeling very happy.
Such had been her interest in Angus's news, and the earnest
discussion of affairs involved in her husband's letter to his
manager, that, for the moment, all thought of Frank waiting
for her in the library at the far end of the house had passed
out of her head.



She had visited this man with no sort of feeling of friendliness,
with nothing but resentment at the interruption, but
the moment she entered the tobacco-laden atmosphere of
his room, and glanced at the long letter which Angus
promptly handed her, all her displeasure vanished, and she
became fully interested.



Nor was the change to be wondered at. The letter was
one which had been written with the express purpose of interesting
her. It was not the brief, terse letter of a business
man. Every word had been carefully considered. The
writer's whole object had been to afford food for discussion,
that his instructions to Angus, to keep her there for a definite
time, might the more easily be carried out.



The paragraph which chiefly held her interest had been
subtly placed by the writer at the opening of the letter.





"There is a big labor movement afoot," he wrote. "It
is normally the bonding of all agriculturalists, and has
for its stated purpose their protection against employers.
This may be so. But I have a shrewd idea
that the primary object is the furthering of the Socialistic
movement that is causing so much harm to the
world's industries, and is fostering the deplorable discontent
prevailing in labor circles all the world over.
However, with such a movement afoot, it is, of course,
quite impossible to forecast what unpleasant developments
the near future may have for us at Deep Willows.



"In removing you, and leaving Mrs. Hendrie in control
of my interests there, I am confident enough of
successful operation in the ordinary way. But under
these new conditions I do not feel so sure. It seems
to me that the necessity for the strength of a man's
controlling hand in dealing with the situation will soon
make itself apparent. Therefore it is better to anticipate.
Such anticipation will cause a change of plans
which, for some reasons, I reluctantly intend to make,
and, for others, leaves me well enough satisfied.



"I shall, therefore, require you to remain at Deep
Willows, and I will ask you to see Mrs. Hendrie at once,
convey her my compliments, and urgently request her
to join me in Winnipeg by the first east-bound mail. I
must confess this change falls in with the present trend
of my business as well as, I need hardly say, my personal
inclinations. I find that affairs will keep me pretty
well tied to Winnipeg and its surroundings, to say
nothing of the tours I shall soon have to make from
these headquarters. There is also a great deal to be
done on the social side. It is becoming more and more
necessary to entertain largely, and this, of course, I
cannot do without my wife's co-operation. So, perhaps,
all things considered, the change will turn out for the
best.



"I am sorely pressed for time or I should have written
Mrs. Hendrie fully on the subject. But, as this
would have entailed two long letters of explanation, and
since it is imperative to write you upon other matters
relating to the work in hand, I must ask you to convey
my apologies to my wife for thus sending her instructions
through a third party. Any way, this letter is
only precautionary lest I should not be able to reach
Deep Willows as I hope to."





Just for one moment, while reading, Monica had experienced
the slightest feeling of pique that her husband
should have chosen Angus as the recipient of his instructions
for herself. But such smallness was quickly banished as she
read on to the end of the letter, through a perfect maze of
intricate orders and countermandings of affairs connected
with Deep Willows. She realized that it would have been
perfectly ridiculous to send this letter to her, and as he was
"sorely pressed for time" the excuse was more than sufficient.



So she readily entered into the discussion which followed
her reading of the letter. Even if he did not reach Deep
Willows she was to rejoin her husband permanently, and
this was far more to her taste than to work apart from him,
even though she knew it was in his best interests.



In the discussion Angus surpassed himself for interest
and amiability, and Monica found herself wondering how
it was she had hitherto had such a dislike for him. Had
she only known it the man was only carrying out secret instructions,
which became all the more easy since the change
of plans had left him free from the nightmare of leaving
Deep Willows, which had pursued him for so many days.



Yes, Angus found it very pleasant, very easy talking to
this brilliantly handsome woman, whose physical charms
might well have found warmth in an iceberg. And, curiously
enough, now that her husband was aware of what he believed
to be the laxity of her morals, he no longer viewed them with
so much resentment.



So pleasant did he make himself, so interesting in his wide
knowledge of her husband's affairs, that Monica found herself
talking on and on, with no thought of the rapidly passing
time. She was utterly absorbed in the man whose life she
shared, absorbed to the exclusion of all else       even the waiting
Frank.



Now they were considering Hendrie's possible return that
night. Angus had done his work, and was waiting, sitting
there expectantly till the time of the final development which
was yet to come.



"It'll need to be a 'special,' mam," he said, with a smile.



Monica laughed lightly.



"Then let it be a 'special.' That, and his automobile, will
serve him well enough. You see              "



She broke off listening. Faintly, but quite distinctly,
the low purr of a high-powered car penetrated the dense
atmosphere of the office.



Angus started up. He, too, heard the sound, and he turned
to the waiting woman.



"Guess it was a 'special' all right. Say              "



He broke off as his narrow eyes took in the expression
of Monica's face. He ran to her side as though to support
her.



"You're faint, mam!" he cried. "It's the heat of this
room. It's              "



But Monica shook him off. Her face was deadly pale,
and she stood supporting herself against the arm of her chair.
Her eyes were alight with a dreadful alarm, as she gazed
incredulously at the hands of the clock on the desk.



It was half-past one, and all this time Frank had been waiting
in the library for her. The thought of her folly and
carelessness was maddening. She would never, never forgive
herself if harm came through it. Harm? It must not.
She must get away at once. She must give him warning.



Then she remembered her companion. His sharp eyes
were upon her. With a great effort she pulled herself together.
It would be fatal for him to realize the truth of her
feelings. She forced herself to a reassuring smile.



"It's nothing," she said, passing one hand wearily across
her forehead. "Just the heat of the room."



Angus's face remained a picture of concern, and she was
satisfied.



"I'll go and open the front door," she said, with studied
calmness. "Everybody is in bed. I              "



Angus had turned to the door, and now opened it. In
doing so Monica's attempt to leave the room was frustrated,
for he raised a warning hand, and she found herself forced
to listen as well.



Presently his eyes met hers.



"Guess you don't need to worry with that door," he said.
"He's coming along over the upper trail. He'll pass us
here."



So Monica had no alternative. She must remain. And
this knowledge threw her into a fresh fever of apprehension.
She searched for further excuse. But none was forthcoming.
Her tumultuous brain refused to serve her, and, in a few
moments, there came the ominous metallic clank as the clutch
was released, and the breaks drew the millionaire's machine
to a standstill at the door.



It was too late. Already her husband's voice could be
heard talking to the chauffeur.



"Hand me that suit case and leave the rest in the car,"
he said. "You best get to bed, and be ready for an early
start tomorrow."



There was nothing left for Monica but to go out and meet
him.



In spite of her trouble it was good to see her husband again.
But even while she listened to his greeting the thought
whirled through her brain, had Frank heard his arrival, too?
Had he made good his escape?



"Why, Mon, this is great. I hadn't expected it."



Hendrie spoke heartily. There was no mistaking the
delight of his manner, and the troubled woman felt a thrill
of satisfaction, even though danger was pressing.



"Gee, I've moved some to get here," he went on. Then
he came up to her as she stood in the doorway, and, under
the watchful eyes of Angus, embraced her warmly.



For a moment he stood her off at arm's length.



"But what are you doing up at this hour?" he demanded,
with pretended severity. Then he turned to his manager
with a laugh. "Keeping late hours with you, Angus, my
friend? It won't do."



"You've got your own letter to blame for that, Alec,"
retorted Monica. "If you must send messages to your wife
through Angus       you must expect the       unexpected." She
laughed in spite of her anxiety.



Hendrie responded with a smile.



"Well, as long as he's told you everything I'll forgive
him       this time. Say,"       he drew out his cigar case and
carefully selected a cigar. His eyes were shadowed for a
moment, and their expression was hidden from his wife       "will
you be able to start East first thing to-morrow. It's       important."



There was emphasis in his last remark, and the eyes he
raised to his wife's face were gently commanding.



Monica took him literally. She was only too glad to be
able to fall in with his wishes.



"Why yes, dear," she said at once. "We can go on
ahead, and Margaret can pack up and follow later. That
will be quite easy."



The command died out of the man's eyes as he surveyed
her. She was very, very beautiful as she stood there in the
lamplight. Her fascination for him was enormous. Then
her readiness to please him. No one but a man afflicted with
his insane jealousy could have doubted her perfect, utter
devotion to him.



But Hendrie was an unusual man. His extraordinary
powers were so abnormally developed that perhaps there
was a slight lack of balance. The driving force which urged
him left him little margin for the more subtle understanding
of human nature. He lived at fever heat. He had no desire
to seek understanding through tolerance. It was for him
to dominate. It was for him to bend, and even break, those
who ran foul of his will.



"Splendid, Mon," he cried, as he pierced the end of his
cigar and placed it firmly between his teeth. "You're always
ready to help me. Splendid." His eyes shot a quick glance
at Angus, who was standing watchfully by.



"Now see, Mon," he went on. "You best get right off to
bed. It's devilish late, and you've got some journey in
front of you. Just give me half an hour with Angus while
I smoke this cigar and I'll join you."



Monica's heart leaped. Here was all she needed to dispel
the last shadow. She could warn              



"Yes, I am tired, dear," she said readily. "It's been a
long day, and I have been working hard."



Hendrie nodded.



"Sure you have."



"Still it doesn't matter," the simple woman went on.
"There's lots and lots of work still before us. And Angus,"
she smiled over at the Scot playfully, "       well, I think he's
really glad I'm going. Aren't you?"



Angus flushed. Then his eyes met the curious gleam in
his employer's.



"I think it's best I stay, mam," he said guardedly. "If
labor troubles get busy I'd say I'm the more fitted to deal
with them."



"Of course you are." Monica was quite herself again, and
she laughed as she picked up her husband's suit case. "I'll
take this along for you, dear," she went on. "Good night,
Angus. Good night, Alec       for the present."



She hurried out of the room, bearing the suit case in her
hand, and, replying to her salutation, the two men stood
watching her as she went.



The door closed.



For some moments Hendrie did not move. His great head
was slightly inclined out of its usual erect position. Angus
waited for him to speak. For himself he had nothing to
say.



At last the cigar in the millionaire's mouth was tilted and
he turned. He reached out and drew the chair Monica had
occupied toward him. Then he sat down quite suddenly.



"Guess she'll find the library empty," he said, in a curiously
dull tone. He crossed his legs and reached for a
match. "He's well on his way to Calford       now," he added,
without enthusiasm.



Angus nodded.



"They've got him?"



The millionaire did not answer. Nor did he display
the least elation at the success of the trap he had laid and
successfully worked.



Only the stony light of his eyes remained. If he had
no elation it is doubtful that he possessed any feeling of a
gentler nature. He had simply done what he had set out
to do       done the thing he intended, as he always did. He
rarely experienced any feeling of triumph in the working of
his plans. That he possessed passionate human feelings
there was little enough doubt. But these were quite apart
from the scheming of his machine-like brain.



His cigar glowed under the pressure at which he was
smoking, and this was the only indication Angus beheld of
any unusual emotion.



The manager stirred uneasily at the lengthening silence.



"She tried to go       when you first came," he said hesitatingly.



Hendrie only nodded, and the quick glance of his eyes
silenced any further attempt on the part of the other.



Angus watched him silently, and, as he watched, it almost
seemed to him that somehow the man's great figure had
shrunk. Maybe it was the way he was sitting, huddled in
his chair. Certainly the old command of his personality
seemed to have lessened, he looked older, and there was a
curious, gray look about his face. He looked weary, an
utterly tired man. Yes, if he could only have associated
such a thing with Alexander Hendrie, he looked like       a
beaten man.



But at last the silence was broken, and with it vanished
the last sign which Angus had read so pessimistically in his
employer. The great head was lifted alertly, and the steady
eyes lit anew.



"Guess you don't know much about women, Angus," he
said thoughtfully.



Angus shook his head.



"Don't want to," he replied coldly. "Guess I got all
I need worrying out wheat."



The other accepted the denial, and went on       



"Maybe I don't know as much as I ought       at my age.
Maybe we've both been too busy       worrying wheat."



Angus smiled coldly. But there was no smile in Hendrie's
eyes. He was gazing steadily before him, his cigar poised,
forgotten, in his hand. He had definitely addressed himself
to Angus, but now he seemed to have forgotten his presence.



"Pshaw! What's the use?" he cried suddenly, with an
irritable shift of his position. "It's not the woman's fault       ever.
It's the man's       the dirty, low-down cur who can
always trade on her weakness. I ought to know. By God!
I ought to know."



He picked up a match almost mechanically and struck it.
But his cigar remained where it was, and the match was
allowed to burn out in his fingers. He threw the end of it
away with a vicious movement.



Suddenly he looked up and caught his manager's eyes
fixed on him curiously.



"What are you staring at, man?" he cried. Then with
sudden heat, "What in hell are you staring at? Do you
think me a doddering fool       a weak imbecile? That's it!"
he cried, working himself up into a sort of frenzy, and breaking
into a laugh, as terrible a sound as Angus remembered
to have heard. "I tell you she's not to blame," he went on
furiously. "I tell you I'll not give her up. Say, you cold-blooded,
herring-bodied Scotchman, have you ever loved a
woman in the whole of your grouchy life?" Again he
laughed. Again Angus felt the horror of it. "Never!" he
went on furiously. "Never, never, never! Love? God, it's
hell! Thank your God, you miserable, cold-blooded fish, you
are incapable of loving any woman."



He reached out again for a match and struck it. But he
threw it away from him at once.



"I can't give her up," he said, in a low, passionate tone.
"I can win her back. I will win her back." His voice rose.
"She is mine, and he       God have mercy on him, for I won't.
Say, there's hell waiting for him. He'll be tried and condemned,
and not a word of his trial will reach the outside
world. He is utterly cut off from the world. I have seen
to that. And then afterwards. By God, I'll hunt him
down. I'll hunt him to his grave, if it costs me every cent
I possess. Rob me? He would rob me of       my love? Love?
It's the worst hell ever man blindly fell into, but       it's
worth while."



Again he broke off, and his companion waited uneasily
for what might yet come. He knew that for the moment
something like madness had been turned loose in him. A
passing madness, but still something to be dreaded.



He had not long to wait. All abruptly the gray eyes lit
anew, and flashed in his direction.



"Why don't you say something?" he cried fiercely. "Why
do you sit there in silence? Are you afraid to speak? Bah!
Say, Angus, when you told me those things I promised you,
if they were not true, I'd       kill you. You remember? They
were true. And because they were true"       the man's eyes
glowered       "I'd like       to kill you       anyway. Yes, I'd like
to tear your miserable heart out of you, as you have helped
to tear the heart out of me."



Angus offered no protest. He sat there still and watchful.
He knew that the man's brain was fighting for sanity. Now
had come the awful reaction. His purpose had been accomplished,
the strain was over, and there was nothing left him
but the knowledge of his own terrible disaster. He felt that
any ill-timed word of his might upset the balance. This
man, who had proved victorious in a thousand battles in
the arena of commerce, was now torn in conflict with his
own soul. He must fight his battle alone. He must fight
it to the end.



"God! If you'd help rob me of all the wealth I possess
you could not have begun to hurt me as       as you have hurt
me in this. All that I have, or am, is       in that woman's
love. All that makes my life worth while is in her smile.
Do you understand? No. Or you'd never have come to
me with your miserable tale." His face was working.
"You're all the same. You're all in the conspiracy. Oh,
I could crush you, as well as the others, with these two hands.
I could squeeze the wretched life out of you, and it would
please me. Yes, it would please me."



Angus held his watchful attitude.



The man was breathing hard, and his usually cold eyes
were burning. He shifted his position spasmodically.



Presently a deep sigh came from between his clenched
teeth. Again he moved, but this time it was to cross his
legs. Angus saw the movement, and, all unconsciously, he
sighed, too. He understood the relaxing of tension which
permitted such a movement. Was the end near? Had the
battle worn itself out? Had the man emerged victorious?



Suddenly Hendrie turned to the cigar, still poised between
his fingers. He smiled. And Angus knew that victory was
within sight. A match was again struck, and this time the
millionaire lit his cigar. The next moment his companion
beheld a glimpse of the suffering heart so deeply hidden in
that broad bosom.



"I'm       I'm sorry, old friend," Hendrie said, with an unusual
note of genuine kindness in his voice. "I'm sorry.
Guess I said a whole heap of rotten stuff to you. Maybe
you'll forget. Maybe you understand something of what
I'm feeling about now. You see       I       just love her, and,
well       I just love her."






CHAPTER XX



THE VERDICT



The machinery at the command of Alexander Hendrie
had been set in motion. Nor was its power in doubt for a
single moment. Wealth may not be able to bias the ruling
of a court, but it can do all those things which can force
conviction upon the mind of the most upright judge on the
bench. It's subtle working in the hands of men who live
by corruption is more powerful than, perhaps, the ordinary
mind would believe. No innocence is sufficient that its victim
need not fear for liberty       even for life itself.



Frank Burton, charged in Calford as Frank Smith, a
name which, to the last, he claimed for his own, was soon
enough to learn something of this extraordinary, intangible
power. To his horror he found himself utterly powerless
before an array of evidence which conveyed a cruelly complete
story of his alleged malefactions, characterized as
house-breaking       with violence. Some of the witnesses
against him were men whom he had never seen or heard of,
and strangely enough, Alexander Hendrie did not appear
against him. The charge was made by Angus Moraine.



For his defence he had only his absurdly bare declaration
of innocence, a declaration made from the passionate depths
of an innocent heart, but one which, in the eyes of the
court, amounted to nothing more than the prerogative of
the vilest criminal.



What use to fight? His counsel, the counsel appointed
by the court, did his conscientious best, but he knew he was
fighting a losing battle. There was no hope from the outset,
and he knew it. However, he had his fee to earn, and he
earned it to the complete satisfaction of his conscience.



In view of his client's declaration of absolute innocence
this worthy man endeavored to drag from him a plausible
explanation of his presence at Deep Willows, with the money
taken from the open safe in his possession. But on this
point Frank remained obstinately silent. He had no explanation
to offer. His mother's honor was more to him
than his liberty       more to him than his life. So the mockery
of justice went on to the end.



In the meantime Alexander Hendrie was no nearer the
scene of persecution than Winnipeg, but the six hundred
odd miles was bridged by telephone wires, and he was in
constant touch with those whose service was at his command.



The completeness with which the last details of his plans
were executed was at once a tribute to his consummate
manipulation, and the merciless quality of his hatred. The
cruelty he displayed must have been indefensible except
for that one touch of human       nay, animal nature, which
belongs to all life. He honestly believed in this man's guilty
relations with his own wife, and his blindly furious jealousy
thus inspired he saw no penalty, no vengeance too cruel or
too lasting to deal out to the offender.



Alexander Hendrie had no scruples when dealing with his
enemies. His was the merciless fighting nature of the brute.
But he was also capable of prodigal generosities, lofty
passions, and great depths of human gentleness.



No feeling of pity stirred him as he sat in his office in
Winnipeg, with the telephone close to his hand, on the
afternoon of his victim's trial.



He was waiting for the news of the verdict which was to
reach him over those hundreds of miles of silent wire. He
was waiting patiently, but absorbed in his desire that word
should reach him at the earliest moment. His desk was
littered with business papers which required his attention,
but they remained untouched. It was an acknowledgment
that paramount in the man's mind is passionate feeling for
the woman he had married.



It was a strange metamorphosis in a man of his long-cultivated
purpose. All his life success had been his most
passionate desire. Now he almost regarded his millions
with contempt. Nature had claimed him at last, and the
lateness of her call had only increased the force and peremptoriness
of her demands.



Even now, while he waited, his thoughts were in that
up-town mansion where Monica was waiting for him. Nor
were they the harsh thoughts of the wronged husband for
the woman in whom his faith had been shattered. He was
thinking of her as the wonderful creature, so fair, so perfect
in form, so delightful in the appeal of her whole personality,
around whom shone the deepest, most glowing fires of his
hopes. She was to him the fairest of all God's creatures;
she was to him the most desirable thing in all the world.



The fierce tempest which had so bitterly raged in his
soul at the first discovery of her frailty had abated, it had
almost worn itself out. Now he had taken the wreckage
and deliberately set it behind him, and once more the flame
of his passion had leaped up       fanned by the breath of the
strong life which was his.



Another might have cast the woman out of his life;
another of lesser caliber. This man might have turned
and rent her, as he had turned and rent the man who was
her secret lover. But such was not Alexander Hendrie.
His passions were part of him, uncontrolled by any lukewarm
considerations of right and wrong. To love, with him,
was to hurl aside all caution, all deliberation, and yield
himself up to it, body and soul. To have cast Monica
out of his life must have been to tear the heart from the
depths of his bosom.



The time crept on, and still the telephone remained silent.
But the waiting man's patience seemed inexhaustible. His
was the patience of certainty. So he smoked on in his
leisurely fashion, dreaming his dreams in the delicate spirals
of fragrant smoke which rose upon the still air of the room
to the clouded ceiling above.



He had no thought for the innocent young life he was
crushing with the power of his wealth so many miles away.
He cared not one jot for the ethics of his merciless actions.
His thwarted love for his erring wife filled all his dreams to
the exclusion of every other consideration.



A secretary entered and silently left some papers upon
his desk. He retired voicelessly to wonder what fresh manipulation
in the wheat world his employer was contemplating.



A junior entered with several telegrams. They, too, were
silently deposited, and he vanished again to some distant
corners of the offices.



Still Hendrie dreamed on, and still the telephone had no
word to impart. His cigar was burning low. The aroma
of its leaf was less delicate. Perhaps it was the latter that
broke in on his dreaming, perhaps it was something else.
He stirred at last, and dropped the lighted stump into a
cuspidor, and thrust his chair back.



At that moment the bur-r-r of the telephone's dummy
bell broke the silence. Without haste, without a sign of
emotion he drew his chair forward again, and leisurely placed
the receiver to his ear.



"Yes       Who's that?       oh!       Calford." Hendrie waited a
moment, the fingers of his right hand drumming idly on
his desk. Presently he went on: "Yes, yes       you are Calford.
Who is it speaking?       Eh?       That you, Angus?
Damn these long-distance 'phones, they're so indistinct!       Yes.
This is Hendrie speaking. Well?       Oh. Finished, is
it?       Yes. And?       oh       splendid. Five years       Good       Five
years penitentiary. Excellent. Thanks. Good-bye."



He replaced the receiver and quietly began to deal with
the accumulation of work which had lain so long untouched
upon his desk.





PART III






CHAPTER I



THE MARCH OF TIME



In the rush of new life in Winnipeg, Monica was left
with little enough time for anything but those duties which,
in her husband's interests, were demanded of her. A fresh
vista of life's panorama had opened out before her, making
it necessary to obtain a definite readjustment of focus.



She quickly found herself tossed about amid the rapids
of the social stream, and, however little the buffeting of its
wayward currents appealed to her, hers was a nature not
likely to shrink before it. It was her duty, as the wife of one
of the richest men in the country, to make herself one of the
pivots about which revolved a narrow, exclusive social circle,
and toward that end she strove with her greatest might.



But the life was certainly not of her choosing. For her its
glamor had no appeals. She regarded it as a splendid
show, built upon the sands of insincerity, hypocrisy, self-indulgence,
vulgarity, all of which were far enough removed
from her true nature.



However, she was not without her compensation. She
felt she was an important spoke in the wheel of fortune her
husband was spinning, and, for his sake, she was glad to
endure the slavery.



So, in her great mansion, in the most exclusive portion
of the city, she dispensed lavish and tasteful hospitality; and,
in turn, took part in all the functions that went to make up
the program of the set in which she found herself something
more than an ordinary star. Within three months
her popularity was achieved, and in six she was voted the
most brilliant hostess in the city.



She spared herself not at all. All her tact, her discretion,
her mentality were exerted in the service of the man she
loved, who, watching her uncomplaining efforts, saw that
they were good. Whatever her feelings and longings for
the peace of the golden plains of Deep Willows, her reward
lay in the quiet acknowledgment, the smiling approval and
systematic devotion of the man whose slave she was only
too willing to be.



It would all end some day, she knew. Some day, her
husband's work completed, she would find herself at his side,
shoulder to shoulder, hand clasped in hand, supported always
by his strong affection, completing their little journey
through life in the proud knowledge that the work they
had set themselves was well and truly done.



Hendrie's satisfaction with her was very apparent.
Whatever his secret thoughts and feelings, whatever his
bitterness of memory, no sign of these was permitted to
escape him. She moved through his life an idol. She was
something in the nature of a religion which reduced him to
the verge of fanaticism.



Thus Monica was absorbed during her first six months
of Winnipeg. But in her moments of respite her thoughts
more than frequently drifted in the direction of young
Frank, and the girl he was to make his wife.



At first she recalled with satisfaction the fact that she
had been able to help him, and she found herself building
many castles for his occupation. Then, as the time slipped
by, she began to wonder at his silence. There was no sense
of alarm. She just wondered, and went on with her pictures
of his future. She thought of the new home she had helped
him select, and saw him in its midst, preparing it for the
reception of the young wife he was so soon to take to his
bosom.



Frank married! It seemed so strange. The thought
carried her happily back to the picture of a blue-eyed,
crumpled-faced baby as it had looked up from its cot with
that meaningless stare, so helpless, yet so ravishing to the
mother instinct. It seemed absurd to think of Frank married.
And yet              



Why had he not written? She was puzzled.



At first her puzzlement was merely passing, as other important
matters drove it from her thoughts. But, as the
days passed without any word, it recurred with greater and
greater frequency. Gradually a subtle worry set in, a
worry both undermining and harassing. Then she seriously
began to consider the puzzle of it, and, in a moment, genuine
alarm took hold of her.



She reviewed the night of her husband's sudden return
to Deep Willows. She remembered how, immediately on
leaving Angus's office, she had gone straight to her library.
It was empty. The safe was locked; all was in order. Even
the window was closed. All this told her what she wanted
to know. Frank had taken his departure safely. The
final touch of the window remaining unfastened, pointed the
fact that he had closed it after him.



Yes, he was safely away. Of that there was no doubt
in her mind. Then, why this silence? Could an accident
have occurred? Could he be ill? It did not seem likely.
In either case he would have let her know. Could he be              ?
No, she thrust the thought of his death aside as too horrible
to contemplate.



Then she thought of the money. It was a large sum.
Had he been robbed? It was a possibility, but one that did
not carry conviction. It was not likely, she told herself.
Knowing him as she did it seemed impossible. No one knew
of his possession, and he was not likely to proclaim it. He
was quite cautious, and, besides, he knew the people he was
likely to find himself among.



At length she wrote to him. This was about three months
after her arrival in Winnipeg. She wrote him at the farm
where he had worked, feeling that the letter would be forwarded
on if he had left the place.



Days passed; two weeks. There was no reply to her
letter, and her fears increased. A month later she wrote
again, this time addressing the letter to his new farm. The
result was the same. His silence remained unbroken.



Then came a shock which reduced her to a condition of
panic. Her first letter was returned to her through the
mail, and the envelope bore the ominous blue pencil message,
"not known." A few days later her second letter came back
with similar words.



The return of the second letter had a curious effect
upon Monica. For a long time she found herself unable to
think clearly upon the matter. Her panic seemed to have
paralyzed her capacity for clear thought, and she was left
helplessly dreading.



The truth was she had no one to whom she could open
her heart. No one to whom she could confide, and with
whom she could discuss the situation. So she was left with
an awful dread weighing her down. Something had happened
to the boy, something dreadful. And she dared not, even
in thought, admit the nature of her fears.



Nor was her trouble without its outward, physical effect.
Sleepless nights and anxiety rapidly began to leave their
mark. She became nervous and irritable. Her beautiful
rounded cheeks lost something of their delicate beauty.
Her eyes grew shadowed, and the nervous strain left bloodshot
markings in the pearly whiteness of her eyes. Her
faithful Margaret was quick to perceive these signs. But
in her ignorance of the real facts she read them as due to
the constant drain of her mistress's social duties upon a
system unused to such a life.



"Madam must rest," she assured her charge, as the latter
sat before her mirror, while the girl's deft fingers prepared
her hair for Mrs. Lionel K. Horsley's ice carnival at the
great skating rink. "Madam will be a ghost of herself soon.
She will be so       so ill."



But "madam" had no reply for the girl's well-meant warning.
She sat silently studying her reflection in the mirror
for many minutes.



The result of that study was a sudden determination to
do something by which she might hope to stay these inroads.
Her resolve took the form of a desire for action. She must
set her doubts at rest. She must find out definitely the
actual reason of her boy's silence.



So once more she set herself to study the dreary list of
possibilities. It was a hopeless, blind sort of groping, and
led nowhither. Nor was it until some days had passed
that her inspiration really came. It came in the middle
of a long, sleepless night, and she only marveled that she
had not thought of it before. If there was one person in
the world likely to know of Frank's whereabouts it was
Phyllis Raysun. Why had she not thought of it before?



Forthwith she left her bed and wrote a letter. Nor did
the possible consequences of what she was doing occur to her
until she had sealed the envelope. Then realization came
sharply enough. She remembered Phyllis's unusual keenness.
Who was she, Monica, to require information about
Frank? What relationship was there between them?
The girl was aware of Frank's illegitimacy. Well? Yes,
she would guess the secret she, Monica, had been at such
pains to keep.



On the impulse of the moment she tore the letter up.
But, almost immediately, she wrote another. The second
was shorter. It was more formal, too, and she left out of it
all excuse for requiring the information. Phyllis must guess,
if she chose. If she guessed, when she answered, she,
Monica, would tell her the truth of her relationship to Frank,
or, at least, the story she had told Frank himself. It would
be the best course to take       the only course she could see.



With the letter written she enjoyed the first real night's
sleep she had had for many days. She felt better. She
felt she was on the right track, and now, at last, was actively
moving to clear up the mystery which had robbed her of so
much peace of mind.



She mailed the letter herself next morning, and then
prepared to await the result with what patience she could.



In due course her answer arrived. It came in the shape
of a cheap envelope bulging to its capacity. For a moment
Monica's excitement was almost painful. Perhaps it contained
the long-awaited letter from Frank himself. Perhaps,
through some mischance, he had been away, and unable to
write her before. Perhaps all her fears had been unnecessary.



She tore off the outer covering. But the first paragraph
written in a girlish hand, dashed every hope, and plunged
her to the depths of despair.



Monica read the letter to the end       the bitter, bitter end       and
she read the simple story of a heartbroken girl, who,
like herself, had been waiting, waiting for word from the
man who was her whole world. She had no news of him
whatsoever. She knew nothing of his whereabouts. She
could find no trace of him. He had vanished. He had gone
out of her life without a word. From the moment he had
left Gleber to visit his mother, nothing had been seen of him
by any one in the vicinity of the farm upon which he had
been working.



Not one doubt of the man himself did the girl express.
She was convinced that some terrible accident had befallen.
Death alone, she declared, would have kept him from her,
and in this belief her grief left her overwhelmed. Monica's
tears fell fast as she read the letter. They were tears for
the child who had written it, tears for herself, tears for the
unhappy boy whom she looked upon and loved as a son.



But the appeal of the girl's story had another effect upon
her. It stiffened her courage, and, for some strange reason,
left her utterly unconvinced of the rightness of the surmise
the letter contained. Frank was not dead, she told herself,
and the denial came from her heart rather than her head.



From that moment a definite change became very marked
in Monica. All her old keenness and aptitude for business
returned to her aid. No stone should be left unturned to
discover the bay, whatever it cost her. Grown to manhood
as he was, he was still her charge, bound to her by the ties
of her duty to the dead, bound to her by the tie of a wonderful
maternal love. She steeled herself to face every possibility.
She flinched at no consequence to herself. If she
searched the world to its ends, Frank should be found.



Her plans were quickly made. In her emergency they
required less thought than had been necessary in the midst
of her doubts. With Frank definitely lost, the matter
resolved itself into a question of dollars. Dollars? She
had them. She had them in unlimited quantities, and they
should be poured out like water.



She promptly engaged the services of the best detectives
in the country, and set them to work. In their supreme
confidence they promised her that if the man was above
ground they would find him. If he were not, then they
would at least point the spot at which he was buried.



Monica was satisfied, and the long weeks of waiting for
news began. She wrote a warm, womanly letter of great
kindness to Phyllis, and told her what she was doing. She
also told her the story of Frank's birth as she had told it
to the boy himself. She promised her, among many other
encouragements, that she would wire her news as soon as it
reached her.



For herself she was quite desperate, and weighed none of
the possible consequences, should word of what she was doing
reach her husband. She was content to await such consequences
and deal with them as they presented themselves.
It was the mother-love in her at war with her love for her
husband, and, somehow, the former, for the time, at least,
seemed to possess the stronger hold upon her. At that
moment, no sacrifice was too great for her to make.



But, for all the confidence expressed by the men she had
employed, weeks grew into months, and a year passed since
Frank's disappearance, and she was still waiting for news
of him. Her patience was sorely taxed, and a great grief
and melancholy settled down upon her. Her agents still
remained optimistic, and with difficulty persuaded her from
employing additional aid.



The ice having been broken, she kept in constant communication
with Phyllis, and the intercourse helped her to
endure the dreary waiting, as it helped the lonely girl so
many miles away. It was a solace, however meager, to
both, and it served to save them from the crushing effects
of a burden which threatened to overwhelm them both.



Once, in a fit of depression, Monica made up her mind to
abandon Winnipeg and return to Deep Willows. She had
no very definite reason for the change. It might have been
that she wanted to return to the place where she had last
seen her boy. It may have been that she wanted to be
within reach of Phyllis, the only person to whom she could
open her troubled heart. Then, too, perhaps her presence
would help the girl, whom, in her own trouble, Monica had
come to look upon with something more than friendliness.



She told her husband of her purpose one night on their way
to dinner at the house of Joseph P. Lachlan, a great railroad
magnate.



Hendrie expressed no surprise, but appeared to display
the keenest sympathy.



"You've done great work, Mon," he said cordially. "I
don't know how I should have got through without your
help on the social side. You're a bully partner. You've
never grumbled. And yet you must be worn out. It's been
worrying me lately. I've seen how all this is telling on you.
Ye       s. You certainly must have a holiday. I hope to
be finished soon. Then I shall be able to join you. But
there are one or two matters I can't leave yet. I hope to
bring off a big coup the night of our big reception, a month
hence. You see, Cyrus Burd, the New York banker, must
be brought into the trust. The whole thing is a question
of overwhelming capital to carry on the fight against the
market when we declare ourselves. And Burd is the man       the
last man we want. I dare say I can worry that reception
through without you. I shall have to. Anyway your health
is the first consideration with me, and Deep Willows is just
the place for you to recuperate in."



Instantly Monica's denial leaped. Her health was nothing
to his affairs, she said. A month more or less would make
no difference to her. There must be no chance of anything
going wrong through her defection. She would not leave
Winnipeg till after that reception.



Then Hendrie tried to persuade her to go. But her mind,
she declared, was definitely made up, and she was quite
immovable. So Hendrie, with an air of reluctance, was
finally forced to acquiesce.



"If you insist, Mon, I have nothing more to say," he said,
with a sigh. "At least when it is over, we'll take a long rest.
We'll visit Europe and spend a lazy month or so."



Monica was clay in his hands. The last place he wanted
her to visit was Deep Willows       yet.



She had reason to be glad of her decision two weeks later.
It was nearly noon one morning when her private telephone
at the side of her bed rang. She was sipping her morning
coffee. The rolls on her plate were as yet untouched.
Margaret was occupied in preparing for her mistress's toilet.
The girl promptly left her work and took up the receiver,
while Monica waited to hear who it was ringing her up.



"Who is it?" the girl inquired. "I can't hear.
Red              "



Monica spoke sharply.



"Give me the thing," she said. "You never could hear
over a 'phone."



The girl obeyed, and left the room, as was her rule when
Monica used the telephone.



It was the Redtown Inquiry Agency, and Monica's heart
leaped as she listened. Their representative wanted to see
her urgently. Would she call upon him before two o'clock?
It was preferable she should go to him. Would she kindly do
so? He could not trust a message of importance to the wire.



It was just one o'clock when Monica was ushered into the
private office of Mr. Verdant, the representative of the Redtown
Agency.



Mr. Verdant greeted her with the cordiality he always
displayed toward a rich client. After placing her in a
chair, where the light from the window shone full upon her
face, he moved noiselessly over to the door, and, with some
display, ascertained that it was tightly shut. Then, as
noiselessly, he returned to his desk, dropped into his swing
chair, adjusted his glasses, and gazed squarely into his
visitor's face.



Having satisfactorily staged himself, and conveyed to the
anxious woman that he was reading her like an open book,
he drew a memorandum pad toward him and spoke without
looking up.



"We have not found your       the person you are interested
in, Mrs. Hendrie," he said, with studied effect.



"You have not found him?" Monica's heart sank. Then
she went on in an aggrieved tone. "Then       then why have
you sent for me? You said it was urgent."



The man looked up. It was a keen face he turned toward
his client. He was a clever detective, but he was also a
shrewd business man.



"Just so, madam," he said. "It is urgent. I have
brought you here to tell you that my people have decided
to abandon the case."



Monica stared.



"But       but I don't understand."



"Precisely, madam, and I am here to explain."



"Please explain       and quickly. I have no time to waste."



Monica was angry. She was grievously disappointed, too.
All the way down Main Street she had buoyed herself with
the belief that her boy had at last been found.



"I'm sorry, mam," Mr. Verdant went on, "but we're business
men as well as inquiry agents. Maybe we're business
men first. You'll naturally understand that our inquiries
frequently lead us into strange places, also they
frequently land us up against people whom, as business men,
we cannot afford to       vulgarly speaking       run up against.
This is our position now with regard to your       er       inquiries."



"You mean       you are afraid to go on with my case?"
Monica made no attempt to conceal her annoyance, even
contempt.



"You can put it that way if you choose," Mr. Verdant
went on imperturbably. "The point is that as inquiry
agents I regret to say my chiefs have decided to abandon
the case, and, in my capacity as their representative, it is
my duty to notify you personally."



"But this is outrageous," cried Monica, suddenly giving
full vent to angry disappointment. "I pay you. Whatever
you ask I am willing to pay. And you coolly, without any
explanation, refuse to continue the case. It       is a scandalous
outrage!"



Her flushed face and sparkling eyes told the detective
more plainly than her words the state of mind his ultimatum
had thrown her into. He assumed at once a more conciliatory
tone.



"Madam," he said, "you are just a little hard upon us.
There are some things far better left alone, and, in this case,
it is 'explanation.' The fact that this is so should tell you
that we have been by no means idle. We have simply gone
as far as we dare in our investigations."



But Monica was not so easily appeased.



"If you have done the work you say; if you have made
discoveries which you refuse to disclose to me, after accepting
my money for your work, then you are committing a fraud
which the law will not tolerate."



Mr. Verdant listened quite unimpressed.



"One moment, madam. I beg of you to keep calm. I
have done my duty as an official of this agency. Now I am
going to do my duty by you, as the detective in charge of
your case. You desire to know the whereabouts of Mr.
Frank Burton. I can tell you how to find his whereabouts       in
half an hour."



"But you said you had not found him!"



Monica was beginning to wonder if the man were not a
lunatic as well as a fraud.



"I have not found him."



"Then       gracious, man, speak out. How can I find him?"



"Ask your husband. Ask Mr. Alexander Hendrie where
he is."



Mr. Verdant had risen from his seat as he spoke, and now
stood holding the door open for his visitor to pass out.






CHAPTER II



WHEN VOWS MUST YIELD



"Ask your husband. Ask Mr. Alexander Hendrie where
he is."



The words beat into Monica's brain. They hammered
upon her ear-drums. They rose before her eyes, mocking
her.



She was back in her own home. She had gone straight
to her bedroom and locked herself in. She was due at a
luncheon party, and, on her return, Margaret had hurried to
wait upon her. But the girl was promptly dismissed, and
the luncheon forgotten. It was a matter of no importance
now. Monica would go nowhere; she would receive no one.
She was ill, she said, and refused to be disturbed.



So Margaret was left wondering and frightened.



Monica paced her room for hours. She was vainly endeavoring
to think connectedly. She was trying desperately
to fathom the meaning of the man Verdant's challenge. It
was useless. All continuity of thought was gone. Her
ideas, her thoughts just tumbled pell-mell through her harassed
brain, eluded her grasp, and vanished in the darkness
whence they had leaped.



"Ask your husband. Ask Mr. Alexander Hendrie where
he is."



It was maddening; and fever coursed through her veins.
Her head grew hot with her effort. It ached, as did
her eyes. Things about her began to seem unreal. Even
the familiar objects in the room seemed to belong to some
long-past, almost forgotten period in her life. She pulled
herself together, and even began to question herself. Where
was she? Ah, yes, this was her husband's house              



"Ask your husband."



For a moment the fever left her cold. Then it was on her
again. She must ask her husband!



A hundred times the words came back, but she could
proceed no further. Instinctively she understood something
of the ugliness lying beyond them.



The distraught woman endured this torture for hours. It
seemed ages; and at times she believed she was struggling
to keep her reason.



If her husband knew of Frank's whereabouts, then       but
she dared go no further. Once she paused in her restless
pacing and stood before the mirror on her dressing-table.
She stared at it as though reading the man's words written
there. Suddenly she became aware of her own reflection,
which seemed to be mocking her. She fled precipitately and
flung herself into a chair, burying her face in her hands.



But such a state of mind could not endure and sanity
remain. It was the result of shock, and the worst of shocks
must give way before the recuperative powers of healthy
nature. So it was now.



The late afternoon sun had just fallen athwart the great
bay window, when the troubled woman, with a sigh as of
utter exhaustion, flung herself upon her bed in a flood of
hysterical tears. For a while the storm remained unabating.
It almost seemed that the flood-gates of a broken heart had
been opened; as though life had no longer any joy remaining;
as though all the most treasured possessions of her
woman's heart had been ruthlessly torn from her bosom,
so hopeless, so dreadful were her tears.



But it was the saving reaction. Within half an hour the
storm had lessened. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it
ceased altogether.



Monica sat up.



For one painful moment she gazed stupidly about her.
Then one by one the details of her room grew upon her, and,
slowly, a subtle change crept into her eyes. For a moment
they hardened, as though she were spurring herself to some
painful resolve. Then, at last, they softened again to their
natural expression. She left her bed, and passed through
the doorway which led into her private bathroom.



Presently she emerged. A cold douche had done its work.
She was quite calm now, and all her movements became
deliberate. She walked up to her mirror, and gazed at the
reflection of her swollen eyes. Then, with a weary sigh, she
finally turned away and pushed the electric bell at her
bedside.



Margaret obeyed the summons with suspicious alacrity.
Truth to tell the devoted girl had been near by, waiting
for the summons. Her mistress's unusual attitude had
seriously troubled her. Now she came, hoping but anxious,
and, after one glance at Monica's swollen eyes she gave vent
to her distress.



"Oh, but, madam              " she cried.



She was silenced with a look.



"I'll begin to dress       now," Monica said coldly.



But the girl's anxiety was too sincere.



"But, madam, it is only half-past five! Dinner       dinner
is at eight."



Monica turned away coldly, and seated herself upon the
ottoman, which stood in the center of the room.



"I will dress now," she said finally.



Margaret understood her charge. It was useless to protest
when Monica's mind was made up. So she set about her
work at once.



Monica watched her as she threw open the wardrobes.
Her eyes followed her as she vanished to prepare the bath.
But it was not with any interest. The girl's movements
simply conveyed a sense of activity to her. That was all.
But it helped her. It helped her, in the midst of her teeming
thought, as nothing else could have done.



She endured the process of her toilet like one in a dream.
Nor was it until it came to the necessary selection of a
gown that she displayed any real interest. Then she roused
herself and startled Margaret with her peevish indecision.
Nothing seemed to please her. Several new gowns, just
home from the extravagant costumer, who poured "creations"
upon her, were flung ruthlessly aside before the girl's
dismayed eyes. She would have none of them, and Margaret
was at her wit's end.



There were only a few simple black gowns left, and
Margaret hated black. But what was she to do? She
produced them, being careful, at the same time, to display
her own disapproval. Promptly selection was made.
Monica knew the value of soft black chiffon against her
beautiful fair hair and fairer skin. No one knew it
better.



Another uncomfortable half hour was spent while the
girl dressed her mistress's hair. Never had Monica been so
difficult to please. But even this was finally satisfactorily
achieved, and Margaret sighed her relief.



However, her surprises were not yet done with. There
was still another forthcoming. Monica surveyed herself in
the mirror. She gazed at herself from every point of view.
She beheld a perfectly molded figure, unusually tall, with
the delicious tint of flesh like alabaster glowing warmly
through the gauzy folds of the simple black chiffon of which
her gown was composed. She saw a face that was slightly
pale, but of exquisite, mature beauty. She saw eyes of a
deep blue, full of warmth, full of that precious suggestion of
passionate possibilities which no man can witness unmoved.
And even in those moments of trouble she knew that she had
done well in her choice of gowns. She knew that she was
very beautiful.



She turned at last to the waiting girl, who was gazing at
her in open admiration.



"Go and find out if Mr. Hendrie has come in yet. If he
hasn't, leave word I am to be told the moment he arrives.
Also, let him be told that I wish to see him in the library
before he goes to dress."



The girl moved toward the door.



"One moment." Monica spoke over her shoulder. "Put
the rouge out for me, and       an eye pencil."



This final order was too much for the girl's sense of the
beautiful.



"But, madam," she cried. "Oh, madam is too beautiful
for              "



"Do as I tell you!"



The order came sharply, almost harshly, and Margaret
hastened to obey. For once Monica was stirred out of her
customary kindliness. Her nerves were on edge. She had
yet to face an ordeal, which, with each passing moment,
was slowly sapping her courage. She knew she had none
to spare, and dreaded lest her strength should fail her at the
last.





Monica was standing in the archway beyond which two
great French windows looked out over the street. One beautiful,
rounded arm was upraised, and its bejeweled hand was
nervously clutching the edge of the heavy crimson curtain.
It was no pose. She was clinging to the curtain for support.



It was still daylight. The setting sun still lit the street
outside. The room was lined from its polished floor to the
ceiling with dark mahogany bookcases, which, with the crimson
hangings, and the deep-toned Turkey carpet, helped to
soften the light to a suggestion of evening.



The sound of a step in the hall beyond startled her. She
clutched the curtain still more tightly. She knew that firm
tread. The handle of the door turned. Instantly she yielded
her hold upon the curtain. Her husband must witness no
sign of her fear. The next moment a deep, familiar voice
greeted her.



"I'm sorry if I kept you waiting, Mon. I              "



Hendrie broke off in astonishment. Just for a moment
his eyes surveyed the wonderful picture she made. And,
in that moment, Monica realized that her efforts had not
been in vain. His eyes were drinking in her beauty, and she
understood that never, in their brief married life, had she
appealed to him more.



"Why, Mon," he cried. Then in a sudden burst of admiration.
"You       you look just splendid." And after a
pause. "Splendid!"



Monica smiled up at him.



"You haven't kept me waiting. I       I was anxious to see
you at once, so I       I dressed early."



Hendrie had drawn nearer, as though about to embrace
her. But her halting fashion of explanation checked him.
All unconsciously he leaned against the edge of a table instead.
It was as though something had warned him to       wait.



"I'm glad I didn't keep you waiting," he said, and something
of the warmth had gone out of his tone. "Something       important?"



The woman was seized with a mad longing to flee from the
room. The ordeal she was about to go through was almost
more than she could bear.



"Yes       I'm afraid it is," she said, in a low, unsteady voice,
while she turned away toward the window.



"Afraid?"



Monica turned again and looked up into his eyes. A
sudden weakness left her knees shaking.



"Yes," she said, and stammered on. "I       I       hardly know
where       to       begin."



Hendrie left the table and drew a step nearer.



"You're in some trouble, my Mon," he said kindly. "I can
see it in your face. Tell me, dear."



His words had their effect. Monica's fears lessened, and
something of her courage returned. Suddenly she threw up
her head.



"No, no! You tell me, Alec!" she cried. "Tell me truly,
as though you were answering your own soul, is there       is
there a condition, a moment, a situation in life when it become
wrong to keep a solemn vow given       to the dead? I
hold that a vow to the dead is the most sacred thing in       life.
Am I right       or wrong?"



The man's gray eyes expressed neither surprise nor curiosity.
They were calmly considering, and in their calm they
were painfully cold.



He shook his head.



"You are wrong," he said simply. "The most sacred thing
in life is       Truth. When Truth demands, no vow to dead or
living can bind."



Monica sighed.



"You are sure?"



"Sure. Quite sure."



The man was deliberate. As no answer was forthcoming,
he went on       



"Come, Mon, tell me. Guess there's something behind all
this. Well       I am here to listen."



The woman stirred. She clenched her hands. Then her
answer came.



"And I am here to tell you," she cried, with a sharp intake
of breath. "I have lost something. I have lost something
which is almost as precious to me as       as your love. I have
been told that you can tell me where to find       him."



"Him?" The word rang through the quiet room.



It was the man's only comment, and a dreadful inflection
was laid upon the word.



There are moments in life when acts are performed, when
words are spoken without thought, even without actual impulse
of our own. They are, perhaps, moments when Fate
steps in to guide us into the path she would have us tread.
Perhaps it was such a moment in Monica's life, in Hendrie's.



Certainly the woman had spoken without thought. She
had no understanding of what her words could possibly mean
to her husband. And Hendrie, surely he was unaware that
murder looked out of his furious gray eyes at what he
believed to be the mention of the man for whose downfall
he had perjured his own soul.



"Yes       him, him!" cried Monica, becoming hysterical.
"My       my dead sister's child."



Hendrie recovered himself at once. He smoothed back his
hair like a man at a loss.



"I       don't think I quite       get it," he said slowly. Then his
bushy brows lifted questioningly. "Your sister's child? I
didn't know you had a sister. You never told me. Say       how
should I know where this child is?"



He was puzzled. Yet he was not without some doubts.



Monica swallowed with difficulty. Her throat and tongue
were parched.



"No," she said, struggling for calmness. "I never told you
because       because I had vowed to keep the secret. Questions
would have followed the telling, which I could not have answered.
I was bound       bound, and I could not break my
promise."



"You best tell me all there is to tell," the man said coldly.
"This secrecy, this promise. I don't understand       any of it."



Never had his wife's beauty appealed to Hendrie more
than it did at that moment. A great depth of passionate
feeling was stirring within him, but he permitted it no display.
He was growing apprehensive, troubled. His doubt,
too, was increasing.



Monica suddenly thrust out her hands in appeal.



"Oh, Alec, it is so hard, even now, to       to break my faith
with the dead. And yet I know you are right. It       it is
more than time for the truth. I think       yes, I believe if poor
Elsie knew all, she would forgive me."



"Elsie?" The man's voice was sharply questioning.



"Yes, Elsie       my poor, dead sister."



"Go on."



"Yes, yes. I must go on." Monica drew a deep breath.
"I can't understand. I don't seem to               Oh, tell me where
he is. My Frank, my poor Frank, Elsie's boy. The boy I
have brought up to manhood, the boy I have cared for all
these years, the boy I have struggled and fought for. He       he
is       lost. He has been spirited away as though he had
never existed. And       I am told by the detectives to ask you
where he is."



Hendrie's eyes were upon the carpet. He was no longer
looking into the troubled face before him.



"Tell me," he said sharply; "when did you see him last?"



Monica no longer hesitated. Her husband's manner had
become suddenly compelling.



"It was the last night I spent at Deep Willows," she said
at once. "Just before you came home."



Hendrie raised his eyes. They were full of a dawning
horror.



"The truth does demand," he cried almost fiercely. "Tell
me! Tell me       as quickly as you can."



Monica was caught in the man's sudden excitement.



"Yes, yes, I will," she cried. "Oh, but it is a long story
and       and a sordid one. It all happened when I was a young
girl. I was only seventeen. Poor Elsie. She had been away
a long time from home. Then she came home to me, her only
relative. She came home to die, and dying gave birth to her
son. You see, she was never married."



She paused, but went on at once at the man's prompt
urging.



"She was never married, and the man left her in the hour
of her direst need. Poor girl, even in her extremity she did
not blame him. She loved him almost as much as she loved
his little baby boy. She knew she was dying, nor did she
seem to mind, except for her baby. He was her great
anxiety. But even in that, her anxiety was chiefly that the
child should never know of his mother's shame. So, almost
with her last breath, she made me swear that I would bring
him up as my own child. That I would keep her secret from
him, and account for his father as being dead, with any story
I chose to tell him. And I       I, a girl of seventeen, promised."



She paused. Then she hurried on as the questioning eyes
of the man were again raised to her face.



"But what does it matter?" she cried suddenly. "She was
my only sister and I loved her. From that day Frank became
my own son, and, for nearly twenty years, I battled
with the world for him. Nor in our worst trials did I feel
anything but the greatest joy in our mutual love. Oh, yes,
when he grew up, I had to lie to him. I have had to lie, lie, lie
all through. And when you came into my life I had to lie
harder than ever. It was either that, or betray my sister's
secret. That I could not do       even for your love. I chose
the easier path. I lied so that I should not have to give
you up."



"It is not quite clear       the necessity?" The man again
raised his eyes to her face, but, almost at once, they turned
back to the carpet.



"It is simple enough," Monica went on dully. "If I married
you, to keep my sister's secret I must keep Frank in the
background. Otherwise I should have to give explanations.
To keep him in the background I must tell him a story that
made it necessary. I did so. So that he should know nothing
of Elsie's shame, and as I had brought him up to call me
'mother,' I did the only thing that seemed to me possible. I
took the whole responsibility upon myself. I told him that
though he was my son I had never been married. You see, I
knew his love for me. I knew his chivalrous spirit. He
wanted me to be happy in my newly found love, so       he accepted
the situation."



Hendrie shook his head.



"You kept the letter of your promise to your sister, and       betrayed
the spirit of it."



Monica hung her head.



"I know. I did it because       I could not give you up."



Hendrie looked up with something like anguish in his eyes.



"Oh, woman, woman," he cried. "Why didn't you take
me into your confidence? These lies could have been saved,
and       and all these other, and even more, terrible consequences.
Listen to me, and I will tell you all the rest. I can
see it now. I can see it more clearly than you can tell me.
He called himself Frank       Smith?"



Monica started.



"Yes. Whenever he visited me at Deep Willows. His
real name was Frank Burton."



Hendrie's gaze wandered toward the window. The street
lamps had just been lit. Never in his life had he known what
it was to humble himself before another. Never had he known
what it was to excuse himself for any act of his. Now he
knew he must do both of these things.



Monica stepped eagerly forward from the shadow of the
curtains.



"You       you know where he is?" she demanded.



Hendrie nodded. Then a strange thing happened. A
harsh, mirthless laugh rang through the darkening room.
Monica stared at the man's unsmiling face, horrified, and
at a loss to understand.



"Then where is he?" she cried blankly.



"He is in the penitentiary, serving five years for breaking
into Deep Willows, and robbing my safe of a bunch of money
that belonged to you."



"Oh, God have mercy!"



The cry rang through the room. Monica reeled and
would have fallen. In a moment her husband's arms were
about her. But she flung him off, and her action was one
of something like loathing. She stood up facing him, and
pointing at him, while her agonized eyes challenged his.



"You       you!" she cried fiercely. Then: "Go on! Tell me       tell
me quickly! It is you       you who have done this!"



Hendrie drew himself up. There was no hesitation about
him, no shrinking before the story he had to tell.



"Yes, I did it," he said. "I       I! I have listened to your
story. Now listen to mine, and when you blame me, you must
blame yourself as well. I have loved you desperately. I love
you now. God knows how I love you. If I did not I could
never have endured what I have endured in the past and kept
my reason. That is my excuse for what I have done.



"I saw that picture in your rooms and took the man to be
an old lover. I hated him, and       I tore it up. I told you
then there could only be one man in your life. I destroyed
that pasteboard as I would destroy any one who came between
us."



Monica remained silent while the man choked down his
rising emotion.



"After we were married I became aware of the clandestine
visits of a handsome man, to you, at Deep Willows. You
were known to have embraced him."



"You       you spied!"



"I did not spy       then. I learned these things, nor does
it matter how. I determined to crush this man I believed
to be your lover. I determined to be rid of him once and for
all. My love for you was so great that what I believed to be
your guilt left me quite untouched. It was men I understood;
men with whom I was accustomed to deal. I meant to
deal with this man. So I set to work. I need not tell you
how I tracked him down and kept him watched. It is sufficient
that I knew of his visit to Deep Willows on the night in
question. My plans were carefully laid. I left very little to
chance. You were in the library with him, and Angus summoned
you, to give you some important news he had received
from me. I had arranged that. At the time the telephone
bell rang I was beyond the window with the sheriff of Everton.
The moment you left the room I entered it. I found
this man with a bunch of money in his hand, and the safe
open behind him. I had not hoped for such luck. I charged
him then and there with the theft. Oh, I knew he had not
stolen it. You had given it him, and it made me the more
furious. I could have shot him where he stood. But it
could not have been sufficient punishment. I meant to crush
him.



"Then I did the crudest thing I could think of. I told
him that I knew he had not stolen the money. I told him
that he could clear himself of the charge by calling you into
the witness box. In that way I knew that what I believed
to be your shame would reach the whole world. But soon I
was to see the stuff he was made of. He would not drag your
name into the matter. He submitted to the charge with a
simple declaration of his innocence, and I was well enough
satisfied. The rest was sheriff's work. Within certain limits
I knew I could buy the law, and I bought it. The case was
kept out of the papers, and you were sent well away from any
possibility of hearing of it. The name he was tried under,
and which he clung to, helped further to disguise his identity.
That night when you returned to the library, as I knew you
would, you found the place in order, and the boy gone. You
had no possible suspicion of what had occurred. You could
have none. You remember I drove up later, as from Everton,
in my automobile."



Hendrie ceased speaking. Monica remained silent. She
stood quite still looking into his face as though she were
striving to read all that lay behind it, trying to fathom to
the very limits the primitive motives which had driven this
man to the dreadful cruelty he had so readily inflicted. He
had sent Frank, her boy, to a felon's prison. Sent him without
one single scruple, without mercy. He had committed,
besides, every base action he could have been guilty of to
achieve his purpose, and all       for love of her.



She tried to think it all out clearly. She tried to see it
through his eyes, but she could not. The hideousness of it
all was too terrible. It was unforgivable.



At last she spoke. Her voice was hard and cold. In it
Hendrie detected, he believed, the sentence her woman's
heart had passed upon him.



"He must be released at once," she said, in a tone that
warned him of all he had lost. "If you do not contrive this
at once the world shall know the whole story       yours as well
as mine."



The man made a slight movement. It was as though he
had flinched before a blow in the face.



"He shall be released," he said.



"He must be released       at once." Monica's icy tone was
final.



She turned away, moving toward the door. Then suddenly
she paused, and a moan of despair broke from her.



"Oh, Alec," she cried, "how       how could you? How could
you do it?"



The man was at her side in a moment.



"I love you, Mon," he cried, in deep tones. "You are
more precious to me than all the world       than life itself.
Can't you understand? Can't you see just something of what
my eyes saw? Where you are concerned it is all so different.
I could not, dared not lose you. I hated this man, who I
believed had robbed me of your love."



Monica's agonized eyes were raised to his for a moment.



"But where was your faith? Where your trust?" she cried.
"Why, why did you not openly accuse me?"



"Accuse you? Mon, you have yet to learn all that my love
means. You think me, the world thinks me, a strong, even
ruthless man. There is truth enough in the latter       God
knows. But for the rest, where you are concerned, I am
weak       so weak. I am more than that. I am an utter coward,
too. While my heart might break at the knowledge of your
infidelity, it would be incomparable to losing you out of my
life. Why did I not accuse you openly? Because I was
afraid to hear the truth from your lips. Do you know what
would have happened had you confessed to me that you loved
this man? It would have meant       murder. Oh, not your
death," as Monica drew away horrified at the terrible sincerity
of the threat. "That man would have died. Now can
you understand? Won't you understand?"



There was a dreadful moment of doubt, of anxiety, while
the man waited an answer to his appeal. No prisoner could
have awaited sentence with more desperate hope. His eyes
devoured the woman's averted face, while his heart hungered
for the faintest gleam of hope it might hold out. And waiting
he wondered. Was there anything in a woman's love at all,
or was he to be condemned to a life with the doors of her soul
closed and barred against him for ever?



It seemed an endless waiting. Then she gave a sign. She
turned to him, and raised a pair of eyes, whose sadness and
distress smote him to the heart, and looked up into his face.
Then he knew, however undeserved, her love was still his.



"Perhaps I can understand, Alec, but       but give me time."
Monica spoke in a deep, tender voice that was full of pain,
full of suffering. "I am beginning to understand many
things I did not comprehend before. You, perhaps, are not
so much to blame as I thought. I have been so weak, too. A
little candor and honesty on my part might have saved it all.
We are both terribly to blame, and perhaps most of it lies at
my door. Let us try to forget ourselves. Let us forget
everything but that which we owe to Frank. We both owe
him so much. Oh, when I think of the way I have fulfilled
poor Elsie's trust I feel as though my heart would
break."



"If ever a trust was carried out truly, yours has been,
Mon."



The man's arms were about her, and he gently drew her to
him. He gazed tenderly down upon her now tear-stained
face.



"No woman could have done more than you have," he
went on. "If things have gone awry it is no fault of yours."
He smoothed her beautiful hair with one tender hand. "I
give you my sacred word your Frank shall be released. I
swear it by the memory of your poor dead sister. I can still
undo the mischief which my mad jealousy has wrought, and
your       Elsie will forgive."



He bent and kissed her upturned face, while she clung to
him for support.



"Yes, yes, she will forgive. It was her nature to forgive,"
Monica said, in a wave of tender memory. "To the
last she would not hear one word against the wretched father
of her boy. Do you know, Alec, I sometimes wonder that
Heaven allows such men to go about working their cruel
mischief upon trusting women."



Hendrie stirred uneasily, and his arms gently released her.



"Tell me of her       of him," he said, his eyes turned upon the
streaming light from the street lamps.



Monica became thoughtful.



"I know so little about him," she said, after a slight pause.
"You see, I never saw him; and Elsie       she would say so little.
It seems she met him in New York. I forgot to tell you Elsie
was an actress. She acted under the name of Audie Thorne."



The man started. Then, slowly, his eyes came back to
her face. Fortunately their expression was lost upon her,
and, before she could turn in his direction, he was once more
gazing out at the brilliant light which, somehow, he was no
longer aware of. He was listening to his wife's voice, but her
words conveyed little enough to him now. His mind was far
back in a dim, almost forgotten past.



"I don't know how it all happened," Monica went on.
"She was doing so well on the stage. Then she met this man,
Leo. The next thing she was up in the Yukon with him. He
was prospecting. Then they were traveling down country       overland       with
an Indian scout. That's when he deserted
her. She only managed to reach me, in San Sabatano,
through the aid of the scout. He gave her money. Money
paid him for the trip." Then a world of contempt crept into
her voice. "I suppose it was the coming of Elsie's baby
which frightened him       the cowardly brute."



Hendrie nodded, his face studiously averted.



"Perhaps," he murmured. "But one can never be sure of
such a man's motives."



"Motives?" There was unutterable scorn in the woman's
voice. "And while he goes free, she, poor soul, is left to
suffer and die       in the       gutter!"



"But       you sheltered her? You cared for her?"



The man's voice was almost pleading.



"Thank God, I could at least do that       but it was not
through any doing of his. Oh, if only I had the punishing of
such       as he."



"Perhaps he will get his punishment, even as you could
desire it. Perhaps he has got it."



"I pray God it may be so."



Quite suddenly Hendrie turned about and faced her. His
face was thrown into the shadow by the light of the window,
which was now behind him.



"These are past days, Mon," he said, in his decided fashion.
"We have to do with errors, faults of the present. I must
get to work at once to repair something of the damage I have
done. You employed detectives. Who?"



"The Redtown Agency."



"Good. I will see them at once. You must dine alone tonight.
I will report later."



The man moved suddenly across to his desk, and one hand
fell heavily upon the carved mahogany of it. He looked
across into the face of the woman he loved, and the fire of a
great purpose shone in his eyes.



"Thank God I am the rich man I am!" he cried. "Thank
God for the power of wealth. You shall see, Mon, you shall
see! Leave me now, for I must       work. Hark!"



The deep note of the dinner gong rang out its opulent song
in the hall.



"Dinner!" Hendrie remained standing. "You had better
go       now."



Monica reluctantly moved toward the door and opened it.



"Very well, dear," she said. "You will tell me all you have
done       later. Thank God, there is no more need for secrecy
between us."



The brilliant light of the hall silhouetted her figure as she
stood. But for once, though his eyes took in every detail of
the picture she made, Alexander Hendrie remained wholly
unappreciative.



His mind was already far away, moving swiftly over other,
long past scenes. He was not even thinking of the innocent
victim of his jealousy. He was traveling again the long, lean,
cruel winter trail. He was once more toiling amid the snows
of the bitter north.



"You are sure, sure       it can be done?"



The spell was broken.



"Sure," the man replied, with a heavy sigh.



The door closed. The darkened room was still and silent.
For some moments the man remained standing where he was.
Then he slowly moved over the soft rugs to the light switch
on the wall, and his hand rested upon it. He hesitated.
Then, with an impatient movement, he pressed the brass
knob, and the room was flooded with light.



He stared out across the sumptuous furnishings, but did
not attempt to move. His face was ghastly in the glare of
light. His eyes were full of horror and straining.



Presently he moved a step toward the desk. It was only
one step. He halted. Slowly his look of horror deepened.
He raised one great hand and passed the fingers of it through
his mane of tawny hair. It was the movement of a man half
dazed. Then his lips moved.



"Audie!" he murmured, in a hoarse whisper. "Audie!"






CHAPTER III



TWO LETTERS



Number "Forty-nine" was standing just inside and clear
of the door of his cell. It was dinner time in the Alston Penitentiary.
On the gallery outside the faint hubbub of the
distribution of food just reached him. He was hungry, even
for prison fare.



"Forty-nine" heard the trolley stop at the door of the
next cell. He heard the click of the lock as the door was
opened. Then came the sodden sound of something moist
emptied into a pannikin, and then the swish of liquid. The
door clicked again, and he knew his turn was next.



The trolley stopped. His door opened. A man, in the
hideous striped costume, like his own, of a fellow-convict,
winked up into his face. It was the friendly wink of an evil
eye. The man passed him in a loaf of black bread. Then,
with a dexterity almost miraculous, a second loaf shot into
"forty-nine's" hands, and was immediately secreted in the
rolled hammock, which served for a bed.



The whole thing was done almost under the very eyes of a
watchful warder. But he remained in ignorance of it. The
double ration was a friendly act that was more than appreciated,
however evil the eye that winked its sympathy. The
prisoner's shining pannikin was filled, and a thin stream of
cocoa was poured into his large tin cup. Then the trolley
and its attendants passed on, and the door automatically
closed.



"Forty-nine" glanced about him, and, finally, sat on the
floor of his cell. He sniffed at the vegetable stew in his
pannikin, and tasted it. Yes, he was too hungry to reject
the watery slush. He took a loaf, tore it in shreds with his
fingers and sopped it in the liquid. Then he devoured it as
rapidly as the hard black crust would permit. After that his
attention was turned to the cocoa. The same process was
adopted here, and, by the time his meal was finished, and the
process of cleaning his utensils was begun, his appetite was
fully appeased.



It was a hideous place, this dreadful cell. It was bare
from the ceiling above to the hard floor on which he was
sitting. In one corner a hammock was rolled up to a universal
pattern adopted throughout the prison. There was
a small box in one corner in which cleaning materials were
carefully packed, and close by were placed two books from
the prison library. For the rest there was nothing but the
bare walls, in which, high up, was set a grated aperture to
admit light and air.



After cleaning up his utensils in orthodox fashion "forty-nine"
went to his box and produced a lump of uneatable, half
cured bacon fat, left from his breakfast. With this he calmly
set to work on a process of massaging his hands. The work
of the convict prison was cruel. In a short while hands would
become a mere mockery of their original form. To obviate
this, the fat bacon process had been adopted, and "forty-nine"
had learned it from the fellow-convicts, more familiar
with the ways and conditions of prison life.



"Forty-nine's" self-appointed task was just completed
when, without warning, the door of his cell suddenly opened,
and the burly form of a rubber-shod warder appeared.



"Forty-nine! For the governor. Right away!"



There was just a suspicion of softening from the warder's
usual manner in the order.



"Forty-nine" looked up without interest. His eyes were
hollow, his cheeks drawn. A deep, hopeless melancholy
seemed to weigh upon his whole expression. A year of one
of the hardest penitentiaries in the country, with the prospect
of years of service yet to complete, left hope far beyond
the reach of his crushed spirit. He stood up obediently.
His manner was pathetically submissive. His great frame,
little more than frame, towered over his guard.



The man stood aside from the doorway and the convict
passed out.





The governor looked up from his desk in the center of a
large, simply furnished hall. Behind a wrought iron cage at
the far end of the apartment stood number "Forty-nine,"
with the warder close behind.



The governor turned to his secretary and spoke in an
undertone. He was a youngish, baldheaded man who had
acquired nothing of the hardness of visage to be found in his
subordinates. Just now there was something almost like a
kindly, sympathetic twinkle in his eyes as he opened out a
sheaf of papers, evidently to do with the man just ushered
into his presence.



The secretary rose from his seat and walked over to the
iron cage. Unfastening a heavy lock he flung it open. To
the prisoner, full of the bitterness of his lot, it almost seemed
as though he were some wild beast being suddenly released
from captivity.



The secretary signed to the warder to bring his charge
into the room. This unusual proceeding left the astonished
warder at a loss. And it required a sharp order from the
governor himself to move him.



"Forty-nine" was conducted to the far side of the desk,
and the governor looked him in the face.



"I am pleased to be able to inform you       er       a free pardon
has been       er       extended to you."



The announcement was made in formal tones, but the
look in the eyes of the speaker was the only human thing to
be found in the notorious Alston Penitentiary. Even the
worst criminals who were brought into contact with Governor
Charles Raymond had, however grudgingly, to admit
his humanity, which only left it the greater mystery that the
methods of his prison were all so directly opposed to his
nature.



"Forty-nine" started. For a moment the settled melancholy
of his cadaverous face lightened. A hand went up to
his head as though to ascertain that he was not dreaming.
It came into contact with the bristles of his cropped hair,
and dropped at once to his side.



"I'm to go       free, sir?"



"That's precisely what I'm telling you."



"Forty-nine's" eyes rolled. He looked from the governor
to the secretary.



"Pardon?" he said. Then a hot light grew in his eyes at
an inner sense of injustice in the method of his release.
"But I've done nothing wrong, sir."



Charles Raymond smiled. But his smile was genuine and
expressed none of the usual incredulity.



"That is a matter for yourself. I simply receive my
orders from the usual authorities. Those orders are that a
free pardon has been extended to you. I also have here a
letter for you, which, since it is in a lady's handwriting, and
you are to be released at once, I have waived the regulations
and refrained from opening. You will receive your railroad
fare to whatever place in the country you wish to go. Also
the usual prison allowance in cash. That will do. The
prison chaplain will visit you before you go out."



"I don't need to see him, sir. He tires me."



The secretary looked up sharply at the fiercely resentful
tone of the prisoner's denial. But the governor only smiled.



"As you will," he said, and signed again to the warder.
"Your letter will be handed to you at the outer gate       with
the other things."



"Forty-nine" was marched off. He re-entered the iron
cage and vanished amid the labyrinth of iron galleries
beyond.



As he passed out of the office the governor turned to his
secretary.



"I've looked up the record of that man's trial. Guess
there's some mystery behind it. Poor devil. Only a youngster,
too. I wonder." Then he turned to his papers again.
"Well, they got him by the heels, and started him on the
road to hell, anyway. Poor devil."



The secretary's murmured agreement with his chief's
commiseration was non-committal. He had no sympathy.
He took his salary and anything else that came his way.
To him convicts were not human.





It was late in the afternoon when Frank Burton found
himself at the outer wicket of the prison. He was clad now
in his own clothes; the clothes he had worn on the night of
his arrest. His prairie hat was crushed unusually low upon
his close-cropped head. As he approached he called out his
number for the last time.



"Forty-nine!"



The guard was ready for him.



"Going to Toronto?" he said, pushing a paper and pen
toward him. "Twenty-eight dollars and seventy cents.
Prison allowance four dollars fifty. Your letter. Sign!"



The money was handed to him in separate amounts, and
the letter was placed beside them. Frank signed in a trembling
hand, and took his possessions. Then he moved toward
the wicket.



"So long!" cried the chief guard. Then he added facetiously.
"Maybe I'll see you again some day."



Frank made no answer. He was beyond words. He
passed through the wicket, which the guard opened for him,
and stood outside in the summer evening light       a free man.



But he experienced no feeling of elation. A sort of
apathy had got hold of him. His liberty now seemed almost
a matter of indifference, and it was merely a mechanical
movement that took him away from the frowning gray
stone ramparts which had held him for a long twelve months.
He had no thought of whither his steps were taking him.
That, too, seemed to be a matter of no importance.



He moved on and on, quite slowly. His letter was still
unopened in his pocket, whence it had been thrust along
with his money. The trail wound its way down the hill upon
which the prison stood. It led on, nearly two miles away, to
the village of Alston. But it might have been Chicago for
all Frank cared.



He was thinking of the past year, and all the events which
led up to his incarceration, with the bitterness of spirit
which only such unutterable degradation could inspire. Nor,
curiously enough, were his feelings directed against the
author, or the methods by which his downfall had been
brought about. All that had long since exhausted itself
during the interminable hours of wakefulness spent in his
stuffy cell. His feelings against the man had worn themselves
out, that is, they had settled down to a cold, unemotional
hatred. No, it was the thought of life itself which
haunted him like an evil shadow, from which he would gladly
have escaped.



For him life seemed to be ended. Whichever way he
looked it was the same. Nothing could help him, nothing
could save him from the hideous stigma under which he lay.
He was a convict, an ex-convict, and to the hour of his death
so he would remain. Wherever he went the pointing finger
would follow him. There was no escape. The brutalizing
influence under which he had existed for twelve months had
got into his very bones.



He told himself that he belonged to the underworld, to
the same world to which some of those wretched beings belonged
who had only escaped death at the hands of the law
on some slight quibble, and with whom he had so recently
herded. The daylight could never again be for him. He belonged
to the darkened streets where recognition was less
easy, where crime stalked abroad, and flitting shadows of
pursuer and pursued hovered the night long.



He sank wearily at the roadside. His weariness was of
spirit. His body was as hard as nails from the tremendous
physical labors of the past year. A morbid craving to review
his wrongs was upon him, that and an invincible desire
to wait for the gathering of the evening shadows.



The westering sun was shining full upon him. A great
waste of open land stretched away toward a purple line of
low hills, fringed with a darker shadow of woods. Not a
living soul was about, no one but himself seemed to be upon
that trail       and he was glad.



For long hours he sat brooding, and, with each passing
minute, his morbid fancies grew. He felt that from the beginning
he had been doomed to disaster, and he only wondered
that he had not realized it before. Was he not a
bastard? Was he not a nobody? His father? He never
had a father, only the wretched creature whose selfish passions
had brought him into the world.



He saw it all in its true colors now. He could more fully
understand it. That was the brand under which he was
born, and it was a brand which was part of the criminal
side of life.



His thoughts drifted on to Phyllis. She had not understood
when he told her. How could she? She was clean,
she was wholesome, she was born in wedlock. She       but he
turned impatiently from the drift of his thoughts. He could
never go back to her. She, like his mother, was a part of
that life which was over and done with. He belonged to
another world now. The underworld.



The underworld. But why       why should he live on, part
of a world he hated and loathed? Why should he permit the
cruel injustice of such a fate? There was a way to defeat
this ruthless enemy. Why not adopt it? Why live? He
had no desire to do so. He had the means at his disposal.
He had money with which to procure a gun. Why go to
Toronto at all? Why show his shaven head to the world, an
object for that hateful, pointing finger?



For a while the idea pleased him. It was such a simple
remedy for all his sufferings. He had passed out of Phyllis's
life, so why risk the finger of scorn being pointed at her
through the fact of his existence. And his mother. His
gentle mother. He caught his breath. The finger of scorn
would never be a burden to her. She was not like others.
Her memory still retained the faintest sheen of light amid
his darkness. He knew, even in those dark moments, that
his self-inflicted death would utterly destroy her life. No.
He was condemned to this under              



He remembered his unopened letter, and drew it from his
pocket. He had not looked at it before. It had never occurred
to him that he had any connection still with a world
beyond the gray stone prison walls.



Now he looked at the envelope, and felt the hot blood of
shame sweep up to his tired brain as he saw that it bore his
mother's handwriting. He opened it reluctantly enough.



Folded carefully inside a number of sheets of closely written
paper was a large sum of money. He took it out and
examined it. There were five thousand dollars. Most of it
was in bills of large denomination, but on the top, with
careful forethought, there were half a dozen which ran from
ten dollars down to one dollar bills. He understood, and
the careful attention only left him the more pained.



With these was a smaller envelope. It was addressed in
Phyllis's well-known hand. This, with the money, he bestowed
in an inner pocket and proceeded to read his mother's
letter first.



But the pathos of it, the breaking heart, which was sufficiently
apparent in every line of that long story she had to
tell, passed him utterly by, and left him unmoved. Just now
he had no sympathy for anything or anybody in the world
but himself, and it would have needed the heart of a Puritan
to have blamed him. Yet his reading was not without interest
in spite of the hardness of his mood.



It was a long, long story that Monica had to tell him, and
it was full of that detail, rambling detail, inspired by the
knowledge that she no longer had anything to conceal, the
knowledge that the truth could be indulged in, in a manner
that had been so long denied her. From the very outset she
told him the real facts of his birth, and it was with something
approaching regret that he learned that she, Monica,
was not his mother. Somehow the shame of his birth, as it
had reflected upon her, was forgotten. Somehow the stigma
seemed to belong to him solely.



In her story she carried him through the old, old days of
their life together, reminding him of trials and struggles
never before fully explained. Tribulations which pointed
for him her devotion and loyalty to the dead and the living.



Then she passed on to the manner in which he had been
trapped by her husband. Here were displayed her passion-torn
feelings, which left the man cold. She gave all the details
in uncolored nakedness, and while condemning utterly,
the cruelty and injustice of her husband, she yet pointed
his motives and pleaded for him.



Then she passed on to the manner of her own discovery
of his whereabouts in prison, her own discovery of her husband's
ruthless handiwork. And again came that note of
pleading for the man she loved. She told him how Hendrie,
directly he discovered his hideous mistake, moved heaven
and earth, and scattered money broadcast, to obtain his
release; and how, at last, he had succeeded.



Finally she appealed to him with all the ardor of a
mother's love to come back to her at once. To come back
and receive all the reparation which she and her husband
were yearning to make.



At the end of the reading Frank refolded the letter and
returned it to his pocket. In spite of the identity of its
author, in spite of his own natural kindliness of heart, there
was not one sign of softening in his now hardened blue eyes.



It was different, however, with his second letter. Phyllis
had no story to tell, she had no forgiveness to plead for any
one. She merely had the fullness of her own simple, loving
heart to pour out at his feet. Not once through four pages
of closely written paper did she hint at his hardships, his
dreadful wrongs. She loved him, she wanted him, as she believed
he loved and wanted her; and so she just told him,
as only Phyllis, with her wide understanding and simplicity
of heart could have told him.



As he returned this letter to his pocket there was a
marked difference in his manner. There was a lingering tenderness
in his actions, and a dewy moisture about his hollow
eyes.



The sun had set, and a golden twilight was softening the
world to a gentle, almost velvet tone as he rose from the edge
of the grass-lined trail. He stood erect. That painful
slouch he had acquired during the past year appeared to
have left his shoulders. His head was lifted, and he began
to walk down the trail at a gait full of decision and purpose.
Phyllys's love had heartened him as it always heartened him.
Something of his morbid shadows had receded before the
brightly burning lamp of her love. He felt a better man,
and a spirit of defiance had risen to combat the claims of
that underworld which had threatened to swallow him up.



At Alston he made his way to a store where he could procure
some letter paper and envelopes. Just for one moment
he hesitated at the door of the building. He was
about to meet a free citizen. One who had never known
prison bars. With a thrust he drew his hat well down to his
ears, squared his shoulders and went in. His precautions
proved needless. The man who served him was used to such
visitors, and quite indifferent. He scarcely even looked at
him as he fulfilled his order, and took the prison money.



Frank hurried away. His self-consciousness was quite
painful. But he meant to beat it.



His next effort was a restaurant. He was a long time
making his selection. Nor did it occur to him to wonder at
the number of cheap eating houses this small village supported.
Finally, however, he accepted the doubtful hospitality
of a Chinese establishment where they dispensed a
cheap chop-suey. Again his appearance caused no surprise
as he gave his order and then sat down at a corner table.



Here he drew out his letter paper and laid it on the much-stained
table before him, and, in a moment, had forgotten
the almond-eyed attendant who was preparing his food.



He felt it necessary to answer Monica's letter at once.
His purpose was definite and quite clear in his mind. The
past, his past, their past was done with. He would face the
world alone, and on his own resources. The letter was quite
short and was finished before the Chinaman brought him his
food.



His meal finished and bill settled, he waited until the lynx-eyed
Mongolian was engaged elsewhere. Then he placed the
letter and the five thousand dollars into an envelope and addressed
it to Monica at Winnipeg. It was his intention to
mail the packet from Toronto.






CHAPTER IV



ON THE RAILROAD



No man may serve a term of imprisonment in a modern
prison and return to freedom on the same moral plane as he
left it. A man may fall, but he may rise again, provided he
is saved from that lifelong branding which a penal prison
leaves upon its victim. Innocent or guilty the modern prison
system is an invention which must rob its victim for ever of
his confidence, his self-respect, almost of his hope. It is an
institution set up to protect the free citizen, and terrorize
the wrong-doer into better ways. And it does neither of these
things. Instead, it pours upon society, daily, a stream of
hopeless, hardened, bitter creatures, who, through its merciless
process, have abandoned what little grip they ever had
upon their moral natures, and drives them along the broad,
ill-lit road of crime. Instead of being the deterrent it is
supposed to be, it is the worst creator of crime known to
civilization.



These were some of the reflections forced upon young
Frank Burton after twelve months' bitter experience in
Alston Penitentiary. And now, with each passing moment
of his new freedom, the truth of these painful observations
was more and more surely brought home to him. An innocent
man, he had come out into the light of freedom, dreading and
shrinking before every eye that was turned in his direction.
His self-confidence was shaken. All his old trust and belief
in the goodness of the life about him seemed to have melted
into dark and painful suspicion, and, for the time at least, he
was forced into those darkened purlieus which belong to the
world of crime. The light was unendurable.



He had changed terribly from the buoyant lad he had been.
He had seen so much, thought so much during those twelve
long months, that now he was weighted down by a maturity
that belonged to twice his years.



He knew he could never go back to the old life. That he
had long since made up his mind up to. More than that, he
could not accept benefits from those who belonged to it,
whom he had known and loved. Even Phyllis, for all her
ardent affection, she, too, belonged to a life that was wholly
dead.



The future, his future, lay in his own two empty hands.
Those whom he loved, and those whom he hated and despised
could have no part in it. Were it otherwise he felt that to
see Monica would be to bring him into contact with Hendrie,
and such contact could only stir in him all the evil influences
of the prison, influences from which it was his determination
to escape.



Phyllis? Little Phyllis?



No. She must go, too. The band of the criminal had
sunk too deeply into his soul. She must be left free. No
such contamination must be brought into her life. His love
for her was far too great for him to submit her to such a
dreadful disaster as marriage with an ex-convict.



He had thought of all these things before, he thought
again of them now. They were rarely absent from his mind.



The moment he read Monica's letter he knew what he intended
to do. And it was the same when he hungrily devoured
the words of devotion he received from Phyllis.
Dealing with Monica's letter had been simple enough. With
Phyllis's it was a far different matter. He wanted her to
understand. He knew he must hurt her, but he felt that by
presenting all his feelings to her, she, with her wide understanding,
would appreciate and accept his decisions.



The whole journey from Alston to Fieldcoats, in the old-fashioned
rumbling "stage," was given up to these hopeless
meditations of an outcast. And he was glad of it. He was
glad that he had the time to think of the letter he must send
this girl at once.



It was dark when the twinkling lights of Fieldcoats, the
nearest town where he would take train for Toronto, came
into view, and he was glad of that friendly obscurity. His
shrinking from the light was no morbid feeling. With his
close-cropped head the story of his recent past was open for
every one to read.



He did not complete the journey to the final halting place
of the stage, but dropped off it in the lower and more obscure
part of the town. It was here that he meant to begin
his new life. A cheap, clean bed was all he desired, just a
place where he could rest between sheets, and write his long
letter to Phyllis. He wanted something solid on four legs.
Something which would not remind him of the hammock he
had learned to hate.



He found the place he required without difficulty. It
vaunted the title, "The Alexandra Hotel," and its beds, in
cubicles, were let out at twenty-five cents and ten cents a
night. It was a mere "dossing house," but that was quite a
matter of indifference. He felt he had no right to squeamishness.



He booked one of the higher priced cubicles and ascertained
that it was clean. Then, with a sigh of resignation,
and some squaring of the shoulders, he prepared to face the
curious eyes of the derelicts who haunted the "office" of the
establishment.



To face even these, with his close-cropped head, Frank
found no light task, but he knew that for weeks yet he must
keep himself hardened to the consciousness of his prison
brand. The only thing possible was a desperately bold
front, a front that would intimidate the curious, and, if
necessary, he must follow it up with all it threatened.



So he entered the room and calmly looked about him. He
was big, spare, and enormously powerful. His hard blue
eyes deliberately sought for any eye that might be turned
in his direction. His trouble was wasted. He forgot that
these poor creatures, lounging upon the hard Windsor
chairs, reading papers, or staring hopelessly before them
while they smoked, were derelicts like himself. Nobody
gave him the slightest heed, and he was left to seek out his
obscure corner where he could write in peace.



Once assured of his immunity, Frank began his letter, and
promptly became completely lost to his surroundings. The
long-pent thoughts of the past year flowed passionately as
he attempted to show the girl he loved all that which lay
deep down in his simple heart.



It was not, perhaps, the convincing letter of a deep
thinker. It was not a letter full of the refinement of logical
argument. He wrote just as he thought, and felt, and saw,
with a mind tinged by the dark hues of his own sufferings and
the sufferings of others.



He told her, simple creature that he was, of all his love
for her. He told her of the aching heart which this definite
parting left him with, and, in the same breath almost, he
told her that he regarded it as his sacred duty to shield her
from contamination with a disgrace such as his. He forgot
that where a real woman's love is concerned, duty, and perhaps
any other scruple is willingly flung aside.



His simplicity carried him into deeper water, for he wrote
long and ardently of his own future, a future conceived, and
to be founded upon all he had seen and experienced in prison.
Again he forgot the wide mind of the girl he was writing to,
and blindly believed that the sincerity and honesty of his
motives must appeal to her.



It was altogether a headlong sort of letter. He wrote as
he thought and felt, and scarcely paused for a word or
phrase. The gist of it was a yearning for a sort of sublime
socialism. He could not longer bear the thought of self-seeking.
He had seen so much of the disastrous results of
it that he felt and knew that the whole process of it was
utterly wrong. The prisons were filled with its results.



Those things, he said, had started his train of thought,
and, with each passing day, his eyes had become more fully
opened.



All the old ambitions, he told her, had been rooted out of
him for ever. They were the natural impulses of a heart and
mind all untutored, and far too immature for the real understanding
of life. He had desired wealth and place in the
world, and it had seemed good to him to so desire. Nor was
it to be wondered at. Such desires had been inspired by
honest motives, if, perhaps, selfish. They were just the first
teachings of life until       it presented the reverse side of the
picture.



He had been shown the reverse of the picture, and it had
come in time. For twelve months he had gazed upon it and
learned its lessons. For twelve months he had groped amid
the cobwebs of life and sought among the darkened corners.
That which he had discovered there had plainly shown him
that, for him, past and future ambitions were divided by a
gulf that could never be bridged again. In future his life
would be cast on the side of the helpless and struggling, on
the side of the oppressed, and those who were less endowed
for the battle of life.



The battle of life? There should be no battle. There
never was a battle intended. Why should there be? Was
there not more than enough to go round? It was only because
the laws of man permitted accumulations to the individual
and so reduced more than half the world to a position
bordering on starvation, a condition which lay at the very
root of all crime. The old belief in the survival of the fittest
was a dead one. It applied to simple physical conditions,
not to the right to enjoy a fair share of those blessings a
beneficent Creator had provided for the benefit of all. Think
of it, he appealed, think of the king of beasts cornering all
the food upon which his species depended to support life.
Picture one proud brute standing over a hoard of rotting
flesh, flourishing his tail and snarling defiance at a crowd
of starving creatures of his own kind. Would they permit
it? Would they leave him in possession? No, they would
set upon him in their numbers, and, in desperation, they
would tear him limb from limb.



Brotherhood and Equality! That was to be the keynote
of his future. Henceforth all his power, all his heart should
be flung into the only cause that could make the world
endurable.



So he wrote to this girl of more than common wisdom, and
he told himself she would understand. He told himself that
though their lives could never come together again, at least
he would possess her sympathy.



It was long past midnight when Frank's letter was folded
in its cheap envelope and addressed. But its writing had
done him good. It had been inspired by a big heart, if little
wisdom, and he felt that he had taken his first step upon the
new road opening out before him.



There were still stragglers in the office when he finally retired
to his cubicle. Some were sleepily drunk, after an evening
spent in "cadging" drinks among the low-class saloons in
the neighborhood. Some were merely utterly weary with a
long day of vain searching for some means of livelihood. All
were unkempt and tattered, and most of them dirty.



These were some of the poor creatures belonging to the
ranks of those, who, in his lofty ideals of the work that lay
before him, Frank hoped to range himself on the side of. In
his youthful blindness he failed utterly to recognize the
workings of the definite laws of compensation. He missed
entirely the most glaring fact of life. It passed him by that
the majority of these were able-bodied men who had wilfully
thrown away the chances which life never fails to offer, for
the indulgence of those selfish passions which in his heart he
abhorred.



That night he slept the fitful sleep of a man unused to his
surroundings, but he was sufficiently refreshed when the hour
appointed for arising in such places arrived. He turned
out quite ready to face all that the day might bring forth.
He knew that he must endure many trials of patience and
feelings. But he intended to face them with a brave heart.



Ten cents was all he allowed himself for his breakfast.
He required only sufficient to sustain life, nor did he obtain
more for the money. Then he made his way to the railroad
depot, forcing himself to a blindness for the attention his
appearance attracted. Here he made inquiries as to the
train, and booked his passage. The train for Toronto left
just before noon, so he purchased a newspaper and sat down
in the waiting-hall. He intended to pass the time scanning
the advertisements, that he might learn the best means of
obtaining employment when he arrived at his destination.



The train was "on time," and, in due course, Frank
boarded it. The car he selected was fairly empty. At the
far end of it a party of people, evidently a family party, occupied
several seats. For the rest five or six men and two
women were scattered about its length.



He took his place in the rear seat of the coach, feeling
that it was preferable to have no inquisitive eyes behind him.
Those who displayed marked attention from in front he felt
confident of being able to deal with. But he reckoned without
his host.



The first part of his journey was quite uneventful. But
at the first important town at which the train stopped several
passengers boarded the car. Among them was a man
with closely trimmed iron gray hair, and quick, searching
eyes that closely scanned the faces of each person in the car.



His stare was not wholly rude. It was the searching
glance of a man who is accustomed to studying his fellows,
who never fails to do so at any opportunity. He took a
corner seat just across the aisle of the car, and on the level
immediately in front of Frank. He sat turned so that the
whole view of the car came within his focus. Nor was it a
matter of more than moments before Frank's cropped head
came under his observation.



Frank felt that this was so, although he was studiously
intent upon his paper, and, as the fixed contemplation remained,
he chafed under it. For some time he endured it,
hoping that, the man's curiosity satisfied, he would turn
away. But nothing of the sort happened. The stranger's
interest became riveted.



Frank felt himself grow hot with resentment. He determined
to put an end to it by the simple process of staring
the man out of countenance. To this end he looked up
sharply, and with anything but a friendly expression in his
cold eyes. As their eyes met there was something like a deliberate
challenge in the exchange. The man made no attempt
to withdraw his gaze, and Frank found himself looking
into a clean-shaven, keen, determined face, lit by a pair of
hard, satirical eyes.



Promptly the position became more than intolerable, and
Frank was driven to a very natural verbal protest. He
sprang from his seat and crossed the aisle. Leaning across
the back of the stranger's seat he voiced his annoyance deliberately
and coldly.



"It seems to me you'll probably know me when you see me
again," he said, with angry sarcasm.



The stranger smiled amiably.



"Just depends when I meet you," he retorted, with a
meaning glance at the close-cropped hair displayed under the
brim of Frank's hat.



A sudden anger lit the boy's eyes at the taunt, and a violent
protest leaped to his lips. But the stranger anticipated
him.



"Say," he drawled, "sit right down       here. I wasn't
meaning offence. What got me looking was you're so like       an
old friend of mine. You brought the other on yourself.
Won't you sit       right down?"



The stranger's manner was so disarmingly cordial that
Frank's heat began to die down. Still, he had no intention
of accepting the invitation.



"Maybe you didn't intend rudeness, but that isn't the
point," he said deliberately. "I'm not the man to stand rudeness
from       anybody."



"Sure," said the other calmly. "Guess that's how we
all feel. Say, it's the queerest thing. Guess you're 'bout
twenty or so. Just about his age. You're the dead image of       my
friend, when he was your age. You got blue eyes and
his were gray. It's the only spark of difference. Going up
Toronto way?"



Frank nodded. He somehow felt he could do no less, without
returning in cold silence to his seat. Somehow he felt
that to do so would be churlish, in spite of the fact that he
was the aggrieved.



The keen-eyed stranger recognized his advantage in obtaining
the admission, and promptly followed it up. He indicated
the seat beside him and persisted in his invitation.



"Best sit," he said, with a pleasant smile. "It's quite a
long piece to Toronto. I'd a heap like to yarn with you."



The stranger was altogether too much for the simplicity
of the other. Besides, there was nothing but amiability in
his manner. Perhaps after all he had been hasty, Frank
thought. He was so sensitive about the brand of the prison
he carried about with him. The shame of it was always with
him. Anyway, it could not hurt talking to this man, and it
would help pass the time. He allowed himself to be persuaded,
and half reluctantly dropped into the seat.



"Say, that's friendly," commented the stranger, with a
sharp, sidelong glance at Frank's strong profile. "There's
just one thing I got set against this country. It's a hell of
a ways between cities. Maybe you don't get that across in
England."



"I've never been in England," Frank admitted.



"Ah. Maybe States?"



Frank nodded. And the man laughed.



"The land of Freedom, Graft and Finance."



"Yes, it's an odd mixture," agreed Frank. "It's also a
land of slavery. A queer contradiction, but nevertheless
true. Three parts of the people are held in bondage to the
other fourth, who represent Capital."



The stranger stirred and settled himself. He gazed
keenly into his companion's face.



"Guess you were one of the 'three parts,' and found the
fourth       oppressive."



Frank shifted his position uneasily. Then with a sudden
curious abandonment he spread his hands out.



"Say," he cried, his cheeks flushing, "I don't know what
makes me talk to you       a stranger. You're the first man
who has wanted to speak to me since       I came out. I know
you've spotted my cropped head, so what's the use of trying
to deny it. Yes, I've found it, I suppose. But not in the
States. Just right here in Canada, where things are much
the same. I've just come out of Alston Penitentiary. I
was sentenced wrongfully to five years, and now, at the end
of one of them they've found out my innocence, and given
me a free pardon       for not being guilty."



"A free pardon?" The stranger's eyes were reading his
companion through and through.



"Yes, a free pardon for an offence I never committed,"
Frank went on, with bitter indignation. "It
doesn't matter how or where it happened. But the whole
thing was worked. I mean my trial, by a man of       well,
one of the millionaire class       one of the other 'fourth.'
Perhaps you'll understand now why I hated you staring
at me."



The stranger nodded sympathetically.



"Guess I'm real sorry," he said.



Frank shook his head.



"It doesn't matter       now. It's done me good to tell       somebody.
See." He drew out his prison discharge and
showed it to his companion, who read it over carefully.
"You don't need to take my word. That'll tell you all you
need to know."



The other looked up.



"Frank Smith?" he said.



"Frank Burton's my name. I used the other so as to
keep it from folks I didn't want to know about it."



"I see." The stranger was studying the clean cut of the
ingenuous face beside him. "And now they'll know       I
s'pose?"



"They've found out for themselves." The youngster's
blue eyes were shadowed in gloom.



"Ah!" The other glanced out of the window a moment.
"And       what are you going to do? Go back to       'em?"



The gloomy blue eyes were turned away. Frank was
staring introspectively down the aisle of the car.



"No," he said at last. "I'm not going back to them."
Then he sat up and looked at his companion earnestly. "To
go back would mean to become one of the other 'fourth.'
The ranks of the submerged three-quarters is my future.
I've learned a lot in the last twelve months. Say, have you
ever been inside a prison."



The stranger's sharp eyes lit with a brief smile. It was
not a really pleasant face with its narrow eyes; nor was it a
pleasant smile. He shook his head.



"I've seen 'em       from the outside. I'm not yearning to
get a peek inside."



Frank looked disappointed.



"It's a pity," he said. "You see, you won't understand
just how I see things. Do you know, the prisons are just
full to overflowing with folks who'd be free to-day       if it
weren't for the existence of that other 'fourth'? Oh, I don't
mean they've been deliberately put away by the wealthy folk.
I'm just learning that one of the greatest causes of all crime,
is that, under present conditions, there isn't enough to go
round."



The stranger's smile had become more encouraging.



"And the cure for it is       Socialism, eh?"



Frank started. Then he nodded.



"I suppose that's what folks would call it. I call it
Brotherhood and Equality."



"Go a step further," said the other. "It's that 'fourth,'
we are talking about, who get rich and live on the efforts of
the worker whom they sweat and crush into the very ground
over which their automobiles roll. Put it in plain words,
man. It is the worker, the poor wretch that just manages to
scrape existence by grinding toil, who feeds the rich and
makes possible the degrading luxury of their lives. And
when the first hope of youth gets swamped by the grind of
their labors, and they see their equally wretched wives and
hungry children going without the barest necessities of life,
and before them lies nothing but the dreary road of incessant
toil, with no earthly chance of bettering themselves, then
they grow desperate, and help to fill those hells of despair
we call penitentiaries. That's what you've realized in
prison."



Frank stared at the man. The force of his manner was
such as to carry absolute conviction of his personal feelings
upon this matter, feelings which also lay so deep in the heart
of the ex-convict. He wondered at the strange chance which
had brought him into contact with a man who shared these
new feelings and beliefs of his. Could it be              ?



"You believe that way, too?" he asked eagerly.



At that moment a waiter from the dining-car entered the
coach.



"First call for dinner! First call for dinner!" He passed
down the car issuing his invitation in high, nasal tones.



The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat pockets, and, as the
waiter passed, he produced his card, and held it out toward
his companion.



"Say," he observed, lapsing once more into his more
genial manner. "Guess you'll be yearning for a billet when
you get along to Toronto. Just keep that by you, and when
you're needing one, come and look me up. We're always
needing recruits for our work. I'll take it kindly if you'll
eat with me right now."



Frank took the card and read the name on it       





                       MR. AUSTIN LEYBURN,



             2012 Mordaunt Avenue, Toronto, Ont.

    President of the Agricultural Helpers' Society of Canada.
               Gen. Sec. Bonded Railroaders.
         Asst.-Gen. Sec. Associated Freighters' Combine.






CHAPTER V



A YOUNG GIRL'S PURPOSE



With her determined little chin thrust into the palm of
her hand, and her elbow propped upon the window ledge of
the railroad car, Phyllis made a delightful picture of country
simplicity. She was dressed in a plain gown of some soft,
dark blue material, and flung back from her shoulders was
a heavy, plaid-lined cape, a garment she had borrowed for
the journey. On the seat in front of her was a well-worn suit
case of cheap compressed cane. It had evidently seen much
service, though such service could hardly have been given in
the city world toward which she was speeding. Reposing on
top of this was her black felt hat. Here, again, her western
farm upbringing was evidenced. It was a mixture, contrived
out of a man's prairie hat into something of that modern
product affected by young girls, beneath which its
wearer reveals little but nose and chin. It was Phyllis's
"best," and she rather liked it.



But she was quite unconscious of the country brand she
bore. She was at all times unconscious of herself, in spite
of her youth. Yet she attracted a good deal of notice among
her fellow-passengers.



A commercial drummer had vainly striven for hours to
attract her attention, his florid face set ready at a moment's
notice to wreath itself into an engaging smile, should she
chance to glance in his direction.



Then, too, a youth, in the company of an elderly female
relative, had gone through a severe process of neck wringing,
several seats in front of her, in the vain hope that her interest
in the absurd fields of wheat through which they were
passing might abate in his favor.



Besides these it was a curious fact that this particular car
demanded so much attention from the train crew. One
official bore down on her, and, with unusual courtesy, asked
her if he should open a window near her to cool the air.
Having achieved his purpose of receiving smiling thanks, he
added a few remarks, passed on, and another came along
and threatened pleasantly to close it, as he was sure she was
in a draught. A third brought her a pillow and refused to
take money for it, the significance of which left her wholly
unconscious.



But the guard. Well, the guard seemed to have nothing
in the world to do but examine her ticket. The railroad
officials certainly did their very best for her.



Through it all, the girl's whole interest seemed to lay in the
wonderful cloth of gold spread over the world through which
they were passing. That and its trimmings in the shape of
farm houses, small settlements, townships just starting, verdant
bluffs and gleaming rivers, all of which glided swiftly
by, a delightful panorama before her wondering eyes, as the
transcontinental mail swept across the prairie lands upon its
east-bound journey.



It was all fresh to her, but none of it was new. She had
been brought up in a corner of this very wheat world, so
she knew it all. Sometimes it was grander and looked more
prosperous, sometimes it was smaller and poorer. But the
method of it was always the same.



Still, she was traveling abroad for the first time in her
young life, and she wanted to see everything there was to see.
Thus, she had traveled for more than two whole days, nor
had she yet exhausted the resources of Canada's great
granary. Indian Head, Moosejaw, Regina, Moosemin,
Brandon, all these places, miles and miles apart, had vanished
into the dim distance behind her, but still the cloth of
golden wheat remained, as she knew it would remain until
Winnipeg was reached.



Funds had not permitted her the luxury of a "sleeper," so
she had faced the discomforts of long days and longer nights
in the ordinary day car. But with her heart set upon a
definite purpose such things were no real hardships to
Phyllis. Just now her one desire in life was to reach Winnipeg,
so nothing else mattered.



It was nearly noon when the conductor of the train entered
the car for perhaps the tenth time that morning. Phyllis
saw him moving down the aisle, and, from force of habit,
got her ticket ready. But the amiable man spared her this
time. He hurried along toward her, and, with the sigh of
an overworked man, dropped into the seat beside her suit
case.



"Guess you'll soon be in Winnipeg, now," he observed,
having learned her anxiety to reach her destination some
twenty or thirty visits to her before.



Phyllis smiled, and her whole face lit up. The conductor
grinned his pleasure at the sight.



"I'm so glad," the girl sighed. "Still, I've had a real
pleasant journey," she added quickly. "You folks have been
very kind to me."



The man's delight was written all over his face.



"Why, that's good of you. But 'tain't just nothin'. Gals
travelin' on their lonesome, it ain't all pie for 'em. We just
like to do our best       when they ain't on the grouch."



Phyllis had abandoned her study of the view.



"I haven't been a grouch, have I?" she demanded.



"Never in your life. Say       you couldn't grouch. 'Tain't
your nature."



Phyllis became aware of the "drummer." His grin was
in full blast. But she quickly ignored him.



"I s'pose you know Winnipeg well?" she hazarded to her
companion, with some eagerness.



"Live there," the man replied, comprehensively.



"Ah, I'm glad. Maybe you know Grand Avenue?"



The man's eyes opened wide.



"Sure I know Grand Avenoo. That's where the big fellers
live. All small houses. Sort o' Fifth Avenoo, Noo York."
Then he grinned. "Say, you ain't figurin' on a hotel in
Grand Avenoo?"



Phyllis flushed.



"Oh, no," she disclaimed hurriedly. "I just want to get
there to       to see a lady who lives there."



The conductor nodded his understanding.



"Sure," he said. "Service. Domestic."



Phyllis's flush deepened.



"Oh, no," she cried. "I'm       I'm just on a visit."



The conductor realized his mistake, and tried to glide over
the fence.



"If you were to tell me the part of Grand Avenoo you're
needing, maybe I could give you the right surface car to
take."



"That would be very kind," Phyllis said earnestly. Then
her dark brows drew together perplexedly. "It's rather
difficult," she went on. "You see, I don't really know just
whereabouts Mrs. Hendrie lives."



"Mrs. Hendrie, d'you say, miss? Mrs. Alexander
Hendrie?"



"Yes, yes. That's the lady," Phyllis cried eagerly. "Do
you know where her house is?"



"Gee!"



"What did you say? I didn't              "



"Beg pardon, miss       I       I just said 'Gee!'" The man
rose from his seat rather hurriedly. "You see, I didn't
just figure you were goin' to Mrs. Alexander Hendrie. You
see, Mr. Hendrie is just about the biggest man in the country,
and       well              "



Phyllis laughed.



"And it seemed queer me going to see them. Of course
it does," she went on, to help the man's confusion. "But
if you'll tell me best how to find Grand Avenue, why, you'll
be doing me a real kindness, just one more."



The girl's tact had prompt effect.



"I'll sure be most pleased miss," the conductor said, with
some emphasis on the last word. "You just go right out
of the booking hall at the depot, and get on to the first Main
Street car you see. It'll take you along up to Grand. Just
give word to the ticket man, an' he'll see you get off right.
We'll be in in less than two hours. We're plumb on time."



He moved away quickly, and Phyllis vaguely understood
that his going had something to do with the fact that she
was going to see the wife of one of the biggest men in the
country. But she quite missed the necessity for the railroader's
exchange of attitude.





Grand Avenue was bathed in sunlight when Phyllis stepped
off the car and looked about her. Automobiles and pair-horse
carriages sped upon their dazzling ways down the
great wide road with a speed and frequency that, for some
moments, left the country girl almost dazed. Her unaccustomed
eyes were wide and wondering, and she clung to
her cane suit case as though for support against the overwhelming
tide of traffic.



After a while, either the stream slackened, or her nerves
became more accustomed, for she made a dash for the sidewalk,
and reached safety once more. Then further dismay
attacked her. She gazed along at the great detached mansions,
which lined the avenue, and the sight gave her understanding
of the train conductor's suggestion that she was
about to enter domestic service. It was in one of these
splendid palaces, she thought, that Mrs. Hendrie lived, and
probably one of the biggest. For a moment she looked
down at her suit case as though she hated it.



Her weakness, however, was quickly passed. She remembered
the object of her visit, and clenched her small white
teeth. All she cared for in the world was at stake in this
desperate visit, and nothing should daunt her.



A large policeman was passing. Noting the girl's evident
hesitation he slackened his pace. He was a genially rubicund
specimen of the force, and inspired confidence. Phyllis
promptly set her suit case down, drew a letter from her
pocket-book and went up to him.



"Will you tell me in which direction that number is, sir?"
she inquired, awed by the man's authority as she held up
the address for his inspection.



The officer's bulging eyes surveyed her from head to foot.
That "sir" had tickled his vanity, and he approved of her.



"One thousand and one?" he said. "Why, that's Alexander
Hendrie's house. Right here behind you       er       miss.
That's Mr. Hendrie's house."



Phyllis thanked him warmly. Then she went back to
her suit case, picked it up, and made for the house with a
rapidly beating heart. It was almost as if everything had
been made especially easy for her, and, in spite of her growing
nervousness, she was very thankful.



The house was well back from the road. It was approached
by a short, unenclosed carriage sweep, lined on
each side by smooth turf, dotted with shrubs and young
trees. The air of wealth was conveyed in the splendidly
kept condition of everything rather than any ostentatious
display. The house itself was a modern production of
decorative architecture, built of massive, beautifully cut
gray stone. The entrance door was beneath a glass and
wrought-iron shelter, which stretched out across the drive
and was supported on massive wrought-iron columns of
exquisite design.



It was not without many heart quakings that Phyllis
ascended the white marble steps and pressed the great button
of the electric bell. Nor were these lessened when the
door was opened with magical abruptness, and she found
herself gazing up at the liveried footman in wonder and
dismay.



The man's cold survey of her was disheartening. Plainly
as looks could speak, he regarded her visit as an impertinent
intrusion, while he waited for her to speak.



It was a critical moment, and Phyllis knew it. The situation
demanded all her courage. Assuming a decision
which quite belied her real feelings, she endeavored to overawe
the man, quite forgetful of the strange hat and stranger
costume she was arrayed in; to say nothing of the deplorable
suit case.



"I want to see Mrs. Hendrie," she demanded shortly.



The man's reply was slow in coming. He devoured her
with eyes which plainly conveyed a definite and contemptuous
refusal.



"Can't be done," he said at last, and prepared to close
the door.



But Phyllis had not traveled all these hundreds of miles
to be defeated by a mere footman.



"Oh, yes, it can," she declared tartly. "And you'll do
best if you remember that you're speaking to a lady. Mrs.
Hendrie is expecting me. Please to tell her Miss Phyllis
Raysun is here       from Gleber."



The absurd dignity of this quaint figure was not without
its effect. The man's manner underwent a slight change,
but he still remained barring the way. At his sign a boy
in uniform stepped forward from some dark corner where
he had been lurking unseen by Phyllis. He stood ready
with a silver tray in his hand.



"Inquire if Mrs. Hendrie is at home," said the footman
loftily. "If she is, will she receive Miss       er       Phyllis Raysun?"



The boy remained with his tray held out. Phyllis was at
a loss. Then she nodded.



"Yes. That's right," she said, failing to understand the
silent demand for a card.



With a smile, which somehow added further to the girl's
angry feelings, the youth hurried away. But the man still
kept her waiting on the step.



Without knowing what she ought to have expected,
Phyllis felt that she was being treated shamefully. She
knew that these liveried underlings were treating her as if
she were some undesirable tramp. It was quite infuriating.
But with so much at stake she felt it safest not to display
too much resentment, so she choked back her indignation and
accepted the affront.



Then quite suddenly a wonderful change came upon the
scene. A change that was evidently utterly unexpected by
the churlish man-servant.



There was a sound of rustling skirts hurrying downstairs.
Then some one brushed the man aside and seized Phyllis's
two ungloved hands, one of which still held the deplorable
suit case.



"My dear, my dear, however did you get here?"



It was Monica. Then she turned angrily upon the discomforted
footman as she drew the girl into the house.



"How dare you keep this lady standing out on the door-step?
How dare you? It's an outrage. It is an outrage
I won't permit in my house. I never heard of such a
thing."



Then she turned upon the scared-faced boy, waiting just
behind her.



"Tell the housekeeper I wish to see her in the library
in an hour's time." Then, in a moment, she was back
again to Phyllis. "Come along, dear. Come up to my
room, and get your things off. Henson will see to your
grip."



But Phyllis clung to the suit case, which she was growing
to hate more and more every moment. She was sure now
that it had had something to do with the rude treatment
she had been subjected to.



"But I       I can carry it, M       Mrs. Hendrie," she cried, the
inevitable "mam" nearly slipping out in spite of her best
efforts.



Monica laughed. She remembered how she, herself, had
felt once upon a time facing an army of servants.



"Very well, dear," she said gently, "but come along."



She took the bewildered girl by the arm, and hurried her
through the great entrance hall. Then up the wide staircase,
and, having left the sharp-eared servants well behind,
opened out a battery of eager questions.



"How ever did you get here all by yourself from that
little far-away farm of yours?" she demanded. "How       how
dared you attempt such a thing, my dear?" she went
on, with genuine concern. "You shouldn't have done it.
You really shouldn't, without letting me know, so that I
could have arranged for your comfort."



They had reached the first floor, and Monica's arm was
about the girl's supple waist.



"I never heard of such a thing," she hurried on, pushing
open the door of her boudoir. "Weren't you frightened
to death? How       how ever did you manage to find this
house       you, who've never been away from your prairie home
in your life?"



"I       I had to come, mam," Phyllis cried. "I       I hope
you're not angry, but I just had to come. I got a
letter from       from Frank, and he told me he was never
coming back to me, and was going to       to       enlist       or
something, in the army of workers and give his life to
bettering their lot, and       and a lot of other silly nonsense
like that. And       and I just had to come and
see you       since I knew that       that you loved him,
too."



There were tears crowding the girl's beautiful, appealing
eyes as she looked up into Monica's face.



Monica stooped and kissed her quite suddenly. Then she
unfastened and removed the unsightly cape and took the
offending suit case from her. She laid them aside, and then
strove to reassure this child, who, though she had only seen
her once before in her life, and only knew her through writing
to her, somehow seemed to have become a part of her
life.



"I'm so glad you came to me, Phyl," she cried. "There's
so much to say       so much for us both to think of. Oh, my
dear, my dear, my heart is broken. I don't know what to
think, or what to do. My poor, poor boy."





An hour passed. The housekeeper waited to see Mrs.
Hendrie in the library, but she did not come. Two hours
passed. Monica and Phyllis still remained together in the
former's room. As Monica had said, there was much for
both to think of. Again she poured out the dreadful story
of Frank's disaster. She was thankful, too, for the girl's
sympathetic ears. It eased her own feelings, and helped
her to think more clearly, which she had not been able to
do since receiving Frank's curt note refusing her money.
But at last there was nothing more left to tell, and Monica
broke down, weeping over the havoc she felt that she alone
had wrought.



"Oh, Phyl, Phyl," she cried desperately. "It is all my
doing; all through my wretched selfishness. You       even
you can't blame my husband. The fault was mine alone."



Phyllis's dark eyes were hard as she flung in her denial.



"But I do blame him," she cried. "Even if Frank had
been guilty it was a wicked, cruel thing to do. I can't help
it if it hurts you, Mrs. Hendrie. I do certainly blame your
husband."



Monica shook her head.



"He was in a fury of jealousy, and no man is quite sane
under such circumstances." Phyllis's challenge had given
Monica the firmness of decision, which, in her grief, she had
utterly lacked. "I am to blame. I can see it all now. Had
I never lied to Frank in my ridiculous sense of duty to my
dead sister, and my selfish desire to marry my husband;
had I never told the boy that I was his mother       this would
never have happened. In his great goodness and chivalry,
the poor boy sacrificed himself for what he believed was my
honor. It       is       too terrible. Just God, what a punishment
for my lies. Never, never, never, as long as I live,
can I forgive myself. And now? Oh, what can I do?
Whatever can we do?"



Monica's tears flowed fast, and in sympathy for the suffering
woman Phyllis wept, too. Her anger, her resentment
against those who had injured her love were powerless
to resist the appeal of this woman's grief. However she
loved Frank, she remembered that Monica loved him, too.
All his life she had struggled and slaved for him.



But she was there for a greater purpose than to help
another woman in her suffering. She was there to help
the man she loved. More than that, she was there to win
him back to herself, to that happiness she believed she alone
could give him. She knew him so well. She felt in her
simple way that he needed her, in spite of his long, long
letter giving her back her promise, and full of his unalterable
resolve to put his past and all that belonged to it, behind
him forever. She intended to pit herself against his
desperate purpose. She was determined to restore the old
Frank she knew, the old Frank she loved better than her
life.



"What can you do?" she cried, a glowing light of strength
and love shining in her beautiful, half-tearful eyes. "What
can we do? Why, everything. But we're not going to do
it by writing letters, mam. You love him? You? And
you can just sit at home right here, and hand him words
written on paper, and push money into the envelope, money
which means nothing to either of you, when he comes out
of the prison you helped to send him to? Oh, mam, mam,
how could you? Your place was at the gates of Alston
prison as it was mine, if I had known, like you did. It was
for us to have been along there, ready to reach out, and       and
help him. What can we do? What can I do? I'll
tell you. Oh, I know it's not for me to tell you things.
Maybe I'm young and foolish. Maybe I don't know much.
I'm just not going to write my Frank in answer to his       his
nonsensical stuff. But I won't take back my promise to
be his wife. I'm       I'm going to marry him       because I
know he wants me, and I want him. Oh, no, I'm not going
to marry a man who gets worrying to make strikes and
things, and calls it helping labor. I'm not going to marry
a man who's always making trouble in the world, who leaves
kiddies starving for what he calls a 'principle,' and most
folks generally       miserable. But I'm going to marry my
Frank, and I'm going right on to Toronto to find him       if I
have to walk there."



The girl finished up breathlessly. All her love and courage
were shining in her eyes. Monica had been held spellbound
by the force and determination underlying every unconsidered
word Phyllis uttered, and now she sprang from
her seat, caught in the rush of the other's enthusiasm.



"Oh Phyl, Phyl," she cried, catching the girl by the
shoulders, and looking down into her ardent face. "You
brave, brave child. I never thought. I could never have
thought, fool that I am. Yes, yes, we will go to him. Not
you alone. I will go, too. You are the bravest, wisest child
in the world, and       I love you for it."






CHAPTER VI



IN TORONTO



The street care hummed in the still summer air. The
sun awnings were stretched out from the endless array of
stores, across the super-heated sidewalk. A busy life perspired
beneath them. Toronto's central shopping areas
were always crowded about midday, not with the smart
woman shopper, but with the lunching population of the
commercial houses.



It was more than a month since Frank's memorable journey
from the hopeless precincts of Alston to one of Canada's
gayest cities; a month during which he had found his days
far easier than he expected, if more full of the responsibilities
of life. From the moment of his meeting with Austin
Leyburn he had permitted himself a looking forward, if not
with anything approaching youthful hope and confidence, at
least to a life full of that work which his understanding
suggested to him might serve to deaden bitter memories, and
help him to face a useful future.



His new aspirations, his new convictions, sprang from a
simple, impulsive heart rather than from any deep study of
Socialistic doctrine. He had no logic on the matters of his
beliefs, he needed none. It was sufficient that he had seen,
had felt, and he hugged to himself the thoughts thus inspired.



For the moment the man Leyburn, with his narrow eyes,
his purposeful face, was something little less than a god to
young Frank. Here was a champion of those very people
whom he believed needed all the help forthcoming. Here
was a man who, from sheer belief in his own principles, had
devoted himself, nay, perhaps, sacrificed himself, to those
very ideals which he, Frank, had only just awakened to.
His official positions in the organized societies of labor
surely testified to the sincerity of his purpose. Thus it was
certainly the work of Providence that he, Frank, had been
thrown into such contact at the moment of his need.



On that eventful train journey, Leyburn had promised to
enroll him among the workers for the good of the submerged
ranks of labor. Moreover he had proved as good as his
word. He had done more. For some unexplained reason
he took Frank into his own personal office, keeping him under
his direct supervision, associating with him, and treating
him to a confidence that was by no means usual in one
of the most powerful heads of the labor movement in
Canada.



It was a strange association, these two. On the one
hand a man of great organizing powers, of keen, practical
understanding of Socialistic principles; and, on the other,
a youth of lofty ideals which had little enough to do with
the bitter class hatred belonging to the sordid modern product
of Socialism. Yet the older man's interest was very
evident, and was displayed in many different ways. He
frequently lunched with his protégé, and never failed to
take him to any demonstration of labor at which it was his
duty to speak.



Frank responded readily to this kindly treatment. Nor
did it ever occur to him to wonder at it. So it came about,
that, bit by bit, this kindly man with the narrow eyes and
hard smile, drew from him the complete story of his life's
disaster.



It was on the occasion when the last detail of the story
was passionately poured into his apparently sympathetic
ears that Austin Leyburn treated his protégé to something
of his platform oratory.



"Out of evil comes good       sometimes," he said, with a
twisted, satirical smile. "You certainly have been the victim
of the class against which all our efforts are directed.
Think of it," he went on, thrusting his elbows upon the
luncheon table which stood between them       they were in the
fly-ridden precincts of the cheap restaurant which Leyburn
always affected       and raising his voice to a denunciatory
pitch. "Think of it. Every man with power to think,
with power to work, who comes within the web of this
wealthy man you speak of       whoever he is       is open to the
possibilities for evil of his accumulations of wealth. That
man, a millionaire, openly confesses to being able to buy
the law sufficiently to legally crush the moral, almost the
physical life out of those who offend him." Then he smiled
whimsically. "Can you wonder at the class hatred existing,
and of which I know you do not wholly approve?" Then he
shrugged, as though to dismiss the matter. "As I said,
good out of evil       sometimes. But for that experience you
would undoubtedly have joined the ranks of the oppressors
and assimilated their creed."



"Yes, yes," cried Frank eagerly. "I see all that. I see
the iniquity of it all that such tyranny should be possible.
I agree entirely. It is against the very principles of all
creation that any one man should possess such power. No
man, woman, or child is safe with such possibilities in our
midst. But this class hatred. The opposition of labor is
not directed sufficiently against the principle. It is directed
against the individual, and so becomes class hatred."



"Remember you are dealing with human nature," Leyburn
objected. "When such forces as we control are put
into active protest against a principle, the principle must
become merged in the individual who represents it. It is the
tangible evidence which an ignorant mass of labor needs of
the existence of offense against the principle which causes
the bitterness of its lot."



"My objection is against that fact," Frank persisted, in
the blindness of enthusiasm. "Class hatred! It is dreadful.
Christ never preached class hatred; and no man who
ever walked this earth had a greater understanding of real
life than He. Listen, I read in one of your books, written
by a man reputed to be a great thinker, that       if the working
men and women of the world were wiped out, capital
and its class would become useless, paralyzed. He also said
that if, on the other hand, those who represent capital were
wiped out, if all but the working men and women were exterminated,
the world would still go on undisturbed, because
of the worker left behind."



Leyburn nodded.



"That is one of the strongest bases of the labor movement.
Why should the man or woman who lives by the
sweat of others enjoy the luxury which is denied to the people
who make that luxury possible? Is the argument not perfectly,
humanly just?"



Frank leaned back in his hard chair. This man was
damping some of his enthusiasm by the argument which
seemed to him as purely selfish as were the existing conditions
of the methods of capital.



"Then the husbandman in the vineyard was all wrong?"
he demanded.



"On the contrary, he was quite right       if he could got no
more than the penny he engaged for," replied Leyburn
cynically.



Frank returned again to the attack.



"Now you are preaching for the worker the very methods
of present-day capital. You are telling him to       grab."



"So long as capital       grabs, labor must do likewise. Unfortunately
this is an age of grab, and until evolution carries
it away, like any other pestilential influence, we must all
grab, or die in the gutter."



Frank shook his head.



"No, no," he cried desperately. "I can't believe it. This
war of classes is all wrong. It is against all the ethics of
brotherhood. It is the war of body against brain. Leave
out the individual and stick to the principle. If the working
class were wiped out to-morrow the brain, which is really
the life of the world, would only change its tactics. After
a brief stagnation it would evolve a fresh condition of things.
It would throw itself into the necessary work, and, after
a while, its powers would contrive a means whereby the
world's work would still go forward. On the other hand, if
the great minds, the thinking minds of those who represent
capital, were wiped out, after a brief spell of chaos, the
vitality of the body would recreate a guiding system, and
things would become the same as they were before. There
would again be capital and labor, with its endless problem.
All that we can humanly demand is equality and brotherhood
for the human race in their various conditions of
life. If a man works his best he must be able to enjoy life
as he sees life. The rest belongs to a Divine Power over
which we can have no control. The world's goods must be
proportionately divided, according to all requirements. Nor
do we all need the same, because of that unequal distribution
by divine hand of the power to do. Oh, maybe I cannot
make it plain. But I can see it all, if only man will work in
a common interest, as I feel sure he was intended to do.
It is a government of common good we need. One that
will provide as well for the laborer as the thinker. They
are two portions of one whole, without either of which the
other cannot exist. Sever them, destroy either, and the lot
of the other is to be deplored."



Frank waited with flushed face and anxious eyes for the
other's reply.



Leyburn's cynical eyes looked up from the stained tablecloth
on which the remains of the meal were still scattered.



"And in the meantime?" he inquired.



"What do you mean?"



"How are you going to achieve this government, this
good and merciful government that is going to provide for
us, each according to our needs? By sitting down and submitting
to the sweaters who rule the lives of the present-day
laboring world, making its condition just what their own
quality of selfishness demands, just because the Divine Hand
has bestowed upon them a greater power to think than It
has upon the worker? I tell you, boy, we are fighting for
all that which you have outlined; and we are fighting       which
is the only way. I said that this was an age of
grab       and, as far as I can see, it is a pestilential influence
that must remain for years to come. The brain must be
forced to yield up its selfish desires by the body; it will
never be persuaded. You used the analogy. I will use it,
too. As you say, the brain represents the thinkers. In
human life the brain thinks, it is selfish in its desires, and
its desires grow. They frequently grow beyond the endurance
of the body, and finally it submits the body to such
conditions of disease that at last the poor stricken thing
rebels. Harmony and well-being cannot endure in human
life with the domination of any one part of it. Capital is
dominating labor now, so that the disease of hopelessness
has spread to every section. Life is a burden. Therefore
labor has rebelled, is rebelling, will continue to rebel, until
capital is abolished and the harmony of equality is restored.
Believe me, I am only viewing your ideals through practical
eyes. Come, my boy, we must to work again. There is
that case of tyranny to be looked into. The discharge of
that fireman for drinking when off duty on the North Saskatchewan
Railroad. There is also the question of colored
agricultural workers to be considered. You, my friend, are
young. You are enthusiastic and idealistic, and I like you
for it. But you will soon see that that which a long experience
has taught me is right."



Leyburn rose from his seat and beckoned the waiter. He
settled the bill, while Frank picked up his hat. The youngster
had no longer need to press it down to his ears. His
hair was rapidly growing to that luxuriant, wavy mass,
which had always been Monica's pride.



At the door of the restaurant, Leyburn turned to him
with his peculiarly ungracious smile, and sniffed the sickening
atmosphere of hot food.



"We've satisfied our appetites, and now we hate the
smell," he said, with a laugh. "Human nature is ungrateful.
By the way, you'd best go on to the Saskatchewan
Railroad offices and ask for that report they promised to
send me. I'll go back to the office." Then, as an afterthought: "Say,"
he added, with a laugh, "I'm going to send
you up West later. Along the line. To do some       talking.
But you'll need to cut all that stuff right out. I mean the
ideal racket. So long."



He turned sharply away, and hurried down the heat-laden
street.



Left alone, Frank looked after him. He shook his head.



"He's a good feller," he said to himself. "But he's
wrong       dead wrong       in some things."



At that moment somebody bumped into him, and he turned
to apologize. Seeing it was a woman, he raised his hat.
Then an exclamation, half joyous, half of dismay, broke
from him.



"Phyl!" he cried. "You? In Toronto?"



In her turn the girl started and stared.



"Frank!" she cried incredulously. Then, regardless of
the passers-by: "Thank God, I've found you! Oh, Frank,
I'm so       so glad. We have been hunting Toronto these
weeks; and now       now              "



"We?"



The girl's delight and evident love almost seemed to have
passed Frank by. With a rush all the old pain of parting
from her, all the dreary heartache he had endured when
writing his farewell to her, was with him once more, as his
troubled eyes searched the sweet face looking so radiantly
up into his.



"Yes, 'we,' dear."



Phyllis, her pretty face wreathed in a happy, confident
little smile, was studying him closely.



"Well?" she cried, as the great fellow stared back at her,
rather like a simple babe.



Frank tried to pull himself together. It was like the
ponderous shake of a St. Bernard dog, rousing himself to
activity.



"I don't know what to say or do." The man's dilemma
was struggling with the joy of this unexpected reunion.
"Why have you come here? Oh, Phyl, it is so hard. It has
been so terribly hard. I tried to explain it all in my letter,
I never thought              "



The girl nodded. Not for a moment did she permit any
other emotion than her delight at seeing him again, appear
in her smiling eyes. She tilted her head slightly on one side,
so that the shadow of her wide-brimmed hat was removed
from her face. Frank became aware of the movement, also
of the hat. He also became aware of the smartly tailored
costume she was wearing, even the pointed toes of her exquisite
shoes, and the white kid gloves upon her hands. She
intended him to notice these things.



"Oh, Frank," she cried, deliberately ignoring his protest,
"Toronto's just the loveliest place ever to buy dress
fixings. Mrs. Hendrie has just made me buy and buy, till       well,
till I don't know how much she's spent on me. You
see," she went on naïvely, "she said I just couldn't get hunting
my beau in Toronto with hayseed sticking all over my
hair. Don't you think I       I look better this way?"



This strange child from a "way-off" western farm had
her own methods of campaign. She was playing for a big
stake, the biggest she could think of       the man she loved.



Frank breathed a deep sigh.



"You       you just look wonderful, Phyl," he cried, for a
moment all else smothered in the background.



"True? Sure?"



"True? Say, you just couldn't look more lovely," the
boy cried.



Phyllis laughed.



"Then come right along. See, we're bumping folks,
standing here. I'm going to take you to where your       where
Mrs. Hendrie is waiting for you. The              "



But the mention of Monica left Frank once more alive to
realities.



"No, no, Phyl," he cried. "It is useless. Don't you
understand? I love my       I love Mon as dearly as ever son
loved a mother, but       the barrier has been set up between
us, and can never be removed. Oh, believe me, it is no resentment,
or bitterness against her. She just belongs to a
different world from mine       now. It would give her pain.
I know what she would say       and I know what I must say."



In spite of all his protests, Frank was walking beside
Phyllis, moving unquestioningly in the direction she selected.



The girl looked round laughingly. Phyllis had never
perhaps smiled so joyously, so sweetly as she was smiling
now. But every look, every word she spoke, was full of
definite purpose.



"I haven't recovered from the shock you handed me       in
that       that letter," she said, without a shadow of distress
in her smiling eyes. "I haven't, true as true. Say, I just
kind of wonder if you've got half a notion how it feels for a
girl to be thrown over by letter? Say, I just won't be
thrown over by       by letter. That's why I've come here to
Toronto. I've come right here so you can tell me with
your own two very determined lips, I'm not wanted. When
you've told me that I'm not wanted, that you just don't
love me any more, then I'm going right away to Gleber,
and get on with my plowing. I'll just pack up all the
elegant suits Mrs. Hendrie's bought me, and never see them
again. Then I'll fix myself up in black and bugles       whatever
they are       and be a widow woman for the rest of my
life. Now, truth! You don't love me       any more; and you
don't want me?"



Just for a moment the girl's mask was dropped as she
made her final demand.



It was only for a moment, but long enough for Frank to
see the depth of her love for him shining in her dark eyes.
The desire then and there to take her in his arms, and throw
every resolution to the winds, was well-nigh overpowering,
but he put it from him, and the effort left him speechless.



"Frank?" she urged.



But still the man remained silent.



"Do you know, dear, you'd have been more merciful if
you'd brutally struck me in the face with your great big fist,
instead of sending me that letter. You see, you'd sure have
left me senseless."



The subtle appeal was too much for the man. His face
flushed with a shame that swept through his heart.



"But what could I do, Phyl? I had to tell you. I had
to give you       your freedom. You could never marry a       convict."



Phyllis's mask of lightness returned to her face. She
meant to hit this man she loved, hard. It took all her courage
to do it, and the only possible chance she had was to
laugh with it.



"A convict?" she cried. "Oh, Frank, I could marry a
convict far, far easier than a       present-day Socialist."



The thrust drove straight home, and, witnessing the havoc
she had wrought, the girl consoled herself with the thought
that hers had been the plunging of the surgeon's knife that
the healing of this man might be the surer, the more complete.



"Phyl!"



The man's look was one of dreadful pain. He felt as if
every ideal and honest feeling he had ever had, had fallen
upon him, crushing him beneath its burden. Phyl's ridicule
was worse, far worse than any suffering he had endured,
however unjust.



"You can't       you don't mean that," he cried hoarsely.
"No, no, Phyl, you don't mean it. You              "



"But I do       I do," the girl cried, with sudden passion.
"Oh, I know you've suffered. God only knows just how
you've suffered! And since I've heard all you've gone
through, I've suffered every moment of it with you. Yes,
I know I've hurt you now, and I meant to hurt you       not
because you hurt me, not because of all you wrote me in
your letter, but because I want to tell you all I feel about       about
this new life you figure to mix up with. Frank, your
own honest notions are just too big for words. They're
like you       all of them. But how       how are you going to
carry them out? Say, I'll tell you. Maybe I'm just seeing
things as they happen, and not as folks guess they're going
to figger out. You're going to help fix things right by
tying yourself to the ranks of labor, so as to fight capital.
That's how you're going to bring about brotherly and
sisterly love in the world! By fighting! Say, you said you
were going to enlist in the army. You have. And it's a
fighting army, facing all the horrors of a war far more
dreadful than the life-and-death struggle of nations. Do
you need me to tell you of the wretched, self-seeking leaders
of the working men? The men who lead them like a flock
of silly sheep so they may personally prosper and feed on
them? Do you need me to tell you, what every paper in
the world tells you, of the awful sufferings the helpless
women and kiddies go through? All just because these
grabbing leaders, yearning for publicity and power, order
their men-folk to stop work, and resort to violence for a
few odd cents more pay, or because some wretched scallawag,
who richly deserves it, no doubt, has fallen under the
rules of his employers. That's not your Socialism, if I
know you. Oh, this horrible, horrible bitterness and hatred
going on everywhere about us. Why should it be? You
ask that, too, and you get right up against one little fact
of life       the power of money       and guess that's the root of
it. It isn't! It isn't! I tell you there's just one cause.
It's selfishness. It's the selfishness of one class just as sure
as it's the selfishness of another. And they bring all sorts
of arguments about principle to prop themselves up on.
There's no principle about it. It's just self, self, self, all
the time. Everybody wants something they don't honestly
earn. And when they can't get it, if they think they're
strong enough, they just start right out to fight for it,
like a lot of savages, while those who look to them for support
and comfort are left to starve, and put up with all
the horrors caused by savage passions, inflamed to frenzy
by those leaders who are the only creatures to obtain worldly
advantage and benefit from their disgraceful doings. Oh,
Frank, it's just awful to think that you have become one
of these       these       villains."



The girl's passionate denunciation came to an end just as
she halted at the foot of the great flight of steps leading up
to the entrance of the Eldorado Hotel. But she waited for
no comment from her silent companion. She just glanced
up and pointed at the building. Then, with an almost
kaleidoscopic return to her lightest, smiling manner, she
announced their arrival at their destination.



"Say, Frank," she cried, with an air of absurd importance.
"This is my hotel. We've a suite of elegant apartments
right on the first floor. And, dear," with a sudden
tenderness, "Mrs. Hendrie       Monica       your Mon, who loves
you nearly as much as I do, is just waiting right there       for
you. You'll come along in?"



Frank looked up into the tenderly pleading eyes, and his
last objection melted before them.



He nodded.






CHAPTER VII



THE DECISION



Monica and Frank were alone in the former's private
sitting-room at the Eldorado Hotel. Phyllis had conducted
him to the door of the room, where she waited until he had
passed safely within. Then she discreetly withdrew to pass
many anxious moments pacing the narrow limits of her own
bedroom on the same floor.



The sitting-room was a large, handsomely furnished
apartment with two lofty windows looking out upon the
busy street, directly over the hotel's entrance porch. At
one of these windows Frank was standing, with his back
turned upon the room and the woman who had drawn so
near to him. His troubled blue eyes were fixed upon the busy
life outside, but it had no interest for him. Whatever he
had gone through before, he believed that he was now facing
the climax of his life. It had arisen so suddenly, so unexpectedly,
as such climaxes do; and it found him ready for
impulsive action that had to be controlled.



Monica was just behind him, and a little to one side. One
hand was resting upon the cold radiator as though she
needed its support. Her beautiful face was drawn, and pale,
great dark rings surrounded her eyes. Her age was strongly
marked just now, it was even exaggerated, and had somehow
communicated itself to her shoulders, which drooped in an
unusually hopeless manner.



It had been a long, and for both, a painful interview. It
had been a scene of love and humility on the part of the
proud wife of Alexander Hendrie, and of affection yet decision,
not untouched with bitterness, on the part of the boy
who had developed so quickly into a man of responsibility.
The mother love had pleaded with a humility that was
pathetic, and the man had listened, steeling his heart against
the inroads which the sound of that gentle voice made upon
his determination.



Never for one moment did he find aught of blame for her.
Never did he, by word or look, convey anything but the
love she had always known. How could it be otherwise?
Nothing could have broken down a love such as his, founded
as it was upon long years of self-sacrificing devotion toward
himself. Monica was still to him all she had ever been       his
mother.



But now her final appeal, that he should abandon his
present life and return to her, had been made, and, as the
end came, she handed him a letter in Alexander Hendrie's
handwriting.



The letter remained unread in his hands, held limply, a
thing apparently of no interest to him.



"Won't you read it, Frank? Won't you read it       for
my sake?" Monica urged, after a long, painful silence.



There was something like tears in her voice, and the
sound became irresistible to the man.



He sighed, and glanced down at the folded paper.



"Where is the use?" he asked gently. "There can be
nothing in it to alter my determination. Oh, Mon, don't
you understand? If I can hear you plead and still remain
certain my purpose is right, how can anything this man
has to say, turn me from it?"



Monica drew a step nearer. Her hand had left the cold
iron. Now the other was laid tenderly upon his shoulder.



"I know, I know, Frank," she cried. "But       won't you
read it? When you have read it you will understand why
I want you to do so. It is the letter of a man with a mind
as big as his passions are       violent. It is the letter of a
man whose proud head is bowed in the       dust with grief at
the wrong he has done to you. If you knew him as I know
him, you would realize all that the writing of that letter
must have cost him. Were it not that I know something
of the great, passionate heart that beats in his body I could
not have believed such a letter written by him possible. Oh,
Frank, if nothing I can say, can turn you from the purpose
of your life, let me plead, as I have never pleaded to any one
before, be your just, kindly self for a few moments, and       listen
while he speaks to you."



Frank unfolded the letter, and, after a moment's hesitation,
withdrew his gaze from the window, and began to
read, Monica waited breathlessly. The letter, in a clear,
bold handwriting, was without heading or date.





"I cannot begin this with a conventional heading. I
cannot expect that you would tolerate any sort of demonstrativeness.
Therefore, what I have to say must be short,
sincere, and to the point. I am sending this by Monica,
to ensure your receiving it, and in the hope that she will
persuade you to read it. I can think of only one wrong,
ever committed by man, greater than that which I have
done to you. The wrong I refer to was done some two
thousand years ago. The horror of that crime has remained
to those whose forbears committed it, and will remain so
long as their lives last. The horror of my crime will so
remain with me. This may sound extravagant to you,
however bitter your feelings, but you do not know, perhaps
you never will know, all that is in my mind as I write. However,
that is for me, and it is not easy. The expression of
all my regrets would be useless to convey what I feel. Let
them pass. There are things I desire to do, and I implore
you, as you may hope for future salvation, as you may pity
a mind and heart racked with torture, to come back with
Monica, and accept an equal partnership in all I have in
the world. It is here, waiting for you at all times between
now and the day I die. I hope that some day you may
learn to forgive the wrongs I have inflicted upon you.



"Alexander Hendrie."





The letter remained in Frank's hand as his eyes were
once more lifted to the window. There was a slight change
in them, a slight softening in their expression. Monica,
watching him, drew a sharp breath. For an instant hope
leaped within her, and a whispered urging escaped her.



"Frank!"



The man made no movement, but the softening passed
swiftly out of his eyes.



"You will       come?"



He held out the letter in reply.



"Take it, Mon, take it back to him," he said deliberately,
yet without harshness. "I will not write a reply, but you
can take him this message. The past is over, and, though
perhaps it cannot easily be forgotten, I have no longer any
feeling about it beyond hatred of the injustice which makes
it possible for the weight of one man's wealth to bring about
such persecution as was dealt out to me. Tell him I cannot
accept that which he has no right to be able to give. Tell
him there are thousands       hundreds of thousands of men and
women who could be benefited by that which he would now
give to me."



Monica drew back sharply, the caressing weight of her
hand slipped from his shoulder.



"You mean that? Oh, no, no, Frank! You cannot answer
him like that. It is not you       never, never!"



"That is the answer, dear." Frank had turned from the
window, and came towards this woman who had been more
than a mother to him. "That is the answer to his letter,
and to all that you have asked me. But you are right, it is
not I       it is the teaching of the suffering and misery I have
witnessed that is speaking, and to that teaching I remain
loyal."



"Frank is right, Mrs. Hendrie."



The man looked across the room with a start, and Monica
turned abruptly. Phyllis was standing just inside the room
with her back to the door she had just closed behind her.
She nodded in answer to their looks of surprise, and her
eyes were smiling, but with suspicious brightness.



"You're going, Frank?" she demanded. "You're just
going right back to those       you've       you've joined?"



The girl's voice was so quiet, so soft. Nor was any of her
aching heart permitted to add one touch of appeal to her
manner. The man cleared his throat. He averted his eyes.



"Yes, Phyl," he said hoarsely.



He stood there feeling as though he was once more before
a tribunal, awaiting sentence. Phyllis had drawn close to
Monica's side, and her strong young arm had slipped protectingly
about the elder woman's waist. The girl understood
her suffering, and her own added to the sympathy of
her action.



Her eyes shone up into the man's face. Their brightness
was the brightness of tears she would not shed.



"Then       it's 'good-bye'?" she said gently.



The man nodded. He dared not speak until he had full
mastery of himself.



Phyllis sighed.



"We came here, Frank, to show you all that was in the
hearts of two women who       who love you," she said slowly.
"Maybe we haven't done it well. I can't rightly say." Her
smile was a little wistful, yet almost pathetically humorous.
"It's the way with folks who try hard       isn't it? They never
just seem to get things right. But, say, it doesn't really
figure any, does it? You see," she went on, "we both wanted
you back. But I needed something more than that. You
told me in your       that long, long letter of yours, marriage
between us was impossible. Well, say, dear, there's just
one thing, and only one thing could make that so. If you
don't need me then it's just       impossible. I asked you that,
and you didn't tell me in words. But everything else you
told me about, you just did want me."



The man made a movement as though to interrupt her,
but she would not allow him to speak.



"Don't worry, dear. Guess you got all you need that way
coming. I just want you to know I love you through and
through, and that surely goes       just as long as I live. Meanwhile,"
she added, her smile gaining in confidence as her
thoughts probed ahead into the distant future, "I'm going
right back to home, and mother; right back to that little
tumble-down shack you know, dear, and I'm going to get
on with my       plowing. And later on, dear, when you just
get the notion, and come along, why       I guess you'll find me
waiting around for you       and I shan't be fixed up in black       and
bugles. Good-bye, dear       for the present."






CHAPTER VIII



THE SHADOW OF WAR



With the passing of summer, and the long, pleasant fall,
winter's desperate night closed about the world. Now it
was succeeded, at last, by the dawn of spring, bringing with
it the delicate, emerald carpet of growing grain, which
later would ripen to a brilliant cloth of gold. Nor was the
earth's beautiful spring raiment to be quickly discarded for
its summer apparel. The keen winds yielded reluctantly to
summer zephyrs, and winter's dread overcast retreated
slowly before the rosy light of the ripening season.



If winter's clouds of threatening elemental storms were
obstinate, so were the hovering clouds of human troubles.
But, unlike the clouds of winter, the latter were growing
with the advancing season, growing until the horizon hung
with the threat of storm, that was ready to break even the
horizon at which the ever optimistic farmer gazed.



It had been a troublous fall in the labor world, and an
even more disturbed winter. The dark months of the year
had proved a very hotbed for the microbe of industrial
unrest, and it had propagated a hundredfold.



As spring dawned, from every corner of the world came
the same story. Strike, strike; everywhere, and in every
calling, the word had gone forward       Strike! It mattered
not the reason. It mattered not the worker's condition.
If wages were ample, then strike for less work. If the work
was insufficient, then strike for a minimum wage. In any
case strike, and see the demands included recognition of
labor unions, and particularly recognition of the demagogues
who led them.



So the storm-clouds of industrial insurrection were fostered.
They threatened, and, rapidly, in almost every direction,
the flood of storm burst. Every sane, hard-thinking
man asked his neighbor the reason. Every far-sighted man,
on both sides, shook his head, and pointed the approach
of a hideous reckoning. Every fool looked on and laughed,
and, shrugging his shoulders, swam with the tide on the
side to which he belonged.



And all the time the demagogues screamed from the house-tops,
and claimed the daily press. These carrion of democracy
actually belonged to neither side. They did not toil
in the mills, nor did they employ labor. Theirs it was to
feed upon the carcass of the worker, and wrest power from
the hands of those who possessed it. Whatever happened,
they must be winners in the game they played. Nor did
it matter one iota to them who might be the sufferers by
their juggling.



They possessed one marketable commodity, their powers
of stirring strife. Nor were they particular to whom they
sold. They belonged to a class of their own, an unscrupulous,
ambitious, self-seeking race of intelligent creatures,
whose sole aim was publicity and power, which, in the end,
must yield them that position and plenty which they decried
in others. It mattered little to them whether they preached
syndication or sauce. Their services must be paid for in
the way they desired. Vituperating from the summit of an
upturned butter tub, or hurling invective from the cushioned
benches of a nation's Assembly of Legislature, it made
no difference to them. Anything they undertook must be
paid for, at their own market price.



These were the microbes of industrial unrest which had
multiplied during the dark months of the year on hotbeds
that were rich, and fat, and warm. Their paunches were
heavy with the goodly supplies of sustenance which they
drew from the bodies of those who, in their blind ignorance
and stupidity, were powerless to resist their insidious
blandishments.



Something of all this may have been in Alexander
Hendrie's mind as he sat before the accumulations of work
awaiting his attention on his desk in the library at Deep
Willows. His hard face was shadowed, even gloomy. It was
the face of a man which suggested nothing of the success
that was really his. Nothing of the triumph with which the
successful organizing of the wheat-growers' trust should have
inspired him. All his plans had matured, all his efforts
had been crowned with that success which seemed to be the
hall-mark of the man. That which he set himself to do,
he prided himself, he did with his might. Nor did he relinquish
his grip upon it till the work was completed.



But on this particular spring morning, the hall-mark
seemed somehow to have become obscured. His eyes were
troubled and brooding. His work remained untouched.
Even an unlighted cigar remained upon the edge of his
desk, a sure sign that he had no taste for the work that lay
before him.



This condition of affairs had been going on for some
time. It had gradually grown worse. To the onlooker, to
eyes that had no real understanding of the man, it might
have suggested that the great spirit had reached the breaking
point, or that some subtle, undermining disease had
set in.



One, at least, of those who stood on intimate terms with
this man knew that this was not so. Angus Moraine realized
the growing depression in his chief, and, perhaps,
feared it. But he knew its cause, or, at least, he knew
something of its cause. For some reason, reasons which
to the hard Scot seemed all insufficient, Hendrie had
changed from the time of his discovery of the mistake he
had made in the case of Frank Smith. He had heard from
his employer, himself the story of that mistake, but Hendrie
had only told him sufficient of it to account for his actions
in obtaining the man's release.



Then there was that other, more intimate matter, the
news of which had leaped like wildfire throughout the household
at Deep Willows. Monica was ailing. It was obvious
that she was to become a mother, and it was equally obvious
that her health was suffering in an extraordinary manner.
There was a doctor, a general practitioner, in residence at
Deep Willows. There was also a night nurse in attendance,
besides a girl companion, from one of the outlying farms
over Gleber way.



These things were known by everybody, not only in the
house, but in the neighborhood, and Angus understood that
the combination of them all was responsible for the apparently
halting movement of the mechanism which so strenuously
drove the life of Alexander Hendrie. The man himself
was just the same underneath it all, but, for the moment,
the clouds were depressing him, and it would require his own
great fighting spirit to disperse them.



Angus was in good humor as he entered the library just
before noon. He believed he possessed the necessary tonic
for his employer's case, and intended to administer it in
his own ruthless fashion.



Hendrie glanced across at the door as he heard it open.
Then, when he saw who his visitor was, he sighed like a man
awakening from an unpleasant dream. He picked up his
cigar and lit it, and Angus watched the action with approval.
He always preferred to deal with Hendrie when
that individual had a cigar thrust at an aggressive angle in
the corner of his mouth.



"Well? Anything to report?" Hendrie demanded. The
effort of pulling himself together left him alert. The last
shadow had, for the moment, passed out of his cold gray
eyes.



"Why, yes."



Angus drew up a chair and laid a sheaf of papers beside
him. He saw the crowded state of the desk, but gave no
sign of the regret which the sight inspired.



"Guess there's a hell of a lot of trouble coming if you
persist in this colored labor racket," he said quickly. "I
don't mind telling you I hate niggers myself, hate 'em to
death. But that's not the trouble. As I've warned you
before, ever since that blamed Agricultural Labor Society
racket started, the beginning of last year, we've had the
country flooded with what I call 'east-side orators.' Talk?
Gee! They'd talk hell cold. They've got the ear of every
white hobo that prides himself he knows the north end of
a plow from the south, and they've filled them full of this
black labor racket."



Hendrie was lifted out of himself. The cold light of his
eyes flashed into a wintry smile.



"Ah," he said. "Strike talk."



"Sure. And I guess it's going to be big. I'd say there's
a big head behind it all       too."



Hendrie nodded.



"They've been gathering funds all the year. Now they
guess they're ready       like everybody else       to get their teeth
into the cake they want to eat. Go ahead."



Angus took a cigar from the box Hendrie held out, and
bit the end off.



"It's well enough for you. You ain't up against all the
racket. I am. We've got plenty labor around here without
darnation niggers. Why not quit 'em?"



Hendrie shook his head, and the other went on.



"Anyway, yesterday, Sunday, I was around, and I ran
into a perfect hallelujah chorus meeting, going on right
down, way out on the river bank. Guess they didn't reckon
I'd smell 'em out. There were five hundred white men at
that meeting, and they were listening to a feller talking from
the stump of a tree. It was the nigger racket. That, and
strike for more wages, and that sort of truck. He was
telling 'em that there was just one time to strike for farm
folks. That was harvest. Said it would hurt owners more
to see their crops ruined in the ear than to quit seeding.
Well, I got good and mad, and I'd got my gun with me.
So I walked right up to that feller, and asked him what in
hell he was doing on your land. He'd got five hundred
mossbacks with him, and he felt good. Guessed he could
bluff me plenty. He got terribly gay for a while, till I
got busy. You see, with five hundred around it was up to
me to show some nerve. The moment he started I whipped
out my gun. I gave him two minutes to get down and light
out. He wasted most of them, and I had to give him two
that shaved the seat of his pants, one for each minute. Then
he hopped it, and the five hundred mossbacks laffed 'emselves
sick. However, I told 'em they were disturbing the Sunday
nap of the fish in the river, and they, too, scattered. But
it don't help, Mr. Hendrie. It means a big piece of trouble
coming. Those fellers'll gather round again like flies, and
they'll suck in the treacle that flows from the lips of some
other flannel mouth. Specially if it's 'black' treacle."



Hendrie's smile had become fixed. And the set of it left
his eyes snapping.



"See here, Angus," he cried, with some vehemence. "I
don't hold a brief for niggers as niggers. But I hold a
brief for them as human creatures."



He swung himself round on his chair and rested his elbow,
supporting his head upon his hand, upon the overflowing
desk. His cigar assumed a still more aggressive pose
in the corner of his mouth.



"The world's just gone crazy on equality. That is, the
folk who've got least of its goods. That's all right. I'd
feel that way myself       if I hadn't got. Well, here's an outfit
of white folk who reckon to make me pay, and pay good.
Not me only, but all who own stuff. Well, if they can
make me pay       guess I'll just have to pay. But anyway, I've
a right to demand the equality they're shouting for. Guess
a nigger hasn't a dog's place among white folks. I don't
care a darn. But a nigger can do my work, and I can
handle him. And if the whole white race of mossbacks don't
like it they can go plumb       to       hell. That's the way I
feel. That's the way all this strike racket that's going on
makes me feel. If they want fight they can get all they
need. Maybe they reckon they can break me all up with
their brawn and muscle, and by quitting, and refusing to
take my pay. I just tell you they can't. Let 'em build up
their giant muscle, and get going good. I'll fight 'em       but
I'll fight 'em with the wits that have put me where I
am, and       I'll beat 'em."



Angus Moraine's sour face and somber eyes lit. He knew
his man, and he liked to hear him talk fight. But he was
curious to know something of that which he knew still remained
to be told.



"This is the first year of the trust operations," he said
shrewdly. "What if the crop is left to rot on the ground?
This place, here, is now just a fraction of the whole combine,
as I understand it."



Hendrie nodded. Amusement was added to the light of
battle in his eyes.



"Sure," he said.



Then he reached across the desk and picked up a large
bundle of papers. He passed them over to the other.



"Take 'em," he said easily. "Read 'em over at your
leisure. You got property in this trust. Maybe you'll
read something there that's cost me a deal of thought. That's
the United Owners' Protection Schedule. You'll find in it
a tabulated list of every property in the combine. Its area
of grain. Its locality. Also a carefully detailed list of
Owner Workers, their numbers, and supplies of machinery
for seeding and harvesting. You'll also find a detailed distribution
sheet of how these, in case of emergency, can
be combined and distributed, and, aided with additional
machinery, supplied by the trust, can complete the harvest
on all trust lands without the help of one single hired man.
The machinery is ordered, and is being distributed now       in
case the railroad troubles develop about harvest time.
There's also another document there of no small importance.
It was passed unanimously at the last general meeting
of directors, and is inspired by these       darned labor
troubles. It empowers me to sell crops standing in the ear,
at a margin under anticipated market price to speculators       if
it's deemed advisable by the directors. This again is
for our protection."



Then he held up a bunch of telegrams.



"These are wires from some of the big speculators.
They're in code, so you can't read 'em. They're offers to
buy       now. These offers, increasing in price each time as
we get nearer the harvest, will come along from now on
till the grain is threshed. I can close a deal any moment
I choose to put pen to paper. Well?"



"Well?"



Angus looked into the man's fearless eyes, marveling at
the wonder of foresight he displayed. For the moment he
almost pitied the dull-witted farmhand who contemplated
pitting himself against such caliber.



"Say, Angus, boy," Hendrie went on, after a pause.
"Sometimes I sort of feel the game isn't worth it, fighting
this mush-headed crowd who have to get other folks to
think for 'em, and tell 'em when they're not satisfied. It's
like shooting up women and children, in spite that any half-dozen
could literally eat me alive. I tell you brain's got
muscle beat all along the line. Give every man an equal
share all over the world, and in six months' time it will be
cornered again by brain that isn't equally distributed, and
never will be."



"I'm getting another crew of niggers up from the south,
and you'll have 'em put on 'time' right here at Deep Willows,"
he went on, after a pause. "I'm going to run my
land in my own way. They need fight? They can get it.
I'm in the humor to fight. And if they shout much more
I'll get Chinamen down from Vancouver to bear a hand in
the work."





Hendrie stood for a moment with his hand on the open
door. His eyes were still alight with the fire of battle
which Angus's visit had inspired. The reckless spirit of
defiance was still stirring, a recklessness which was, perhaps,
unusual in him. The strongest characteristic of this man
was his invincible resolution. It was his deliberateness of
purpose, urged by supreme personal force that had placed
him where he was       not recklessness.



But just now an actual desire for recklessness was running
riot through his hot veins. He wanted to fight. He
felt it was the safety valve necessary for his own desperate
feelings.



Monica's condition more than troubled him. All the more
so because he knew that his own actions had helped her
peculiar ailing, which was rapidly sapping all her vitality
at the time she most needed it. He knew, no one better,
that Frank's troubles, his absence, and the uncertainty of
his future, had played upon her nervous system till she was
left no longer fit to bear her burden of motherhood.



Oh yes, he knew. He knew of the shattered wreck of
her woman's heart, and it maddened him to think that the
cause of it lay at his door. More than this, the black,
haunting shadow of memory left him no peace. It was with
him at all times, now jeering and mocking, now threatening
him. But his own remorse he felt he could bear. He was
a fighter; he could battle with self as with any other foe.
But, for Monica, his love drove him to a desperation which
sometimes threatened to overwhelm him.



He closed the door behind him, and hurried toward the
entrance hall. As he reached it he saw the figure of Phyllis
Raysun ascending the stairs. He promptly called to her.



"Tell me," he cried. "Well, child? What is Dr. Fraser's
report?"



The girl turned, and almost reluctantly descended the
stairs.



Monica's appeal to her to come to her had been irresistible
to the heart of the sympathetic girl. The appeal had been
conveyed to her by Hendrie himself, the man whom she
believed she hated as a monster of cruelty. She had listened
to him, and something in the manner in which he had urged
her, promising that the work of her farm should go forward
during her absence by his own men, and that her mother
should lack for no comfort that money could purchase, gave
her an insight into a nature that began at once to interest
her, in spite of her definitely formed opinions of him. The
man certainly puzzled her young, but, for a girl of her
upbringing, wide understanding.



Nor had her stay at Deep Willows lessened her interest.



Now she looked at him with unsmiling eyes.



"The doctor's just gone right into Everton for special
physic," she said.



"Yes, yes. But       his report?"



Phyllis's gaze wandered to the front door, out of which
the doctor had just passed.



"He says       slight improvement," she replied coldly.



"Ah! Improvement! Yes?"



The man sighed. He was clinging to the meager encouragement
of that single word.



Phyllis understood. She nodded. Then her eyes lit with
a sudden purpose, and she dashed his hope.



"Oh, but say, Mr. Hendrie," she cried. "It doesn't just
mean a thing. It doesn't sure       sure. There's just one
hope for Mo       for Mrs. Hendrie. It's Frank. You don't
understand. How can you understand us women? Get
Frank right back to her, and       and you won't need Doc.
Fraser for her any more than I want him. That's what
you'll need to do. She's pining her life right away for him.
She loves him. He's       he's her son. Can't you see? She
just worships you right through, because you're her husband.
But Frank? Why, she thinks of the days when his
little hands used to cling around her, tearing her fixings,
that cost money, and all that. She       she just loves every
hair of his poor head."



The girl's hands were held out appealingly, and the man's
eyes dared not look in their direction. She had poured an
exquisite torture into his already troubled heart, and her
appealing hands had twisted the knife that probed its depths.
She could not add one detail to his knowledge of all it would
mean, not only to Monica, but to himself, if only Frank
could be brought home to the great house at Deep Willows.



One hand went up to his clammy brow. The square-tipped
fingers ran their way through his ample, graying
hair. Then, with a sudden nervous movement, his arms
flung out.



"Oh, God!" he cried, his eyes suddenly blazing with a
passion that had for one brief moment broken the bonds
which usually so sternly controlled it. "What do you know,
child? What can you know of the awful longing I have
to bring that boy here? You say I do not know you women.
I tell you you do not know all that men can feel. You
think me a brute, a monster; I have seen it in your eyes.
You think my every thought is money and self. Maybe you
are justified. It is money       gold that has been my undoing.
It is that which has wrecked my life. Pshaw! You don't
understand. Nobody does       but myself. But I tell you,
here and now, I'd give all I have, everything I possess in
life, even life itself, to bring that boy here, and know that
he would remain with us for       ever."



His outburst left the girl half frightened. But his passion
died out almost as swiftly as it had arisen. His control
was not long yielded, and, as his eyes resumed their
wonted steadiness, and looked up into Phyllis's with
something almost like a smile, she timidly sought to help
him.



"I'm       I'm sorry," she said, on the impulse. Then she
leaned forward eagerly. "But       but can't it       be done? Oh,
if he would only come       in time. I know he will come       some
day. If I did not       then       then I shouldn't want to
go right on living."



The man started slightly.



"I       I had forgotten       you," he said.



Phyllis nodded.



"Frank is in       Calford," she said slowly. "I had mail
from him yesterday."



She was speaking in the hope that what she said might
help to stir him to some definite action. She was beginning
to understand the powers which he possessed.



The man appeared to be lost in thought.



"I am going to marry Frank       one day," she went on, in
her confident little way.



Suddenly Hendrie looked round at her. His eyes surveyed
her closely. He became aware for the first time of
the strength of her pretty face. The bright intelligence
looking out of her deep eyes. The firmness of her mouth
and chin. These things left a marked effect upon him. His
manner became almost gentle.



"What is he doing in Calford?" he asked abruptly.



A faint smile lit the girl's eyes for a moment, and then
passed.



"He's       guess you'd call it 'agitating.' He doesn't. I'd
say he calls it preaching brotherhood and equality to a
gang of railroaders."



Again the man started.



"He's       working on the       railroad trouble?" he demanded
incredulously.



Phyllis nodded. Hendrie drew a deep breath.



"Yes. He's been working hard for a year now, and       and
I believe he's just thrown himself into the cause of       Socialism
with all his might. He       he gets talking everywhere.
His name's always in the papers. Say, can't you do a
thing? Can't you help       bring him here?"



Hendrie looked into the girl's earnest face. Then he
looked away. A dozen conflicting emotions were stirring
within him.



"I can't say right now, child," he replied, after a pause.
Then he looked up, and Phyllis read a definite resolve in his
hard gray eyes. "You best write him," he went on. "Write
him to-day. Tell him how Monica is. Tell him all you
like, but leave me out. Maybe I can do something. Guess
there's going to be a big fight with labor, and we're going
to be in it. Maybe the thought of it makes me feel good.
It's about the only thing can make me feel good       now. But
I wish       your Frank was on our side," he went on, almost
to himself. "I'd say he'd be a good fighter. Yes, I'd say
he was that. Must be. It's good to fight, too, when troubles
get around. It's good       sure."



"Must men always       fight?" asked Phyllis quietly.



The man stared.



"Why, yes!" he said in astonishment.



"Frank doesn't think so."



The millionaire shook his head deliberately.



"Say," he cried confidently, "your Frank will fight when
the time comes. And       he'll fight       big."



"What makes you say       that?"



The girl's question came sharply, and, in a moment, a
great light leaped into Alexander Hendrie's eyes.



"What makes me say       that?" he cried. Then he shrugged,
and moved to pass her on the stairs on the way to his wife's
room. "I know," he said, confidently. "That's all."






CHAPTER IX



CAPITAL AND LABOR



It was a large hall on the outskirts of Calford, in one of
the poorer neighborhoods. It was packed almost to suffocation
by an audience of stern-faced, eager humanity. There
were the ample figures of uniformed train conductors; there
were the thin, hard-muscled freighters. There were men
from the locomotive departments, with traces of coal-dust
about their eyes, of which, even in their leisure, they never
seem quite able to rid themselves.



There were colored Pullman servants, and waiters, and
cooks from the dining-cars. There were plate-layers in
their blue overalls, and machinists from the round-house.
So, too, was the depot department represented. It was a
great gathering of all grades of railroad workers on the
Calford section of the system.



The benches were crowded right up to the narrow platform,
upon which a group of four men, evidently workers
like the audience, were seated behind a tall youth, with
thick, fair hair and enormous breadth of shoulder. He was
standing out alone. He was talking rapidly in a deep,
resonant voice which carried distinctly to the remotest corners
of the building. His face was flushed, and his blue
eyes were alight with earnestness for the subject of his
address.



Point after point he was striving to drive home by the
sheer force of his own convictions. There was no display
about him. There was none of the pathetic humor, or the
unconsciously humorous pathos of the ordinary demagogue.
He was preaching the gospel of equality, as he saw it,
judiciously tempered to meet with the requirements of the
society to which his audience belonged, and which he, for
the moment, represented.



He talked well. Extremely well. And his audience listened.
Frequently his sentences were punctuated by approving
"hear, hears," in many directions. But there was
none of that explosive approval which is as nectar to the
ordinary demagogue.



To one man, sitting in the back of the hall, a man nearly
as large as the speaker, though older, enveloped in a rough
suit, which, while matching the tone of the rest of the audience,
sat ill upon him, it seemed that the speaker lacked
something with which to carry his audience.



He listened attentively, he followed every word, seeking
to discover the nature of this lack. It was not easy to detect.
Yet he was sure of its existence. Nor was it till the
evening was half spent that he quietly registered the fact
that this man missed one great essential to win his way to
the hearts of these people. He was not one of them. He
only understood their lives through immature observation.
He had never lived their life.



Somehow the conviction left him satisfied, and he settled
himself more comfortably upon his uncomfortable bench.



Later on he became aware of a sense of restlessness running
through the hall. There was a definite clearing of
throats among the audience. There was a good deal of
shifting of positions. He even observed the inclination of
heads toward each other, which told him that whispered
conversations were going on about him. To him this meant
a waning interest in the speaker. Doubt was no longer in
his mind, but now his satisfaction became touched with
regret.



Now he knew this man was not brutal enough. He was
not coarse enough. He did not know the hearts of these
men sufficiently. His mind was far too ideal, and his talk
further lacked in its appeal to self.



To hold these men he must come down to definite promises
of obtaining for them, and bestowing upon them, the fulfilment
of desires they were incapable of satisfying for themselves.
It was the old story of satisfied men made dissatisfied,
and now they required the promise of satisfaction for
appetites suddenly rendered sharp-set.



The man in the rough clothes, which sat so ill upon him,
knew that these men would leave that hall feeling they had
wasted a leisure that might have been given up to their
own particular pastimes.



The meeting lasted over two hours, but the man at the
back of the hall left long before its close. He had heard all
he wanted to hear, and felt it was sufficient for his purpose.



He drove back to his hotel in a handsome automobile,
in which his clothes looked still more out of place. This
was quickly remedied, however, and, when once more he
emerged from the building, he was clad as befitted the sixty-horsepower
vehicle which he re-entered.





Frank had returned to his room at the Algonquin Hotel.
He was tired, and a shadow of dissatisfaction clouded his
blue eyes as he scanned the bundle of manuscript lying in
his lap.



He was going over his speech, the speech he had made
that night to the railroad men of Calford. He knew he had
not "made good," and was seeking the weak spots in the
written manuscript. But he could not detect them.



It never occurred to him that his weakness lay in the fact
of that manuscript. He had written his speech because
he felt it was an important occasion. Austin Leyburn had
impressed its importance upon him. He had written it and
learned it by heart, and the result had been       failure. Of
the latter he was convinced, in spite of assurances to the
contrary by his comrades on the platform, For the rest
the significance of his failure had passed him by.



Yes, it was no use shirking the point. He had failed.
He threw the manuscript upon his dressing bureau, and
abandoned himself to the unpleasant reflections the knowledge
brought.



It was nearly midnight when a bell-boy knocked at his
door. A man, he said, was waiting below, and wished to
see him. He handed him a card.



Frank took it and glanced at it indifferently. Then his
indifference passed, and his eyes lit with a peculiar expression.
The boy waited.



"Alexander Hendrie," he read.



"Wants to see you       important," the boy urged, as the
man remained silently contemplating the strip of pasteboard.



"Important." The word repeated itself in Frank's brain
again and again. He still stared at the card. What did
Alexander Hendrie want? What could he want? By what
right did he dare to intrude upon him?



He was on the point of sending down a deliberate refusal
to see him. He was hot with resentment, a resentment he
had endeavored long ago to stifle, and had almost succeeded.
But he had miscalculated the human nature in him.
Now it rose up and scattered the result of his careful
schooling.



"Shall I show him up?" demanded the boy impatiently.



It was on the tip of Frank's tongue to pronounce his
refusal, when, quite suddenly, he changed his mind. No, he
would see him. It would be good to see him. He could at
least show him he was not afraid of him. He could let him
see how he despised all that which this man counted worth
while. Yes, he would see him.



"Show him up," he said coldly. The boy hurried away,
pocketing, with the avidity of his kind, the trifling silver
coin he was presented with.



Frank rose from his chair and began to move about the
room in the restless fashion of a man disturbed more than
he admits, more than, perhaps, he knows. All thought of
his evening's failure had passed from his mind. He was
about to confront the man who had dishonestly sent him to
a convict's cell, and a deadly bitterness surged through his
veins.



The door opened without any warning. Frank's back
was turned. His bed stood between him and his visitor
when he swung round and looked into the millionaire's face.



"Well?" he demanded, with a deliberate harshness.



Every feeling of bitter antagonism was expressed in his
greeting.



The millionaire closed the door behind him. His face
expressed no feeling whatsoever. He had schooled himself
well, and his schooling possessed the ripeness of experience.
He heard the younger man's tone, and every feeling it expressed
was conveyed to his understanding. He made no
attempt at politeness or amiability. He accepted the position
as the other chose to make it, but without any display
of resentment.



"I drove from Deep Willows to hear you speak to-night.
Also, I wanted to speak to you." Hendrie glanced about
him at the pleasantly furnished bedroom. "May I       sit?"



For a moment Frank remained silent. He looked hard
at this strong, ruthless man with his slightly graying hair
and clean-cut, resolute features. Nor did his powerful figure,
in its faultless evening dress, escape his attention.



Suddenly he kicked the rocker he had previously been
occupying toward his visitor. His action was the extreme
of discourtesy and contempt.



"You are uninvited, but       it's a free enough country,"
he said, with almost childish rudeness.



Hendrie passed his manner by.



"Yes, I s'pose it's a free enough country," he said, accepting
the chair deliberately.



Frank watched him, and slowly his self-schooling began
to reassert itself. This man had come with a definite purpose.
Somehow, he felt that, had he been in his place, it
would have required some nerve, even courage, for him to
have faced any man he had dishonestly condemned to penitentiary
for five years. Nature again was strong in him.
He admired courage       even in one whom he knew to be an
enemy.



"Free enough for the rich," he said, with a sarcasm that
hardly fitted him. "Honest people don't always find it
free."



The millionaire eyed him leisurely. Somehow his gray
eyes were softer than usual. This man seemed powerless
to move him to antagonism, even to passive resentment.



"Would you mind if       I lighted a cigar?" he inquired.
"I s'pose it's useless to offer you one. You don't care to
receive anything at my hands."



Frank seated himself upon the edge of the bed.



"Smoke all you want," he said ungraciously. "No, I
want nothing at your hands       except to be let alone."



Hendrie deliberately lit his cigar. For once it did not
find its way to the corner of his hard mouth. He blew a
thin stream of smoke from his pursed lips, and the action
ended in the faintest possible sigh.



"I'm sorry," he said. Then he leveled his eyes directly
into the other's. "I made you an offer months ago. You
refused it then. I s'pose you still feel the same? It still
stands."



Frank sat up, and his eyes lit.



"It can go on standing," he cried fiercely. "I tell you
I want nothing from you. I suppose it is only the arrogance
of your wealth makes you dare to offer me       me such compensation."
He finished up with a laugh that had nothing
pleasant in it.



"Dare?" Hendrie's bushy brows were raised mildly.



"Yes, dare!" There was something very like violence in
the younger man's tone.



"I thought every man who does a wrong       unwittingly       has
a right to make       reparation, not compensation."



"Unwittingly? Do you call it 'unwitting' when you use
your wealth to bribe and corrupt so that a man, even if
he be guilty, may be made to suffer? These were the things
you did to ruin me       an innocent man."



Hendrie smoked on. His eyes were lowered so that the
other could not see their expression.



"I did these things, and       there is no excuse," he said
presently. "You are young. Anyway, you cannot see with
my eyes. Let me try to fit the case on you. Suppose you
married       your Phyllis. Suppose you had every reason for
believing her faithless to you. Suppose you caught her
lover, as you believed, with money, your money, with which
she had supplied him. To what lengths would you go to
punish him?"



"It would be impossible. As impossible as it was in your
wife's case."



"Just so. But       suppose. Suppose       you believed."



Hendrie was leaning forward in his rocker.



"I might shoot him, but I would not              "



"Just so       you would commit murder, where I       I resorted
to methods perhaps less criminal. Suppose I had shot you.
Suppose I had escaped the legal consequences of my crime,
and then discovered your innocence. Need I go further?"



The subtle manner in which he had been inveigled into
debate infuriated Frank. But somehow he was powerless
to withdraw. The man's calmness held him, and he blundered
further.



"If you possessed half the honesty you claim for your
purpose you would have been man enough to go to your wife
for explanation."



Again Hendrie's eyes were averted, but the extraordinary
mildness of his manner forced itself further on the younger
man.



"And yet you would have shot the man you found in
what you believed similar relations to your       Phyllis? Do
you know why you would have done that       even worse than
I did       in the eyes of the law? I will tell you. It is because       you
love Phyllis. Because you really love Phyllis
you would do as your heart dictates       not as your head
prompts you. Did you not truly, humanly love, you would
go to her for explanation, because then you would not fear
to hear the hideous truth from her, that she no longer loved
you. In some things, my boy, where our love is concerned,
we do not possess all our courage. I was older, I knew
more of life, therefore I did not shoot, as I could easily have
done. But my passion for my wife is as strong as is your
young love for Phyllis, and I was too cowardly to risk hearing
the truth that her love for an elderly man was dead, and
all her affection was given to a younger man. Try and
picture my fears if you can. I, with my hair graying, and
you, with the flowing hair of superb youth."



Frank had no answer. He was trying to remember only
his injuries at this man's hands.



"It is because of these things I have dared to offer to
make reparation to you, have dared to come and see you,"
Hendrie went on. Then his eyes smiled into the other's
half angry, half troubled face. To any one knowing the
man, his smile was a miraculous change from the front with
which he usually faced the world. "You will accept nothing
from my hands, you say. So be it. But       and make no
mistake       reparation, all of it that lies in my power, shall
be made. That you cannot prevent. Remember you are
launched upon a life of great vicissitudes. You cannot foresee
its ramifications, you cannot see its possibilities. Wherever
you are I shall be looking on, and, though you may
not know it, all my influence will be at work       on your behalf.
I was around to-night, dressed in clothing no doubt
you would like to see me dressed in always, listening to
your particularly clever, but unconvincing speech to the
railroad men. You would have done really well among men
of a higher intelligence, men who think and feel as you do,
but you failed to raise one single hope among those you
were addressing, that they would get 'something for nothing'
if they followed your leadership. Consequently you failed."



Frank's face suddenly flushed, and a fierce retort leaped
to his lips.



"Something for nothing!" he cried scathingly. "That
is your understanding of the laborer who is sweated by big
corporations seeking outrageous dividends. Something for
nothing!" he went on, lashing himself to a white fury. "It
is always the sneer of the employer, of the vampire who lives
by others' toil and enjoys luxury, while those who help
them to it may starve for all they care. I tell you all these
poor people can squeeze from the grasp of capital is only a
tithe of their just due. Every man is entitled to a fair share
of the profits of his toil. He is entitled to live a life of
comfort and happiness in proportion to the service he gives
in the world's work."



Frank's eyes were flashing and his breath came quickly,
but he stared blankly as the other nodded approval of his
claims.



"Perfectly right," Hendrie said. "Perfectly just." He
leaned back in his rocker and swung himself to and fro. His
cigar was poised in one hand, and his eyes were seriously
reflective. "Does he not get that?" he asked, after a
pause.



"No, a thousand times no!" Frank's denial came with
all the force of his passionate conviction.



"You talk of service in the world's work," Hendrie went
on reflectively, apparently untouched by the other's heat.
"You suggest that it means a man's willingness to exercise
his muscles, and whatever intelligence he may possess in
the general work which is required by civilization at the
moment, and, which, incidentally, is to provide him with
a means of living. All labor and those who would protect
labor forget, or they seem to me to forget, the fundamental
principle of all civilization. They seem to forget that to
which civilization owes its very existence       and to whom.
Civilization owes its existence to the few       not the many.
Civilization owes its progress to the thinkers, not the mere
toilers. Battles are won by organization which is the work
of the thinker, not the mad, uncontrolled rush of a rabble
army. The mill owner is the thinker who must find a
market for the wares produced in his mills, or there is no
work for the laborer. He must found that mill, or it does
not exist. He must spend a life of anxious thought, and
ceaseless effort, exhausting his nervous forces till he often
becomes a mental wreck, which no mere privations could
reduce him to, and such as the mere toiler could never have
to endure. The thinker will harness Nature's forces in a
manner which will ultimately provide work for millions. But
until he harnesses that power, that work is not possible.
And so it would be quite easy to go on indefinitely illustrating
the fact that labor owes its well-being, almost its existence,
to the thinker. And you would deny the right of the
thinker to reap the reward of his efforts."



"I deny the right to profits extorted at the expense of
labor. I deny the right to a luxury which others, less endowed
by Nature in their attainments, can enjoy. We are
all human beings, made alike, with powers, of enjoyment
alike, with a life that is one and the same, and I deny the
right for one to be privileged over another in the creature
comforts, which, after all, is one of the main objects of all
effort in life. I deny the right to a power in the individual
which can be dishonestly used to the detriment of his fellows."



Again the younger man's feelings had risen to fever heat.
Again his feelings ran riot in his denial.



Alexander Hendrie looked on unmoved.



"My boy," he said gently, "if you would deny all these
things, then appeal to your Creator to make all men of equal
capacity in thought, morals, and muscle. You cannot force
equality upon a world where the Divine Creator has seen
fit to make all things unequal. I tell you you cannot change
the principles of life. Let the sledge hammer of Socialism
be turned loose, let it crush the oppressors of labor as it
will. But life will remain the same. It will go on as before.
The thinkers will live in the luxury you deplore, and the
toiler will sweat, and ache, and sometimes live in misery, as
he does now. But, remember, his misery is no greater than
the misery among those clad in the purple. There is no
greater misery in the world than the misery of the man or
woman who can afford to be happy. All that can be done
is to better the lot of the worker within given limits. But,
for God's sake, make the limit such as to leave him with
incentive sufficient to lift him from the ranks in which he is
enlisted, should his capacity prove adequate for promotion."



The force of the millionaire's simple views left a marked
effect upon the other. There was something so definite, yet
so tolerant about them. Somehow Frank felt that this man
was not thinking with the brain of the rich man. He was
speaking from a wide and strenuous experience of life. It
almost seemed to him that Alexander Hendrie must have
gone through a good deal of that which he, Frank, believed
to be the sufferings of the unjustly treated workers.



"You admit that the condition of labor needs improvement?"
he demanded sharply.



"No one more readily," Hendrie replied earnestly. "Help
them, give them every benefit possible. But the man who
would tell them that they earn, and have a right to more
than the market value of their daily toil is a liar! He is
committing a crime against both society and labor itself."



"Do you so treat       your labor?"



"I pay him his market price. Privately I am at all times
ready to help him. But my best sympathies are not with
the poor creature who has no thought beyond his food, his
sleep, and the fathering of numerous offspring which, without
regard to responsibility, he sheds upon the world in
worse case than himself. It is the man who will strive to
rise above his lot that has my sympathy. The man who
has the courage to face disaster, and even starvation, that,
in however small a degree, he may leave his mark upon the
face of the world. That is the man who appeals to me, and
whom I am even now seeking to help."



Frank rose from his seat upon his bed.



"You are helping       now?" he demanded incredulously.



The millionaire smiled.



"Maybe you would not call it by that name." He shook
his head, and rose heavily from his chair. "Let that pass,"
he said, with a quick, keen glance into the boy's face. "I
must get back to Deep Willows. I had no right to spend
all this time away. Mrs. Hendrie is ill       seriously ill, I fear.
Your Phyllis is with her, serving her for friendship's sake.
She does not receive even a market value for her toil. The
price of her service is inestimable."



"Mon       Mrs. Hendrie is       ill?"



Frank's face blanched. A great trouble crept into his
eyes. Hendrie noted the expression closely.



"Yes," he said simply. "She is to become a       mother.
But she is ill       and       ah, well, maybe she'll pull through.
It is in the hands of Providence." He sighed with genuine
trouble.



"You say       Phyllis       is with her?"



"Why, yes. She has been with us for months."



"Has Mon       Mrs. Hendrie been ill       so long?"



Frank's voice was almost pleading.



"She began to ail when she       returned from Toronto       nearly
a year ago."



"A year       ago?"



"Yes."



The keen eyes of the millionaire were strangely soft as
he watched the evident suffering in the boy's young face.
He waited.



"I              " Frank hesitated. Then, with a sudden impulsive
rush, he blurted out a request. "Can I       that is, might I
be allowed to call and see       her?" he asked, his voice hoarse
with sudden emotion. He had forgotten he desired nothing
at this man's hands.



"Why, yes. The doors of Deep Willows are always open
to you."



Frank looked up. For a moment something very like
panic swept over him. His visitor's eyes were upon him,
watching him with nothing but kindness in their depths.
Each was thinking of the same thing. Each knew that a
battle had been fought out between them, and victory had
been won. Frank's panic lay in the knowledge that he had
been the loser. Then his panic passed, and only resentment,
and his anxiety for Monica remained. But the miracle of
it was that his resentment was far less than he could have
believed possible.



Hendrie picked up his hat.



"I'm glad I came," he said, moving toward the door.



Frank averted his eyes.



"Good night," he said brusquely, vainly striving to bolster
his angry feelings.



"Good night, my boy."



Hendrie passed out of the room and closed the door behind
him carefully.



As he went Frank flung himself into a chair, and, for
a while, sat with his face buried in his hands. Monica was
ill. Seriously ill. Maybe dangerously ill. Phyllis had said
no word of it in her letters. Not one word, and she was
with her. No word had reached him.



He caught his breath. He had suddenly realized how
utterly he had cut himself out of Monica's life, the life of
this woman who had been as a mother to him.






CHAPTER X



STRIKE TROUBLES SPREADING



It was a sultry afternoon, one of those clammy days
when flies stick and become victims of the drink habit, striving
to quench unnatural thirst at patches of spilled liquor
on bar-room counters, and, in a final frenzy, endeavor to
commit suicide in the dregs of warm tumblers left by their
human fellow-sufferers.



Lionel K. Sharpe, the proprietor of the Russell Hotel at
Everton, was propped behind his counter, smiling with amiable
idiocy at the vagaries of two drunken flies scrambling
about the inner sides of a tumbler, which contained the dregs
of what was alleged to be port wine. Abe Hopkinson, and
Josh Taylor, the bullet-headed butcher, watched them from
the other side of the bar.



"Guess I'd say it's hereditary in flies," said Abe, feeling
scientific.



"Wot's hered       hereditry?" demanded the butcher.



"Why       drink," explained Abe.



"Seems it's here       her       hereditry in most folk," smiled
Lionel K., chewing the stump of his cigar vigorously to
conceal his difficulty with such scientific terms.



The butcher nodded.



"I'd say some thirsts couldn't be brought on any other
way," he said. "Well, not to say       easy."



Abe grinned.



"Guess you ain't a believer in that guy Darwin's highbrow
theory?"



"Don't know what it is," replied the butcher, lifting the
glass, and tilting it so as to put the ruddy liquid within
reach of the volubly buzzing insects. "Anyway, I don't
believe in it. Say       I'll swar' them two sossled microbes is
holding a concert to 'emselves. See, one of 'em's doing the
buzzin', and blamed if the other feller ain't just wavin' a
leg to beat the band, keepin' time. Say, ain't they havin'
a hell of a time?"



Lionel K. Sharpe struck a match, tried to light his cigar
stump, burned his mustache, and abandoned the attempt.



"Hell!" he cried in disgust. Then he pointed at the flies.
"Say, Josh, jest think of it. Guess that splash of port's
well-nigh a sea       leastways a lake to them. How'd you
fancy standin' around a sea of port wine?"



"Guess I'd rather be settin' in a boat and paddlin' around
in it       jest as long as it wasn't your port. On second
thought, I'd rather be in a sailin' craft. You see, I'd have
more hands free." He pointed at the flies. "Say, that
feller's quit buzzin'. I've a notion he's sung hisself hoarse.
Mebbe he's got the hiccups. Wal, say, get that! They're
kissin' each other."



"They're sloshed to the gills, sure," grinned Sharpe.



"Ain't it queer?" said Abe. "Blamed if it ain't jest the
same with folks. They git a drink under their belts, an' it
sets 'em foolish. They get blowin' their horns, an' doing
things. Then they start singing, an' finish up shootin'       or
kissin' each other."



Josh desisted from his efforts at plying the flies with more
drink, and stared round at his companion.



"I'd jest like to know how drink takes you, Abe," he cried
in pretended alarm, "fightin' or kissin'. 'Cause if it's the
amorous racket, I quit you right here. I just ain't kissin' a
thing. I quit it years ago. It's a fool trick, anyway, an'
physic dopers all sez it's full to death of disease." Then he
added speculatively: "Makes you sort o' wonder what kind
o' disease your kisses 'ud hand around. You don't look as
if you'd got a spavin, or a spring halt. What 'ud you guess,
Lionel?"



"Guess?" Mr. Sharpe helped himself to a fresh cigar.
"Ther' ain't no guessin' to it. Jest consumption. That's
all."



He blew a cloud of smoke on the drunken flies, and sent
them tumbling headlong into the liquor. Then he picked up
the glass and washed it.



"Ah, yes," said Josh. "That's it       consumption       generly
of liquor."



"Which you ain't never bustin' to pay fer," cried Abe,
with a laugh.



"Pay? Wal, I'd smile. Pay? Guess I gone right on
strike payin'. My union don't let its members pay oftener
than they're obliged. But we don't stop non-unions payin'.
Oh, no. We jest boost 'em right on an' help 'em pay."



"Strike?" said Abe. "Guess it's a kind o' fashion goin'
around strikin'. Everybody's worrying to quit somethin'       an'
it's most generly work. But that ain't no use to you,
Josh. You got to do work 'fore you ken quit it."



The bullet-headed butcher smiled benignly.



"Work? Say, you ain't heard o' work. Guess you're
one o' them all-fired capitalists, wot sets around makin'
profit out o' us pore fellers who kill the meat what fills the
tins you poison your customers with, by reason you've
bought up a job line o' throw outs. Work?" he went on,
throwing out his arms in ridiculous burlesque of a strike
orator. "We are the fellers who do the work. We make
your profit for you. We       we       we are the people wot sets the
old world wobblin' around every day. We       us down-trods
who have to drink Sharpe's rot-gut whisky while you amuse
yourself settin' flies drunk on port wine!"



At that moment the swing door was thrust open, and Pete
Farline, the drug-store keeper, and Sid Ellerton pushed
their way in.



"Drink, Lionel," demanded Peter wearily.



But the hotel proprietor shook his head and winked at
Josh.



"I gone on strike       sure," he said.



Pete looked around at Josh and Abe for enlightenment.



"Strike?" he inquired. "Guess I don't get you."



"Why every feller's strikin' now," grinned Josh.



"Oh."



"Quit servin' drinks?" asked Sid, supporting himself on
the bar.



Lionel K. Sharpe shook his head and laughed.



"Nope," he said, amid a cloud of smoke. "Just quit
chalkin' up Pete's score."



He obtained the laugh he required, and set glasses before
the newcomers.



"Seein' it's that way, Lal, I'll have to go on strike sousin'
your poison," Farline retorted. Then he turned to the
others. "Say, fellers, let's strike for decent liquor, an' when
we get it let's strike for havin' it free. If we get that, we'll
have pipes laid on over our beds, and strike again if we don't
get 'em."



"Why, yes," laughed Josh. "Then we'll strike cos the
rats we see ain't spiders."



"Sure," nodded Abe. "An' strike like hell if they grow
wings."



Lionel K. Sharpe held out his hand for Pete's money.



"Then when you wake up       you'll strike anyway," he said.



Pete handed him a dollar bill, and Josh's face purpled
with laughter.



"Get it, boys," he cried. "Look at that!" he went on,
pointing at Sharpe. "There he is, fellers. Ther's the capitalist.
Money for nothin'. That's what it is. That's the
feller we're on to. Down with Capital, sez I! Up with
Labor, or any other old thing. Say, we're right on strike,
an' I'm goin' out to get a banner, an' form a parade. I'm
jest goin' to make speeches to the populace 'bout things.
I'm full up o' Capital. We're sweated, that's wot we are.
We won't stand for it, neither. Down with 'em. We want
their blood. We want the world       with a fence round it.
Say, fellers, ef I git busy that way will you ante up an automobile,
an' drink, an' boost me into the government so I ken
rob folks right, an' keep out of the penitentiary?"



"Boost you to hell!" cried Sharpe, as the swing doors
were pushed open, and a stranger made his way in.



All eyes were turned upon the newcomer. He was a powerfully
built man of medium size. The gray in his dark hair
showed beneath his soft felt hat, and his eyes were narrow
and keen. His dress was the ordinary dress of the city man,
and quite unpretentious.



The men in the bar eyed him covertly as he made his way
to the counter and called for a "long lager."



Lionel K. Sharpe served him as though strangers were an
everyday occurrence in that bar, but he was speculating as
to who he might be.



"Hot," said the man, after a long pull at his schooner of
beer.



"Some," observed Sharpe, handing him his change.



"Bad road from Calford," the stranger said, after another
journey into his beer.



"Hellish," returned Sharpe, wiping glasses.



"How far to Deep Willows?" asked the other, presently.



"Nigh seven," replied Sharpe.



"Across the river?"



"You don't need to. Keep to the right bank."



"Good. Thanks."



The stranger finished his drink, and made his way out
of the place.



In a moment the "strikers" were crowding at the window
watching his departure. They saw him walk across the road
to a large automobile waiting for him. They saw him speak
to the driver, and then jump into the seat beside him. Then
the machine, with a heavy snort, rolled away.



"Another all-fired capitalist," laughed Josh.



"Friend of Hendrie's," murmured Abe.



"Didn't seem Hendrie's class," protested Pete.



Lionel K. Sharpe shook his head.



"I seen him before," he said reflectively. "Seems to me I
see him at Calford some time back. Yes. That's it. He       say,
gee!" He broke into a loud guffaw, and turned to Josh.
"Say, he's the man for you. I mind hearing him shouting
down with capitalists to a lot of bum railroaders. That's
when I saw him."



"You're on your back, man. You got a nightmare," cried
Josh scornfully. "Him drivin' about in an automobile."



Abe grinned.



"That's what they're out for," he cried contemptuously.
Then he turned back to the bar. "Guess we'll have another
drink       anyway."





Alexander Hendrie was leaving Angus Moraine's office,
where he had spent the early hours of the afternoon discussing
matters of business and receiving reports. The two
men had also spent some time considering the conditions
prevailing on the railroad, conditions threatening to affect
them considerably. That a big strike was imminent was
sufficiently apparent to them both, and each understood the
disastrous possibilities to the harvest if it should occur at
that time.



There had been strikes before, but, from Hendrie's confidential
sources, it had been learned that the forthcoming
strike would be of a particularly comprehensive nature.
There was big talk of sympathetic strikes on the part of all
transport workers, and among those who were required to
handle goods ultimately intended for transport on the railroad.



The Scot was troubled. But Hendrie seemed to revel in
the contemplation of a great struggle with Labor. Truth
to tell, he was actually pleased that all his energies would be
involved in the forthcoming fight. He would have less time
to think, and he had no desire to think just now.



He left the office by the outer door, and walked leisurely
round to the front of the house, intent upon the threatened
struggle, and those things which would be affected by it. He
was calmly considering every point, every detail in the great
game in which his life was spent, which might be brought
into contact with it.



At the entrance porch of the house he paused, and drew
a bundle of cipher messages from his pocket. He read them
carefully. Each one represented a financial transaction with
some well-known Chicago wheat speculator, the completion
of which would place his interests beyond the reach of disaster
through any strikes. He had only to wire an affirmative
to any one of them to set all doubts at rest.



However, he finally returned them to his pocket and shook
his head. No, it was too easy. It would rob him of all place
in the fight to come       if such fight really were coming. Besides,
there would be that loss of profit for the speculator's
risk; a loss which his keen, financial mind begrudged. No,
not yet. There was time enough. He would only yield to
the temptation of safeguarding the affairs of the Trust when
it became absolutely necessary.



He thrust his hands deeply into his coat pockets, as though
to emphasize his decision, and his gaze wandered toward the
fair woodland picture of the river banks, crowded with virgin
growth. Acres and acres of ripening grain lay beyond, and
here and there, through breaks in the foliage, he could discern
the tint of yellow amid the paling carpet of green. The
sight of it further hardened his decision.



To a man of lesser caliber the responsibility of that wheat
world must have been a burden to tax the nerves to the uttermost.
But to Hendrie it was scarcely a labor. He loved this
world he had made his, and it weighed far less upon him than
did the more trifling worries adding friction to the routine
of daily life. But for Monica's illness, and a curious sort of
nightmare haunting the back cells of this man's memory,
Alexander Hendrie must have been a perfectly happy man,
reveling in a success which had been his life-long ambition.



Finally he turned from the pleasant scenes his thoughts
were conjuring. He was about to pass into the house to
visit the woman who was the choicest jewel in his crown of
success. He moved toward the doorway, but paused
abruptly. The sweep of the private trail on the north bank
of the river had come within his view, and he beheld a powerful
automobile rapidly approaching the house.



For the moment he believed it to be the visit of one of his
associates in business, perhaps from Calford, or even Winnipeg.
Then he doubted. He was expecting no one. Anyway
he would have been notified of their coming.



He left the porch and stood out in the open, watching the
vehicle curiously. It came swiftly on, its soft purr humming
upon the still, hot air. It was a large touring car, and two
people were occupying the front seat. The rest was empty.



A few moments later it drew up sharply abreast of him.
A pair of keen eyes were staring at him from the other side
of the chauffeur. Hendrie caught their stare, and a quick,
deep breath filled his lungs.



For a while, it seemed quite a long time to the millionaire,
no word was spoken. Then he saw the man on the other side
of the driver jump out of the car. Then he heard him speak.



"You can go back up the trail," he said to his man. "I'll
walk out and meet you when I want you."



Then the car moved off. It turned about, and finally
rolled away. Hendrie saw all this without taking any interest.
For some reason his thoughts had been abruptly carried
back into a dim past, to a vision of a land of lofty, barren
hills, a land of drear woods and shadowed valleys, a land
where fierce cold ate into the bones, and strangled the joy
of living.



And all the while his eyes were fixed upon the back of the
powerful figure that remained turned toward him until the
car had passed out of sight. Then the stranger swung about.
His narrow eyes were alight with a passion that seemed
unaccountable. He raised one hand, and his forefinger
pointed a deadly hatred.



"You! Leo!" he cried.



The dreary scenes of the Yukon heights faded abruptly
from the millionaire's mind. He looked into that narrow,
evilly expressive face with a cold, hard stare.



"Yes," he said. "Well?"



There was no flinching. There was no surprise even. He
spoke utterly without emotion, like the echo of those ruthless
hills which only a moment before he had contemplated.



"So       I've come up with you at last!" cried Austin Leyburn.
"Oh, I knew I should do so some day. It was not
possible for it to be otherwise. I've searched. I've sounded
every corner of this continent. Some day, I guessed I'd turn
the stone under which you were hiding."



For an instant Hendrie's eyes lit. Then they smiled with a
contempt for the mind that could suggest his hiding.



"Guess that's my name       has always been my name."
said, with an expressive lifting of the shoulders. "Your
search sounds better than it could have been in fact. I allow
the world has known just where to set its finger on Alexander
Hendrie for many years now. Say, p'raps you're not interested
in wheat, and so missed finding me."



"You? Alexander Hendrie?" Leyburn cried incredulously.



"Guess that's my name       has always been my name."
Hendrie smoothed his mane of hair with one steady hand.
"Folks used to call me Leo, because       of this. By the way,
you apparently came to see me?"



The face of Austin Leyburn expressed a devilish hatred
no words could have told. It was a hatred nursed and fostered
through long years when his mind and energies were
wholly turned upon profit extracted through the ignorance
and passion of fellow-creatures of inferior mentality. It was
an atmosphere in which such passionate bitterness might
well be fostered.



But the calmness of his intended victim, for the moment,
had a restraining effect. He felt the need for coolness.



So he laughed. There was no mirth in his laughter. It
was a hollow sound that jarred terribly.



"Yes, I came here to find Alexander Hendrie, and not       Leo.
I came to find the millionaire wheat grower, and challenge
him with the injustices he is handing out to white agricultural
labor, whose representative I am. I came to warn
him that it was impossible for men of our union to work side
by side with black labor, which earns white man's pay. I
came to tell him that if he persisted, there is not a white man
in the country will work for him, and that he must dismiss all
black labor at once. I came to tell Alexander Hendrie these
things, and I find       Leo."



Hendrie smiled into his face.



"You came to tell him all this, and you found, in his stead
       Leo, the feller I guess you're not particularly well disposed
toward. In fact, whom you       rather dislike. Well?"



Years of self-discipline had given Austin Leyburn a fine
control of himself. But before that control had been acquired
he had been robbed of all he possessed in the world by
a man named Leo. He had been made to suffer by this man
as few men are made to suffer, and after facing trials and
hardships few men face successfully. These sufferings had
ingrained into his heart a passionate hatred and desire for
revenge no acquired control could withstand, and now the
torrent of his bitter animosity broke out.



"Whom I hate better than any man on earth," Leyburn
cried, in a low, passionate tone. "Listen to me, Leo. You're
a great man now. You're among the rich of this continent,
and so you're the more worth crushing. We both find ourselves
in different positions now. Very different positions.
You are powerful in the control of huge capital, founded upon
the gold you stole from me twenty years ago on the Yukon
trail. I       I control hundreds of thousands of workers in this
country. That is no mean power. Hitherto my power has
been exercised in the legitimate process of protecting that
labor from men of your class. But from this moment all
that is changed. Before all things in my life I have a mission
to fulfill. It is my personal vengeance upon the man who
robbed me twenty years ago, and left his mistress, bearing
her unborn child, to starve on the long winter trail."



"It is a lie! She was not left to starve. She was provided
for."



Hendrie was driven to furious denial by the taunt.



"Ah, that's better!" cried Leyburn. "Much better. I've
cut through your rough hide. I say you left her to starve       for
all you cared. And I've set myself up as the champion
of her cause as well as my own. I'm going to carry it
through with all the power at my command. Oh, I know no
law will help me to my vengeance. That highway robbery is
just between ourselves. Well, I guess I don't need any one's
help to avenge it."



Hendrie had himself well under control again. He nodded
as the man paused.



"Go on," he said.



"I intend to," Leyburn cried, his face livid and working
with the fury that drove him. "I'm going back now to Toronto
to set the machinery working. And that machinery
will grind its way on till you are reduced to the dust I intend
to crush you into. It will not be Labor against Capital. But
Labor against Alexander Hendrie."



"And what shall I be doing?" Hendrie's eyes were alight
with something like amusement.



"You       you? I'll tell you what you'll be doing when I've
finished. You'll be wishing to God you had never stolen a
dead man's gold."



Hendrie started. His eyes grew tigerish. But he remained
silent. Leyburn saw the change and understood it.



"Oh, God, it was a low-down game, something about
parallel to the ghoul on the battlefield stealing money and
accouterments from the dead soldiers. Now you are going
to pay for it as you deserve. Don't make any mistake. By
God, Leo, I'm going to smash you!"



Austin Leyburn turned away and hurried down the trail.






CHAPTER XI



LEYBURN'S INSPIRATION



Feverish activity was going forward in all the labor
controls which acknowledged Austin Leyburn's leadership.
Everywhere was agitation and ferment among the rank and
file of the workers, while controlling staffs worked night and
day.



Austin Leyburn had projected the greatest coup ever attempted
in the country. At one stroke he intended to paralyze
all trade. East and west, north and south, it was his
purpose to leave the moving world at a standstill.



There were many nominal causes for the upheaval. They
could be found every day, in almost every calling, each one,
in itself, of a trivial nature, perhaps, but, collectively, an
expression of tyranny and injustice on the part of the employers
that he, Leyburn, and those others interested in the
labor movement, declared could not be borne by the worker.
So the latter awoke to learn of the many injustices he had
been enduring, and of which, before, he had been utterly
unaware.



The real cause of the forthcoming struggle lay far deeper.
It found its breeding ground in the fertile realms of human
nature, the human nature of the men who led the movement.
They required self-aggrandizement and profit, and beneath
the cloak of Principle they hid their unworthy desires from
the searchlight of publicity. Principle       since democracy
had struggled from beneath the crushing heel of the oppressor
the word had become enormously fashionable. Its
elasticity had been its success. It could be molded by the
individual to suit every need. But in these days, it had become
far more the hall-mark of hypocrisy than the expression
of lofty ideals.



Years ago Austin Leyburn had declared his belief that
some of the overflow from the world's pockets could be diverted
into his own, by methods far less strenuous than those
of the great Leo. Since then he had endeavored to prove
his assertion.



That he had been successful there could be no doubt. He
was far better equipped with this world's goods than he
would have cared to proclaim from the platform to one of
his labor audiences. He kept his private life hidden by
a very simple process, and so much noise and bustle did he
contrive in his calling that no one gave him credit for
possessing any       private life.



But herein the world was mistaken. The life he displayed
to his colleagues was simple and unpretentious. He lived
in a cheap suite of apartments in the humbler quarters of
Toronto. He ate in restaurants where he rubbed shoulders
with men of the labor world. In his business he walked, or
rode in the street cars. To carry added conviction his
clothes were always of the ready-made order, and he possessed
a perfect genius for reducing the immaculateness of
a low, starched collar.



But there was another Austin Leyburn when the claims
of his business released him for infrequent week-ends. He
was an affluent sort of country squire. A man who reveled
in the possession of an ample estate and splendid mansion,
hidden away in the remotenesses of a natural beauty spot
some twenty-five miles outside Toronto. Here he enjoyed
the luxuries and comforts which in others were anathema to
him. His cellar was well stocked with wines of the choicest
vintages. His cigars were the best money could buy. He
possessed a modest collection of works of art, and his house
was furnished with all those things valued for their age and
associations.



To this place he would adjourn at long intervals. And at
such times even his name would be left behind him in the
city, in company of his ready-made clothing, his scarcely
immaculate collar, and the memory of fly-ridden restaurants,
lest there should be a jarring note to his enjoyment as he
lounged back in his powerful automobile, which was never
permitted to cross the city limits.



All these things were bought and paid for by a method of
making money almost devilish in its inception. Leyburn
was a gambler on the stock market. He gambled in Labor
strikes.



This was the great final coup he now contemplated. He
cared not one jot for the injustices meted out to labor.
He cared nothing for the sufferings, the privations it had to
endure. Long ago he and many others of his associates had
learned the fact that all strikes more or less affected the
financial market. Nor were they slow to take advantage
of it.



A general transport strike would send shares crashing to
bed-rock prices; would send them tumbling as they had
never fallen before, as even international war would not
affect them. And when they had fallen sufficiently, when, in
his own phraseology, the bottom had dropped out of the
market, then he and his fellow-vultures would plunge their
greedy beaks into the flesh of the carcass and gorge themselves.
Then, and not till then, the starving worker might
return to his work.



Just now he was in Calford and hard at work. While his
subordinates lived in a whirl of organization, his it was to
contrive that the news of the labor troubles reached the
world at large in a sufficiently alarming type. And his
gauge of the alarm achieved would be the state of the financial
markets.



He had only that morning returned from Deep Willows,
and it was not until long after his mid-day meal that he
found leisure to turn his thoughts definitely to the fresh
plans he had decided upon, on his journey back to Calford.



Now, as he sat before his desk, he picked up the receiver
of the telephone and spoke sharply.



"Is Frank Smith in the office?" he demanded. "Yes. I
said Smith. Oh! Then tell him to come to me at once."



He replaced the instrument and leaned back in his chair.
He felt that Fate had played an extraordinarily pleasant
trick upon him. In his cynical way he admitted grudgingly
that for once she had been more than kind. The chance of it.
A loose end. Yes, he had actually found himself with a loose
end, and had promptly decided to fill up the time with a visit
to the greatest wheat grower in the country in the interests of
his new toy, the Agricultural Labor Society. It had led him       whither?



His narrow eyes smiled. But the smile died almost at its
birth, lost in a bitter hatred for the man who had robbed him
upon the Yukon trail twenty years ago.



The door of his room opened and Frank hurried in. His
manner was nervous, quite unlike his usual manner. He was
changed in appearance, too. Nor was it a change for the
better. He looked older. His eyes were painfully serious.
His dress wore an air of neglect. Whatever else the work of
a labor organizer had done for him there was no outward
sign of improvement.



"You sent for me?" he demanded, a look of nervous expectation
in his serious eyes.



"Sure." Leyburn nodded. His manner was final. It was
also the manner of an employer to a subordinate. The intimacy
between these two had somehow died out.



Leyburn gazed at him thoughtfully, and the superiority of
his position was displayed therein. Frank experienced a
feeling of irritation. Leyburn frequently irritated him now.
When they had first met, the boy's enthusiasm had made him
regard this leader as something in the nature of a god. Since
then he had discovered a good deal of clay about the feet of
his deity.



"Guess I'm going to hand you a change of work, boy,"
Leyburn said at last, his manner deliberately impressive.
"Say, you weren't a big hit with the railroaders." Frank
winced perceptibly, and the other saw that his thrust had
gone home. "Oh, I don't blame you a hell of a lot," he went
on patronizingly. "You've never been a railroader       that's
where it comes in. I'd say the feller that talks to those boys
needs to be one of 'em. We got plenty without you, and       so
I'm going to hand you a change, to the farming racket."
Then he smiled. "Guess you're a bit of a mossback yourself.
You'll understand those boys, and be able to talk 'em their
own way."



Frank's face had flushed with the poignancy of his feelings
over his failure. He felt even more the crudeness of this
man's manner.



"I'll do my best," he said briefly.



There was none of his earlier enthusiasm in his assurance.
Truth to tell, something of his enthusiasm had died on the
night of his failure at the railroaders' meeting, and it had
died after Alexander Hendrie had left him.



"That's right," said Leyburn, with some geniality. "I
don't like your 'cocksures.' Give me the man out to do his
damnedest. You'll make good, lad       this time. Say, I'm
going to set you chasing up the work among the farms. See
it's going ahead. Ther's men out to do the gassing. You'll
just have to see they gas right. Get me? There's going to
be a strike around harvest       this year. It's going to happen
along with the transporters."



Frank was startled. There was to have been no serious
movement this year on the agricultural side. Only preparations.
Why this sudden change of plans?



"This year?" he said.



"That's how I said," returned Leyburn dryly.



"But I thought              "



"I'll do the thinking, boy," said Leyburn quickly. Then
he grinned. "Guess I've done most of it already. You're
on?"



"Why, yes." Frank was perplexed. Nor had he any
definite objection.



"Good." Leyburn picked his teeth with a match. Then
he went on: "You'll make your headquarters at Everton.
That's where Hendrie's place is. I've got men at work there.
They've been there quite a while. We're taking up that nigger
question there, and punching it home for all we're worth.
It's a good lever for running up wages on. The wheat men
will be easy       their crops are perishable. If Hendrie don't
squeal quick, he's got miles of wheat growing," he said significantly.
"Of course he's only one. But he's good to work on.
Now, just watch around there. Don't do a heap of big talk.
The other'll do that. You'll go around the farms, the smaller
ones, and do some private talk. You'll superintend the
whole of that section. Guess there's a hundred and more
farms in it. I'll hand you a schedule of 'em."



As Leyburn finished speaking, Frank stirred uneasily.



"Must I go on this work?" he asked hesitatingly.



Leyburn looked up sharply. There was a sparkle in his
eyes.



"Sure," he said coldly.



"Couldn't you hand me another section?" Frank asked,
after an awkward pause, while Leyburn regarded his averted
face closely.



"Why?" The demand rapped out. It was full of a sudden,
angry distrust. Leyburn was not in the habit of having
his orders questioned in his own office.



But Frank's hesitation and nervousness vanished under the
other's intolerable manner. Leyburn's attitude was not one
he was prepared to submit to. He felt it would not have been
displayed, but for his failure with the railroaders. If that
was the sort of man Leyburn was       well              



"I can't do the work you want me to, round about Deep
Willows," he said, with deliberate coldness.



"Why?" Again came the monosyllabic inquiry. But this
time it was in genuine surprise, and possessed no resentment.



Frank found it easier to explain in consequence.



"You see, Mon       Mrs. Hendrie is       is my foster mother,"
he said simply. "I owe her nothing but good. I can never
tell you of the sacrifices she has made for me, and of her devotion.
I shouldn't like to hurt her."



Leyburn stared. There was no resentment in him now       only
amazement.



"Then       then       Hendrie is              "



"Hendrie is the man who sent me to the penitentiary for
five years."



Frank turned away as he made the admission. Leyburn
emitted a low whistle.



"You see," Frank went on. "I had told you my story
without telling you any names. I should not tell you now,
only that it becomes necessary to explain my reasons for refusing
to accept the work."



But Leyburn was not listening. He suddenly pointed at
a chair.



"Sit, boy," he cried, his manner suddenly assuming a
pleasant geniality. "Sit right down       and let's talk this thing
out."



Frank was glad enough to accept the invitation. He owed
this man a good deal in spite of his slight change of feelings
towards him. Nor was he one to shrink from paying his
debts.



"It's the queerest thing ever," Leyburn went on thoughtfully,
as Frank drew up a chair. Then, in answer to the
other's look of inquiry: "Why, that I should chose you to go
and deal with our       organization       in Hendrie's neighborhood.
Seems almost like Fate pitching him into your hands
for what he's       done to you. He's hurt you, and now       now,
why, your turn's coming along."



"But curiously enough, I have no desire for any retaliation,"
said Frank simply. "One time I might have been
pleased to       hurt him. But now       well       somehow I seem to
understand what drove him to it, and       I don't blame him so
much. Besides              "



"Besides?" Leyburn's eyes were watchful.



"That sort of thing doesn't fit in with my ideas of Brotherhood,"
Frank concluded simply.



Leyburn nodded. His expression had become absurdly
gentle.



"Maybe you're right, boy," he said. "You see, I'm an old
campaigner. Guess I'm a bit hardened."



"That's natural, too." Frank was glad at the change in
the man. He was glad, too, that he could agree with him.



"But there's no real hurt coming to Hendrie, if       he's reasonable,"
Leyburn went on thoughtfully. "You see, boy,
maybe it looks that way, but this process of ours is only a
sharpish way of teaching these monopolists that they've got
to remember there are other folks in the world who need to
live. That there is such a thing as brotherhood. I'd say
Hendrie's a pretty good man, but he's headstrong       as you
know. He won't be told a thing. All we need from him is
his example, showing all those smaller folk he understands
the needs of humanity, and is prepared to do his slice for it.
What are we going to do? Why, when the time comes, the
time most vital to him, we're going to show him he's dependent
on us, and needs to treat us right. That's all. If he
treats us right, then there's no harm done. This war       you
hate the word       can be run on peaceful lines if both parties
are not yearning to scrap. All we've got to do is to be
ready to scrap. You won't be hurting Mrs. Hendrie. You
won't be hurting a soul. But you'll just stand by to defend
labor if they're out to hurt us. Get me?"



Frank nodded.



"Yes. It is right enough what you say," he replied. "I
know all that. But it's this strike, and all the damage it does,
makes me feel sick about it."



Leyburn laughed.



"If I know Hendrie, there'll be no strike. All we've got to
do is to be ready for one. Say, lad, you're a bit sensitive. I
tell you we're just going to bluff Hendrie into doing what he
doesn't want to do. That's giving a living wage to folk who
work for him. He'll give it when the bluff's put up."



"You think so?" Frank's eagerness sounded pleasantly
in Leyburn's ears.



"Sure. They all do       in the end. Wheat men are easier
than railroad companies. Their crops are perishable.
There'll be no real strike. So Mrs. Hendrie's your       foster
mother. Say, it beats hell."



"Yes." Frank looked up. "She's a sort of aunt, too," he
said unguardedly, flushing as he remembered that he could
claim no real relationship with any one. "Her sister was my       mother.
I don't know who my father was       exactly. I
know he was called Leo, but              "



"Leo!" Leyburn started. It was with difficulty he could
keep himself from shouting the name. "Leo       you said?
Then you are              " It was on the tip of his tongue to tell
Frank he was Hendrie's son. But a sudden inspiration
checked the impulse.



"I am       what?" demanded Frank, caught by the others
excitement.



But Leyburn was equal to the occasion.



"Not necessarily, though," he said, with an assumption of
thoughtfulness. "I was going to say Italian. Maybe Leo
was just his first name."



Frank shook his head.



"I don't know. I don't think I'm Italian, though," he said
unsuspiciously. "You see, Mrs. Hendrie is American, as, of
course, was my mother. She had been an actress. Audrey
Thorne, I think she called herself, but her real name was
Elsie Hanson. Still, these details can't interest you," he
finished up a little drearily.



Leyburn stared out of the window for some moments. He
was thinking hard. He was piecing all he had just learned
together, and striving to see how he might turn it all to account
in the purpose he had in his mind. If he had been
amazed before on learning the name of the man who had injured
Frank       amazed, and fiendishly delighted, it was nothing
to his feelings now. Hendrie, Frank's father! Audie's
son! Audie! Yes, more than ever Frank must be enlisted in
this work. It would delight his, Leyburn's, revengeful nature
if Hendrie could be made to suffer through his own son.
It was a good thought, and very pleasant to him.



He turned a smiling, kindly face upon his victim.



"It's all devilish hard luck on you, boy       to be born, in a
manner of speaking, without father or mother. The world
certainly owes you a big debt. A debt so big you'd wonder
how it could ever pay it. But the world has its own little
ways of doing things. It's sometimes got a queer knack."



Frank shook his head. His smile was tinged with sadness.



"I don't seem to feel that way either," he said slowly. "I
don't seem to feel any one owes me anything. Maybe I did
a while back, but I don't now."



"Not even Hendrie?"



Frank shook his head seriously.



"Least of all       Hendrie. I rather fancy he's been paid all
he can bear for what he did to me."



Leyburn sighed with pretended sympathy.



"You're a good boy," he said kindly. "Too good for the
hard knocks life likes handing around. Maybe you'll get       compensation.
However," he went on, sitting up, and assuming
a business-like alertness, "we've got to put this business
through. We've got to make these people give a fair
wage to their workers, a wage that will leave them a margin
of comfort and happiness in a dreary sort of life. Nigger
labor is cutting them out, and it can't be tolerated. We're
not out to injure these employers. By God, we're not!
We're out with as good a purpose by them as any church
parson. That's what I can't get folks to see. Our methods
may be rough, but the end justifies it. They are our only
ways of doing it. I tell you, boy, in this fight we are having,
of man against himself       and that's what it amounts to       we
have got to put all sentiment aside. Our duty lies clear
before us. And when the war is over, Hendrie, and all men
like him, will be the first to see the righteousness of our cause       and
thank us. We take out a tooth, boy, because it aches,
and it is painful to do it, but it leaves us with everlasting
peace. You don't feel you can do this work I want you to
do? Well, I won't press it. But"       he turned a sidelong
glance upon the other's ingenuous face, now so expressive of
the struggle going on within his simple mind       "but I think
the teaching for Hendrie would have come well from you.
Yes, it surely would." He smiled. "Good for evil, eh? And
it is for his good. It is almost a duty       feeling as you do. He
is a good man, but       passionate. And his passions run away
with him. Seems to me it would be good to point the right
road to him. Then, too, you understand his kind. S'pose
I threw a hard-shouting, leather-lunged hobo at him       we
wouldn't get so good a result. Not by a lot. It would be
doubling the risk of trouble. Well, where would you like to
work       instead?"



Frank rose from his seat and began to pace the room.
Leyburn silently watched him. The smile behind his eyes was
well hidden. He knew his man. He felt it to be hard work
persuading him, but it was worth while.



At last Frank abruptly came to a stand before him.



"I'll do the work," he cried, with a gulp. "I tell you, Leyburn,
I'd rather do anything else, but I       I believe, as you say,
it's my duty to do this. Yes, I'll go, and I'll do my very best.
But I warn you, if trouble threatens Mrs. Hendrie, directly
or indirectly, I'll do my best to help her, if all labor in the
world has to suffer for it."






CHAPTER XII



HENDRIE SELLS



Alexander Hendrie's mood was one of doubt and almost
indecision, as he rode over the hard, white trail intersecting
the miles of wheat surrounding Deep Willows. He had spent
an unpleasant morning with his manager. He had listened
to bad reports of Monica's condition, and added to these were
many unpleasant reflections upon the visit of the man Tug       whom
he now knew to be the great labor leader       Austin Leyburn       to
Deep Willows.



Now that the harvest was drawing near he found himself
surrounded by a wonderful picture of golden glory. Under
ordinary circumstances he must have reveled in the sight, for,
before all things, the growing of wheat represented the chief
factor in his life. But now he found little enough pleasure
in the contemplation of an abundant harvest. His mind was
beset with so many things which could rob him of such joy,
and it was almost as if the brilliant sunlight, shining on the
wealth of gold about him, had been obscured by storm clouds
of a drab, depressing hue.



Angus Moraine's tale of trials and portentous happenings
had been a long one. The unrest among the hundreds of
workers employed upon the farms was paralyzing efficient
work. The imported black labor was both unsatisfactory as
regards work, and a constant source of worry in its relation
with the white. Only the night before a fierce encounter had
occurred between the two colors, which, but for his own
timely intervention, must have ended in bloodshed, if not in
some sort of deliberate lynching of six drunken blacks. He
warned Hendrie with the utmost solemnity that he was riding
for a serious fall, and that unless the matter was looked into
at once, the threatened strike would be child's play to the
brutal warfare that was daily brewing.



Thus, at Angus's earnest request, Hendrie had set out on
a tour of inspection of some of the remoter homesteads on
the estate. He was going to see for himself and test the attitude
of his army of workers. The truth of his manager's
statements was quickly brought home to him. He soon discovered
a definite antagonism toward himself in the white
camps, which left him no room for doubt. But it seemed
otherwise among the blacks. These men seemed contented
enough. The threat of their white fellows seemed to have
left them quite undisturbed. Perhaps, since their numbers
were rapidly being augmented, they felt strong enough to
deal adequately with any possible attack. He knew the
sanguine nature of the nigger well enough to realize that his
arrogance was not easily overshadowed by physical fear of
his fellows.



In his heart, however, Alexander Hendrie knew that Angus
was right, and he was wrong. There was certainly danger
of a sort ahead. Perhaps even a danger not to be trifled
with. But this did not weigh seriously with him. He felt
that his interests were sufficiently safeguarded, and that
which he was doing was perfectly within his rights. He
could not see that defying a prejudice was to commit any
crime against the canons of labor. Besides       and herein lay
the secret of his obstinate determination to adhere to his
policy       labor was trying to "bluff" him. He would call the
"bluff" of any man. He simply would not submit. Nor, if
blood were spilled, would he hold himself responsible.



But this was only a part of that which was troubling him.
Far more serious than all question of labor, the man Leyburn's
personal threats stood out in his mind. He did not
fear him personally. It was not in the master of Deep Willows
to fear any man. But he understood the scheming
mind of the labor leader, and it certainly troubled him as to
the direction his attack would take.



He would attack. There was no question of that. If it
were through labor, Hendrie really had little with which to
concern himself. That was prepared for. But he doubted
if it would come through that quarter. Elsewhere he knew
there were many vulnerable spots in his armor of defence.



His alert mind was not slow to fix upon his weakest spot.
It was his home-life. His passionate love for Monica guided
him unerringly to the one point in which he dreaded an attack
most. This man Tug, as he knew him, was not one of
the bolder class of antagonists. He would not openly assail
him before the world. That could never be his way. He
would attack subtly, and in the direction he was sure of
hurting most. Hendrie himself knew where he could be hurt
most. Did Leyburn?



Something very like despair gripped him, as, in fancy, he
pictured Monica's scorn and loathing for the man who was
her Frank's father, against the man for his apparent desertion
of her dead sister, Audie. This was the shadow that
had oppressed him ever since that fateful day on which he
had learned that Frank was his own son. This was the
burden he had borne as the just punishment for that crime
he had committed so long ago. Now the hand of Fate still
seemed to be moving on, and he felt instinctively that the
woman he loved better than life itself must soon be told,
and he must bow before the sentence her gentle lips might
pass. He could not hope. He dared not. He knew he was
at the mercy of a merciless enemy who would have no
scruples as to how he accomplished his end.



His busy brain traveled on and on, over possibilities and
impossibilities. His imagination had become feverishly active,
and its hideous limits seemed unbounded.



But amid it all he still found it possible to draw one
slight satisfaction, and it was a true index to his curiously
savage manhood.



It was little enough, but it was the one bright spot on his
drab horizon. He found it possible to draw satisfaction
from the memory of that robbery of Tug's gold. Yes, he
had many enough regrets for things he had done in those
by-gone days, but he was truly glad of that passionate,
almost insane moment of craving when he had robbed Austin
Leyburn of all he possessed in the world.



Yes, it was good       but       no, he had not robbed him of
quite all. He had left him       his life. Well, Austin Leyburn
had best be careful what he did. Monica's love was more
precious to him than perhaps Leyburn's gold had been to
the wretched man who had so laboriously wrested it from
the bosom of mother earth.



His moments were very dark as his horse made its way
back to Deep Willows. They were so dark that they
seemed almost impossible of ever lightening. Then, as so
often happens in the midst of the blackest moments, there
came a flash of revealing light. It was the desperate courage
of the man suddenly rising superior to the false cowardice
inspired by his love for his wife. Why should he not
forestall Leyburn? Why not tell her his story himself?
Why not make a desperate fight to rid himself for ever of the
haunting shadow of that painful past? If lose her he must,
it would be far better to lose her with the truth, the simple,
plain facts upon his lips, than to be found guilty of endeavoring
to wilfully deceive.



The complexity of this man was extraordinary. But
whatever his faults or virtues, and the latter were few
enough, his mainspring of character was a colossal courage
that could not long be held under by baser considerations.
He might rob, as he had done, he might even slay, yet
through it all he would prove his manhood when the time
for expiation came. Whatever Austin Leyburn's estimate of
Alexander Hendrie he would find himself pitted against a
superior manhood when he drew his sword upon him.



Reaching the home farm, Hendrie dismounted and left his
horse with the waiting groom. He hurried off in the direction
of the house and encountered Angus on his way from
his office. The manager stopped him.



"Been around?" he inquired, without any lightness.



Hendrie nodded. He was in a hurry.



"Sure," he said.



"Well, what d'you think of things?"



The Scot's persistence was not easy to fling off.



"Can't stop now," Hendrie exclaimed. "I'll tell you
later."



But Angus had not yet finished.



"Say." He paused deliberately. "Guess I've got more
than I'm yearning to lose in the Trust, so I guess there's no
offence in what I need to say. If you'll listen to me, Mr.
Hendrie, I say, for God's sake sell, and sell quick!"



Hendrie smiled at the other's earnestness.



"I'm going to," he said easily. "I'm going right into Calford
to fix it to-night."



He passed on, flinging his final words over his shoulder at
the stern-eyed Scot, who promptly continued his way with a
load lifted from his money-loving heart.



But the road Hendrie had set himself to face seemed beset
with obstruction. At the house he encountered Doctor
Fraser, who had been impatiently awaiting his return. His
news was written in his anxious face, and the millionaire read
it before he opened his lips.



"Trouble?" demanded Hendrie shortly, as the man detained
him.



"Yes. Mrs. Hendrie has had a bad night. And       there
are signs I don't like. I want you to have another nurse at
once. You see, Miss Raysun is admirable for helping to keep
our patient's spirits up, and all that, but I want a trained
eye to be on the watch all the time. There are developments
I am afraid of. If they come along we shall have to act very
promptly."



"Danger?" The millionaire's face was tensely set.



"Oh, not yet. Not yet. I hope there won't be, but       we
must be prepared."



In the doctor's anxious face there was none of the confidence
his words expressed, and Hendrie was in no wise deceived.



"Can I see her?" he inquired sharply.



"Ye-es. I see no objection," the other returned cautiously.
"All I ask is that you keep her from all excitement.
That is imperative. I think it will do her good to see you.
Only be careful."



Hendrie waited for no more. He pushed his way through
the glass entrance doors, and hurried upstairs and along
the softly carpeted corridor to his wife's sick room. At the
door he paused for a moment before he knocked. His heart
was beating furiously. Doctor Fraser's news had disturbed
him far more than his outward seeming had admitted.



Phyllis opened the door to him. When she saw who it was
she drew aside to allow him to pass in. Then, as she heard
Monica's glad cry from the bed, discreetly withdrew, and
closed the door.



In three strides Hendrie was at Monica's side, and the
next moment her head was pillowed upon his shoulder, with
his powerful arm supporting her, as he seated himself upon
the downy softness of the bed.



"My poor Mon," he said gently, as he looked down into
the pale, worn face of the sick woman. "I've just seen
Doc Fraser, who tells me you've had another bad night."



Monica nestled closer to this great strong man whom she
almost worshipped.



"Yes, dear," she said, gazing up into his face in almost
pathetic appeal. "It is the nights that are worst. It's       it's
too dreadful. The moment night comes I am haunted
by dreadful waking dreams. There is no peace       none whatever.
Every dreadful thing, every painful moment I have
ever endured in my life seems to rise up and mock at me.
Sometimes I feel I shall never sleep again. And yet I suppose
I do sleep and don't know it, for the dreams go on and
on until daylight comes. Oh, I wish I knew what was the
matter with me. This dreadful sort of nightmare I think is
killing me. If only I were in pain, if only I could feel something,
I believe I could bear it more easily. Oh, I wish it
would end."



For a moment Hendrie had no answer. Every word Monica
had uttered left a stab in his aching heart. He knew, as
Phyllis knew, the cause of all this trouble. He knew, no one
knew better, that he, and he alone, was its cause. Her nervous
system had been driven to the breaking point more than a
year ago, and his had been the hand that had driven it. His
mind went back to young Frank and his own visit to him.
It had seemed to promise well. Frank had desired to see
Monica. But       he had not yet done so. He knew that
Frank, the sight of him alone, would go far to banishing the
tortures of this woman's nerves.



He stifled his feelings, and vainly endeavored to cheer her.



"I think it would do you good to go away to the sea, or
the mountains, Mon," he said, in his lightest manner. "It
could be easily fixed, if the Doc. says you can go. A special
train, no stop anywhere. What do you think?"



But Monica only shook her head.



"I don't want to leave Deep Willows, and Phyl, and you,"
she said plaintively. "The happiest moments of my life have
been spent here. I just never want to see Winnipeg ever
again. Nor Toronto. No, dear, when our son is born I want
him to be born       here."



Hendrie smiled tenderly down into the poor tired eyes.
He bent and kissed her.



"Son?" he said gently.



"Yes, dear. I'm sure he will be our       son."



The man sighed. He was thinking of Frank. He was
thinking of another woman who had said that to him. He
was thinking of all he had come to tell this woman, and he
knew he must remain silent. The doctor said she must not
be excited. The way he had calculated to beat the man Tug
was barred to him, and he knew he had thought more of
beating him than of the honesty of his purpose.



Monica looked up at him with a little sigh.



"Tell me, dear, how are the Trust affairs going?" she
asked, a little eagerly. "I seem to have lost all touch with
them."



Hendrie promptly exerted himself.



"Why, things couldn't be better," he said, lying deliberately.



"I'm so glad. Your scheme will win out as your schemes
always do. You are       a wonderful man, Alec." She sighed
contentedly. "Tell me of them."



There was no escape, and Hendrie promptly resigned
himself. He knew he must draw a glowing picture for this
gentle, sick creature, who loved him, and he did his best.



He told her of the general position of things, carefully
suppressing everything of an unpleasant nature, or glossing
them over. He just hinted at the labor unrest, feeling it
would be best to leave it alone. But Monica eagerly caught
at the hints.



"Ah," she cried, starting from his supporting arm. "I
knew there was labor trouble."



"You knew? Who told you?" Hendrie's surprise was
marked. It was an understood thing that all that was unpleasant
should be kept from Monica. He wondered if
Phyllis had been foolish enough to tell her.



Monica smiled up at him. Her eyes were feverish.



"You need not be afraid, Alec," she said, with a touch of
reproach in her tone. "No one has told me; no one has disobeyed
orders. But it is useless to try to keep these things
from me, when       they are unpleasant. Did I not tell you all
my nights were crowded with dreams that are unpleasant?
I have seen this labor trouble in my dreams. I have seen it,
not as you talk of it, as something to be set aside as of no
importance. I have seen it in its full horror of merciless
antagonism of class against class. I have seen the poverty,
the misery and starvation driving the wretched workers to
fierce and criminal outrages. It has been war, bitter war for
existence on the part of these, and desperate defence on the
part of folks like ourselves. I have seen cities in flames, with
the streets running blood. I have seen the whole countryside
afire, and we, you and I, have been always in its midst,
with my poor Frank at the head of the mob. Oh, it has been
dreadful, awful."



Monica had quite suddenly worked herself up into a frenzy
of fever, and the man at her side looked helplessly on. The
moment she finished speaking he sought with all his might to
soothe her jangling nerves.



"These are fancies, dear," he said, in his direct fashion.
"These are the distortions of the darkness you complain
about. Listen, I'll tell you. None of these things can hurt
us, and I don't think your Frank will ever lead a mob. His
thoughts and impulses are far too exalted. For ourselves I
am going to Calford to sell to-day. I am going to complete
the deal before any word of labor trouble affecting us can
reach the public. I sell to the speculators. Then       nothing
matters."



His reassurance had its effect, and the sick woman sighed.



"I'm so glad. You are always just a point cleverer than
any one else. Come and tell me about it when you get back,
won't you? This sort of thing helps me." Suddenly Monica
turned her head and claimed his whole attention. "Tell me,
Alec, do you think Frank will ever come to me? Oh, if he
would only come I       I believe these dreadful nightmares
would leave me. If you only knew how I long to see him. If
you              "



At that moment one of his headstrong fits seized the man.
It was one of those moments when the will to do rose up in
him, casting aside all reason, all caution in its tremendous
purpose.



"He shall come," he cried. "I       I promise you!"



The sick woman clasped her hands in an ecstasy of hope
and thankfulness.



"Oh, Alec," she cried, "you promise? Then       he will come.
I can be happy now. Quite happy       till you return."



But immediately Hendrie realized how he had committed
himself. He saw ahead the added danger of failure. And
in his moment of realization he rose abruptly from his seat
on the bed. But he would not yield to his momentary weakness.
His promise once given must be fulfilled. He must
set about it at once. He knew that his desperate feelings at
the sight of the sufferings of this woman he loved, had
trapped him.



"I must go now, Mon," he cried, with an attempt at cheerfulness.
"I must fulfill my promise. You see my going to
Calford is lucky, for I believe our Frank is there. If he is I
shall bring him back with me. Good-bye, my dearest. God
bless you. Our Frank shall help you to get well."



"God bless you, Alec. You will come back to me       soon?"
she cried appealingly.



The man stooped, and the woman's thin arms caught and
held him in their embrace. Then, reluctantly, he moved
away and passed from the room.



Beyond the door Phyllis was awaiting him. As he came
out she raised a finger to her lips to enjoin silence, and led
him down the corridor.



At the head of the stairs she turned, and her eyes were
alight with excitement.



"I had to see you first, Mr. Hendrie," she said, in an excited
undertone, as though fearful lest Monica might hear,
even at that distance. "It's       it's about Frank. You know
she's just all out to see him. She's dying       to see him. Well,
I've had a letter from him. I'd written him, telling him he
must come, and it's his answer. He       he says he's coming
right away, and I've to go into Everton to meet him. I       had
to ask you first. May he come       and see Monica?
Will it hurt her? You see, I just guessed I'd write without
saying a thing about it, and       and now he's coming."



A silent thankfulness went up from the millionaire's heart
as he smiled down into the pretty, eager face before him.



"Our guardian angel," he cried impulsively. "Why, my
dear, I've only just given my solemn promise that he shall
come, and I was wondering how to fulfill it."



"Then he may come? The shock? The excitement? The
doctor says she must be kept from all excitement," cried
Phyllis doubtfully.



"Doctor be damned!" cried Hendrie, in his headstrong
way. "Happiness never killed any one. And"       his eyes
grew serious and his manner less full of hope       "anyway,"
he went on, in a passionate tone, "I'd ten thousand times
rather see poor Mon die happy than endure the heartbreaking
sufferings she is doing now. Wire him, my dear, wire him
not to delay, but to come along at once."



Then his manner grew thoughtful, and a touch of bitterness
crept into it.



"I'm       I'm going into Calford right now," he said, "and       my
absence will make it easier for him. Good girl."



He patted her gently on the shoulder, and passed down the
stairs.






CHAPTER XIII



FRANK LEARNS HIS DUTY



Time had been when Frank believed that no chance of
life could ever bring him to the neighborhood of Deep Willows
again. Now, within a brief two years, he was eagerly
watching for the familiar scenes as his hired conveyance
drew near the village of Everton.



However eagerly his eyes gazed out ahead, his spirit was
sorely enough depressed. He felt that he hated the golden
wheat fields as they came within his view, spreading their rich
carpet over the earth far as the eye could reach. He was
struck, too, at the distance they had seemed to lie back in
his memory. They seemed to belong to some other, long past
existence that had no relation to his present. A great gulf
seemed to have been crossed, a gulf, dreadful in its profundity,
and somehow these lands belonged to it.



The delicious air of the plains seemed to oppress him. He
felt that the invigorating breezes choked him. The golden
sunlight, too, shining down upon the burnished grain, failed
to raise a single pulse beat. Two years ago it would all have
been so different.



But he knew that the change was in himself. Young as he
was he knew that something of his youth had been snatched
from him by the ruthless hand of life. He knew that here
nothing was changed. The same breezes blew over the same
fertile plains. The same sun shone down with its serene
splendor. The same people dwelt on this glorious land. It
was only he that was different.



The change he realized made him turn his eyes upon his
new aspect of life with still further questioning, and he knew
that it had brought him not one moment of happiness that
could compare with those by-gone days, somewhere behind
him, beyond the painful gulf he still feared to gaze upon.



But an added trouble was with him now. Fate had sternly
decreed that his lot was still bound up with Deep Willows.
There was no escape. Austin Leyburn had morally forced
this place, he wished to shun, upon him, and, further, the
subtle appeal of his affections had been played upon. There
was mockery in the conflicting object, of his return to the
place. His whole love was bound up in two women. He was
paradoxically journeying to bring comfort to the two lives
he had brought pain into, while, at the same time, he knew,
in spite of Leyburn's assurances to the contrary, his duty
pointed directly the opposite.



His boyish mind was disturbed, his kindly heart was
troubled. While he believed that his new thought was right,
all his inclinations tore him in other directions, now that his
affections had been brought into conflict.



At last he drove down the wood-lined main street of the
village. He passed several empty, outlying houses which he
remembered he had always known as empty. The rotting
sidewalk of wood, too, was just the same as he remembered it.
He passed the little wooden church, which possessed a bell
so reminiscent of the prairie homestead. There, too, was
the parson's house beside it. Then, next, a cross street, and
beyond that the stores, six in number, that made up the commercial
interests of the place. On the next corner stood the
Russell Hotel. Yes, he could see it. There was a buggy
outside it. There was generally a buggy outside it, he remembered.
Whose was it? There was some one in it. Ah,
yes, a woman. No, why it was       yes, it was Phyllis.



His heart beat fast as his buckboard rattled up. His eyes
had grown bright with something of their old boyish smile of
delight as he noted the bent head of the girl poring over a
book she was reading. For the moment, all his doubts and
regrets were forgotten. Phyllis was waiting for him. Waiting,
though he did not realize it, as she would always wait for
him.



He called out a greeting as he drew nearer, and the girl
looked up with a glad smile. Then, though many yards
still separated them, he became aware of a marked change
in her young face. She was thinner, the old freshness of her
rounded cheeks had somehow sobered down to a delicate
smoothness, almost thinness. The brilliant look of perfect,
open-air health had given place to a delicate pallor that in
no way robbed her of beauty, but quite banished the sun-tanned
freshness gleaned from her work in the fields. Her
eyes, too, they seemed bigger and wider than ever. Then
there was her change of attire. The old Phyllis was gone.
Here was a city girl in her place, dressed with simple taste,
but in clothes that must have cost far more money than she
could afford.



But his astonishment did not lessen his delight at the
sight of her. Never had she looked more beautiful to him,
never had she possessed more attraction. He knew that
most of her time was spent at Monica's side, a place he often
felt that should have been his. She had told him of the
changes in her life, and that since Monica's illness her own
home and mother saw her at week-ends only, while Hendrie's
money provided that her little farm lacked not in its prosperity.



"Why, Phyl," he cried, as he came up. "You waiting for
me here, like this? I might have been hours late."



The girl smiled happily as she closed her book.



"Certainly you might. But"       with a simple sincerity       "it
would have made no difference. I have waited longer
than this for you       before. And often enough sitting on a
hard, well-polished old log."



For once Frank detected that which underlaid her words.
He remembered that time in Toronto when she had ventured
alone from her home to find him. He remembered that she
had said she would always be waiting for him, and his boyish
heart went out more tenderly to her than ever.



But what he said conveyed nothing of this.



"But this sun," he cried. "It       it is scorching."



The girl only smiled and shook her head.



"You can pay off your teamster, and leave your baggage
here. Guess you'd best get up beside me, and I'll drive
you in."



In a moment the man's mind came back to all that this
visit entailed. The sight of this girl had put it out of his
head.



"Yes," he said, "I'll get up beside you, but              " Then
he turned to his teamster. "Put the horses in the barn," he
said, "and book me a room. You'll see to yourself, and wait
for me here."



Then he alighted and climbed into Phyllis's buggy, and
the next moment they were rolling smoothly along in the direction
of Deep Willows.



Phyllis leaned back in her seat and dropped her hands in
her lap. The horse was pleasantly ambling along a trail it
was used to.



She looked round with a half humorous smile.



"Of course. Say, I forgot you belonged to the       enemy,
Frank," she said. "I just forgot everything, but that you
were coming to see Monica. You said in your letter you'd
got to get right here in your       work. It seems queer. I       say,
Frank, I just can't fix you as an       enemy," she cried, in
a tone of raillery.



The man's eyes were on the two, small, gloved hands in
her lap.



"I'm       not an enemy, Phyl," he said, in a low tone.



"Aren't you?" She laughed. "I suppose it's just friendship
to us all to come along, just around harvest, and tell
the boys to quit work, so as to make us poor farmers lose our
crops, and keep the boys who work the harvest from making
a great stake for the winter. You see, we've had men around
these weeks and weeks, telling the boys that way. They're
men belonging to Leyburn, same as you do."



Frank looked up with hot eyes.



"I don't belong to Leyburn," he cried. "I belong to no
man but myself, and my       my convictions."



His sudden heat sobered the girl at his side. She seemed
to be reduced to penitence.



"I'm real sorry I said that, Frank, I am sure. You see,
I was just teasing. Guess I didn't think       except about poor
Monica. You see, dear, she's so       so ill, and I don't think
she'll ever get better. That's partly why I sent for you.
When this       this trouble comes I'm half afraid it'll kill her."



The man's resentment had utterly died out. In its place
was a terrible, straining anxiety and grief.



"Kill her? Oh, Phyl, you can't       you don't mean that.
Surely she is not so ill as all that. Surely you're just
troubled, and fancy that. How       how can any labor trouble
hurt her. It can't. There will be no trouble if Hendrie is       reasonable.
That is what Leyburn said. He promised me
that."



"Promised you?" said the girl quickly. Her mind was
wide open and watchful. This boy was all the world to her.



"Yes, yes. He promised me before I accepted this work.
Oh, you don't understand. You can't. We want the employers
to realize their responsibilities. We want them to
make the lives of those who toil for them happier and better.
We want them to give them a fair wage, and let them enjoy
life instead of keeping them crushed beneath the grindstone
of their labor. Hendrie, I believe, will do this. Then       there
can be no trouble that can hurt Monica."



Phyllis gazed out ahead and nodded.



"You, too, feared your work might hurt Monica," she
said, "or you would not have made him promise       that."



Frank started. He knew that fear had been in his mind.
Was still in it. But Phyllis did not wait for an answer. She
turned at once to him, and her beautiful eyes were very
tender as she beheld the pucker of anxious thought between
his brows.



"Men are so queer," she said, with a quaint little twisted
smile. "I'd say they aren't a bit like women in       some things.
Say, dear, I guess it wouldn't hurt you just a little bit if I'd
set right out to carry on a war against everything that belonged
to your life. It wouldn't hurt you to think your son
had just got right to work to make you do things that you
couldn't see the justice of. It wouldn't hurt you, no matter
how he told you he was your friend, if he acted the way of
an enemy. To a woman that just seems dreadful. It's like
your own child, the child you've done all you could to help       when
he's helpless, the child you've never been too ill, or too
tired to nurse and fix right, the child you'd be ready any time
to give your life for, just turning right around and hitting
you in the face when       when you're helpless. It doesn't matter
if trouble comes or not, you're leading the folks against
your Monica. While she's abed sick to death, and can't help
herself, you're       you're just going to hit her in the face.
Maybe it's not just only in the face. Maybe it's her poor,
tired heart, that's been crying these nights and nights for
sight of you."



"Phyl! Phyl! For God's sake don't talk that way,"
Frank burst out, a great, passionate grief in his honest eyes.
"You make me out the cruelest monster living. Can't I convince
you of the rightness of all I want to do? Monica? I'd
give my life a hundred times to help her. I love her as never
mother was loved. I would not hurt her, not a hair of her
head."



"I know, dear," the girl replied soothingly. "I know all
that, and       much more. I know that you are not going to
hurt her. God is watching over her, and He would never
permit you such a       crime. Then, dear"       she smiled her
gentle smile up into his face, and her pretty teeth clipped
together as she spurred herself to her final thrust       "there's
another watching over her, too. But he's only an earthly
creature. Still, he's a big, strong man, who's just full of all
the faults which belong to all strong human nature. Yes,
oh, yes. He's anything but a saint. But he sets your Mon
before all things in his life, before everything, and he's       her
husband. He is there to protect her, as, some day, you may
want to protect       me."



The buggy rounded the last bend in the trail, and the great
house came into view as Phyllis finished speaking. Frank
made no answer. He had nothing to say. The girl at his
side had stirred his tender heart as it had never been stirred
before, and he sat gazing hopelessly out ahead at the palatial
home, with all its luxury of surroundings, where the woman
he regarded as a mother was denied the health and happiness
which the world believed wealth could never fail to bestow.



He could not help thinking of it, though well-nigh overwhelmed
with grief. All the wealth which others were crying
out to share in, was hers, and yet he felt that there was
greater health and happiness to be found in the houses of
poverty it was his desire to champion.



No, he had no answer for this wise girl he loved. How
could he answer her? His eyes were opening to possibilities
which had seemed so utterly impossible before. In his mind
he had accused Hendrie, and all others of his class, of being
monsters of inhumanity, devoid of heart, a race apart from
those who toiled for the barest existence, and Phyllis was
telling him how perfectly human were these hated creatures.



This man Hendrie was just as the rest of men. Whatever
his passions, his unscrupulous methods of dealing with those
who crossed his path, he shared all these things in common
with all humanity. His love for Monica was just man's love
for woman, only, perhaps, more strong, more vital, by reason
of the wonderful strength of manhood which was his.
Greater than all in his life stood out this love of his for his
wife.



Notwithstanding all that had passed, notwithstanding the
class Hendrie represented, notwithstanding that, even now,
he, Frank, was embarked upon a mission in opposition to this
very man, a strange warmth of feeling rose up in his heart
for him who could so watch and guard over Monica, and
strive with body and mind to keep her from all hurt.



Phyllis sat watching him covertly. Perhaps she understood
something of what was passing in his mind. She understood
his doubt. That there was no mistaking. She knew
the value of that doubt, and wondered if it was the seed that
must grow and develop, and finally bring back to herself and
Monica the boy they both loved so well. She believed it was,
and the comfort of the thought held her silent, too.



Presently she drew the horse up at the entrance porch.
She flung the reins to the waiting servant, and sprang unassisted
from the vehicle. Frank moved more slowly, and
lumbered his great body from between the spidery wheels.



In silence they passed into the house. In silence Phyllis
led the way upstairs. She wanted no word to pass between
them now, until Frank had seen Monica.



At the door of the sick room she paused and knocked. It
was opened by the new nurse, arrived only that morning from
Calford. Then Phyllis, signing to Frank to remain outside,
passed in and closed the door behind her.



The man waited. The minutes seemed like hours. He had
forgotten everything now except that he was to see Monica
again. Something of Phyllis's manner in entering that room
had inspired him with a dread which no words could have
given him. He felt that perhaps he was about to see her for
the last time.



At last he heard a rustle of skirts beyond the door. The
next moment the nurse stood in the doorway, signing to him
for silence. Then she beckoned him in.



The door closed softly behind him, and he started at the
great canopied bed.



Monica was half propped up. Beside her was Phyllis,
tenderly chafing her thin, almost transparent hands. He
took a step toward the bed, but halted abruptly as he heard
Monica's familiar voice, now high pitched and strident.



"No, no, I don't believe it. I can't have won it. Why you
don't know what it means to me. Here, here's a dollar for
you. I'm going to see the editor at once. Yes, he's my son
and what of it? You dare." Then followed a few mumbled
unintelligible words. But in a moment her voice rose to a
passionate appeal. "Oh, Frank, don't leave me! Don't you
understand? I love him so. No, don't go       please don't
leave me. He's gone! He's gone! They've taken him to
prison. Oh, God, and I shall never see him again. Five
years. God have mercy, have mercy!"



The voice rambled on, now rising to a dreadful pitch, now
dying down to a whisper. Now the words and sentences were
plain, distinct, now there were only despairing mutterings,
which had neither meaning nor continuity. Frank stood
looking on in horrified amazement. He had not dreamed of
such a thing. No one had even hinted at such a condition.
But he could not stand there listening. He felt as though his
heart must break.



Suddenly he started forward, and Phyllis, watching beckoned
to him. He flung himself upon his knees at the bedside,
and tried to take one of the sick woman's hands in his. But
instantly Monica snatched it away.



"Don't dare to touch me," she cried, struggling into a
sitting posture. "You       you have done this. You sent him
to prison       and now I shall never see him again."



The sick woman's voice had risen almost to a scream, and
the nurse sprang to her side. Phyllis caught Frank's hands
and led him away.



"Come," she said, and together they passed hastily out
of the room.



They were standing at the head of the stairs. Phyllis, with
her hands clasping the balustrade of the gallery, overlooking
the entrance hall, was gazing out of the window, opposite her,
at the wonderful golden skyline beyond the belt of trees that
marked the course of the river. Frank was beside her, half
turned toward her. He was standing on the third step of the
staircase.



"This delirium only started after I left this morning," the
girl was saying. "She was quite       quite all right then. Oh,
Frank, I don't know what to do. Mr. Hendrie is away, and       I'm
afraid."



The man's emotion was no less. His face was ghastly pale,
and a light of utter depression and hopelessness had dulled
his eyes. At the girl's final admission he suddenly looked up,
and a passionate light replaced the gloom of a moment
before.



"Phyl, Phyl, I can't go on!" he cried. "I can't leave her.
I must stay here. I love her. I owe her everything       everything
I am. She       she is my mother. Oh, God, and to think
I am even now here in the district at war with all that belongs
to her. To think that I should have one single thought
in antagonism to her. No, no. I can't go on with it. I must
stay and help her. I must stay till       till the crisis is past.
Phyl       tell me. Tell me what I can do. I love her, dear, and
I want to       help her."



The man's sudden passion stirred the girl's responsive
heart. But it also helped to banish her own moment of
weakness. She suddenly placed one hand upon his as it
rested on the balustrade beside her. It was a caress that
thrilled the man, even in the midst of his trouble.



"You can't stay here, Frank, dear," she said. "It would
be useless; it would be wrong."



"Wrong?"



The girl nodded.



"Yes," she said simply.



"But surely I have a right to remain, and       and help?"



Phyllis smiled tenderly.



"How?" she inquired. "Help? You would only stay
around worrying and miserable. You could do no good,
dear. Besides              "



"Besides?"



"Your duty lies       elsewhere."



"My duty lies here. My first duty is to my       mother!"



The man's denial came with a deep thrill of passion.



"Does it, dear?" Phyllis said gently. "I think not       yet."
Then she suddenly abandoned herself to all that was in her
heart for this man's good, and her voice was deep with her
own emotion. "I tell you you can't stay. You surely can't.
See, there's nothing for you to do around. I shall send word
to Mr. Hendrie, at once. The doctor is here, and the nurses.
You must go. Go right about your business. Frank, Frank,
just fix it in your mind right away, there's no two roads of
duty. Your bond is given. Your future is bound right up
in helping folks who need your help. You cannot draw back
just       just because your       mother       is sick. To do that is
just yourself claiming you. Your pledge is to the workers
now, and you must fulfill it. I would have you do this, sure.
Say, when you're through, when you've fulfilled your duty,
then it's time to come around and think of those you just
love       for yourself. Frank, I'd just love to have you stay
around, but I'd rather you do the duty you set yourself       now."



The man stared incredulously up into her face. He was
trying to fathom the meaning of this sudden change of attitude
toward the work he was engaged upon. Even at such a
moment he could not help remembering how passionately she
had protested against it in Toronto.



"You       you, Phyl, tell me to       go on? You refuse me
when I implore you to let me remain with Mon?"



The girl looked down at him with her wise little smile.



"Yes," she said, with a sigh. "I want you to go now, otherwise       you
will never be able to come back to us. Come,
dear," she went on, smiling at his puzzled expression, and
taking him by the hand, "I must go and send my message to
Mr. Hendrie."






CHAPTER XIV



THE STRIKE



Angus looked up into the faces of the three men standing
beyond his roll-top desk, which was littered with dust and
debris such as no man accustomed to office work could
have tolerated. But Angus was no office man. He hated
the place, and only used it when his work obliged him to.



Just now he was glad of it. He was glad of its support
in dealing with affairs such as were confronting him at the
moment. It helped him to an air which he felt to be necessary.
Full well he knew the awe of a roll-top desk for these
sons of the soil.



Now he leaned back in his chair, and his cold eyes glanced
deliberately at each man's face in turn. They were russet-hued
faces, bearded and unkempt. They were the faces of
men strong in muscle if simple of mind. They were three
of his farm hands, and each one had served under his guidance
for many years. They were competent, skilled machinists,
whose thought was only for their work and their
weekly wage.



Angus knew them well, for willing, hard-working men,
with a weakness only for taking things easy on Monday
mornings, and an invincible desire to reach the Russell Hotel
bar punctually at one o'clock on Saturday afternoons.



Secretly he regretted the interview; outwardly he was
roughly indifferent.



The men stood silent and uncomfortable under his scrutiny,
but a surly truculence was in their eyes as they endeavored
to return his stare.



"So this is your       ultimatum," the manager said at last,
with something of his best snarling grouch in his harsh voice.
"Mr. Hendrie's got to cut out one hundred and eighty-three
niggers from this place, all slap-up workers, who don't
break up every blamed machine they put their hands on,
because you white boys are kicking at their color." One of
the men made a movement as though about to interrupt, but
Angus silenced him with a gesture. "Hold on," he cried.
"Guess I listened to you all you needed. I hadn't a word
while you boys were gassing. Now I need to do some talk.
Seein' I'm busy I'm not going to waste my time on you. So
just get this, and get it good and quick. I'm running this
layout. I'm paying you your wages. I'm boss. I'll run
the place as I see fit. If you don't like it you can go       to
hell!"



"They're undercuttin' us in price," cried one of the men,
with an oath.



"They're being paid the same wages as you are       according
to their class of work," retorted Angus sharply.



"Then they've no right to it, they're bl               niggers,"
cried the same man.



Angus's eyes snapped.



"I don't care a cuss if they're Red Indians or Chinamen,"
he snarled.



"See here, Mr. Moraine," cried another, "we come here
like men to tell you what's doing, so it's up to you. We
refuse to work alongside a lousy crowd o' niggers. Try and
force it on us, and there's not a blamed soul among us
whites'll handle a binder this harvest. Your crops can rot
till they stink. Every white man on this layout quits at
sun-down to-day."



Angus rose from his chair, and his lean figure was bent
forward as he supported himself with one hand on the desk.



"You can take your damned 'times' now," he cried fiercely.
Then he shot one hand in the direction of the door. "There's
the door," he shouted. "Get to hell       through it."



The three muttering figures retreated hastily. They knew
this man's methods too well to hesitate. They had been
chosen by their comrades to represent them, and they had
carried out their mission in good faith. But from the outset
they had little enough hope of success. Men on that farm
had attempted to bluff Angus before. But the hard-faced
Scot was a match for any man he employed. Physically
he knew no fear, and his contempt for the "hired man" was
profound.



They returned to their waiting comrades filled with resentment
against both Hendrie and his representative. They
had done what they considered their duty, a duty pointed
out to them by the talkers of their union, now they were
ready to listen to any counsels, and act upon them, provided
they were not of a pacific nature.



Angus dropped back into his chair, with the sigh of a man
at high tension.



A moment later he picked up a tinted paper, and read
the typewritten words upon it. It was a message he had
received that morning from the millionaire. It was satisfactorily
brief.



"Fixed up everything. Hendrie."



The sight of those three words gladdened the Scot to an
extent that brought a wintry smile to his lean face. Yes,
he was satisfied. He knew that the deal in wheat had been
made, and that the trust affairs were safeguarded. It was
this knowledge that had inspired the ruthless, autocratic
fashion in which he had sent the workers' delegates about
their business.



Yes, now he was rather pleased at the prospect of a fight.
He would rather fight than eat. That was a phrase frequently
used to express the opinion the workers held of their
chief. Nor was it particularly exaggerated. This hard-driving
descendant of Scotch ancestors possessed a wonderful
predilection for the lesser scientific art of physical self-defense,
and it was the secret of much of his success in the
organizing of his employer's interests at Deep Willows.



But these developments at home left many possibilities
of an ugly nature, a nature that could not easily be anticipated.
With strikes here, there, and everywhere about the
country, strikes of sympathy, as well as strikes for definite
grievance, not even Hendrie, himself, could foresee all the
possibilities of mischief. Therefore, in the millionaire's absence,
it became his obvious duty to distribute a universal
warning to all the trust farmers.



This was no small task, but it was one that afforded him
a sort of malicious satisfaction in the thought of beating
these people in the game they contemplated.



Angus quite enjoyed the work. He was really in his
element. The prospect of a fight warmed his heart. Almost
in the same breath he blessed and cursed what he characterized
as Hendrie's bull-headed obstinacy. At one moment
he was fiendishly chuckling at the headlong retreat of the
invaders of his office, and the next he was swearing under
his breath at the man who invented pens, and such a depressing
hued liquid as ink. He was wound up to his best fighting
mood, and his disappointment would be keen if the immediate
future afforded no further outlet for his violent
spirit.



At last his task was completed, and he sighed his relief.
It was well past his dinner hour when the last message was
written and dispatched to the telegraph office at Everton.
But food was just now of no sort of consequence. He sat
back in his chair, lit his pipe, and prepared to compose a
message to his employer.



After considerable thought, and several written attempts,
he completed the message. But it was not altogether satisfactory.
For some moments he sat considering it, and, in
the midst of his cogitations, his eye lit upon his unfolded
copy of the Winnipeg Daily Times.



It was lying on the top of his desk. He always received
the paper a day late, but it was his custom to read it every
morning, immediately after his breakfast. This morning
it had lain in its place neglected by reason of the coming
of the delegation from the farm workers. Now he picked
it up without another thought. His interest in the world's
finance was far too deep to permit of any further neglect.



He turned the financial page and scanned it eagerly.
Then, his appetite in this direction appeased, he idly turned
over to the general news.



In a moment he was sitting up alert. In a moment all
thoughts of finance, and everything else, were banished from
his mind, and his whole interest became absorbed in what
he read. The top headline was in vast type, and half a
column was devoted to lesser "scare" headlines.





    GENERAL RAILROAD STRIKE
    THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY





With hungry eyes he read down the list of inconveniences
and terrors by which, the paper informed the public, they
were beset. Then below this he read on into the lesser
type, and found the filling out of the "scare" headings in
picturesque, not to say lurid, journalese. This was all for
the unsophisticated, the simple, and warned them that the
bubble of civilization had burst as effectually as if it had
been made of soap.



Angus read it all, and it impressed him. Not, perhaps,
as the editor intended, but his keen mind saw through the
embellishments and detected the painful truth of the facts
underneath. The possibilities were enormous. He pictured
the state of chaos he and Hendrie had so often discussed,
which might occur in a vast country, such as Canada, with
a simple trunk route of communication running through it.



Further, his mind flew to the coming of the harvest. It
was less than two weeks off. In a moment the possibilities
piled up in his mind till he began to think that perhaps
the picturesque journalist was right, a great and terrible
national disaster was upon the country.



In the midst of it all he suddenly remembered his message
to Hendrie. It was a request for him to return without
delay. The memory of it made him promptly turn to the
paragraph relating to passenger transport. It was brief,
but very definite.





"The strikers hold the track from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Pacific, and it is understood that if the railroad company
attempts to transport either passengers or freight, under
military escort, at a given signal the permanent way will
be torn up at hundreds of different points all along the line.
Thus, even the mails will be held up. The intention of the
strikers is to paralyze the entire trade of the country, and,
since the numbers of police and troops in the country are
utterly inadequate to protect the thousands of miles of permanent
way, it seems more than likely the strikers' orders
will have to be implicitly obeyed, or a reign of anarchy will
set in. It seems impossible to believe that here in the twentieth
century," etc., etc.





Angus looked from the paper at his message to Alexander
Hendrie, and his pursed lips emitted a low whistle.



"It looks like              "



He was muttering to himself of the impossibility of the
millionaire's return, when the door communicating with the
house was unceremoniously flung open, and Phyllis hurried
in.



"Mr. Moraine," she cried, a little breathlessly, holding
out a telegraph slip. "I want you to get this off at once.
I don't want to send it by any of the house servants. It's
to Mr. Hendrie. He       he       must come back at once."



Angus scowled. He eyed the paper and finally took it
from her hand in no very friendly manner. If there was one
thing he hated on earth it was for women to mix themselves
up with affairs.



He began to read the message, but Phyllis gave him no
time to finish it. She was as near despair as ever she had
been in all her young life.



"He must get right back," she declared passionately.
"It's       it's       Mrs. Hendrie. I've just left Doctor Fraser."
Suddenly tears leaped into her distressed eyes. "He says       if       if
we are to save her she'll need to be       be operated on
right away. Oh, it's awful! You       you must just get him
back, and he must bring a       specialist with him. Ah       what?"



Angus pointed at the newspaper. Its headlines were
staring up from the desk in all their painful crudity.



"See that?" he demanded, in his sharp way. Then he
picked the paper up, and held it out to her. "Read it.
There." He pointed at the paragraph relating to the
transport of passengers. "I don't just see how he's to get
back here with a doctor or anything else. He's wanted
right here for other things, too, but              "



"Other things?"



The man nodded.



"We'll have a strike here of our own       to-night. All
hands. Over three hundred of 'em."



But the girl was devouring the news. As she read, her
heart sank, and all hope was completely dashed. The threatening
tears overflowed down her cheeks. For the first time
in her life she felt utterly helpless.



"But he must, he must, he must come?" she cried desperately.
"Don't you understand? It means Mrs. Hendrie's
life if he doesn't bring help. Oh, don't sit there staring.
Do something. You       you've got to get him here, somehow       with
a       a surgeon. Strike? Do you think we can let
strikes stand in the way       when her life depends on it? Let
him come by 'special'       anything so we get him here. Oh!"



Her hands flung together in an impotent gesture of desperation
with her final exclamation, and even the cold heart
of the manager was moved.



He leaned forward in his seat.



"Easy, girl," he cried. "You're talking foolish. You
got to keep cool, and we'll think this thing out. I guess
Mrs. Hendrie's turn was sudden," he said thoughtfully.
"And the Doc's let her run to the last before he guessed
how things were. It's their way       some of 'em. How long's
she got? You see, Hendrie's hung up       same as other folks.
It's no use talking of 'specials,' but the wire's still open.
Now, see here, if we've got time, maybe he can make it in an
automobile. It's up to him, and I don't guess much'll stop
him when he knows how things are. You find out what time
the Doc gives her, and I'll wire. You see, sometimes these
things               What's that?"



Angus held up a hand and sat listening.



Far away it seemed, a low, soft note droned in through
the open window. It was a deep, purring sound like the hum
of the wind in overhead telegraph wires.



Suddenly the man sprang from his seat. He went to the
outer door and flung it open. The girl followed, and stood
beside him. The sound grew louder. At last the man
turned. His excitement had given place to his usual taciturn
expression. He shook his head ominously.



"That's Hendrie's automobile," he said. "If he's in it       there's
a hell of a poor chance of getting a surgeon from
Winnipeg."



But Phyllis made no answer. She was staring out down
the trail, watching, watching for the coming of the vehicle,
in the hope that Hendrie was not with it.



The moment passed. Then all of a sudden she cried out,
and stood with outstretched arm pointing.



"Look," she cried. "Look, look! It is       Mr. Hendrie."



A few moments later the great machine rolled up. The
millionaire, at sight of Angus and Phyllis, signed to the
driver, and, instead of going on to the front of the house,
the machine drew up at the office door. He leaped to the
ground and came over to them at once.



"I just made it," he cried. "Got the last train out of
Winnipeg. They've closed down tighter than hell. There's
not a locomotive running in the country to-day       except to
carry mails. Just the loco and caboose       that's all. I was
dead in luck. Inside information put me wise. Say       there's
going to be the devil to pay."



"There sure is," replied Angus grimly. "Say, just come
right in. There's things       doing."



Hendrie glanced sharply into the man's face. Then his
eyes turned quickly upon Phyllis. But he followed his manager
into the office without a word.



Inside Angus pushed a chair forward for the millionaire's
accommodation. But the latter made no attempt to use it.



"Well?" he demanded, looking from one to the other.
"What's       doing?"



Angus shrugged and picked up the message he had written
out. He handed it to him.



"Guess that'll tell you       quickest," he said.



The millionaire took the paper. As he read the long
message it contained, his eyes lit, and a half smile stirred
the corners of his mouth.



Finally he looked up into the Scot's face.



"Well?" he said. "We've guessed that all along. That's
not worrying any of us. You got my message? The deal's
through. Every grain of wheat on Deep Willows is sold
in the ear. I've sold no more, but I stand a personal guarantee
for the rest. You see, I've a notion that the risk lies
in my property       only. Nowhere else. My guarantee for
the rest of the trust farmers, which includes your property,
goes. The trust must get the full benefit of the market.
This is its first year of operation, and I want to show
a good result. Strike or no strike, we've got them beaten
to a mush. The trust just gets to work as per schedule.
Say, they can't hurt us a thing. Even this railroad strike
can't seriously interfere. All it will do, if it only lasts long
enough, is to send up the price of the crop. That's not
going to worry us a little              "



At that moment Phyllis, unable to contain herself longer,
made a move towards the millionaire. Angus saw the movement,
and Hendrie became aware of it as his manager's eyes
were turned upon the girl.



"Ah, my dear," he cried, still buoyant in his confidence,
"guess I'd forgotten you. Eh?"



Phyllis was holding up her message. The message she
had brought for Angus to dispatch.



"What, more trouble?" cried Hendrie, taking the paper
with a laugh.



Phyllis made no answer. She felt sick at heart. Her
unaccustomed eyes had not yet adjusted their focus to matters
involving life and death. Besides, since she had first
encountered Monica upon the trail, a great affection had
steadily grown up in her heart for the woman, who, later,
she had learned, was the woman whom Frank had always
regarded as his mother. Now, to her inexperienced mind,
there seemed to be no hope for her, whichever way she looked.
She was pinning her faith to this man whose strength and
dominating force alone seemed possible in such an emergency.
She waited, scarcely daring to breathe, watching
for that ray of hope she dared to think his expression as he
read might afford her.



But her hopes fell completely, still further below the zero
at which they had stood. First, as she watched, she saw that
ominous drawing together of the man's heavy brows, then,
the naturally cold gray of his eyes seemed to change. Their
stony gleam shone like the pinnacles of an iceberg in the
light of a winter sun. Then they lit with a sudden violent
emotion, and it seemed to her that the strength she was
relying upon was about to fail her.



He looked up from the paper which fluttered to the floor
from fingers which no longer seemed to obey the controlling
will. He looked at Angus for a moment in a sort of dazed
inquiry. Then his gaze sought the girl, and the storm burst.



"God in heaven!" he cried.



It was the exclamation of a mind which scarcely grasps
the reality of the position, and yet has received the full
shock.



"Why was I not told?" he demanded fiercely. "Why,
in God's name, was it left till now? You Angus! You
girl!" He turned furiously from one to the other. "Do you
know what you've done? Do you?" He laughed wildly. "Of
course you do? You've timed it. Timed it, do you hear?
So it's impossible to get poor Mon the help she needs. Oh,
as if I can't see. Am I blind? Am I an imbecile? You,
you rotten Scot, you've always hated her. I saw it from
the first. And now maybe you're satisfied. As for you,
girl"       he turned upon Phyllis with upraised arms, as though
about to strike her to the ground       "you're as bad. You
wanted your revenge for what your man has been made to
suffer. That's it. Oh, God, that I should have been so
blind! Was there ever such a devilish vengeance? You,
with your mild ways and simple air, you've stolen into my
house that you might break my heart to square with me
for your man's sufferings. And between you my Monica,
my poor Mon, is lying in extremity, waiting for the help
you would deny her. You thought to hurt me, and by God!
you have succeeded," he cried, his voice rising to greater
violence. "Oh, yes, you've succeeded, between you. You've
done more. You've       you've killed her!"



He brought one great fist crashing down upon the desk.
Then he rushed on       



"That fool doctor talks of hope. How can there be hope?
I tell you there's none       not a shadow. There's not a train
to go through. North, South, East and West, we are
cut off as if those cursed plains were an ocean. Hope?" he
laughed harshly. "There's as much hope as there is in
hell. That woman'll be left to die. Do you hear me? Die!
And between you, some of you, you've killed her!"



His frenzy was the frenzy of a madman. It was a frenzy
such as, once before in his life, he had displayed. All this
man's strength was swept aside by the passionate torrent
of his dreadful feelings. All power of reason was lost to
him. No hysterical child could have been weaker in its
mental balance than this great savage man was at that
moment.



Phyllis understood something of this. Angus simply
eyed him watchfully. His was not the discerning eye of
the girl. His attitude was the outcome of a nature which
understood violence only at its face value, therefore he was
physically and mentally alert. But the girl, a mere child,
saw deeper. And her observation roused her own latent
courage and mentality to activity.



She saw that she must fling herself into the arena that he
might be brought up to the only fighting pitch that could
serve them all, that could serve Monica. She seized upon
his final charge to attack him almost as fiercely as he had
attacked them.



"You are talking like a child," she cried recklessly.
"You're talking out of a yellow strain that lies somewhere
in your own wicked heart. How dare you say such things
to us       to me? It's you       you who've laid poor Monica on
her bed of sickness. You, with your cruel wickedness.
Your vile suspicions. It is you, alone, who's responsible,
and you know it.



"Say, Mr. Hendrie," she went on, her tone changing from
passionate anger to one of taunting mockery. "You're a
great man. There's no one can beat you when they get up
against you. That's why you can stand there bullying and
accusing us. You think to crush us right into the dust,
like       like slimy reptiles. Oh, you're a great man. You're
so strong."



Then, in a flash, her mockery was merged into a fierce
challenge, the more strong for her very youth and girlishness.



"Prove it! Prove it!" she cried. "Prove your power
against the fate barring your way. Don't stand there
accusing folks who're right here to help you all they know.
Save your Monica. There's time       yes, I tell you there's
time       if you've the heart and courage to do it!"



She stood before him, her slim figure palpitating with the
fierce emotion his madness had stirred in her. Her dark
eyes flashed into his with all the courage of her young
heart shining in their depths. And before it the man's
insane frenzy died abruptly.



Angus, watching, beheld this girl's       this child's       victory.
His cool Scotch brain marveled, and reluctantly admired,
while he waited for the millionaire's reply.



It came after a long pause. It came in the hard, cold
tones to which he was used, when stress of affairs demanded
the concentrated force which lay behind his methods.



"Run away, girl," he cried harshly. "Run away, and
leave me to think this thing out. Guess I'm sorry for
what I said               Now I just want to think."






CHAPTER XV



PHYLLIS GOES IN SEARCH OF FRANK



Hendrie's return home became something like an epoch
in the life of Phyllis Raysun. It was the moment of her
passing from girlhood to the full maturity of a woman. She
began to see with eyes more widely open, and a mind whitted
to the keenest understanding of the actions and motives
of those about her.



Ever since her first coming to Deep Willows, Hendrie,
with all her reason for abhorrence of him, had never failed
to interest her. Nor was it long before this interest begat
forgiveness, and even liking. His colossal powers for dealing
with affairs excited her youthful imagination and impelled
admiration. But more than all else, his evident passionate
devotion to Monica appealed to her.



When he had first learned that Monica was to yield him
her woman's pledge of love and devotion, he had displayed
a side of character she had deemed impossible in one of
his obvious characteristics. His boisterous, almost youthful
joy was quite unrestrained. She had never dreamed of
such a display in anybody, much less in Hendrie, the hard,
stern financier. It became painful and even pathetic in
such a man.



But now, since the latest scene in Angus's office, she had
read the real truth of his personality. She had always
watched and studied him closely, she had detected many
almost unaccountable weaknesses, but when the climax in
her observations was reached in his insane outburst, she
felt she held the key to the driving force which hurled him
so frequently blundering down the path of life.



To her he appeared a complex mechanism tremendously
organized in one definite direction, which left all other
directions utterly uncontrolled. All his life, it seemed to
her, he had concentrated his mind and energies upon the
process of accumulating wealth, and the power of wealth.
Nothing else had been permitted to appeal to him. He had
rigorously torn every other inclination up by the roots and
flung them aside, to be left behind him in the race to win
his ambitions. He had treated himself like a mere thinking
machine, a machine to be driven in the only direction in
which he desired to think. He had utterly forgotten that
he was a human being, created with a hundred and one feelings,
all of which must be duly cared for, and used, and
controlled. The only control over his more human passions
he had ever attempted to use must have been of a nature
which endeavored to crush them out of existence.



Now the result was manifest. Human nature had rebelled.
Human nature was fighting for its existence. The
human nature in him all uncontrolled by careful, studied
training, drove him whithersoever it listed. All his great,
machine-made brain broke down before its tremendous flood-tide,
and he was swept along upon its bosom toward the
brink of disaster. His passions once stirred, there was no
telling where they might bring him up. She believed that
under their influence he would stop at nothing.



Fortunately it seemed that all his passions were wrapped
up in Monica. She was certainly their guiding star, and
from this thought she drew comfort and hope. She felt
that if Monica could only be saved, all would be well with
him. While, on the other hand, her loss suggested to her
imagination possibilities all too dreadful to contemplate.



Thus was her fevered anxiety stirred to its limits during
the rest of the day, and the following morning, Doctor
Fraser was to make his final examination of his patient, and
give his definite verdict to the husband. Phyllis dreaded
that verdict. Whatever it might mean for Monica, it was
the man for whom she most feared.



Her mind was kept fully alert for all that was passing
during the time of waiting. She knew that Hendrie kept
himself tremendously busy. She knew that the wires were
speeding messages from the house at Deep Willows, and it
required little trouble to find out that Professor Hinkling,
of Winnipeg, was in direct communication with the master
of Deep Willows. She ascertained, too, that he was the
greatest surgeon in the country for all matters to do with
Monica's condition.



Then Angus had disappeared, and Hendrie was left at
the head of affairs at the farm. Here, too, she soon learned
that he had been speeded to Calford in the automobile to
endeavor, by every means known to the power of money,
to arrange for a special train to be allowed to run from
Winnipeg to Calford, and bring the great surgeon to Monica's
aid.



All these things left an atmosphere of suppressed excitement
and anxiety pervading the whole place, and, coupled
with the strike of farm hands, which, as promised, began
at sundown, a chaotic state seemed to reign everywhere.



The real crisis arrived with the hour of the noonday meal.
The entire household was aware that Doctor Fraser's report
was due at any moment. Phyllis and the millionaire sat
down to their meal together. Neither required anything
to eat, and only Phyllis made any pretense. Hendrie sat
at the head of the great table, surrounded by all the luxury
he had heaped upon his wife, wrapped in morose silence.
His attitude was such that even Phyllis feared to arouse the
storm she felt to be brooding behind his sullen eyes.



It was in the midst of the final course that Doctor Fraser
made his appearance. Phyllis felt her head whirl at sight
of his pale, grave face. Then, with an effort, she pulled
herself together, and covertly watched the millionaire.



A strange light had crept into his eyes, as the thin, clever
face appeared in the doorway. It was a light of desperate
hope, of a heart yearning for some trifling encouragement
where conviction made all hope impossible. She pitied this
man of millions from the bottom of her heart.



But Fraser was speaking in slow, deliberate tones. He
was reciting the medical aspect of the case, and, though
only understanding half of what he said, the girl listened
acutely. Finally he summed up the situation.



"It means this, Mr. Hendrie," he said, with a gesture,
the significance of which was quite unmistakable. "Nominally,
I suppose, there are two lives at stake. I contend
there is only one. I think we can put the child's life out
of the question. The complications are such that there
is little doubt the child would be still-born. Everything
points that way. Anyway, in my opinion, the complications
are such that it would be absolutely fatal to allow Mrs.
Hendrie to face the labors of child-birth. In a younger
woman there might have been a shadow of hope. In her
case I am convinced there is none. In my opinion       mind
it is but one man's opinion       you have only one alternative.
The child must be sacrificed by operation."



Phyllis's eyes were upon Alexander Hendrie's set face.
She beheld the strong, drawn mouth twitch nervously. She
also noted that one great fist was clenched tightly as it
rested upon the white cloth of the table.



She sighed as she awaited his reply.



Suddenly he raised his head, and his passionate eyes shot
a swift inquiry into the doctor's face.



"And the time limit       for the operation?" he asked.



He was thinking only of his wife. Phyllis understood.



The doctor deliberated.



"A week. Perhaps less."



Phyllis caught her breath.



"How much less?"



The exactness of Hendrie's mind demanded satisfying.



"Safety in five days. Risk in seven. That's the utmost
limit."



Again the girl caught her breath. Hendrie did not move
a muscle. Presently he spoke again.



"Failing       all else       will       you undertake the operation?"



Doctor Fraser cleared his throat.



"It is my duty," he said slowly.



Then he passed one hand quickly across his forehead as
though striving to remove a weight from his mind.



"For God's sake, don't let it come to that, Mr. Hendrie,"
he cried. "I am an ordinary practitioner. This is a desperate
case for a specialist. If you offered me a fee of
one hundred thousand dollars I'd gladly refuse it. Surely
you can get Hinkling here in time."



Suddenly Hendrie's fist lifted and crashed down upon the
table.



"Yes, by God, yes!" he cried.



Then he sat quite still. A moment later he ran his fingers
through his hair, and they remained there while he spoke
very quietly.



"I'd pay you half a million," he said, in a low, deep voice,
"if I thought you could do this       successfully. As it is I
wouldn't offer you ten cents. I'm sorry       Doc       but              "



He rose from the table and walked heavily out of the
room.



Phyllis followed his example. As she passed the doctor
she paused.



"Is there no       hope?" she asked pleadingly.



The man shook his head.



"None       unless Hinkling can be got here       in time."



She passed on out of the room without a word. There
was nothing more to be said. Anyway she was quite beyond
words.



Phyllis went straight to her bedroom. She could not go
to Monica yet, with the knowledge of what she had just
heard. It was dreadful. It seemed utterly, utterly hopeless.
Five days. Seven at the most. Seven       and the railroad
completely shut down. Monica's life must be sacrificed
because some wretched workman was not satisfied, or some
equally absurd thing. It was too awful to contemplate.



In the extremity of her grief her thoughts strayed to
Frank. It was the natural womanly impulse causing her
to turn to the man she loved. As the boy's image rose before
her distraught mind she remembered that he belonged to
those who had brought this desperate state of things about.
And in her moment of realization she cried out her bitterness       



"Oh, Frank, Frank, how could you?"



The words echoed through the silent room, and came back
to her with startling effect. She shivered at their sound,
and flung herself upon her bed in a passion of grief. She
remained there sobbing for many minutes. The strain had
been too much for her, and now the hopelessness of it all
wrung her heart.



But after a while the storm passed, and she sat up. Then,
once more, she abandoned herself to thought. Curiously
enough, Frank was still uppermost in her mind. A wild
longing, quite impossible to resist, to see him, and tell him
of all that had happened, possessed her, and she tried to
think where he might be found.



She did not know. She could not think. He was in the
neighborhood. That was certain. But where, where? She
paced the room puzzling her brains as to how she might
find him. Then, quite without realizing her actions, she
opened a drawer in her bureau and drew out the riding suit
Monica had given her. She had only worn it a few times
before Monica had been taken seriously ill. She looked it
over. It had been her great pride       once. Its divided skirt
and beautiful long coat had been a positive joy.



Suddenly an irresistible impulse made her lay it out on
her bed. The next moment she began to remove her own
costume.





Far out on the outskirts of those wheat lands which
acknowledged the direct control of the master of Deep
Willows, at a point where the cultivated land yielded to
the wood-lined slopes of the river valley, a great crowd of
men, made to look almost insignificant by comparison with
their wide surroundings, were listening eagerly to a speaker,
perched upon the prostrate form of a huge tree trunk.



It was evening, and the westering sun lolled heavily upon
the skyline, cradled in a cauldron of fiery cloud rising to
bear it upon its long night journey. Everywhere was the
profound peace when Nature composes itself for repose at
the close of day. The air was sweet with the perfume of
ripening foliage, blended with the dank which rose from the
racing waters below. It was a moment for peace and good-will;
it was a moment when all life should yield its thanks
for blessings bestowed by the unseen hand of Nature; it
was a moment when the heart of man should bow before the
Creator of a beneficent life.



Yet neither peace nor good-will reigned. The arrogant
heart of man was stirred by passions of discontent, and even
evil. Life and all its benefits and blessings they possessed,
and possessing them they cared nothing for such possession.
These things were forgotten in a craving for more. This
crowd was foregathered that it might learn how best to
satisfy its discontent, which had been stirred by mischievous
tongues in hearts hitherto contented.



The man on the tree trunk was no mere flamboyant orator
preaching a doctrine of profound socialism. He was not
talking "principle," so beloved of the tub-thumper. He was
there with a mind packed full of venom against one man, a
venom he was spitting into the ears of these workers for
that one man's undoing.



This man had traveled far to satisfy his hatred. He had
put himself at enormous inconvenience to address this meeting.
His coming, too, had been heralded by other talkers,
who were his satellites. His audience had been promised the
joy of listening to the words of the greatest labor leader in
the country; the privilege of hearing what the most powerful
figure in the country's labor movement had to promise
them; what he could do to wrest from their employer a
bettering of their lot.



Austin Leyburn was paying something like a secret visit
to those people, and so carefully had his coming been nursed
that his words became as the words of divine inspiration to
those dull-witted workers he was addressing.



It was the first evening of the strike at Deep Willows, and
his coming had been anticipated in another way. A liberal
supply of drink had found its way to the strikers. No one
quite knew where it came from. No one cared very much.
It was there for their indulgence, and they thirstily availed
themselves of it.



The result was all that might have been hoped by those
whose mischief was at work. A sense of elation prevailed.
A sense of injustice against Alexander Hendrie was uppermost
in blurred minds. A vaunting demand for something,
something they did not possess, lay at the back of pretty
well every mind, and an arrogant determination to possess
it was stirring. Then, too, prejudice against the colored
race became a prejudice no longer, it had swiftly lashed
itself into an active hatred that suggested grave possibilities.



This was the attitude of mind desired, and carefully fostered,
before the great man's words could be received as he
demanded they should be received. Then, with a blare of
oratorical trumpets he appeared in their midst.



It was the perfection of organization, organization such
as only Austin Leyburn understood.



Frank had been abroad among the smaller farms in the
district, pursuing his work with indifferent enthusiasm. Now
he was returning to Everton for the night, weary in body,
but still more weary in heart. His mind was full of that
which he had witnessed in Monica's home. He was thinking
of the mother he had always known, lying in her richly appointed
sickroom, crying out in her delirium all the pain
and anguish through which she had passed, and was still
passing.



Something was urging him to hasten on his way, and,
hastening, to diverge, and break his journey at Deep Willows.
He felt that he could not pass another night, he could
not endure another day of the work that had somehow grown
so distasteful to him, without ascertaining Monica's condition.
It was little more than twenty-four hours since his
mind and heart had been distracted almost beyond endurance
by a sight of her sufferings. And during those few
hours he seemed to have passed through an eternity.



His way brought him along the north bank of the river.
It was a short cut to the boundary of Hendrie's wheat lands,
which he must skirt on his journey to Everton. His horse
was tired. It had been under the saddle since noon.



He had been riding along the lower slopes down by the
river bank, and, as he came to the limits of Deep Willows,
he dismounted and led the weary creature up the steep sides
of the valley.



It was just as he neared the shoulder of the rising ground
that a sudden burst of cheering startled his horse and made
it lunge backwards, and it was some moments before Frank
could pacify it. At last, however, he induced the frightened
beast to stand. Then he hitched it to a bush and moved
forward on foot.



He, too, had been startled, but he guessed something of
the meaning of the cheering. He had heard so much of that
sort of thing lately. It seemed to him that his whole life
was spent listening to crowds of dishevelled creatures cheering
men who made them promises which could never be fulfilled.



He made his way through the foliage, and as he feared
its fringe he moved more cautiously. Nor was he aware
of his caution. There was no reason for it. If this were
what he suspected it was, a strike meeting, it was surely
his duty to witness it. However, his movements became
cautious, even furtive.



A moment later he was glad they had been so, for, as he
pushed the last of the bush aside, and beheld the crowd
beyond, and saw the figure of Austin Leyburn addressing
it, and heard his powerful voice hurling invective against
Alexander Hendrie from his tree trunk, he thanked his stars
that his presence was unknown.



Austin Leyburn here! Austin Leyburn in the neighborhood
of Deep Willows, while the great railroad strike was
in full operation! It was almost unbelievable.



These were something of Frank's amazed thoughts as he
watched the gesticulating figure silhouetted against the
ruddy skyline.



But now, as he stood, the man's words reached him, and,
in a moment, their startling purpose held him spellbound.



What was that he was saying? Hark!



Leyburn's harsh voice rang out in clarion tones       



"I hadn't intended to come along yet, boys," he was saying.
"I hadn't intended to come till next year. You see,
this is a new union, and funds are not big. It needs money
to fight these gilded hogs. But when I saw the way things
were going; when I heard the way you were herded alongside
a crowd of lousy niggers, and set to work with 'em, like
a pack of galley slaves; when I heard these things, and
learned that these dirty blacks were taking the place of
legitimate white workers for less wages, then my blood just
got red hot, and I couldn't sleep o' nights. Say, boys, it
broke me all up. I couldn't eat nor sleep till I'd rushed
through a financial arrangement with other labor organizations,
which sets you clear beyond the chances of want.
There's money and plenty for a strike right now. Money
and plenty to kill the harvest of these swine of men who
roll about in their automobiles, every bolt of which, every
soft cushion they sit on, has been paid for by the sweat of
your big hearts.



"What's your wages? A dollar a day? Don't you wish
it was? Don't you wish they'd let you have it? I was
going to say 'earn' it. By hell, earn it! You're earning
hundreds a day for this skunk of a man, Hendrie. Hundreds
and hundreds. Say, he's got millions, no one knows how
rich he is, and you boys are the fellows who earn it for him.
Do you get that? Do you get its meaning right? Here's
one man sits around on top, with you boys lying around
whining at his feet for a fraction of the result of your own
work."



Frank murmured the word "syndicalism" to himself. But
the rabid tongue of Leyburn was still at work.



"Say, d'you know what set war raging between the northern
and southern states? Do you know what set sons and
fathers at each other's throats? I'll tell you. It was the
high-minded folk of the north couldn't stand for slavery,
even of the blacks. Do you know what you are to-day?
You're slaves, slaves of this man       white slaves. 'Out you
go into my fields,' he says, 'and I'll let you live       just live       that's
all. His fields, mark you. His! By what right are
they his? Ain't they yours? Didn't the Creator set you
out here just the same as him, and hand you this world
for your own? His fields! And out you go into them, and
you grind, and sweat, and you fill his safe full of money, so
he can live in a luxury you can never enjoy."



"The cur," muttered the listener. "The miserable cur."
Something stirred behind him, but it remained unnoticed.



"Listen to me," Leyburn shouted above the hubbub of
agreement and applause which arose from the half-drunken
portion of the crowd. "Do you know what's going to happen
right here, quite soon? Course you don't. You don't
know these gilded hogs same as I do. I'll tell you what's
going to happen. Hendrie told me himself. He says niggers
are easier dealt with than whites. He says he can get
them cheaper. He says they work just as well. He says
he'll run Deep Willows on black labor entirely       soon, just
as soon as he can get enough of 'em. He cares nothing
for any of you, not even for you boys who've worked years
for him. Out you got to go       the lot of you, so he can
make bigger money out of the black. Get that? You know
what it means to you? Will you stand for it?"



A great shout of "no" accompanied by a yell of blasphemy
greeted his challenge.



"All lies, lies, lies," muttered the listening man, and a
soft-voiced echo from somewhere behind agreed with him.



"Of course you won't," Leyburn roared, with a harsh
laugh. "And that's why I'm right here talking to you,
because you're the real grit. You've quit work to-night,
and you're going to get your strike pay right away, and
when you get it, I'll tell you what you'll do, if you'd beat
this skunk into treating you right. There's his crop       worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. You reckon to let it rot
at harvest. Will it rot? Mind he's still got his rotten
black slaves. Do you know what he'll do? No, you hadn't
thought of it. But I'll tell you. He'll set them to work it.
While you're making a stand for labor, his black slaves'll
rob you of the fruits of your work. See?"



Another fierce shout went up from the audience, and the
speaker grinned his delight.



Frank waited breathlessly for what was to follow, and a
low sigh, like the breath of the night breeze in the trees,
sounded behind him.



"Now, you're going to beat him, and I'll show you how.
See this?" Leyburn drew a box of matches from his pocket,
and held it up for all to see.



"Fire the damned crop," shouted a voice in the crowd.
And in a moment the word "fire" roared from a hundred
tongues.



The speaker nodded and laughed.



"That's it," he cried. "Make a big bluff at him, and
he's got to weaken. He won't listen without, so he'll have
to be made to listen. Fire his crop, and you steal his purse.
It's fair game. This is war       labor war. Fire his crop, and
he's on his knees, and you can make your own terms. The
damned niggers don't amount to a row of shucks. If they
butt in, out 'em. Get after 'em with a gun, shoot 'em up       the
crowd of you. Then the government'll get busy and
stop black labor in a white country. They can't afford to
quarrel with the workers. They want their votes. They're
yearning for office. Get redhot after the niggers and out
'em. Chase 'em back to the place they belong. Are you on?"



A great cheer rose from the crowd. It was prolonged.
And with it was the laugh of mischief Leyburn wanted to
hear. He knew that he had tickled their sense of humor,
and love of violent horse-play. Firing the crop appealed.
But, even more, the routing of the niggers would be a joy
not readily missed.



"That's it," Leyburn cried. "But before I've done I
want to say right here              "



Frank passed one great hand across his perspiring forehead.
It was unbelievable that it could be Leyburn urging
these men to nothing less than anarchy and crime. He could
scarcely credit his ears. Yet there it was       and he was still
speaking.



A furious and utter loathing for the man, even for the
cause of the benighted worker, rose up in his heart and
sickened him.



"It's awful!" he said aloud.



"It's the saddest sight I've seen in my life."



Frank swung round at the sound of the voice. In a
moment his arms were outstretched.



"Phyl!" he cried. "You?"



Phyllis caught his hands and held them tightly.






Phyllis Caught His Hands and Held Them Tightly




"Yes, Frank. I've       I've been chasing for you all the
afternoon. Say              "



"Oh, Phyl, Phyl, did you hear? Did you hear all that
man said?" Frank broke in. "That's Austin Leyburn.
That's the man to whom my duty is pledged. Was there
ever such a lying, despicable traitor to humanity? He tells
them to burn       to kill their fellows. And that's the man
whom I have been helping. Never, never, never again. Just
God! I have done with it all. Was there ever such vile
criminal teaching or methods? Thank God, my eyes are
open to it all       at last."



Phyllis drew his two hands toward her and placed them
about her neck. Then she reached up to him, tip-toeing, and
kissed him on the lips.



"And I thank God too, dear."



The man drew her to him in a great embrace.



"Never again, Phyl," he said more calmly, after a moment.
"Never again, so long as I live." He kissed her
tenderly.



Then, as the strident tones of Leyburn still reached them,
the girl looked up.



"Frank," she cried, with a slight start. "I had almost
forgotten. You made me forget. I       I came to find you.
I want you to come back to Deep Willows. Will you come?
Mr. Hendrie is there."



"Alexander Hendrie?"



"Yes."



The man stood silent for a moment, and the girl's eyes
became intensely earnest.



"Will you come and tell him       what we have heard       to-night?"
she begged. "Will you come and tell him       what
you have told me? But it's not that I want you for most.
There's trouble around. Desperate trouble for       for Monica."
She clasped her hands in her anxiety. "Oh, come       come
and help. Come and help us       her. Doctor Fraser
says she cannot live unless       unless she is operated on by       by
a surgeon from Winnipeg. But the railroad strike has
made it impossible to get him       in time."



Frank started back and his arms dropped abruptly from
about the girl's slim body.



"Monica?" he cried. "Monica dying?" Then, with a
gasp. "Oh, God, and I helped to make that strike!"






CHAPTER XVI



THE DAWN OF HOPE



Alexander Hendrie started round at the sound of the
servant's voice.



He was in the library. Night had fallen, and the room
was in darkness. He had been staring blankly at one of
the windows, across which the curtains had not yet been
drawn. For hours his mind had been concentrated upon
the one eternal problem which confronted him. He was
beset with doubts, hopes, fears, each one of which he examined
closely, dismissed or accepted, and pigeon-holed the
latter in the back cells of memory for future use.



The man was obsessed with one idea only. The fulfilment
of Doctor Fraser's demands, and the saving of the one
precious life which was far more to him than his own. The
nervous tension at which his efforts left him made him literally
jump at the sound of the voice of the man who had
entered the room so silently.



"Miss Raysun would be glad to know if you would spare
her a few minutes, sir. She say's it's a matter of importance."



The millionaire swung his chair about, and faced the man
in the darkness.



"Turn on the lights," he said sharply. "You can draw
the curtains; then tell Miss Raysun to come right along."



The electric switch clicked and the room was flooded with
light. Then the servant crossed the room silently and drew
the curtains. Then he moved over to the door, hesitated,
and finally stopped.



"She has some one with her, sir," he said doubtfully.



This man was in full possession of the gossip of the house.
Besides, he valued his position.



"Who?"



Hendrie's question came with an alert inflection. He understood
the man's doubt.



"It's Mr. Smith       Mr. Frank Smith       I think, sir."



"Well?"



There was no mistaking the tone of the second inquiry.
The man hastened to remedy his mistake.



"Beg pardon, sir, I       I thought I'd just mention it."



"That will do."



Hendrie appeared to occupy himself with the papers on
his desk as the man hurried out.



But the moment he was alone the millionaire gave up the
pretense. Again he sat back in his chair, and gazed unblinkingly
at the reading lamp before him. All in a moment,
it seemed, from comparative indifference at Phyllis's
desire for an interview, his mood had leaped to impatience
for her coming. Frank was with her       why? Here, at a
moment when he knew he was face to face with, perhaps,
the greatest disaster of his life; here, when almost every
man's hand seemed to be turning against him; here, when
all his powers of achievement were being taxed to the limit,
he was to be confronted with his own natural son, Frank.
Again his groping mind questioned       why?



Thought traveled swiftly back over other scenes, scenes
he would gladly have shut out of memory       now. But they
were always there ready to confront him with his own mis-doings.
He thought of the poor woman on the lonely Yukon
trail. He thought of the hardships with which she must
have been beset. He thought of the young life-burden she
had been bearing. Then he remembered the stalwart youth
who had refused to betray Monica's secret, preferring to
face penal servitude as an alternative. Then he remembered
the honest youth championing the cause of the oppressed
before his cold argument. And again he questioned
the meaning of his coming now.



But his reflections were cut short. He glanced across at
the door as it opened, and Phyllis hurried in. She was still
dressed in her riding suit, her face and eyes, beneath the
soft, wide-brimmed prairie hat she was wearing, shining
with an excitement she could hardly restrain. Behind her
came the great figure of Frank, and the millionaire's eyes
were for him alone.



He rose and silently placed a chair for the girl. But
Phyllis refused it and remained standing. She turned to
Frank.



"You sit down, Frank," she said, with a peremptoriness
begot of her excitement.



Without thinking the man obeyed.



Hendrie's eyes were still upon him.



"Well?" he inquired, almost gently.



Frank glanced up at the girl. The situation troubled him.
But the memory of the scene he had just witnessed was
still with him, and his sudden and utter loathing for the
man Leyburn sent hot words surging to his lips.



"I hadn't a thought to come here, Mr. Hendrie," he cried,
on the impulse of his feelings. "Maybe you won't thank
me for it, anyway. Still, I've got to tell you things. I've
come to tell you, you were right, and I was all wrong. I've
come to tell you there's no honesty in these professional
leaders of labor       to tell you that the whole game is a baser
and far worse side of the competition of life than is that
of the men it is directed against. Yes, I see it all now.
The bonding of labor is the raising of an army of physical
force, normally to work peacefully for its common welfare,
but, in reality, to tyrannize and to wrest by any means in
its power, by violence, by fire, by bloodshed, if necessary,
those benefits which it covets, regardless of all right and
justice, and which, individually, its members have not the
capacity to achieve honestly for themselves. I want to tell
you this now while my heart is burning with the realization
of the truth; while my eyes are open to the deviltry of
these men who endeavor to blind the world to their own
selfish motives by crying out in the name of justice and fair
dealing. There is no justice in them. It is all self, and the
purblind workers are the helpless tools by which they seek
to achieve their ends. I have done with it forever. There is
no such thing as universal brotherhood       there never can be.
You are right. So long as human nature remains human
nature, self will dominate the world, and charity must become
a luxury for moments of cessation from hostilities in the
battle of life."



The tide of the man's hot words swept on without pause
for a second, and both Phyllis and the millionaire knew
they came from his heart.



But now, having made clear his own feelings, he rushed
headlong to the warning he had to impart.



"It doesn't matter       the details       how I witnessed it, how
Phyllis, here, shared with me in the contemplation of a
scene such as we never want to witness again. It was the
man I have been working with, the most prominent figure
in the labor movement of this country, the man who has
organized the railroad strike which is to bar the way to
the help my moth       Mrs. Hendrie needs, talking to your
workers who are on strike."



"Austin Leyburn," said Hendrie dryly.



"Yes," cried Frank. "That is the scoundrel who disguises
his villainous heart under a cloak of philanthropy.
That is the man. He has come down here secretly, leaving
his legitimate work at Calford and Winnipeg to incite your
hands to burn your crop out, and to drive the niggers off
the land by violence, by shooting them down. Why he has
come is beyond my comprehension. I can only imagine that
he has some personal grievance against you which he wishes
to satisfy. Whatever it is the fact remains. The men have
been made half drunk, when they cannot be wholly responsible
for their actions, and he is urging them to burn you
out and shoot up the niggers. Mr. Hendrie, something's
got to be done at once. I don't know what, I don't know
how, but that man is driving them to a great crime which
they would never otherwise dream of. That crime must
be stopped. Oh, if I could only think how. But I can't.
You       you, Mr. Hendrie. It is for you to think of this
thing, and whatever your plan you can count on me for       anything."



Frank was leaning forward in his chair. His great hands
were clasped, and hung down between his parted knees, upon
which his elbows rested. The earnest light of his eyes was
shining with a deep fire, and Phyllis, watching him, yearned
to fling her arms about him, and tell him something of the
love and sympathy running such riot in her heart.



Alexander Hendrie had turned toward his desk. A paper
knife was in his right hand, and its ivory blade was
gently tapping the pad of blotting-paper spread out before him.



He spoke at last, and his manner was quite unusual. Ordinarily
he would have attacked the threat against himself in a
sharp, brusque way. But somehow Frank's presence had a distinctly
softening effect upon him.



"It's not easy, is it, boy?" he said, glancing round with a
half-smile.



"Easy? But it       means murder. Murder of those niggers."



The thought revolted the man. It seemed to him that
Hendrie had missed the appalling nature of the situation.



"Yes. It looks like it," said Hendrie, still almost indifferently.
"But I think we can save that. The moment
Angus returns the niggers can be scattered. Angus will be
back soon       to-night."



"To-night? But we must act       now."



"Yes." Hendrie agreed. Then he smiled confidently.
"But there's more time than you think, boy. I know men.
These boys won't start shooting till they've worked themselves
up to it. They'll likely work 'emselves up by firing
my crop."



Frank started incredulously.



"You       you will let them?" he gasped.



Phyllis was watching the millionaire. He shrugged.



"It'll help to manure the soil       for next year," he said
indifferently.



"But       but       the loss!" Frank's protest came in an awed
whisper.



Hendrie smiled.



"That's up to me," he said enigmatically. Then he faced
round, and fixed Frank with his steady eyes. "See here,
listen. You don't just reckon all this means to me       your
coming and telling me this, and that other       that you've quit
Austin Leyburn," he said. "It's put something into me.
I can't just explain       now. But I want to tell you of other
things. There's things in my mind just now that make
matters like the burning of my crop, yes, and even the shooting
up of niggers seem kind of small. Don't think I'm
standing for a racket like that. No, sir. We'll see those
black devils right, or               However, it's about this Leyburn.
Guess you're right. He's got a grievance, and it's
so big it's got to come to a burst up between us. One of
us'll have to get right down and out." He drew a deep
breath, and his manner became thoughtful. "Guess it'll
have to be Leyburn," he said, after a pause. "Yes, there's
work for me yet." Suddenly he looked up with a question
in his eyes. "Say, boy, you don't owe me a hell of a lot.
And yet you come to me with       all this?" He gazed thoughtfully,
studying the strong, earnest young face before him.



"I told you I hadn't thought of coming until              " Frank
broke off as Phyllis completed the explanation.



"I persuaded him, Mr. Hendrie. You see              "



"I guessed that." Hendrie nodded. Then he smiled.
"Guess it's generally a woman fixes things easy for men-folk,
when the road's rough."



Then quite suddenly he leaned forward in his chair, his
great hands gripping its arms with enormous force.



"Say, you two," he cried, a sudden fierce light shining in
his t yes, "we're wasting precious minutes. You, boy, you've
come to me with talk of this crime to be committed. Guess
your heart's just full of it. But I've no room for it now.
I'm just full to the brim of another crime that your man
Leyburn's committed. He can burn my crop; he can shoot
down every nigger in the country for all I care, while this
other thing is threatening. Say, there's no nigger or white
man I'd raise a hand to help if it's at the expense of one
moment I need to stop the completion of that other crime.
Boy, boy, I don't care if the roof of this world falls in and
crushes every living soul, so long as Monica is saved. She,
and she alone, is my one thought, and I tell you right here
that if she dies       she will not die alone. Oh, don't think I
am mad," he cried, as Frank stared in alarm at the passionate,
working face. "I am sane       sane as you are. Now
answer me, answer me as you love your God, as you love
the woman who cared for you from your childhood. Why
are you here? I want the blank truth. You have no love
for me, and that you've cut Leyburn out of your life is
insufficient reason. Why       why are you here?"



He gazed into the boy's face as though he would compel
him. Phyllis waited without a word.



Frank needed little consideration. His reply came
promptly, and full of sincerity.



"I came to see if I could help her in any way." he said.
"You're right. I should not have come for those other matters.
Phyllis could have warned you. I am not here because
of you. I am here because I       I helped to make that
railroad strike, and I love my       I love Mrs. Hendrie. I said
you could count on me for       anything, and I meant it. I'd
willingly sacrifice everything, even my life, for Monica."



Hendrie suddenly released his hold upon the arms of his
chair and sat back. His eyes were smiling, and, just for a
moment, a wave of great peace swept over his stormy heart.



"I'm glad, boy," he said simply. "Monica is lying upstairs
surrounded by everything the world can give her
but the help which alone can save her life. You owe her
much, but you owe her nothing compared with my debts
to her. Now she is in need of the payment of every outstanding
debt, and it is up to us. How can we bring Professor
Hinkling from Winnipeg? That is the question that
is now filling my heart and brain. When we have solved it,
when that help is brought to her, then some of our debts
will have been paid. How? How? How can this be done?
How can this man Leyburn be bested. How?"



The man's words came hotly. He was not asking his questions
of the others. He was simply reiterating the straining
thought in his mind. Phyllis understood this, but Frank
accepted the question as addressed to himself. His mind
was not subtle. His simplicity at times was almost child-like.
His prompt answer had something of that nature in it
now.



"Why, the railroad is the only way," he said.



Hendrie threw up his hands in an ecstasy of irritation.



"The strike, man! The strike!" he cried. "There's not
a passenger can travel. If it were attempted the permanent
way would be torn up by Leyburn's orders. The railroad
company would never risk the attempt."



Frank's eyes opened wide.



"Well?" he cried. "That's all right, If he can order
the track torn up, he can order a train through       or order
the strikers to let a train through."



The millionaire's eyes were fixed on the other's ingenuous
face. He was exasperated at what he considered his display
of almost imbecile childishness.



"But I tell you he would do anything to hurt or ruin
me," he cried, rapidly losing all patience.



The sight of his evident impatience had a marked effect
upon Frank. Phyllis, watching both men, saw her lover's
eyes suddenly harden. His rather large mouth, so like the
millionaire's, suddenly shut tight, and the movement was
accompanied by a fierce setting of the jaws. A wave of
anxiety for what was coming swept over her. Then came
Frank's voice, as fierce and harsh as ever she had heard in
Alexander Hendrie.



"If this man Hinkling's coming means saving Mrs. Hendrie's
life, and Leyburn has power to let him through in
time, and refuses it, I'll kill him, Mr. Hendrie," he cried,
in a deep, stern voice. "I'll choke the rotten life out of
him with these two hands," he added, in a sudden frenzy,
reaching out toward the other with his fists clenching, as
though they were grasping the labor leader's throat.



Hendrie's eyes lit as he heard the other's words and saw
the murderously inspired action. The man meant it. He
recognized the fierce spirit which underlay a nature of
kindliness and gentle feeling, and, curiously enough, it
warmed him, as the gentler side of the man had left him
untouched.



He was about to reply when quite suddenly Phyllis cried
out.



"I see. I see," she said. "Frank's right, Mr. Hendrie.
Leyburn has the power, and, if he will not use it, he must
be made to              "



But before she could proceed further the door was unceremoniously
flung open, and Angus Moraine, lean, vulture-like,
hurried in.



"It's no good, Mr.               Oh, beg pardon. I didn't just
know              " He paused, as though about to withdraw at
the sight of Frank and Phyllis. "Guess I'll come along
later," he said. "There's a fire way out to the west. I saw
it as I came along. Looks like the prairie. I'll just get
around. You won't need the automobile. It'll take me
quicker."



Phyllis started.



"Fire?" she demanded, in sudden alarm.



"Out west?" cried Frank, rising abruptly from his seat.



Angus nodded.



"Why, yes," he said. "Guess it's just the prairie."



Suddenly the millionaire laughed aloud.



"Prairie?" he cried. "Say, Angus, my boy, that's my
crop. They've fired the crop. They're going to break me.
Austin Leyburn and his scallywags. They're going to
smash me by burning my crop, and then they're going to
shoot down every nigger on the place while they let my
wife die in her bed for want of a surgeon's aid. Do you get
that all? Do you? That's Leyburn. Austin Leyburn, who
came here days ago and promised he'd smash me for things
done way back on the old Yukon trail. Hey! Stop right
here and listen. I've got it now, and this boy, here, and
this child, too, have shown me the way. There's no train
to go through, eh? That's what they've told you in Calford.
A million dollars won't take one through. Well, a
tram's going through, and for a deal less than a million.
The railroaders need Leyburn's order. Leyburn's order!"
He laughed in a wild sort of sarcasm. "Well, by God, he
shall give it! This boy and girl are on. It don't need any
telling. You are on, my dour Scot       I know you. We'll let
him burn the crop, let him shoot up the niggers, I don't
care a curse. He's going to send that train through. Sit
right down and I'll tell you 'bout it."






CHAPTER XVII



A RAID



Austin Leyburn was well enough satisfied. More than
that, he felt he had earned these moments of satisfaction.



He had taken a big chance in rushing down in his automobile
from Calford to Everton at the moment when the newly
started strike of the railroad required his whole attention,
and the sympathies of other forms of transport required to
be brought into line. So many things might go wrong with
his greater plans, and though his working staff and fellow-leaders
were men of capacity, and fully able to deal with
affairs, he knew that, in all emergency, his was the organizing
brain, his was the final word.



But the risk had been worth while. Anything was worth
while that gave him opportunity of satisfying something of
his almost lifelong hatred of Alexander Hendrie. This new
toy of his, this organization of agricultural labor, had assumed
proportions far greater in his mind than any of his
other interests, and the reason of it lay in the fact that at
last, after years of waiting, it had brought him into contact
with the man, Leo. Better still, Leo, the Leo he had
at last found out, was worth while. He was a great man,
a man head and shoulders above all his fellows in the world's
affairs, and his ultimate fall would be something worth while
having brought about.



His delight was manifest as he rode along the trail in
the direction of Everton. His good humor left his narrow
eyes smiling his satisfied thought. His men had worked well;
and he       well, he had never worked harder, or with a more
satisfactory result. These men of the soil were far easier
to influence than town-bred workers. It was natural       as
they were. Yes, for once in his life he felt grateful to those
who had served him. The men who had been sent ahead
to agitate had never worked with such successful results.
He would remember them, and mark them out for promotion.



Then there was young Frank Smith. He smiled more
broadly down at his horse's ears. Leo's son       working for
his father's downfall. It was a pretty touch, and the humor
of it tickled him. Oh, Leo should know of it       later on,
when the work was completed.



Frank. He wondered where he was just now. The smile
died out of his eyes. He had purposely kept his meeting
secret. He had had no desire that the boy should witness
it. He had a perfect estimate of the youngster's prejudices
and feelings which might have militated against his, Leyburn's,
success had Frank listened to his urging of those
drink-sodden creatures to violence. But where was he? He
had received no word from the boy for nearly a week. He
made a mental note to set inquiries afoot       that is, if no
word were awaiting him on his return to Calford.



At that moment his horse, an old roadster, hired at the
livery barn in Everton, threw up its head and snuffed at
the light, southern breeze. Leyburn glanced up expectantly
and turned his eyes in the direction in which his uneasy
horse was staring. In an instant Frank was forgotten, and
his whole attention became fixed upon what he beheld. He
drew rein sharply, and the animal stood fidgeting and fretful.



Away to the southwest behind him a ruddy glow shone
upon the night sky. It was the direction whence the night
breeze sprang, and he knew that it was at the point where
he had held his meeting. He rubbed his hands gleefully
and chuckled. While he watched the glow spread along the
southern horizon, and as it spread so the stars in the sky
above were obscured, and he knew that a great fog of smoke
had intervened to hide them.



His horse continued to fidget, and again and again its
gushing nostrils strove to expel the taint of smoke, now
plainly to be noticed in the fresh air of the plains.



But the man remained absorbed. Farther and farther
along the horizon lit, and now, where before only a glowing
reflection had been, a sharp belt of flame showed up, revealing
to his satisfied eyes the great billows of smoke rolling
along and upwards, borne upon the bosom of the summer
breeze.



He knew that his work was complete. He knew that those
whom he had left behind to see that his desires were carried
out had done so promptly and satisfactorily. He knew that
now no human hand could save the miles of crop belonging
to Alexander Hendrie. He knew that, by morning, a charred,
black debris would be all that remained of hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of grain, and that Leo, the great
Leo, would be just so much the poorer.



He gave his restive horse its head, and the eager beast
plunged forward down the trail. It was thankful, desperately
thankful, for the chance of getting away from the
hateful, fascinating sight.



Leyburn's eyes remained turned upon the wonderful spectacle
of the fiercely burning grain. The fire was sweeping
onward with a terrific rush, and a dull roar reached him as
it licked up the rustling heads of wheat in a parallel to the
road he was traveling. Its pace was miraculous, and man
and beast were soon left far behind in the race. Never had
this man witnessed such a wonderful scene, and something
of its awe filled his heart.



He had no misgivings, no qualms of conscience. It was
his work, this wanton destruction, and he gloried in it. The
weight of his hand had fallen, and he knew that Alexander
Hendrie, while powerless to help himself, would understand
who had directed the blow.



The fire grew with lightning rapidity, and even here on
this trail, well away from the danger zone, the heat left his
horse in a lather of sweat. The smoke, too, was choking,
but the discomfort of it was no discomfort to him at all,
only to his horse, who had no desire for a cruel vengeance
in its submissive heart.



He sped on rapidly. Soon the trail turned away northward,
and the fire fell lower and lower upon the horizon,
and the heated night air cooled and sweetened. But the
man half regretted he was no longer in full view of the result
of his mischief. Still he reveled in the thought of what
Hendrie's feelings must be just now. It gave him the greatest
delight to picture the millionaire standing in the shadow
of his palatial home while a vast slice of his wealth was
vanishing in smoke before his eyes.



An hour later he approached the bluffs which surrounded
Everton. He had passed no one on the trail. As he drew
near his destination he was still further astonished to find
no sign of excitement stirring. He looked back. The sky
was lit for miles around, yet Everton and its surroundings
seemed all undisturbed. There was just a slight feeling of
pique in him as he realized how little popular stir his doings
had caused, and this lack of interest somehow lessened his
satisfaction.



The bluff swallowed him up, and he dug his heels viciously
into his horse's flanks.



The next moment he became aware of a horseman riding
toward him. That was better. Everton was awake after
all. Doubtless only the silence of the bluffs gave the little
town its appearance of indifference to the epoch-making
achievements of his genius.



The horseman rounded a bend in the trail just ahead of
him. He drew up sharply as he came abreast.



"Say," the man cried, without ceremony, "guess you don't
just happen to be Austin Leyburn?"



Leyburn thought quickly before replying.



"You looking for him?" he inquired evasively.



"What in hell do you s'pose I'm doin'?" retorted the
other, with a sort of explosion.



"Shouting a deal," observed Leyburn calmly.



"Guess you'd shout too, if you was chased this time o'
night rushin' around hunting a guy called Leyburn, when
there's a hell of a big fire eatin' up that doggone skunk
Hendrie's wheat."



"Fire?"



Leyburn appeared surprised.



"That's what I said. Say, you ain't deef an' blind, or
what's ailing yer? You come along that way. Gee, I'd
sure guess that lousy dollar king's 'bout hatin' hisself right
now. It's his boys. They're on strike. More power to
'em, sez I. If I'd anything in their bizness I'd burn his house,
too."



"You a farm hand?" inquired Leyburn amusedly.



"Was. I worked for Hendrie till his dirty Scotch manager
fired me. Now I'm chasin' chores around the hotel, back
there. Well, guess I got to find this guy 'fore I make my
blankets this night. I'll get on       seein' you haven't seen him
around."



But Leyburn promptly detained him.



"I'm your man," he said quietly. "What is it?"



"You're Leyburn?" The man's eyes twinkled in the darkness
as he fumbled in his dirty waistcoat pocket. "I'm real
glad," he exclaimed. "Guess I'll get a peek at Hendrie's
bonfire after all. Here       it come over the 'phone for you an
hour back. It's from Calford. The boss wrote it down so I
wouldn't forget. You got to chase back to Calford right
away. Something important. Boss said they wouldn't say
wot, seein' it wasn't you speakin', but you wasn't to lose a
minit       'cep you wanted one hell of a bust-up of trouble.
Here it is." He drew out a piece of paper tightly folded.



Leyburn took the paper.



"That what this paper says?" he asked.



"Wal, not just them words, but you got to get back right
away. Guess I'll get on an' see that fire now."



The choreman picked up his reins and rammed his heels
into his horse's flanks.



"So long," he called out, as his horse dashed forward in
the direction Leyburn had come.



Leyburn did not trouble to reply. He was already urging
his horse forward so as to reach the hotel with as little delay
as possible.



Trouble in Calford. He had risked it by making his visit
to Everton. It was always the way. He might have known.
What fool trick had they been up to in his absence? Was
there ever such a pack of imbeciles? Not one fit to be
trusted for a second. He slashed his horse's sides with vicious
heels in his haste to obey the summons.





The level prairie trail lay like a ribbon outstretched in
front of the speeding machine, as the searchlight at the
head of the car threw out its great shaft of hard, cold
light.



The man at the wheel sat well forward. His eyes were
straining behind his glasses, straining to discover in time
those treacherous unevennesses so frequently found in the
hollows of an unmade road. The speed was terrific, and
even Austin Leyburn, who sat beside him, with all his confidence
in his man, was sitting up, too, lending his watchful
eyes to the task.



The machine purred musically in the stillness of the night.
The engine was firing with perfect precision, and the occupants
of the car were left free to give their whole attention
to the surface of the road. It was needed, too. The danger
of their speed in the darkness was great, even to the most
experienced chauffeur.



Austin Leyburn had been forced to obey his summons.
On arrival at the Russell Hotel he had interviewed Lionel
K. Sharpe, and verified the telephone message. Sharpe had
told him the same as he had written down on paper, and
assured him of the urgency with which the message had
been sent.



But even this had not been sufficient for the shrewd labor
leader. Nothing would satisfy him but to ring up Calford
himself. He was promptly afforded every facility. Nor
was it until he had spent half an hour in vain ringing that
he discovered that the machine had taken into its wayward,
wooden head to get out of order. In consequence he was
left with no alternative but to accept the message as it stood,
and make the journey to Calford with all possible speed.



His mind traveled swiftly over the possibilities suggested
by the message. But each and every suggestion that came
to him left him dissatisfied. He could think of no probability
that demanded his presence at headquarters before
the morning, at his usual hour, the time his fellow-workers
were aware he intended to return.



He became annoyed. The more he considered the matter
the more his annoyance grew. Yet he could not help a feeling
of uneasiness, too. All his satisfaction of a short while
ago had passed. It was one thing to achieve a long-cherished
revenge; but, to him, it was quite another if its achievement
meant the upsetting of his entire life's work. These thoughts
came to him and would not be denied, in spite of his repeated
reassurance that it was all impossible, and that the message
must have been the result of some absurd and sudden panic
on the part of some blundering fool.



He was in the midst of these reflections, and his own attention
was consequently distracted from the road, when a
whistling sound escaped the man beside him. It was like a
sharp intake of breath, caused by sudden alarm. Leyburn
turned toward him, and as he did so the car jolted under
the sharp application of brakes, while behind them a stream
of sparks lit their wake.



"What is it?" he demanded, peering out ahead. "Gee!" he
cried in alarm, an instant later. "Quick, skirt it!"



But the car jerked to a standstill in a manner that must
nearly have ripped the tires off the wheels, and Leyburn
found himself with his hands gripping the dashboard below
the glass wind-screen, which came into sharp contact with
his face.



"Gee! That was a narrow shave," cried the chauffeur,
with a gasp of relief.



"What the devil              !" cried Leyburn, struggling back
to his seat, while the engine roared free, vibrating the whole
car violently, as if in angry protest.



But the driver had jumped to the ground, and stood contemplating
a huge tangle of barbed wire spreading right
across the trail, less than a dozen yards beyond the front
wheels.



Leyburn climbed down and followed him. There were no
bluffs, there were no fields with barbed wire fencing anywhere
in sight. It was plain enough, even in the darkness,
that they were surrounded on either hand by nothing but
bare, open prairie. He approached the tangled mass, and
his man pointed at it.



"We must clear it," he said. "It's these cursed farmers.
They're so darned careless               Say, if we'd gone headlong
into that, it would have torn our running gear right out.
Look at that." He stooped and fingered the great strands
of wire.



Leyburn bent down. His suspicions were fully aroused.



"Say," he cried. "This didn't get here by              "



"Hands up!"



The cry came sharply from directly behind the labor
leader, and its threat was unmistakable.



Leyburn turned at the hoarse demand. The chauffeur
stood up. Both found themselves looking into the muzzles of
revolvers. Two masked men stood confronting them, while
a third was waiting close by.



The chauffeur promptly complied with the order. He
felt that he had nothing to gain by refusing. He remembered
in time that he had only a few dollars in cash on him,
and no valuables.



Leyburn was less quick to respond. Light had broken
in upon his quick brain, and his thoughts had gone back to
the telephone message.



Another sharp order brought his wandering attention
back to the exigencies of the moment, and his hands were
slowly raised above his head.



Then the third man became active. Without a moment's
hesitation, and in absolute silence, he ran his hands down
the labor leader's pockets. Then he produced a rope, and
taking hold of his arms forced them to his sides, finally
securing them behind his back. Once his man was completely
trussed he turned his attention to the other, treating him to
similar attentions.



The whole thing was the work of a few moments. Leyburn,
impotently raging, was left quite helpless. So sudden
and startling had been the attack, so unsuspected, that its
success was complete; and even protest became impossible
before the threat of his assailants' weapons.



Now more than ever he knew he had been trapped by the
telephone message. But why, and by whom? Robbery?
It was absurd. The money he had on him would not pay
these men for their trouble and risk.



No, it was not robbery. Then he remembered Hendrie
and the firing of his crop. In a moment he became anxious,
and narrowly scrutinized the figures of his assailants. Two
of them were large, and the third was a lean creature, tall
enough, but small beside the other two. Each man's face was
completely covered by a long black mask. He could not
tell even if they were bearded.



His suspicions once aroused, however, he quickly made up
his mind that this was the work of his arch-enemy, and he
knew that, for the time, at least, he stood at his mercy.



Suddenly a hand was laid upon his shoulder. He was
turned about. Then he was thrust forward.



"Walk," commanded the man who had first spoken. The
next moment he found himself moving out on to the prairie.



In the meantime the chauffeur was hustled back to the
automobile. His captor secured him in the front seat, while
the third man dragged the barbed wire clear of the road.
Then the other took his place at the wheel, and the car
rolled away.



The third man looked after it. Then he finally turned
off the trail and followed Leyburn and his captor. By the
time he reached them, both men were in the saddle, waiting.
Two other horses stood by. He sprang into the saddle of
one and led the other, and the whole party set off across the
prairie.






CHAPTER XVIII



HIS BACK TO THE WALL



"Phew!"



Hendrie threw off the long cloth mask he had been wearing.
It dropped into the wastepaper basket beside the desk.
Angus Moraine followed his example.



In the center of the room, sitting on a high-legged armchair,
his arms still bound, Austin Leyburn silently watched
his captors' movements.



They were in the library at Deep Willows.



Long before their arrival Leyburn had become aware of
his captors' identity. The identity of the third man, who
was no longer with them, puzzled him       was still puzzling
him. The journey to Deep Willows had been made with
the passing of scarcely a single word. Once the captive
attempted to break the silence, but a swift threat had left
him no alternative.



Leyburn was no physical coward. But he knew men;
and his understanding of them left him convinced that Leo,
as he preferred to think of him, was utterly reckless when
goaded as he had been goaded by the total loss of his crop.
Therefore he waited, watchful and alert, ready to fight the
moment any reasonable opportunity offered, or to submit,
according to circumstances.



The millionaire's manner had lost something of its severity.
For the moment he felt he was back in the old fighting
days when lawlessness had no terrors for his impulsive
heart. It felt good to have his wits pitted against his old
associate with all law and order thrust into the background.
Besides, he knew that something far more precious than his
own life was dependent upon the result of this night's work.



He switched on additional light and then moved over to
the desk, against which he propped himself.



"Hot. Hot as hell, under those things, Tug, my boy,"
he said, while Angus unostentatiously seated himself in a
chair somewhat behind the prisoner. "Still, I guess they
were necessary. I wouldn't have had your man recognize
us. You didn't matter. He did. You are only one. Say,
he's a smart lad       your chauffeur. If he hadn't been you'd
both likely have been on the way to glory now, traveling
on a barbed wire. You were moving some. Still, I had to
risk all that. I needed you out in the open, with no one
around, and I hadn't time to worry out a better plan. You
see, I wanted you       without any halo. Guess I'll have to
hand your boy a wad       later. He did me a right good turn
saving your neck."



Leyburn smarted under the jibing manner. He strove
to twist himself into a position of ease, which his bound
arms made almost impossible. He wanted to answer. He
wanted to fling back some stinging retort, but prudence
kept him silent.



Hendrie watched his endeavor to ease his position, and
signed to Angus.



"Better loose him," he said, as he might have spoken of
some dog. "He's harmless       anyway."



Angus obeyed. And Leyburn could no longer keep
silence.



"Maybe he didn't do you so good a turn as you think,"
he cried, his voice husky with rage. "But you'll pay him
all right. You'll pay me, too, for this night's work. It was
like you       a highway robber."



Angus looked from one to the other. There was some
meaning in Leyburn's words he could not quite follow.



But the millionaire seemed undisturbed by them.



"Yes," Hendrie said, reaching round to the cabinet behind
him and taking a cigar.



He bit the end off, and Angus noted the vicious clip of his
sharp, white teeth. He lit the cigar deliberately, and eyed
his prisoner through the smoke.



"Yes," he said again, "later I'll be ready to pay most
anything. Just now it's you who're going to pay. Guess
you ought to understand that. You've known me with my
back to the wall before. I'm dangerous with my back to the
wall. You likely know that. You paid before       guess you're
going to pay now."



Leyburn stirred. The cold ease of this man's manner
troubled him. This reference to his doings in the past       before
another       had an ominous flavor. Policy kept him
silent, though he was longing to shout another furious defiance
at him.



"I'm generally ready to take my chances 'bout things,"
Hendrie went on, "but," he added with a contemptuous
movement of the hand, "this isn't as big a chance as no
doubt you figure it is. It don't amount to a heap taking
forcible possession of a low-down labor man who's set the
boys on to firing a million-dollar crop. Also incited them
to murder a lot of harmless niggers."



Leyburn's eyes grew hot, but he answered in a tone that
matched the other's for contempt.



"That wouldn't go in a court of law," he said. "You've
got to prove it. You'd find yourself up against a proposition
doing it. The strikers fired that crop because they
were drunk." He laughed; but his mirth was little better
than a snarl.



"Wouldn't it?" said Hendrie, removing his cigar and seriously
contemplating the perfect white ash at its tip. "Maybe
you're right though. Guess you know the limits you can
go to. Still, you're apt to be overconfident. Guess you
were that way some time back. You remember. You
warned me you intended to 'smash' me. That was the word.
It's a good word to impress folks who're carried away by
words. But it's too showy for me. Besides, it's a fool trick
to warn folks you're going to hunt 'em. You need to do
the smashing first and warn afterwards. That's my way.
In your case that warning was fatal. It left me time to get
busy. Oh, I got busy all right. Maybe you know I went
East, just after. I s'pose you kept track of me. I went
East for two reasons. One to make it so you couldn't hurt
me through your labor machinery. The other to       hunt
you up."



He paused and their eyes met. A quick, furtive inquiry
was in Leyburn's. In Hendrie's there was simply a deadly
cold light as he nodded.



"Oh, yes," he went on. "I hunted you up all right.
P'r'aps you don't know it       but you ought to       my work is
to study and watch the money market. It is for me to find
out who're moving, who're manipulating. It's not always
easy. So, to do it successfully, and to keep myself just
ahead of other folks, I have a bureau of secret information
that would be a credit to New York Tammany Hall. Do
you follow me?"



Leyburn abruptly shifted his position.



"I don't," he denied, with unnecessary force.



Hendrie knocked his ash on to the Turkey carpet.



"I'll make it plainer. It will enlighten Angus, here, as
well. When you're in conspiracy to play the stock market
through labor strikes which you control, it's best not to
threaten to smash one of the biggest operators in the country.
If you're sensible, and finish with me as I want you to
finish, these things don't matter. But if you're foolish, and
headstrong, there are a heap of things may happen. One of
them is the prisoners' dock for criminal conspiracy in your
labor work. Not only for you, but for the other 'heads' of
your movement."



Leyburn suddenly burst into a laugh. It was forced. It
was so evidently forced that it drew a reluctant smile from
the watchful Scot behind him, and a contemptuous smiling
response from Hendrie, himself.



"Funny, isn't it?" the millionaire observed calmly. "It
would be funnier still if your union members heard of it.
Gee, they'd be tickled to death."



But the humor suggested by Hendrie passed his prisoner
by. His laugh had died out, and his angry eyes snapped.



"You didn't bring me here to tell me this       this fool talk,"
he cried, striving desperately for calmness.



Hendrie relit his cigar, which had gone out.



"No I didn't, Tug, my boy," he said, glancing over the
flame of the match at the man's furious face. "There are
other things." He blew the light out, and placed the dead
match carefully in an ash tray. "Guess you don't need me
to preach sense to a man like you. Still, if I'd a grievance
against a man       and," he smiled, "I allow you have reason
to feel unfriendly toward me       I should just get right up
on my hind legs and hand him all I knew       dead straight. I
wouldn't worry with a bum organization of labor to do it.
It's unwieldy, it's rarely effective. You leave me free to
get out of it, to protect myself. Say, you haven't robbed me
of a thing to-night. All you've done is to manure the soil,
and do me a service toward next year's crop, which I doubt,
when the time comes, if you'll be in a position to hurt."



He crossed over to the window and drew the curtains
aside. The red glow of the still burning crop was shining in
every direction. The window looked out upon a land of fire,
with the house, an oasis in the center of it, cut off by wide
"fire breaks," which left it beyond all danger.



"Look," he cried. "It's a pretty sight. Fire in every
direction. But, from your point of view, wholly uneffective."



The curtains fell back in their place, and the millionaire
returned to the desk. Leyburn had not moved. Like an
obstinate child he had refused to look as invited, and Angus's
grim face displayed his appreciation of the manner in which
Hendrie was, in his own phraseology, "putting him through
it."



"Then there's those niggers," the millionaire continued,
as soon as he had taken up his position at the desk again.
"You told the boys to shoot 'em up to-night." He shook his
head sadly. "Quite ridiculous. Quite impossible. You
should have thought more       and hated less. Angus has
paid 'em off, and they're quitting right now, as fast as panic
can chase 'em. You see, there's no more work here now for
black or white for six months to come. All the hands are
out of a job, whether they like it or not. When they've
starved till their bones are rattling they'll come back to us
on their hands and knees. You've done that. It's the way
you raise their wages. The way you better their lot. Pshaw!
you're like the rest of 'em, only you're worse, because you're
legally dishonest, too. So long as the papers are full of
you, so long as your workers cheer you to the echo, and you
can sign orders giving the world permission to go on moving
around in space, so long as your pocketbooks are fattened
by the blind ignorance of those you represent, what in hell
do you care for the worker? I'm sick to death of you and
your rotten kind. To do good there must be honesty in
you       and there's none. You make the worker suffer weeks
and weeks of misery and hardship, goading him into the belief
that he is all-powerful, for some paltry betterment that
does not begin to make up for what he has suffered. You
never let him rest and prosper. You drive him, year after
year, till, by the time he ends up his miserable life in poverty,
he can reckon a large proportion of it has been spent
in wilful idleness which has helped further to rob him of any
adequate provision for his wife and children. It makes me
sick. As long as the world lasts labor must be the under dog.
You cannot lift labor if it cannot lift itself. Brute force
must remain subservient to brain. With your unclean human
hands you are striving to drive labor to a vain effort to
overthrow one of the greatest laws of all life."



For the moment Hendrie seemed to have lost himself in
the interest of his own subject, but he was abruptly brought
back to the affairs in hand by the smiling sarcasm of his
prisoner.



"Quite a lecture," he cried. "Say, Leo              "



But he reckoned without the loyal Scot behind him.



"Quit your gas," cried Angus, in a threatening tone.



Leyburn turned with sudden ferocity. But before he
could voice his exasperation Hendrie broke in.



"Easy," he cried. "Don't raise your voice here. There's
a sick woman upstairs. A woman sick to death. And it's
because of her you're here now."



Leyburn looked quickly up into the big man's face. It
had changed, changed utterly. All the old calm had gone.
Memory, memory inspired by thoughts of the desperate
straits of the woman he loved, had left the millionaire's
every nerve straining.



"Sick woman?" cried Leyburn. "What in hell have I to
do with your sick women folk?"



Hendrie's eyes had become bloodshot. The Scot watched
him closely and with some apprehension.



"I'll tell you," cried the millionaire, his jaws shutting
tight on his cigar. "The woman who's sick is       my
wife."



Leyburn burst into a derisive laugh.



"Your wife?" he cried. "Your wife? What about Audie?
What about the woman you left to starve       to die out on
the Yukon trail?" He glanced round at Angus to witness
the effect of his challenge. "His wife," he said deliberately
addressing the Scot. "He left her, deserted her with her
unborn child."



There are moments in life when a man is face to face with
death without being aware of it. This was such a moment.
Hendrie's hand was on a loaded revolver in his coat pocket,
and a mad impulse urged him to silence that virulent, taunting
tongue then and there. Fortunately Leyburn ceased
speaking in time, and the impulse passed.



"We'll talk of that later," cried Hendrie, the blood still
beating madly at his temples, but his words almost calm.
"Meanwhile it's about my wife you're here. Mrs. Hendrie
is sick to death upstairs for want of a surgeon's aid. The
man who can save her is in Winnipeg. Your strike on the railroad
keeps him from getting here in time to save her. Do
you understand? You're here to save her by giving an
order to your union members, and those in authority over
them, to permit a special train to bring him here. That's
what you're here for, and       by God, you're going to give it."



The veins were standing out like ropes on his forehead
as he uttered his final threat. Leyburn understood. But
he could not resist an impulse to challenge him further.



"And if I refuse?" he demanded, with brows raised superciliously.



"But you won't," retorted Hendrie. "Oh, no, you won't,
my friend." Then in a moment his eyes blazed up with that
curious insane light Angus knew so well. A deep flush overspread
his great face. "I told you my back was to the
wall," he cried. "I told you that. And you       you poor,
miserable fool, believed it was because of your pitiful attempt
to break me. I could laugh to think that you       you       Tug       the
man I robbed on the Yukon trail, could ever hope to
beat me when it came to measuring our strength. Never
in your life. But, all unconsciously, you have hurt me; yes,
you have hurt me       and you're going to undo that hurt."
Slowly he withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket,
and continued, pointing his words with the shining revolver
his hand was gripping.



"You're going to write that order out now       here, in this
room. You're going to write it so there can be no mistake.
One of your men       one of your lieutenants       the man you
call Frank Smith is going to take it and see that it is obeyed.
He will also accompany the train. You'll write it now       this
moment, do you understand? Now       here       or I'll shoot you
down for the miserable cur you are."



Angus was sitting bolt up in his chair. His hard eyes
were alight. He knew the mood of his employer, and even
he dreaded what might follow.



But Leyburn, too, had realized something of the insane
passion driving this man. Nor had he any desire to test
it too far. However, he still demurred. He knew that for
the second time in his life this great Leo had the best of him,
and he must submit. But his submission should be full of
fight.



"This man. This Frank Smith," he said, looking squarely
into the millionaire's eyes. "Does he know what relation
he is to you?"



"No. Do you?" Hendrie's reply bit through the silence.



Leyburn nodded. He was grinning savagely.



"Yes," he said. "I discovered it soon after I       discovered
you."



Hendrie's eyes were blazing.



"Good," he said. "Then it'll help to embellish the story
you'll have to tell him       after he returns from Winnipeg."



"After?" Leyburn started.



Hendrie nodded. But his revolver was still tightly
clutched in his hand.



"Perhaps I have a poor estimate of human nature," he
said. "Anyway       of yours. I've taken all the chances with
you I intend to take. You are going to stop right here       after
you've written that order."



"But       if I write this order as you want it, you can't,
you've no right              "



"Right?" Hendrie laughed savagely. "Right?" he reiterated
scornfully. "We've done with all question of right
just now. For the moment I'm the top dog, and until you've
complied with all my demands, you can put the question of
right out of your mind. There's the paper and ink," he
went on, moving away from the desk. "Make out that order       at
once."



Leyburn made no attempt to comply. He sat there with
his narrow eyes on the man standing threateningly confronting
him. He was thinking       thinking rapidly. He
was afraid, too. More afraid than he would have admitted.
Besides, if he were detained until Frank returned       then
what of Calford? What of the railroad strike? What of
a thousand and one demands awaiting his attention. It
was impossible. He broke into a cold sweat. Then his
eyes wandered to the shining barrel of that revolver. He
noted the tremendous pressure of muscle in the hand grasping
it. There was a storm of passion lying behind that
pressure. He raised his eyes to the greenish gray of Hendrie's.
To him their expression was surely not sane.



"Write that order!"



The millionaire's revolver hand was slowly raised. Leyburn
saw the movement. At the same time he became aware
that Angus was moving his chair out of the direct line of
fire. He was beaten, and he knew it.



"Hell take you!" he cried, rising from his seat. "Give
me the paper!"



Hendrie pointed at the desk without a word. Leyburn
followed the indication. Then he walked over and seated
himself in the millionaire's chair.



For several minutes there was no sound in the room but
the scratching of the labor leader's pen. Angus looked on,
watching his employer and wondering. He was wondering
what really would have happened had Leyburn refused.
Somehow he felt glad he had moved out of the line of fire.
Hendrie's eyes never left the figure bending over the desk.



At last Leyburn flung down the pen.



"There's the order," he cried, rising from the desk. "It's
absolutely right. No one will disobey it," he declared
ostentatiously. "Now I demand to be allowed to go free."



The millionaire picked up the paper, blotted it, and then
carefully read it over. He was satisfied. It seemed all he
could desire. He looked up and shook his head.



"You'll remain my       guest       till the surgeon arrives," he
said.



Leyburn suddenly threw up his hands, and the movement
was an expression of panic.



"It will take a       week!" he cried desperately.



"You'll remain my       guest       until he comes." Hendrie's
voice and manner were utterly savage. "If he is too late
to save her, my promise goes if       I swing for it."






CHAPTER XIX



TWO MEN



The devastation of the wheat lands of Deep Willows was
complete. The home of Alexander Hendrie itself, stood
out scathless, the center of a blackened, charred waste. It
was a mockery, a pitiful mockery of its recent glory.
Against its somber, naked surroundings the delicate paint
work of its perfect wooden structure left a vulgar, even
tawdry impression of the mind. It looked as out of place as
bright colors at a plumed funeral. The home farm, the
outlying farms for miles around, they, too, stood as they had
stood before, while all the live stock, their "feed," the machinery,
had escaped the ravages of the sea of fire by reason
of the well-planned "fire-breaks" which the cautious Scot
kept in perfect order.



The fire had stripped the river banks, too. The beautiful
wooded slopes, the pride and delight of their owner and his
manager, were now mere blackened skeletons whose moldering
limbs were beyond even the power of time to heal.



It was a terrible destruction, so wanton, so useless, even
as an expression of human hatred. So utterly was it lacking
in this respect that it became nothing short of an insult to
the Creator of all things rather than an act of vengeance
of human upon human. The only real sufferers would be
those whose hands had wrought the mischief, a suffering
that must be surely just.



Hendrie himself did not witness daylight's revelation.
Long before morning he was in Calford, accompanied by
Frank, whose work had been the secret bestowal of Leyburn's
chauffeur, and his automobile, until such time as the man
could safely be permitted to return to the world to which
he belonged. Hendrie and his helpers had committed themselves
to their conspiracy in no uncertain fashion. Whatever
the outcome for them they had been prepared to risk
all for the life, which at least two of them valued above
all else.



But the man whose watch and ward this beautiful farm
had been, the man whose fortunes had for so long been
bound up in it, was early enough abroad, and his sunken
eyes, brooding, regretful, hating, witnessed the utter ruin
of his years of labor.



Angus Moraine suffered far deeper than any words could
tell. It was like a mother witnessing the destruction of an
only child, for this farm, and all pertaining to it, was as his
only child. He loved it with a depth of affection almost
incongruous in a man so hard, so unsympathetic as he.
Yet his love was so real that the sight that daylight revealed
to his horror-stricken eyes well-nigh broke his heart, and
set him hating as he had never hated in his life. So, as he
gazed abroad, he thanked Providence that his was the
charge of their captive, even though that captivity were
only to last a week.



Yes, Leyburn was his prisoner       was in his sole charge.
Perhaps in thus committing him Hendrie had understood
something of what that charge would mean. Whether he
did or not, certain it is that Leyburn, before the week was
out, had reason to curse the day that had brought him once
more into contact with the great Leo.



The doings of the night before, the bringing of the captive
to Deep Willows, had been kept a profound secret from the
household. Long before morning Leyburn had been further
spirited off to the inner recesses of a remote farm building
where his jailer promptly instituted a rigor of treatment
far less merciful than that of the harshest penitentiary.
Then came Angus Moraine's despair at the sight of the
utter destruction about him, and, from that moment, he
laid himself out to the punishment of his victim, as only his
peculiar mind could conceive it. For every pang he suffered
he determined that the author of them should suffer
double, and his manner of achieving it was inspired by the
coldly cruel streak which was part of his hard nature.



True to his intentions he achieved a hatred in Leyburn
for himself that scarcely ranked less than the labor leader's
hatred for his arch-enemy, Leo. Angus baited his prisoner
by methods of almost devilish ingenuity. He spared no
pains, no trouble, and that which passed between them was
for them alone. Certain it is that long before the termination
of the imprisonment, the Scot's dour temper had improved,
a sure sign that even from the great disaster which
had befallen his wheat lands he had contrived to draw some
slight satisfaction.



In the meantime the two men in Calford were engaged on
a delicate mission, in spite of their possession of Leyburn's
written instructions to his colleagues. Upon Frank devolved
the chief work. Alexander Hendrie dared not appear in it.
Frank was known to be Leyburn's lieutenant, and, as such,
he was received.



But there was much formality, an exhaustive inquisition
as to Leyburn, his whereabouts, the work he was engaged
upon, the purpose of his order and Frank was forced to
lie as never in his life had he lied before. Money had to be
spent freely in every direction. The railroad company had
to be adequately reassured and indemnified. Its fears of
disaster to itself had to be lulled, and, in the process, the
expenditure of money was staggering. The conflicting
forces at work in every direction were appalling. Among
the strikers, their leaders, and then the railroad company.
So much inhumanity and ignorance prevailed under the
cloak of humanity that almost at any moment during the
negotiations the whole project might well have fallen to the
ground.



Finally, however, the last obstacle was overcome, the last
difference adjusted, and the hour for departure came. Adhering
to their methods of conducting the negotiations, the
final Godspeed was spoken in the privacy of Hendrie's
rooms in the hotel at which he was staying.



It was brief enough, as became the existing relations between
the two men.



Frank received his final instructions concerning Professor
Hinkling, and stood waiting.



Hendrie paused for a moment, considering. Then he
looked into the boy's serious, earnest face, with a shadowy
smile in his steady eyes.



"Keep it in your mind, boy, that poor Mon is depending
on you," he said. "Her life is in your hands       for the moment.
Bring him back with you. Bring him back if you
have to fight the whole way, and       well, I guess God'll bless
you for it."



Frank nodded. Then the millionaire, after a fractional
pause, crossed to the door and held it open. Frank looked
into his face for one fleeting second. Then he moved toward
the door. A look of indecision was in his eyes, but finally
he turned deliberately, and with decision.



"Good-bye, Mr. Hendrie," he said. Then he added in a
low, earnest tone. "I thought I hated you, sir, but       I
don't."



The millionaire made no reply, and the boy passed out.



Nor was the latter conscious of the deepening tenderness
in the older man's eyes. All he felt, all he knew, was that
the last shadow of the past, of his past sufferings at this
man's hands, had been swallowed up in the great bond of
sympathy now existing between them. Each man was ready
to lay down even his life for one poor, helpless, sick woman;
each was inspired by a love that now knew no limits to its
sacrifice of self.



Hendrie turned back from the door with a deep sigh. He
raised his right hand and stood thoughtfully gazing at it.
It was almost as if he were examining it, seeking something
his conscience told him he would find upon it. He knew, too,
that his thought was of something unclean. He knew, too,
that however much he had longed to grip the departing
boy's hand in honest affection he had no right to do so       yet.



His return to Deep Willows was almost precipitate. He
wanted to spend not a moment more than was necessary
away from the roof which sheltered Monica. The chaotic
condition of railroad affairs in Calford interested him not
one whit now. He cared nothing for the rights or wrongs
of the battle raging between labor and capital. The weary
women and hungry children of the strikers, for all he cared
could die in the ditches their husbands had dug for them.



As for the employers, let them fight their battles out as
best they could. It mattered not at all if the country's
entire trade were left at a standstill, nor was it of consequence
what anarchy reigned. The stock markets might
collapse, and shares might fall beyond redemption. His
wealth counted for nothing in the stress of his feelings.
Just one thing counted; one poor, flickering, suffering life.



So he rushed headlong back to Deep Willows to pass the
time of waiting with what patience he could. Humanly
speaking, he had played his last card for the saving of that
one life, so there was nothing left for him but to pace the
floors of his luxurious home hoping and fearing, now threatening
to himself the life of the man who had made the chances
of timely help so remote, now praying to Almighty God, as
never in his life he had prayed before, to spare him the life
he loved.



He had reached the one terrific moment in his life when
he realized that the world, in which his heart and mind had
been so long wrapped, meant nothing. He was down to the
bare skeleton of human nature when primal passions alone
counted. He knew that he had shed for ever the coat of
civilization. It had always fitted him ill. Now the natural
love of man for woman, male for female, in its simplest form,
dominated his whole being. And with it came all those savage
instincts with which the natural world seeks to protect
its own.



The destruction of his wheat lands passed him by. He
did not see that blackened world as his loyal servant Angus
saw it. He had neither patience nor inclination to listen to
lamentations, just as he had no lamentation to make over it
for himself.



His attitude reflected itself in his surroundings. The
house remained silent as the grave. Angus avoided him, and
devoted all his attention to his prisoner. The nurses and
the doctor devoted themselves to the last ounce of their
strength to their patient; and the servants went about their
duties with hushed voices, which left the great house with the
atmosphere of a sepulcher.



Hendrie rarely left his library. Hour after hour he spent
in desperate solitude. His pretence was work, but he did
none. And Phyllis alone dared to approach him.



From her he drew some comfort. Her wonderful tact,
and even affection, showed her the way to bring him a measure
of that mental ease he so desperately needed. Only once
during that terrible week of waiting did she make a mistake.
She knew she had made it the moment the words had passed
her lips, and it became a lesson she knew she would never
need again.



It was on the fourth day of Frank's absence. She was
beginning to catch something of the infection of Hendrie's
restless unease. Doubt of the success of Frank's mission
was creeping through her armor of optimism. She was
troubled, and so her moment of weakness came.



"I       I wonder if he'll succeed. I wonder       if he'll be in
time," she said.



Then in a moment she caught her breath at the sudden
and awful expression of the man's eyes. They blazed up
with a wild, insane light. He broke into a loud, harsh laugh.



"If he doesn't, you'll see me at the gallows, girl," he
cried.



Phyllis had cried out in protest. Then, in something like
panic, she rushed from the room.



That night she was haunted by dreams so hideous that
long before daylight she had left her bed, and joined the
night nurse.



Once more her fear got the better of her, but here she was
met by the practical trained mind of a woman who was devoted
to her work.



"If Hinkling doesn't get here to-morrow, or the next day       well,
poor soul, she's in the hands of some one who knows
best. Doctor Fraser gave too big a margin, I think. Still       we
must hope for the best. Poor soul, she knows nothing       so
she can't be suffering. I see Mr. Hendrie's light is still
burning in the library. He'll be in the doctor's hands if
Hinkling doesn't get here       in time."



Phyllis agreed. She knew it, too. She knew the desperate
condition of the man's mind, and her knowledge told her
that the balance was wavering.



The fifth day dawned. Still there was no news. But none
could reach them. The day after Hendrie's return from
Calford the telegraph wires had been cut, and, since then,
all communication had been left intermittent. The wires
were repaired, and, within a few hours, cut again. And so
it had gone on. The automobile had been waiting in Calford
for two days now, and all knew that the only indication of
the success of Frank's mission would be the return of the
vehicle with its precious freight.



Thus on this day all eyes and thoughts turned upon the
trail through the blackened wheat fields.



*****



It was noon. Phyllis and the millionaire were standing
at the entrance porch. The sun was beating down upon
their bare heads all unnoticed, all uncared. The eyes of the
man never left the sweep of the trail where it rounded the
skeleton woods which lined the river bank. The girl had
wearied of the straining, and now watched her companion.



In her heart was a great pity for him. His eyes were no
longer the steady eyes she knew so well. They were bloodshot
and sunken. The veins at his temples, and of his neck,
were standing out like ropes. It seemed to her imagination
that all his great bodily strength was concentrated at the
breaking point. Painful as was her own anxiety, it was as
nothing beside the fear his attitude inspired her with. If
Frank failed?       but she dared not think of it.



Suddenly she started. Just for one moment a look of
dreadful doubt looked out of her eyes, now abruptly turned
upon the trail again. Had her prairie-trained ears deceived
her, or              ? She dared not glance again in Hendrie's direction
until she was sure. She listened. Then a wild excitement
lit her face. She moved. She reached out. One hand
suddenly gripped the arm of the man beside her. He made
a movement as though to free himself, but her nervous clutch
only tightened.



"Listen!" she cried. Then in a moment: "Oh, if he's succeeded.
Oh, if he's only got him with him!"



"Silence, child!"



The man's harsh voice rang out, and Phyllis, even in her
excitement, quailed at the tone.



Now, side by side, with eyes and ears straining, the girl
still clinging to the man's arm, they stood waiting.



That familiar purr. Soft, soft, a low, deep note thrilling
with hope for the watchers. But it was far away, so far
that the man, whose ears were less well trained, could only
just hear it.



To Phyllis it was distinct now, and growing in volume
with each passing moment. Oh, that precious note. What
music. No such perfect music could ever have fallen on
straining ears. Its gentle softness suggested but one thing
to the girl. It was the hope of life. She felt that no such
warmth, no such modulation could have been in that which
was the herald of disaster.



The man's imagination was less sensitive. His usually
firm mouth was twitching. There was water in his eyes,
but it was not tears, nor was it the result of excitement. It
was the strain he was putting forth to catch the first sight
of the vehicle, and count its passengers as it came.



He shivered once. The girl felt the shiver, and she, too,
shook with excitement. She was leaning forward.



At last she could stand it no longer. She broke from
her companion, and flew down the trail as fast as her active
young limbs could carry her. She must be the first to convey
the good news to the breaking heart of the man who
remained standing, like one paralyzed, by the porch of his
splendid home.



On she ran, on and on, till she came to the bend where the
river turned away, and the open trail went straight on, and
the bluffs of Everton lay in full view.



Here she halted and gazed out. For some moments she
stood watching, watching. Then, at last, she turned and
began to run back, waving her hands in a frenzy of ecstasy
as she came.



In a few moments she was within hailing distance of the
man, and she halted.



"Four of them!" she gasped frantically. "Four of them
in the car! Frank's brought him! Frank's brought him!"






CHAPTER XX



THE STORY OF LEO



It was evening. The afterglow of sunset still shed its
golden radiance upon a blackened world, striving vainly to
burnish with its gentle luster the depressing aspect of
charred fields. The cool August breezes, usually so fresh
and sweet at sundown, were tainted, scarcely unpleasantly,
with the reek of dead fire.



Two figures, apparently absorbed in themselves, were
pacing slowly the broad trail which fronted Deep Willows.
They were talking, talking earnestly of those things which
concerned their lives, while their anxious hearts were waiting
with almost sickening dread, for the moment when a summons
should reach them, that they might learn the verdict
of hope or disaster which Providence had in store for them.



They knew, these two, these boy and girl lovers, that the
life of the one they had learned to love so dearly was hovering
in the balance. They knew that the great surgeon, who
had journeyed so far, and under such strenuous conditions,
was waging the human side of a great battle.



Was he once more to be victorious over Death, or would
that ruthless specter at last defy him? The man was accounted
infallible by a thankful world. He had come to the
rescue fully prepared for a great fight. He had brought not
only his own dresser, but also his own anesthetist, while two
competent nurses and another medical man were on the
premises. So these two hoped, while their hearts were yet
plunged in a perfect maelstrom of fears.



They were striving with all their might to pass the hours
of waiting. Professor Hinkling had been with his patient
from the moment of his arrival soon after noon. He was
still with her now, when the great August sun had set amid
its glory of fiery cloud.



Phyllis halted in her walk. Quite abruptly she raised a
pair of earnest, admiring eyes to her lover's face. In their
depths lay all that which can raise a man to a perfect paradise
of joy and hope. Never had her woman's attraction
been more evident to young Frank than at that moment.
Never in his life had he realized more fully than at this moment
all he had so recently striven to crush out of his life
and deny himself for ever.



"Say, Frank, dear," she cried ardently. "The more I
think, why, the more I just love to feel you       you are my
Frank, and it was you, and you only, could have brought
Professor Hinkling through here. Say, you must have been
well-nigh crazy with the worry       and       and anxiety. Oh, if
you'd only known how we, Mr. Hendrie and I, felt standing
right here to-day waiting       waiting with scarcely a reason
to hope you'd make Deep Willows in time. D'you know,
Mr. Hendrie was well-nigh clean crazed       sure?" She shuddered.
"I never saw a crazy man before, but he was crazy
then. I watched him. I was scared       scared to death."



Frank looked out over at the great house. Suddenly he
breathed a deep sigh.



"I'm glad, Phyl," he said presently. "I'm glad       I got
here in time. I'm glad, not only for poor Mon, but for       him."
He looked down into the girl's eyes, and a half smile
crept into his own: "It's all so queer," he went on. "I       I
ought to hate that man. Yes, I ought. And I just feel
like a sort of soft worm for not doing so. That's a fact,
Phyl. I don't hate him. I       I like him. Do you know I
seem to have seen into him, right deep down into his heart,
and it's       a queer place. But I've seen something there that
appeals to me. It appeals to me so big that I       simply can't
hate him. It's his big manhood. He's full to the brim of
something that I've never understood before. Something
I'm just beginning to understand. And, d'you know, I don't
believe there's nearly so much of it going around as folks
pretend to believe. Do you know, Phyl, I believe if that
man were dying to-morrow he'd just get right hold of Death,
and       and he'd try to choke the life out of him before he'd
give in."



Phyllis nodded her head wisely.



"You're right, dear," she cried impulsively. "Can you
wonder he's where he is? Can you wonder he's right on top
of the things other folks are shouting for, but haven't the
strength, or grit to       to just grab hold of for themselves?
You're feeling just like I do about him. Guess he's so big
in spirit as well as body. That's why he's on top. It's       it's
always the way."



"Yes," Frank admitted, "that's how you've always said       and
I think       now       you're right. I didn't always think
so       but I do now."



Phyllis turned away. She was gazing across at the house,
and a deep look of enthusiasm and hope was shining in her
eyes.



"Do you know, Frank," she said, after a pause. "I sort
of feel our Mon will win out       now. No, I'm not just thinking
of Professor Hinkling. I'm thinking of Mr. Hendrie.
I sort of feel he's got to win out in       everything. His whole
mind and heart's on Monica's recovery, and       and I believe
they're too big and strong for Fate to break him. Oh, I'm
foolish, I know. I'm talking like a crazy girl, but I just
can't help it. I believe he's too strong even       for Fate."



Frank, too, was gazing across at the house. A curious
look had crept into his eyes. They were stern, stern and
cold, and his jaws had shut tight.



Phyllis, glancing up at him, wondered. It was the first
time in her life she had seen such a look in her lover's eyes.
Never, even in those dark days when he had first left prison,
had she seen such a look in him. And yet it was quite
familiar. It was a look she knew quite well.



She started, and an irresistible impulse stirred her.



"Frank! Oh, Frank!" she cried. "If you could only see
yourself. Tell me, dear. What are you thinking?"



"Thinking?"



The look had passed. The man's eyes were now gently
smiling down into the girl's eager face.



"I was thinking of you, Phyl," he said tenderly. "I was
thinking of you in Mon's place, and of myself in Hendrie's.
I was thinking of what I should do. Of how I should feel.
I was thinking that I, too, should want to take Fate in my
two hands and compel it to do my will."



His face was flushing with boyish shame at the apparent
boastfulness of his words, but he had spoken the truth.



But Phyllis saw nothing of the braggart in his words.



"I knew it, I knew it," she cried, her eyes shining with
love and admiration. "Your face was the face of Alexander
Hendrie just now. I have seen that look in his, not once,
but a hundred times, and       then it was in yours. Oh, Frank,
I am so glad, so       so glad you felt like that. I long to think
and feel that now the old miserable past is over and done
with, that you, too, will take life in your two strong hands,
and       and fight out the big battle the Almighty has set for
men. I want no man who must have others to fight for
him; I want no man who will cry out weakly at every blow
in the face; I want no man who will yield beneath the flail
of Fate. I want the man of big courage, the man of fight.
He must have the muscles of a giant, and the heart of a
lion. That man I will set up on my little altar, and so long
as I live I will go down on my knees and thank God for His
goodness in giving him to me."



Frank had no words in which to answer. A great passion
was sweeping through his veins and held him silent. Of a
sudden his arms reached out and caught the girl's slim body
in their powerful embrace, and, regardless that they were
in full view of the house, he crushed her to his bosom, and
kissed her passionately.



But Phyllis was more mindful of those things, and swiftly
released herself with a little cry.



"Frank!" she protested. "Frank!"



But Frank remained smilingly unrepentant.



"I don't care," he cried. "I don't care if the whole              "



He broke off with a scared look in the midst of his smile.
Phyllis was pointing across at the house. The glass entrance
doors had just swung to, and a man-servant was rapidly
coming toward them.



"It's       it's about       Monica!" Phyllis exclaimed, in a sudden
panic.





The man addressed himself to Frank.



"Mr. Hendrie would like to see you at once, sir. He's
in the library now       waiting."



Frank looked into the man's inscrutable face in anxious
inquiry.



"Is there       has there been any word of       Mrs. Hendrie       yet?"
he questioned sharply.



The man's sigh was in perfect order with his training.



"I think not       yet, sir."



Frank sighed, too. His relief was lest the news should
have been bad. His eyes sought Phyllis's.



Then he turned again to the man.



"You said       at once?"



"Yes, sir. Mr. Hendrie was emphatic on the point."



Phyllis looked up into her lover's face.



"You best hurry, Frank."



"Yes."



Frank hurried away, leaving the man to return to the
house at his leisure.





Daylight was rapidly dying. Already the remoter corners
of the library were lost in growing shadows. Outside the
rosy sunset had chilled to a pale yellow, above which a faint
twinkle of stars was already visible.



Hendrie was sitting astride a chair. Its back was turned,
and his folded arms were resting upon it. His great, square
chin was thrust forward supported upon them.



His eyes were gloomy, and coldly brooding as they surveyed
the other two occupants of the room. Austin Leyburn
was seated with his back to the window, and his face was lost
in the shadow. A few yards away from his charge sat Angus
Moraine. His watchful eyes, full of a hatred he made no
attempt to conceal, were steadily fixed upon the other's
shadowed features.



A painful, straining silence reigned in the room. There
was nothing more to be said between these three until the
arrival of the man whom Hendrie had dispatched a servant
in search of.



Presently the door opened. Hendrie half turned his head.
Leyburn's eyes lifted in the direction. Only Angus remained
indifferent to the arrival. He knew that his reign in charge
of his prisoner was over, and the thought was as gall and
wormwood to him.



Frank glanced in turn at the three figures. Then he approached
his host.



"You wished to see me, Mr. Hendrie."



The millionaire raised his head and nodded.



"Yes, boy," he said, and Leyburn's eyes suddenly lit with
a venom that seemed to fit with their narrow setting.



Now Hendrie seemed in no hurry to proceed. He turned
about leisurely, and reached over to his cigar cabinet. He
selected a cigar with some care, smelled it, and rolled it
lightly between finger and thumb. Then he pushed the cabinet
along the desk in Frank's direction.



"Smoke?" he said, and bit off the end of his own cigar.



Frank shook his head.



"I'd rather smoke my pipe," he said simply.



Hendrie's eyes became less cold. He nodded.



"Sit       anyway," he said, in his brief, almost brusque
fashion.



Frank obeyed, and the other lit his cigar.



When it was burning satisfactorily, he turned thoughtful
eyes on Frank, who was in the act of lighting his pipe.



"Say," he began, evidently thinking hard, "Hinkling's
sent word he'll be along in a while. Couldn't just say how
long. Seems to me there's got to be some talk in this room       before
he comes. This feller here, Austin Leyburn, or
Tug, as I've always known him, is full to the brim with
stuff he's crazy to hand out to the       general public. It's
mostly about me. You see, we knew each other well, some
twenty years ago. He sort of thinks he knows a heap about
me I'd hate to hand on to anybody else, specially you       and
Mrs. Hendrie. I've been trying to convince him this
while back I'm just yearning for you both to hear all he's
got to tell, but I want to be around so I know he tells it
right. You see, it's important he tells it right. Guess my
being around don't seem to suit him, and he's kicking. Says
he'll tell it when he wants, and in his own way. Not as I
want, and at my time. He says he's going to raise trouble
all around for us       when he gets away. I've told him he can
do what in hell he likes       when he gets away. Meanwhile,
you are going to hear all he wants you to hear right now.
If he won't tell you in front of me as I want him to, then
I'll tell it you in front of him as he don't want me to. If
I hide anything or forget anything, or tell it wrong, it's up
to him to correct me, same as I should correct him. Whether
he likes it or not, that story's going to be told right here and
now."



There was no mistaking Alexander Hendrie's manner.
Frank knew that a crisis in the man's life had arrived, perhaps
a crisis in the lives of all those present. He made no
attempt to reply. He knew that the millionaire's words were
the preliminary to a skirmish in which he had no part beyond
that of an onlooker.



Hendrie turned to Leyburn.



"You get me?" he demanded. "You can choose to tell       or
not. I don't care a curse which you do."



Leyburn suddenly cleared his throat. He sat forward in
his chair and even in the failing light it was plain       the
furious flashing of his eyes. Angus lost no detail of any
purpose, other than to talk, in his prisoner. He sat absolutely
alert.



"Yes," Leyburn suddenly cried out. "I'll tell the story
to this       this cur of a boy of yours, damn you." Then he
flung out an arm, pointing at the man astride his chair,
smoking in his steady, unruffled fashion. "See that man,"
he cried, with added fury, addressing himself to Frank.
"See that low-down thief? See him, a cur who can even rob
the dead? That's your father!"



It was a terrible moment. It was a moment so painful
that no added word could have intensified its drama.



Nor was any word forthcoming. Hendrie smoked on.
His face was calm, his balance of restraint was quite undisturbed
before the hideous accusation.



One swift glance of Frank's blue eyes shot in his father's
direction, but, otherwise, he, too, continued to smoke his
pipe without a sign. He knew it was not for him to speak       yet.
Angus silently gritted his teeth. His astonishment
could not be doubted. Leyburn alone seemed to be affected.
He had lashed himself to a super-heat by his own words.



"Say," he cried, still addressing himself to Frank. "You
young skunk, I can thank you for all this       this that's happened
here. I find you, a jail-bird, coming straight from
the penitentiary, and I take you, make a man of you, and
this       this is the way you repay me. But I might have
known it would be. If ever there was a son of a rotten
father, you are he. The three of you've got me here. You
reckon I'm in your power. Guess none of you'd stop at
murder, if it suited you. I tell you unless you do it, and
do it quick, there's a long road ahead of us all, and we'll
travel it together, and I'll fight you every inch of the way."



Hendrie removed his cigar from between his lips.



"The boy's waiting for your yarn. The other'll keep for       later."



"Yes, you're right, Leo. Oh, you're right," Leyburn retorted
passionately. "It'll keep till later. Meanwhile I'll
get on with the story." He turned again to Frank. "You're
this man's bastard. You understand       his bastard. Twenty
years ago we were on the Yukon together              "



"Not together. We were both there," corrected Hendrie.



"Yes, we were both there. You were living with your
paramour       the woman Audie       this fellow's mother. I was
with my partner, Charlie. He was sick to death. We'd
got a big wad of gold from the creek, and because Charlie
was sick              "



"And you'd got enough gold to suit your purposes," put
in Hendrie quietly.



"We decided to return to civilization." Leyburn went on,
ignoring the interruption. "I hoped to get him cured."



"So you made him face the winter trail." Hendrie's addition
was made quite without passion.



"We set out down country with our dogs, and all our
goods, and gold, and got held up by a blizzard. We were
camped in a bluff. Charlie could not stand the weather.
He got so weak we couldn't travel. Then before we struck
camp he died. I didn't know he was dead, and I had gone
to gather firewood. Meanwhile, this man and your mother
made up their minds to return to civilization. He had a
big wad of gold. You were to be born before winter was out,
and your mother was scared to have you born up there. So
she made this man bring her down. She reckoned he was
honest, and would marry her. She reckoned like that because
she was a woman," he added, with burning contempt.



He waited for Hendrie's comment, which came promptly.



"She reckoned that way because she knew it was my purpose,"
he said coldly.



"But you didn't marry her, did you?" Leyburn cried
tauntingly.



"I didn't marry her because she was dead when I finally
found her whereabouts."



"But she did not die till after you deserted her," cried Leyburn,
with venomous triumph.



"Best go straight on with the story. You want the boy
to know it all       not in pieces." Hendrie went on smoking.



Leyburn turned to Frank again.



"And it's a pretty story," he assured him. "Listen. A
week after we started down the trail these two followed us
with a scout. They, too, got caught in the blizzard. They
got caught in the open. They were high up in the hills. An
accident happened. They lost their gold, dropped with a
lot of their baggage over a precipice. This man got mad.
He loved gold. He cared for nothing else. Your mother
was nothing beside it. She was just a burden. Finally
they made camp a few miles from us. After a while this
man saw our smoke in the distance. He stole out on the
excuse of fetching wood. He tramped to our camp. He
came there when I was away for wood and Charlie had just
died. Finding Charlie dead, and no one about, he stole our
gold, our dogs and sled, our provisions and blankets, and
hit the trail south, leaving your mother with the scout, and
me to walk back to their camp or starve. That's the man
who is your father. That's the man you've gone over to,
and sacrificed your pledges to humanity for. Do you understand
what you've done? Do you? You've helped this
criminal, this skunk of a man who dishonored your mother,
and left her and her unborn child on the long winter trail to
die, this thief, this ghoul who could rob the dead, and renounced
your most sacred pledges. By God, you are your
father's son!"



The scorn and hatred the man flung into his final charge
was far, far beyond the power of words.



He looked for its effect, waiting for Frank to take up his
challenge. But he remained disappointed.



"Well?" he urged, with gathering fury.



Still there was no answer in the darkened room.



But though he remained silent Frank's heart was beating
hard. A strange excitement was plunging wildly through
his veins. He felt that he wanted to reach out his strong
young hands and do hurt. He felt at that moment, and
during the moments he was hearkening to the venomous
story, aggravated by every hateful inflection that could
goad, that relief could only come in violence. And his desire
was to silence that hateful voice, and choke the story it
was telling back into the throat of the man telling it. It did
not hurt him to hear these things of his own father because
he was his father. They hurt him because they were on the
tongue of this man, who, from the bottom of his heart, he
had learned so to despise and hate.



Alexander Hendrie shot a sidelong glance into the boy's
face. It was a furtive glance, watchful and anxious. Then
his eyes returned to their dark brooding.



A moment later, as Frank made no response to the man's
challenge, Hendrie removed the cigar from his mouth.



"You stuck nearer the truth than I expected you would.
Maybe you knew it would be useless to do otherwise, seeing
I'm here to put you right," he said, in his deep, unruffled
tones. "Now              "



He broke off, and glanced quickly at the door as a sharp
knock made itself heard. Suddenly he held up his hand, as
though to enjoin silence, and, in a moment, his eyes lit with
a mingling of wild hope and abject fear.



The door opened and, silhouetted against the brilliantly
lit hall beyond, stood the slight figure of an elderly man with
iron gray hair.



Hendrie sprang to his feet and pressed the switch of the
electric light. Then he turned and faced Professor Hinkling
as the surgeon advanced into the room.



The little man came straight up to him with his hand out-stretched.
His clean-cut features were smiling, but he looked
tired and nervous.



"I think," he said deliberately, "we have turned the corner,
Mr. Hendrie. I have every reason to believe Mrs. Hendrie
will recover. The operation has been quite successful.
I shall remain with Dr. Fraser to watch the case for a few
days, but I have no fears of ultimate recovery. We were
only just in time. Another day." He held up his hands to
signify disaster, and the millionaire understood. "My best
congratulations, my dear sir. She should be about again in
less than a month."





The door closed on the retreating figure of the great surgeon.
For a moment Hendrie stood looking after him.
Then he abruptly turned and flung the end of his cigar into
the cuspidor beside his desk. Then he turned again, and his
eyes flashed round upon the three men who had remained
perfectly silent during the surgeon's brief visit. They were
different eyes now which finally settled upon the man who had
so recently heaped accusation and insult upon his head.
They were full of that great fighting spirit which they all
knew so well.



He strode up to Austin Leyburn, who sat watching him
speculatively, who was waiting for whatever development
was yet to come.



"Get up!" he cried, with a deep, underlying ferocity in
his voice and manner. "Get right up on to your hind legs.
You heard what he said? You heard?" He drew his right
hand from his coat pocket and produced a revolver. "If
his verdict had been otherwise you would never have left
this room. Every chamber of this gun is loaded, and each
bullet would have found its way into your rotten body. As
it is, you can go. You are free. Your car, and your man,
will meet you in Everton. Take my advice and get away
from this neighborhood without delay. When you are away
remember this. You can take what action you like for what
has happened here. I don't care a curse. But I'll warn you
right here and now, that you have committed criminal conspiracy
in playing the stock market, and when I give the
word, the machinery for prosecution will be set moving
against you. Further, I'd warn you that if one word of the
story you've told here to-night reaches the world outside,
that word will be given, and you'll pay as you never yet
guessed you'd ever pay for the luxury of a private revenge.
You get me? Now go! Go quick!"



Austin Leyburn was on his feet. The two men stood eye
to eye. With all his faults, the difference between them left
the balance absurdly in the millionaire's favor.



"Yes, I'll go. And I'll remember," cried Leyburn fiercely.
"You can shout now, but I'll remember everything. You
won't have to set that machinery in motion, but when the
time comes       and I'll be looking for that time all my life       you'll
find I have remembered everything, both for you and       your
bastard son."



As his last words leaped from between his clenched teeth
he moved swiftly across to the door. Hendrie shot a quick
glance at Angus, and the watchful Scot promptly followed
him out.



"It's a pretty story, Frank."



Hendrie's lips were smiling, but his eyes were half anxious,
half questioning.



"Guess it hasn't gained niceness from that feller," he went
on. "No," he added thoughtfully. "Nothing ever gained
in niceness from those lips. Tug never had pleasant ways.
Still, there it is       and              " In spite of himself his eyes were
wholly anxious now       "it's true, when you clean his tone
off it."



Frank rose from his chair and moved away across the
room. His movement seemed objectless, yet his father understood.
He knew that a great conflict was going on within
that silent heart, and he wondered.



But Leyburn's venomous manner of telling his, Hendrie's,
story had satisfied the millionaire. He preferred that his
son should know it from its worst possible aspect. That
was why he had forced it from the labor man's lips. He
desired no smoothing over of the roughnesses of his past
character. Certainly not for his own son's benefit. He was
determined that this boy should sit in judgment upon him
with his eyes wide open to all his shortcomings. He wanted
him to know his father as he was.



"I wanted him to tell Monica, too," Hendrie went on, after
a pause. "But she's not fit to hear it       yet. Now I'll have
to tell her myself. I shan't cover things up, anyway. There's
just one thing I want to add. It's right I should add it.
Leyburn didn't know it." He smiled. "Guess no one knew it
but me. I wanted the truth from him, so we'll have it all. I
want to tell you, after your mother got down to civilization
I spent most of Tug's gold trying to find her       to marry her.
It took me weeks and weeks. Then I found she was dead,
and you       I had lost you, too."



Frank turned round, and there was thankfulness and no
condemnation in the eyes that looked into his father's across
the room. Instantly Hendrie's face became set.



"Say," he cried quickly, "don't think I'm squealing.
Don't think I'm shuffling. These are just facts, same as the
others. Get a grip on things, boy. I'm wholly unrepentant
for the things I've done. Especially for       helping myself to
Tug's gold. I don't go back on anything I do. These things
were, and I       stand for them. There's just one other thing
I'd like you to know. I didn't know you were my son till I
set about getting you released from the penitentiary. I
learned that from Monica, when she told me about you. I
didn't tell her of my discovery       again this is the truth       because
I was scared to lose her love. You see, boy, there
are some things make cowards of us in spite of ourselves. I
told you that before.



"That's pretty well all. Maybe there's things you'd like
to know later, when you aren't feeling so hot about this.
Well, I'll be glad to tell you when you want to hear them.
I'm your father, boy, and Monica is your stepmother.
This is your home, same as any other place I own. You've
just to open your lips and say the word, and your share of
all I have is waiting for you       everything I have or       am.
You get that? It's all up to you. You're just as free as
you were before. Your own decision goes with me. I just
want you to get me clearly. I want you to understand all
that's in my head. You are my son, and I'm proud and
pleased about it. But       I bend the knee to no man       not
even to you       my son."



The man's curious dignity, his crude truth, and deliberate
honesty of purpose were superlative. Frank was looking
upon the man as he was, shorn of everything that could
hide, in however slight a degree, the rugged character that
was his, and he knew it.



This was the father whose violent youthful passions had
brought him into the world. This was the father who had
given him the breath of life which had borne him upon its
stormy bosom. This unrepentant sinner. This strong man
among strong men. This human creature so ready to err,
yet so full of human nature, was his father.



The knowledge somehow left him no sense of outrage. He
had neither resentment nor dislike. Only, in the back of his
simple mind, was a lurking admiration for one who had the
courage to talk as he had just talked, to do as he had just
done.



He drew a step nearer.



"Father," he said. Then he paused. After a moment he
repeated the word. "Father       it sounds queer to call you
'father,' doesn't it?"



The millionaire nodded. His eyes were smiling.



"Your ways may not be my ways," he went on. "I don't
know. Anyway, I fancy you just see things your own way,
and I mine. All that man said left me cold       except one
thing. He said you       deserted my mother. You've cleared
that up       and I'm glad. I'd sooner believe the truth from
you than from him. But I seem to have heard such a heap.
I seem to have lived through years this past week. I can't
just get that full grip you spoke of. Maybe I will after a
while. Still       there's a thing standing right out in my mind,
and       and I'm glad. Our Mon is going to get through.
God's been pretty good to us in that. She's going to live for
us both. Say, we had to fight hard       and it's good to fight       after
all. Since I've tasted what fighting means I seem to
understand some of your life, seem to understand something
of you. I'm glad we were to       gether in this. I think I'll
get out, and       just walk around. I       yes, I want to       think."



The millionaire remained where he was. He made no
movement. His eyes were on his son's face. He saw its
color come and go in the brilliant light of the room. His
halting speech told him far more than his words. He knew,
deep down in his heart, that all he desired, all he longed for,
was to be fulfilled.



He knew that in the midst of the threatening disaster that
had so long hung over him, when all the world, and the
powers of Fate had seemed to be working against him, not
only was the woman he loved to be restored to him, but he
was to find and recover his       son.



He nodded kindly.



"Yes, boy. I kind of know how you're feeling. Just get
around, and       sort things out," he said. "When you've
done, just round-up your Phyllis and tell her the things
you've heard. I'd like you to. After that, if you've the
notion, you can come right back to me."



Frank drew another step nearer. His father waited.



"Yes       father. I       think I will."



There was doubt and hesitation in the boy's words and
movements. Hendrie remained quite still. Suddenly Frank
turned away and walked toward the door. Half-way across
the room he paused again irresolutely. He glanced back.
The smiling eyes of his father caught his.



In a moment his indecision passed, and he strode back
quickly with long, firm strides.



As he drew near, his great right hand was thrust out.



"Won't       won't you shake hands, father?" he cried.



In an instant his hand was caught in a crushing grip.



"Why, yes, lad," cried Hendrie, a great light shining in
his eyes. "Say, this is just the greatest moment in my
life."






CHAPTER XXI



HENDRIE'S WAY



In spite of Professor Hinkling's best assurance, a month
of weary nursing and watching followed before Monica's recovery
became assured. The operation was absolutely successful,
but the patient herself obstinately refused to respond
to the skill that sought her complete recovery. It almost
seemed as though her recuperative powers had been completely
destroyed, for she lingered close to the border which
she had so nearly crossed, and Nature, generally so accommodating,
utterly refused to carry her away from it.



Thus it was that Professor Hinkling stayed on and on at
Deep Willows, puzzled and anxious. He sacrificed his great
practice to that one flickering life. He was even better than
his word, for he rarely ever left the house, and remained in
constant attendance.



Alexander Hendrie, a prey to every misgiving which his
love could inspire, watched these things with thankfulness
and gratitude to the man who could so generously bestow his
great skill. He was glad. Though he knew his debt to this
man was beyond the reach of mere wealth he was glad that it
was within his power to make a princely effort to repay.



Frank and Phyllis, too, found themselves well-nigh despairing.
Whenever Phyllis could drag herself from the
vicinity of the sick room, which no one but nurses and
doctors were permitted to enter, she spent her time at her
lover's side. Together they shared this weary trouble, as
they shared all things, buoying each other with words of
hope and confidence which had no stable foundations in their
minds. In Hendrie's presence they avoided the subject of
Monica's health altogether. It was enough for them to witness
his brooding eyes, with their gloomy, stormy look, which
was rarely absent from them now.



The reaction from his moment of buoyant hope, when he
had dismissed Austin Leyburn, was painful to all who observed
it. The man's heart was well-nigh breaking, and a
great dread filled his stormy brain. He could not rest.
Work       work was the only thing, and he set himself a pace
which human machinery could never hope to keep up. He
avoided everybody except Angus, and these two spent every
moment of their time in the repairing of the damage done by
the strikers to the farm.



They were full enough weeks for everybody. Events were
happening in almost every direction, the influence of which
was felt throughout the whole farming world.



The strike of farm hands had fallen utterly flat since Leyburn
had departed from Deep Willows, and the strikers had
discovered that harvesting was going on in every direction
without their aid. Instead of the employers being brought
to their knees as promised, they, the strikers at Deep Willows,
as a result of their own mischief, found themselves
without the prospect of work, and a winter yet to face.
When they attempted to gain employment on other farms,
they found themselves not required. Their plight was bad,
and, in very little time, they were glad enough to approach
Deep Willows, as Hendrie had prophesied, pretty well on
their knees.



Nor did they come in vain. In less than a week a hundred
plows, steam and horse, were at work burying the last signs
of recent destruction. But whatever Hendrie's feelings,
whatever his attitude toward these misguided creatures,
Angus Moraine's was unmistakable. He was a born martinet,
nor could he forget their wanton destruction of his beloved farm.



Then, too, within two weeks of Leyburn's release, a further
lightening of the labor horizon came. The significance of it
was lost to the general public. Quite suddenly the railroad
strike came to an end. The world was told that a compromise
had been effected between the men and the company.
Perhaps, too, the men were told this by their leaders.



Hendrie had his own ideas upon the subject, and Angus
Moraine shared them.



"There's only one thing for the gopher when the watch-dogs
get loose, Angus," the millionaire said, when he received
the confirmation of the rumor. "They need to hunt their
holes       quick."



Angus agreed, but his eyes only half smiled.



"Sure," he said.



"Leyburn's a pretty wise guy," Hendrie went on thoughtfully.
"Guess the bottom's dropped right out of his play.
It'll take him a while patching it. But he'll be on to a fresh
mischief later, and we'll need to keep a skinned eye. But I
guess it won't be playing stocks through labor strikes. Say,
he'll quit labor       after a while."



How true was Alexander Hendrie's surmise time soon
showed. Austin Leyburn did resign from his official capacity
in labor circles. And within a year he suddenly reappeared
in the financial world, which brought him under closer observation
by the wheat operator.



These events came, passed, and soon were relegated to the
mere memory of a stormy period, scarcely pleasant to dwell
upon. In the meantime Monica's retarded recovery occupied
every mind at Deep Willows. It was so wholly inexplicable.



One day, toward the end of the third week, Professor
Hinkling, who had taken a great fancy to Phyllis, opened
his heart to her upon the subject.



It was one morning. Phyllis was on the landing not far
from the door of the sick room. She was waiting, as was
her custom, for the surgeon's report. He had been with his
patient longer than usual and the girl was worried, and
more than usually depressed. All sorts of fancies had taken
hold of her imagination, and she feared a change for the very
worst. At last the door opened and she saw the man's slim
figure emerge.



He saw her, too. He knew she would be there. Now his
eyes had lost their usual cheerfulness. His brows were
knitted, and he looked troubled. He shook his head as he
came up.



"No improvement, my dear young lady," he said, in his
crisp way.



"None? None at all?" The girl's face fell.



The man shook his head again.



"It is       quite extraordinary," he said thoughtfully. "She
is comparatively young. I should say she was normally a       healthy
woman. The operation was absolutely successful.
She       she ought to be better       very much better. It almost
seems       as if she doesn't want to recover."



"Oh, but," the girl cried impulsively, and broke off. All
of a sudden the man's final remark became full of significance
to her woman's mind.



"But       what?" inquired the man, with his amiable smile.



"I       I don't know," declared Phyllis lamely.



The man shook his head.



"That won't do," he said kindly. "You       you were thinking
of something. Something suggested by my saying she
seemed not to want to recover." His keen eyes were searching
her strong, young face. "Listen, young lady," he went
on, after a pause, while the girl felt as though he were reading
her through and through. "We surgeons are frequently
up against psychological forces in our patients which not
infrequently undo all the good we attempt to do. Believe me,
a skillful operation often fails by reason of the antagonistic
forces I refer to. There is no physical reason that I can discover
why Mrs. Hendrie should not recover. Her history       the
history of her trouble       suggests that the psychological
side has been instrumental in bringing about her       deplorable
condition. I know no absolute facts, but I have reason to
believe that her mental attitude is such as to retard, even
destroy the chances of her recovery. Can you tell me? But
I know you can."



The girl suddenly clasped and unclasped her hands. Her
anxiety became almost painful. The waiting man saw that
he was on a hot scent, and, like the clever man he was, refrained
from pressing her.



Presently she looked up into his face with desperate eyes.



"Oh, Professor," she cried, "I've so       so wanted to say
something to you before. But I've       I've been scared to.
You see, a       a woman's so different from a man       and       Monica
is       is a woman."



"Quite so."



Phyllis saw the smile which accompanied the surgeon's
words, and her helpless groping suddenly passed. She stifled
her nervousness and spoke quickly.



"Yes, I know. I'm silly," she cried. "But       maybe no
one's told you. You see, it's not easy. Yes, Mrs. Hendrie's
trouble I think was largely brought on by grief."



"Ah."



"I can't       can't tell you what it was. It's       it's hers. I
have no right to tell it       even to you. Anyway," she went
on quickly, "that grief is still with her       I expect. But it
could be removed in       in a moment," she added quickly. "It
would be so simple       if the excitement were              "



The surgeon's eyes lit.



"Good girl," he cried, in his quietly cordial fashion.
"Now, how can the trouble be       removed?"



There was a quiet eagerness in the man's demand.



"Why       by letting Frank see her," Phyllis exclaimed. "By
letting him see her and tell her that he is here       living here       here
for good."



The man reached out, and taking one of the girl's hands
patted it gently.



"Good girl," he said. "Now, just run off and bring this       great
Frank. Tell him what you like, and then send him to
me. He shall see Mrs. Hendrie       alone. And trust me to
ask no questions. Maybe we shall find him a better doctor
than any of us. You can leave the       excitement to me."



So it came about that the long, dreary period of waiting
for improvement was suddenly brought to an end. Frank
was the first person, except the nurses, allowed into the sick
room, and he proved the tonic she needed.



That which passed between the two remained for them
alone, but the effect upon Monica was miraculous. Improvement
started from that moment, and Hinkling moved about
the house, his dark eyes shining with the assurance of
victory.



So, at last, bright days came again at Deep Willows. The
influence of Monica's sudden move forward toward recovery
was reflected in the entire household. Even Angus, austere,
"grouchy," felt it, for the millionaire and his incessant work
no longer obsessed him. Even he was glad of the breathing
space which the change in his employer's mood gave
him.



The news traveled like lightning, and, two days later,
when the great surgeon prepared for his long-delayed departure,
everybody in the neighborhood, everybody in the
house, down to the humblest capacity of service, knew that
the mistress of Deep Willows was marching down the broad
high road to health with no wavering or uncertain steps.



The millionaire accompanied the surgeon to Calford when
the day came for departure, and during the long run in the
automobile, in spite of his change of feelings, in spite of his
great thankfulness that he was leaving Monica behind him
basking in the companionship of the man and girl whom she
regarded with all the affection of a mother, he was unusually
silent.



The two men were lounging back in the open car. One,
at least, was reveling in the sweet fresh air of the prairie
lands as he sped upon the first stage of his journey back to
the crowded streets of the city to which he belonged.



"I think it will be best to give her a complete change," the
surgeon said, after a long, thoughtful silence. "When I say
complete I mean Europe, or travel about generally. Egypt,
Palestine. Even China, or Japan. Take her completely out
of herself, and every surrounding she's used to. There's
nothing like comfortable travel in easy stages for a woman
who's gone through what Mrs. Hendrie has."



"I'd thought of it," said the millionaire, settling himself
more deeply on the wide seat.



The surgeon smiled.



"Then put it into practice," he returned.



Hendrie nodded. He was gazing out ahead over the long
even trail. There was a grave look in his steady eyes.



"Say," he inquired, a moment later, "guess she's pretty
strong       now? No danger of a relapse?"



"None whatever       I should say."



The little man's eyes were surveying the other speculatively.



"I'm       glad," said Hendrie, with a heavy sigh. "None,
eh?"



"Humanly speaking       none."



Hendrie nodded with his eyes averted.



Presently he turned, and the two looked into each other's
eyes, as men will who understand each other.



"She's got to hear some       news," Hendrie said, in his
blunt fashion. "Likely it may knock her       hard."



The surgeon sat up.



"About that boy       Frank? Anything against him?"



Hendrie shook his head.



"No," he said. "It's       about me."



Professor Hinkling sat back in his seat with an assured
smile.



"That's all right," he said easily. "It's only that boy
matters       just now."





The evening sun was streaming in through the wide bow
window of the boudoir, lighting up the delicate shades of
color in the costly decorations with a suggestion of spring,
rather than the mature days of early autumn which were
already upon the world. There was hope in the aspect of
the room, hope in the brilliancy of the sunlight, hope, too,
engendered of the knowledge that here was no longer a sick
room, but a delightful harmonious resting place where convalescence
was to be converted into complete restoration to
health.



A large lounge filled the space beneath the window where
the patient might lie, or sit, drinking in the health-giving
fragrance of the pure prairie air; where the sight of the wide
blue heavens, with their robes of fleecy white, might well inspire
the desire for perfect health; where the golden sun in
all its glory might bathe the ailing body in its generous light,
and drive back the grim shadows of sickness to the realms
of darkness where they rightly belonged.



The room was littered with all those things which told of
kindly hearts and loving hands. This temporary imprisonment
must be made something more than tolerable. It must
be made a memory for after life to look back upon, not with
shuddering repulsion, but with delight at the thought of the
generous love striving to bring happiness once more into an
ailing life.



There were flowers, wonderful and rare; flowers which had
traveled leagues and leagues to bring their message of hope
of summer days to come, and delight the eye with their
wonders of delicate coloring, and ravish the senses with their
subtle fragrance. There were books, too, books full of life's
little romances to inspire that joy of thought and sympathy,
for others less blessed in a struggling world. Fruits, delicious
fruits from the most extravagant and luxurious corners
of the earth. A hundred and one things there were
waiting upon Monica's invalid whim, and, if need be, there
would be a hundred and one more. The wealth of one of the
world's rich men was at her feet. She was his idol. Nothing
should be denied. No desire of hers should remain unfulfilled,
if only it might contribute to the restoration of that perfect
health from which she had so long been separated.



Hendrie was with her now as she reclined upon the lounge.
She was still a shadow of her former self, but her eyes were
alight with a wonderful peace of mind, and the joy of living.
She was propped up with soft cushions, facing her husband,
who was leaning forward in his chair with his hands clasped
loosely, his elbows resting upon his parted knees.



He had been talking for a long time. He was still talking
in a voice that was unusually subdued and gentle. He was
carrying out his deliberate purpose to its last detail. He was
telling her the story of that past; that past so full of passionate
wrong-doing; so full of disgraceful, but strong manhood.
He had shirked none of it. By not one fraction did
he deviate from the bald truth, however ugly it might appear,
in whatever painful light it might discover him. By
not one touch of the brush of falsehood did he seek to gloss
over the harsh surface of his own ruthless acts. It was a
time when only truth could serve, and he had steeled his
heart to abide by the result.



Just as he had always been the unyielding man, driving
straight to the goal of purpose, so he was equally unyielding
to the temptation to screen himself, equally strong in his
frank self-accusing. He knew no middle course. There was
no middle course for him. Such did not exist.



He had brought his story down to the final details of the
recent happenings at Deep Willows.



"Mon," he said, gazing straight into the unwavering eyes
he loved, and speaking with gentle earnestness, "you must
judge me as you will. I tell you, cost me what it may, your
judgment goes. The things I have done, and been, may
seem unforgivable to you. It would surely be a miracle if
they did not. But before you sit in judgment on me you
must know all you have meant to my life. You must know
something of the depth of my love for you."



He thrust one hand into his coat pocket and withdrew the
revolver it had contained for so many weeks now.



"See this gun?" he went on. "It's loaded in every chamber.
No, don't be afraid, dear," he smiled as a look of
trouble crept into his wife's eyes. "I had no thought of
suicide. That is an act of cowardice; and, whatever my
shortcomings, I am not afraid to face trouble when it comes
along. But I want to let you see into my heart and mind,
and know the man I am. That gun was meant for Austin
Leyburn. The man I had wronged, and who was bent on
revenge. His vengeance meant nothing to me personally.
If he had succeeded in ruining me utterly I could still have
laughed at him       so long as I had you. But all unconsciously
he had made it possible that the help you needed, the help
that was to save your precious life to me, might not be
forthcoming. Had you died, I should have shot him dead.
Furthermore, I should have been glad that my hand had
crushed out his life. There is nothing more for me to say
now, dear," he went on, after a pause. "You know me now
as I am, or at least as I know myself to me. The future, my
future is in your hands."



He sat up and returned the ominous weapon to his pocket,
while Monica remained silent. Her eyes were no longer upon
him. Their lids were lowered to hide the thought so busy
behind them.



The man glanced at her. Illness had left its mark. Lines
of suffering had drawn themselves about the corners of her
beautiful mouth, where lines had not been before. Deep
shadows were gathered about her eyes, and the hollowed
cheeks displayed the ravages of ill-health.



But, even so, her beauty had in no wise departed. To
this man, at least, there was no difference from the superb
beauty once hers. It was the woman he loved, the soul and
mind. Those things which he felt no ravages of illness could
ever change.



He waited wordless. Of that which his heart might fear
he gave no sign. It was his way.



At last Monica sighed. Then her eyes were slowly raised,
and for one long, ardent moment she gazed upon the man
whose blemishes were so many and whose virtues were so few,
and yet whose manhood was far, far greater to her than
that of any other she had ever known. She saw in him that
wonderful thing which few women can look upon unmoved.
She saw courage and manhood, and she bowed her woman's
love of all the virtues to the instinct of her sex. She would
not, could not judge. Nature had created in her an ardent
woman's soul, full of the power of love, regardless of the
right and wrong of her feelings. She had loved this man,
and it was beyond her power to recall, or change those feelings.
So her words came, thrilling with gratitude and love
for the man who knew no other life than at her side.



"I'm glad, dear, so glad," she cried passionately. "Oh,"
she went on, with a ring of wonderful delight which carried
joy into the man's stormy heart, and set his every sense
thrilling, "I'm glad of it all. I'm glad I am here       you are
near me. I'm glad that this wonderful evening sun is shining,
and that my eyes can look upon it. I am glad that I am
breathing this fresh, pure air, and that God has seen fit to
let you drag me back from those dark and painful ways.
But more than all I am glad of you, Alec, glad that I can
reach out and touch you       so."



She thrust out one almost transparent hand, which was
seized and gently clasped in both her husband's.



"It is good, dear, to feel your great, strong, warm hands
in mine. It is good to know they are always with me, ready
to fight for me, ready to caress me. Lift me up, dear       so."



The man reached out and supported her frail body, so
that her fair head rested against his shoulder as he drew her
to him.



"So, yes, it is good to have you with me," she went on
happily. "Now kiss me, dear; kiss me, and tell me that the
shadows are all gone by, that never again, so long as we live,
shall we let others replace them. So       yes." She sighed
in perfect contentment and happiness. "God has been very
good to us       far, far better than either of us deserve."



So there fell a wonderful, perfect silence upon the room.
The great sun beyond the window lolled heavily to his rest,
and the shadows grew out of the remoter corners of the room.
Peace seemed to reign everywhere; a wonderful, perfect
peace.



And after a while, a long, long while it seemed, the
woman stirred in her husband's arms. Presently she
looked up.



Her happy, wandering gaze had drifted to the window
and beyond. There, in the darkening shadows of the skeleton
woodlands, she beheld two figures strolling idly, hand in
hand. The growing twilight left them clearly outlined
against the blackened trees. The man's great figure towered
over the slim woman by his side, who was still by no means
dwarfed. Monica thrilled with delight as she beheld them.
They were those whom she loved best in the world, next to
this man at her side.



"Look, Alec," she cried. "Look there. They, too, have
at last found perfect happiness. Soon       soon they will be
launching their little craft upon the world's troubled waters.
Soon they, too, will know the real meaning of life. We have
learned together, dear, haven't we? And now       now we can
sit by, and watch them, and help them launch their little
boat. Beyond that we cannot go. Theirs it is to set their
course and keep it. Theirs it is to put their hands to the
tiller and weather every storm. And they are many       very,
very, many, even for the most fortunate. God be with
them."



The man was watching the idly wandering lovers with eyes
of deep affection.



"He's a good boy," he said, in a tone that was full of
paternal pride. "There's no bad streak in him, as there is
in              " He sighed. "I'm glad of it. I want to wonder
when I think what he's suffered at my hands. And after all
these years he's come to me. It's good, Mon. It's good to
think of.



"Yes," he went on, after a pause, "and what a girl for any
man. I feel glad, so glad, I don't just know how to speak it.
But I can do a lot. Say, when it comes to launching that
boat, I don't guess they need to lay a hand to it. That's
right up to me."



Monica gazed up into his strong face. Emotion was
working behind that wonderful mask. She knew. But she
would not let him know that she could read so deeply.



"How       how, shall you help to       launch that boat, dear?"
she asked gently.



The man smiled, and his eyes were shining with generous
impulse.



"How? Why, he comes into my business on a half share.
You see, he's in my life on a half share already."



Monica's eyes thanked him. He wanted no words.



"And       little Phyllis       Phyl?" she asked with a tender inflection
on the familiar abbreviation.



The man's smile broadened.



"Why, Phyl?" he cried. "For Phyl, whatever you say
goes. Guess I'd like to hand her the house in Winnipeg as a
present       on my own       though. She's just worth       everything."



Monica nodded.



"We have many debts to pay," she said. "There's that
other, too."



"Other?" For a moment Hendrie looked at her in some
doubt. Then he smiled again. "Ah       you mean       Angus."



"Yes, your beloved       Angus."



There was a note of gentle raillery in Monica's reply.



The man nodded.



"Sure," he said, with unmistakable conviction. Then he
added: "The thing he's yearning for is this farm. He's just
loved it years. Guess my attorney's fixing it over to him       right
now."



The man's prodigal generosity left Monica speechless.



"He's worth it," he went on. "He's worth all I can do."
Then he smiled. "You see, he's a feller whose rough exterior
conceals a deal of what's worth while."



The woman's eyes were again turned toward the window,
and the two figures beyond it. Their magnetism was irresistible.



"Those who possess most of       what is really worth while,
often contrive to hide it under an exterior of denial," she
said. Then, as an afterthought. "It's       it's the way of the
strong."



The man agreed and his smile was almost humorous.



"Guess the strong folks often find themselves mighty
short of the more       delicate virtues," he said, with a laugh.
"Seems a pity       eh, Mon? Guess if things weren't that way,
we'd be having a world full of perfect men, hopping around
like rabbits, and chasing glory by the light of their own
halos."



Monica laughed, too, and finally smiled up into his face as
she nestled closer to him.



"I don't think halos are becoming       anyway," she said.
"I'm glad you don't wear       a halo."

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
