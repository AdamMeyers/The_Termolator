<p class="first">&ldquo;Neither can men hear the voice of the cattle;
both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled, they are
gone.&rdquo; The forests are silent, over hill and dale hangs a black
pall; beast and bird are in hiding; the voices are hushed. But before
they have disappeared, following in the track of others, I have
endeavoured to catch the hum of the bee, the twitter of the bird, the
chirp of the cricket, the song of the dying swan, and all the tales
which beasts and birds and little beetles tell their young before they
go to sleep ere the flash of the glow-worm flits across the darkness of
the forest.</p>
<p>I have followed up to their lairs the ferocious wolf, the
cantankerous dog, the sly fox and the wise hedgehog, have listened to
the lark and to the nightingale, and paid homage to little king wren.
Who knows how much longer they will disport themselves in the fields
and forests of Rumania, where the hoofs of the horses, the feet of the
marching men, the shout of battle and the thunder of the guns have
silenced&mdash;let us hope only for a while&mdash;the voice of the dumb
creatures, who still speak so eloquently to him who knows their
language and understands the cunning spell of their hidden wisdom. It
is as if I had gathered flowers from the field of the Rumanian popular
imagination. They are fresh from the field, and the dew still hangs
upon them like so many diamonds, flashing in the light of popular
poetry; nay, sometimes a few specks of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e230" href="#xd21e230" name="xd21e230">viii</a>]</span>the
original soil are still clinging to the roots. I have not pressed them
between the leaves of this book. I have handled them tenderly. It has
been a work of love, the dreamy fancies of youth, the solace of maturer
age. Peradventure one or the other may be taken out and planted anew in
the nurseries of the West, where they may blossom and grow afresh. They
might bring with them the breath of the open field, the perfume of the
forest. They might conjure up the time when the nations were still
young and lived in the great Nursery of Nature. If one could only bring
to the nations of the West for awhile a glimpse of the time of their
youth! In my wanderings through these enchanted fields I have tried to
find whence the seeds have come, whose hands have sown them, and what
spiritual wind and weather have fostered their growth, whether the rain
of heaven or the fountains of the deep have watered the roots, what sun
has shone upon them, what fiery blast has made these flowers wither and
die.</p>
<p>Such as they are, then, they are offered in love to the English
people.</p>
<p>I have to thank Mr. S. L. Bensusan, who in true friendship, with
admirable skill and with untiring zeal has helped me to remove the
boulders, to level the ground, to plan the beds and to trim the edges;
Miss C. S. Burne, whose keen sympathy, unerring eye and deft hand have
helped to weed the tares and group the flowers; my son Vivian, who with
loving care and gentle touch has brushed away the dead leaves that had
fallen on the green sward, and last, but not least, the Folk-Lore
Society, which has granted me a niche in its great Pantheon. It is
indeed no small honour to be in the company of the gods.</p>

<p class="first">The Rumanian animal tales, which appear here for the
first time outside Rumania, are so weird, so different from any known
to the folk-lore of the West, that they arrest our attention and invite
close examination. They are, for the most part, not only beautiful in
themselves, but by reason of a peculiar flight of fancy and a powerful
imagination are so unlike anything known in other collections of
folk-lore that they raise problems far reaching, and, I venture to
think, of the highest importance to the study of popular literature. We
are moving in a religious atmosphere. Many of the tales start, as it
were, from the beginning of creation. God, the Apostles, the Evil One
seem to take a hand in the work and to rejoice more or less in the
labour of their hands. We have, besides, animal fables pure and simple,
tales designed for enjoyment, tales of fancy in which the nimble and
small creatures outwit the burly and heavy ones. We have also fairy
tales like those known to us in the West and made familiar to us by
numerous collections. A prominent characteristic is the childlike
simplicity of all the stories, the absence of any dualistic element. No
&ldquo;moral&rdquo; has been tacked on to these tales, and probably
they were not even intended to teach one. The questions which the study
of folk-lore has raised, whether anthropological, psychological, or
historical will be raised with a renewed force. I shall endeavour,
however briefly, to deal with some of the problems in the light which
this collection of Rumanian tales is able to shed upon the study of
folk-lore. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>The anthropological, historical and psychological problems
underlying our studies must be attacked&mdash;I venture to
think&mdash;from a fresh point of view. The view I hold is that the
European nations form one spiritual unit, and that within that unit the
various degrees of development through which one or the other has
passed are still preserved. I believe that we must study the
manifestations of the human spirit from a geographical angle of vision,
that this development has spread <i>directly</i> from one group of men
to another, and that, before going to the extreme ends of the earth for
doubtful clues, we must first try to find them, and perhaps we shall
succeed in finding them more easily and satisfactorily, among some of
the European nations whose folk-lore has not yet been sufficiently
investigated. We can find in Europe various stages of
&ldquo;culture,&rdquo; and these we must trace by slow descent to the
lowest rung of the ladder. At a certain stage of our descent we may
strike the stratum of Asiatic folk-lore which may lead us further in
our comparative study. Let me give some practical examples of my
meaning. The relation between man and animal has been the subject of
numerous highly speculative but none the less extremely interesting and
acute investigations. We have had Totemism, we have had Animism and
many other explanations, which by their number became simply
bewildering. Students have gone to the Bushmen of Australia, and to the
Red Indians of America for parallels and explanations, or for proofs of
their highly ingenious theories. But are there no animal and bird
stories in Europe which would show us how, to this day, the people
understand the relations between man and other living creatures, what
views they hold of birds and beasts and insects? Are the animals
humanised&mdash;using the word in the sense of impersonating a human
being? Do the people see any fundamental difference between the created
things? In the fairy tale, at any rate, no such definite clear-cut
distinction between man and animal can be discerned.</p>
<p>But at the root of many anthropological myths the animal is only a
disguised human being. The worth of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>Rumanian stories&mdash;culled
as they are from the mouth of the people&mdash;is their ability to show
how to this very day the people look upon the animal world. Perhaps
another view will ultimately find its way among the students of
folk-lore. What I am anxious to emphasise is the fact that there are,
for the investigation of folk-lore students, mines of untold wealth
that have hitherto not been sufficiently worked.</p>
<p>These tales represent one or more of the earlier stages of European
folk-lore. The elements, not yet quite closely moulded together, allow
us at times to lay bare the sources and thus trace the inner history of
this part of folk-lore. The people are confronted by a world filled
with weird and mysterious animals, birds, insects, each with their own
peculiarities to invite question.</p>
<p>Almost everything that is not of daily occurrence excites the
people&rsquo;s curiosity, and they ask for an explanation of it; where
does this or that animal come from, and why has it this or that
peculiarity in its habits, colours, form and other matters? They are
very grateful for instruction. But it must be of a kind adapted to
their understanding. It must be plausible, even if it puts some strain
on their imagination. The more wonderful and weird that explanation,
the more easily it is accepted by the people, and the more firmly is it
believed. This question of &ldquo;belief&rdquo; has often been raised
in connection with fairy tales. It is asked whether the people believe
in the existence of fairies, monsters, marvellous and wonder-working
animals, in short, in all the mechanism of the fairy tale.</p>
<p>To this an unhesitating answer can be given in so far as these
Rumanian tales and legends are concerned. They are believed in
implicitly. They form an integral part&mdash;I feel almost inclined to
say they form an exclusive part&mdash;of the popular religious beliefs
of the folk. The people are neither too squeamish, nor too sophistical
in their faith, nor do they enquire too closely into the dogmatic
character of such beliefs or into the sources from which they have
come. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the East too the people, as a rule, are good-natured, and a good
story remains a good story, whether told by a believer or an
infidel.</p>
<p>The study of these tales promises to exceed by far in interest the
study of mere &ldquo;fairy tales.&rdquo; We are moving in a spiritual
world, which appears to be much more primitive in the animal tale than
in the fairy tale. We are getting much nearer to the very soul of the
people, to its power of imagination and abstraction. We can see more
clearly the manner of its working.</p>
<p>The comparative study of fairy lore has led to the surprising
recognition of the world-wide range of these tales. In spite of
investigations carried on for close upon a century, no satisfactory
solution has yet been found which would explain the appearance of one
and the same fairy tale at such widely separate parts of the world as
India and England. Various answers have been advanced in order to
explain this surprising similarity. And the same problem arises here.
This collection of tales, as already mentioned, contains two groups.
The larger group consists of the legend or creation stories&mdash;in
which, however, one section contains fairy tales though used also as
creation stories&mdash;and the other group consists of fables pure and
simple. It would be unscientific, I hold, to treat these groups on one
plane as if they were all contemporary in their origin. They may
represent various degrees either of local evolution, and if so, that
may be found to be the best solution, or they may have come in various
stages of transmission. The theory of migration has been applied
hitherto to the fairy tale. I am not aware that the history of the
popular fable has been attempted, still less that of the creation
legends, which have remained almost unknown until quite recently. I
will deal with each of these groups as far as possible separately, and
the conclusions drawn from each group will afterwards be merged into
one final conclusion established by the fact of their actual presence
in Rumanian popular lore.</p>
<p>Migration, no doubt, offers the best solution of the riddle set by
the fairy tale. No one, unless he solves the riddle of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>the heroine
in the fairy tale, can win her. But still the opinion of scholars is
divided. The mistake, I venture to think, has been that all the tales
called by this title, and even culled from the mouth of the people,
have been treated on one general principle, without recognising the
possibility that there may be divers layers, some older, some of a more
recent date. This probability seems to have been entirely overlooked.
That which holds good for one cycle need not hold equally good for
<i>all</i> the rest. But the question of the central origin of tales
must not be confused with that of their transmission. Thus a tale may
originate in India or Egypt, but once it has started on a journey of
its own it will be carried, chiefly by word of mouth, from country to
country. And as its structure is loose, a mere framework with a very
simple plot, it will assimilate other elements and undergo those
manifold changes, the investigation of which is the delight and despair
of the folk-lorist.</p>
<p>We are now faced by a new set of stories, some of which are mere
tales, while others are of a more legendary character. I class under
the latter heading all those in which the religious element stands out
prominently. They have assumed their actual form no doubt probably
under the powerful sway of some religious influence. The peculiar shade
of religious teaching which has moulded the actual form of these
legendary stories, and which is of decisive importance in our
investigation, will be discussed more fully later on, after we have
been able to dispose of other solutions offered by the explanation of
the origin of these tales. It will then be possible to approach the
question of the fairy tales from the coign of vantage gained.</p>
<p>Within this class of tales there are some in which the legendary
character is not so pronounced, where the tale is intended to explain
certain peculiarities of animals. These seem to be of so primitive a
character that the closest parallels can only be found among primitive
nations. Here a new problem sets in&mdash;the problem of origins. For
curiously enough a striking similarity cannot be denied to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>Rumanian, Indian, African and possibly American
tales. But the similarity is only in the aim. The other nations ask
precisely the same questions about the animals with which they are
familiar, and they endeavour to give an answer to their query. The
parallelism is in the question. Are we, then, to treat these tales in
the same manner as the &ldquo;fairy tales&rdquo; and account for that
similarity in the same manner as that of fairy tales gathered from
distant regions? Or, in other words, have we here another set of tales
which have been carried chiefly by word of mouth from one country to
another? Are these stories also new witnesses to the process of
&ldquo;migration&rdquo;? And are we, then, to assume that this theory
of migration should be applied to these animal tales, as it has been to
the fairy tale? Or, are we to assume that the unity of the human soul
works on parallel lines in divers countries among divers nations not
otherwise connected with one another? If not, how is this similarity to
be explained? True, the parallelism between Rumanian and Indian tales
is not so close as it is between the &ldquo;fairy tales.&rdquo; For the
animals are often not the same. They are everywhere local beasts. This
change in the animals chosen may be due to different circumstances and
local assimilation. It is quite natural that for a tiger and jackal, a
wolf and a fox might have been substituted when the animal tale reached
Europe, for the tale had to be localised in order to preserve its
interest in a new atmosphere. One need not go very far to find the same
change taking place even in written literature. The jackals in the
frame story of the Panchatantra become &ldquo;foxes&rdquo; in Kalila Wa
Dimna in the European versions. Or, to take another example, in the
famous parable of the &ldquo;man in the pit&rdquo; in the Barlaam
Josaphat legend the furious elephant becomes a camel, however
incongruous the substitution may appear. If such changes could take
place in the written literature in which the incidents are fixed, how
much more easily could it take place when a story is carried only by
word of mouth? Then the substitution of a familiar animal for one
unknown would be quite natural. The people want to know the reason
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>for the peculiarities of those animals that they
know. They are not likely to care much for unknown fauna. Unless those
other animals are of a purely mythical and fantastical character, and
as <i>such</i> appeal to the universal imagination, there is no room in
the popular mythology for animals of foreign countries.</p>
<p>If, then, we admit that these animal fables have been brought to
Europe in the same manner as the fairy tales, by means of oral
transmission, then they have preserved their original character and
their primitive form less modified than has happened in the case of the
fairy tale, for reasons which would have to be explained. The only
other suggestion is that these legends and animal tales are of a local
origin, the product of the poetical imagination of the Rumanian
peasant, and as such quite independent of any other source. If this is
not acceptable we must admit a continuous stream of popular tradition,
setting in at a time not yet determined and spreading from East to West
or from South to North, the direction of the stream having been
determined by the presumable centre of origin in Asia, before or
contemporary with the spread of the real fairy tales.</p>
<p>But, it might be argued, as has been also done in the case of the
fairy tales, that these stories are the product of individual efforts
of local myth-makers and popular poets, that they are purely indigenous
in origin. One cannot deny that the people could invent such stories.
Some one must have invented them, and why could they not have been
invented by the Rumanian peasant independently of the Indian story
teller?</p>
<p>The cosmogonic setting invalidates this suggestion. Such a setting
presupposes a definite set of ideas about the beginnings of things
which are neither spontaneous nor indigenous. All that can be said is
that, once the impulse had been given, the imagination of the people
followed the lead and worked in its own way on the given lines. This is
the general trend of real popular lore. Each nation mints in its own
fashion the gold brought from elsewhere, and places its own imprint
upon it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>This view I find myself unable to accept. It could be entertained
only and solely if no parallels whatsoever could be found anywhere to
some at least of the more important and characteristic creation tales,
fairy tales and fables.</p>
<p>The question then remains, Where do these tales come from? Are they
indeed the expression of the primitive mind, and if so, have we to
recognise these specific Rumanian beast tales as so many indigenous
products of the primitive Rumanian mind?</p>
<p>Tylor, in his <i>Primitive Culture</i> (i. 3 ed. 410 ff.), discusses
at some length the beast tales found among primitive peoples, tales
that as yet are not the excuse for a moral and have not been reduced to
the background of an allegory. He takes his examples from the North
Indians of America, from the Kamtchadals of Kamtchatka and from the
inhabitants of Guinea. These stories are thus, as it were, the
primitive expression of the myth-making imagination of peoples in which
the animal stands in as close a relation as any human being. Be this as
it may, the conclusions drawn by Tylor rest on this evidence gathered
only from so-called dark ages. He is not aware of any such tales among
the nations of Europe, who certainly cannot be classed among the
primitive peoples. And on the other hand he is fully alive to the fact
that a number of such beast tales have been worked up in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries in the famous epic of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>.</p>
<p>The question arises, Whence came some of the incidents believed to
be more ancient? They lead us straight to the supposition that such
animal tales in a primitive form must have existed among the peoples of
Europe, even as far west as Flanders and France. They were afterwards
woven into one consecutive narrative, conceived in a spirit of satire
on existing social and clerical conditions. A &ldquo;moral&rdquo; has
thus been introduced into a set of more ancient tales. But of this
anon. In view of these Rumanian tales we can no longer be content to
leave the question of the compilation of <i>Reynard</i> where Tylor has
left it. The new materials now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=
"#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>at our disposal allow us to follow it
much further and to arrive at conclusions differing from those of
Tylor. From the moment that we find in Europe similar beast tales to
those found among primitive peoples in other parts of the world, we are
confronted by a new problem. We may recognise the same spiritual agency
at work: we may see the same action of the mind, asking everywhere for
an explanation of the phenomena from beast and bird, from sky and sea.
Thus far the minds of all the nations run on parallel lines. The
differentiation begins with the answer, and here, then, the problem
sets in. How many nations give the same answer, and in so doing form,
as it were, a group by themselves? How old is this or that answer or
the tale that contains it? And what is the form in which it is given?
Is it a fable or has it a religious colouring? In endeavouring to reply
to these queries we find ourselves face to face with the problems of
indigenous character, primitive origin, independent evolution and
question of survival. We are thus brought face to face with yet another
theory&mdash;the theory of survivals&mdash;the most important of all,
which sways the trend of the study of modern folk-lore. I must deal
with it here at some greater length. I mean, of course, the theory that
sees in every manifestation of the popular spirit, in every story, in
every ballad or song, a survival from hoary antiquity, a remnant of
prehistoric times, to which the people have clung with a marvellous
tenacity, although they have entirely forgotten its meaning. Out of an
unconscious antiquarian weakness they are supposed to have preserved
every fossil even if and when it had become burdensome to them. But it
must not be forgotten that the people retain only those practices and
beliefs by means of which they hope to obtain health, wealth and power,
and they will take care not to jeopardise such benefits by any neglect.
So long as these results are expected, the people will cling
tenaciously to the beliefs which promise them the greater gifts. It is
not impossible that such beliefs, being too deeply rooted, might
survive local political changes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>But in order to survive, two conditions are essential, continuity of
place and continuity of ethnical unity. The religious continuity is
also an important condition, though not by any means so essential. The
clash of two or more religious doctrines causes on the one hand the
destruction of the official system of religious ceremonies and
practices, and on the other drives to the bottom that mass of
ceremonies from the observance of which benefits to health and wealth
are expected. In the moment when the belief in their efficacy has gone
they disappear without leaving a trace. Very little, if anything,
survives. It is a fallacy to believe, as is now the fashion, that
without such continuity any real survival can take place. This theory
has been carried to extreme lengths, without the slightest
justification. It all rests on finely spun hypotheses in which time and
space have entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>No connecting link has been brought forward to bind the present to
the past. However plausible some aspects of the &ldquo;vegetation
god&rdquo; may appear, one must remember the essential fact, that there
is now not a single nation in Europe living on the soil where such
practices as the slaying of an annual king god has been practised, if,
indeed, they have ever been practised, beyond a very strictly limited
area in Asia Minor and possibly in Sicily or Italy. With whom could
such practices survive, for example, in Bulgaria or even in Thrace? It
is known that the population there has changed its character many
times, even within the last eight hundred years. There is such a medley
of races, some old, some new, that it would be impossible to expect
survivals from the Pelasgian or Dacian past. Nor would they have
anything in common. The Rumanians of Latin origin are certainly not the
oldest inhabitants of Rumania. If, then, each of these ethnical unities
had separate practices or, to come nearer to our subject, separate
tales and stories marked with its own individuality, it might perhaps
be argued that these stories and popular beliefs are survivals from
prehistoric times, remnants of a past long forgotten, embodying a
folk-lore and popular psychology which date back to remote antiquity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>None of these nations, and, in fact, none of the
modern nations of Europe, reach back to any extreme antiquity, nor are
they homogeneous in their ethnical character nor the descendants of the
autochthonous inhabitants. There may be a few rare strains of other
blood in the modern admixture, but not of any decisive character,
certainly it is not strong enough to have preserved any survivals.</p>
<p>True, many of the modern practices are no more of yesterday than
these tales and stories are, but again, they are certainly not so old
as a modern school of thought endeavours to make out. Comparatively
modern nations, often alien to the soil which they inhabit, none of
them of a pure unmixed origin, cannot have retained beliefs, tales,
etc., of which their forefathers knew nothing. They could not have laid
stress on things which had disappeared with the nations whom their
successors or victors had destroyed. If, then, we find that these
nations of diverse origins and of diverse times possess a certain stock
of folk-lore in common, it follows naturally that they must have
obtained it in common at a certain definite period, when in spite of
their ethnical and possibly political differences they were all
subjected together to one pervading influence. A great spiritual force
moulded them at one and the same time, and this produced one common
result, which, in spite of its genetic unity, would have allowed a
certain latitude for individual development. If, as I assume, it was
the all-pervading influence of religious sects which stretched from far
East to extreme West and embraced all the cultured nations of Europe,
impressing them with the same seal&mdash;a certain popularly modified
Christianity embellished with legends and tales appealing to the
imagination, containing a strong didactic and ethical strain,
propounding a new solution of the world&rsquo;s problem suited to the
understanding of the people, accounting satisfactorily for the evil in
the world, warding off the effects of these spirits of evil&mdash;then
it is small wonder that their teaching sunk deeper into the heart of
the people and brought about that surprising spiritual unification in
the religion of the masses which survives in folk-lore. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>They would thus date from more or less the same period, when the
whole of Europe felt the influence of teachings which lasted two to
three centuries at least, quite long enough to leave indelible
traces.</p>
<p>It is not to be denied that among these tales some may belong to an
anterior period. The newer facts had in some cases been grafted on
older ones. Some remnants of ancient myths had survived the first
process of forcible Christianisation. But only there where ancient
paganism can be shown to have flourished when this new wave of
proselytism set in, only there might one be able to discover such
traces. These are the local incidents, the local colouring, which give
to each tale its own popular character without changing its substance.
Such process of assimilation is akin to the other before mentioned,
viz. the substitution of the European fauna for Asiatic or Indian
animals. Though references to ancient Greek myths occur in these
stories, yet in spite of that the Rumanian versions approximate more
closely to the later Byzantine than the ancient classical forms. The
transformation sets in practically where the Middle Ages part from
antiquity. Here is yet another proof for the more recent phase of this
popular literature.</p>
<p>A grave danger threatens the scientific character of folk-lore, if a
wrong method of investigation be persisted in much longer. I refer to
the system of haphazard comparisons arising out of the view that
everything done and every rite kept by the folk must of necessity be a
survival from extreme antiquity and belong to a period anterior to our
modern civilization&mdash;a fossil from the age of man&rsquo;s
childhood embedded in layers of more recent date. For proof of this
theory parallels are sought and found among primitive nations, or those
who we believe have not yet left the rude stage of primitive culture.
If, then, something is found among them which resembles closely or
remotely any of the customs, tales, and beliefs, in our own midst, we
are convinced that these customs, tales or beliefs are really remnants
of an older stage, through which the modern nations have passed before
they reached the present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>stage of development, and which they
have cherished and kept unchanged throughout the ages. The history of
comparative philology offers the best analogy for the demonstration of
the futility of such reasoning. Nothing contributed so much to make the
study of comparative philology a laughing-stock as this endeavour to
build up theories of the origin of the language on such arbitrary
foundations.</p>
<p>How deceptive such haphazard similarities can be is best
demonstrated by the endeavours to derive all the European languages
from the Hebrew. This was believed to have been the original language
which Adam spoke. Nothing more natural, then, than to trace all the
languages back to the Hebrew, which moreover was a holy language. Much
ingenuity and immense learning were spent&mdash;nay wasted&mdash;for
centuries in this undertaking. The most trifling incident, the most
superficial identity in sound or meaning was looked upon as complete
evidence. It has taken close upon half a century to demolish this
fabric of philological fallacy, and to place comparative philology on a
sound basis. We know now that similarities in different languages may
be the result of independent evolution.</p>
<p>The similarities are often quite superficial. No one would, for
example, compare a modern English word with an old Latin or Greek stem
or with any archaic dialect of these languages, without showing the
gradual development of our modern word. He would take it back step by
step, and then compare the oldest English form with a contemporary
form. Most of the European languages, as we now see, are derived from
one common stock, more archaic than any of them. No one would now trace
a French word directly to that old Indo-European root, without going
first to the Latin; and so with every other language belonging to the
same group. Each nation has put the seal of its own individuality on
its language, which it has moulded and shaped according to its own
physiological and psychical faculties. The one will have retained more
primitive forms; for example, local and historical as well as ethnical
continuity have kept the Italian much closer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>to the
Latin than Spanish or Portuguese. No one dreams to-day of reducing a
French word to a Hebrew root, despite any similarity of form which they
might have in common.</p>
<p>We can go now one step further and suggest a common origin for the
Indo-European and Semitic groups of languages, a unity which lies
beyond the time of their separation, and it is the dream and aim of
comparative philology to attain this goal.</p>
<p>Returning now to our science of folk-lore, we have a perfect analogy
in the study of comparative philology briefly sketched above. The
analogy is so complete that it is almost unnecessary to elaborate it in
detail. It is obvious that safety and scholarship lie in the following
line of investigation. A European group of folk-lore must first be
established, and the dependence on an earlier common stock
demonstrated. But the historical connection stands foremost, and the
fixing, more or less definitely, of the time of its appearance in the
form in which it now exists. In adopting this line of investigation, it
will then become unscientific to postulate early survivals for elements
that may date from a comparatively recent period, and for which an
explanation can be found by this historical and comparative study. And
just as it has happened in the case of the study of comparative
philology, so it will happen that we shall be in a much better position
to separate and to appreciate the individual character of the folk-lore
of each nation, the form which the common stock assumes under the
psychical and cultural conditions which characterise its spiritual
life. This method will give us also the key to the ethno-psychology,
the ultimate aim and goal of folk-lore studies. No doubt some higher
unity may possibly emerge out of this historical investigation, for
which again the study of comparative philology offers us the best
parallel. Separate groups may be formed of European and Asiatic
folk-lore. The artificial geographical division need not form the
separating barrier either in folk-lore, or, as has been proved, in the
study of language. But to continue the method of haphazard parallelism
and indiscriminate comparison <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>between old and new will be
indefensible. It will be found that even in the so-called immutable
East continual changes have taken place which do not allow us to assume
favourable conditions of continuity and &ldquo;survivals.&rdquo; Still
less is this the case with the peoples who concern us more directly,
the inhabitants of the south-eastern part of Europe. One has only to
cast a glance at the medley of nationalities inhabiting the Balkan
Peninsula and the neighbourhood to realise the profound differences of
faith, origin and language of Greeks and Albanians, Slavs and
Rumanians, Hungarians and Saxons, and one is forced to the conclusion
that whatever these may possess in common is not a survival from olden
times, but must have come to them at a time when they were all living
together in that part of Europe, subject to one common influence strong
enough to leave an indelible impression on their imagination.</p>
<p>This result is unavoidable if we remember also the past history of
these countries. They have been swept over by nations, one more
barbarous than another, one more ruthless than another, and none
remaining there long enough to become a decisive factor in the
formation of the existing nationalities. Dacians and Pelasgians, Romans
and Goths, Petchenegs and Cumans, Alans and Huns, Tartars and
Hungarians, Bulgars, Slavs and Turks have succeeded one another with
great rapidity, not to mention the numerous colonies of Armenians,
Syrians and Gipsies planted in the heart of the Byzantine Empire by the
foreign rulers on the throne of Byzantium. It would be a sheer miracle
if anything of ancient times could have survived. Assuming even the
theoretical possibility of such a miracle&mdash;and those who hold
strongly to such a theory of unqualified survivals evidently do believe
in such miracles&mdash;even then it will remain to be shown, with whom
these ancient beliefs and tales originated and survived. The romantic
legend may have, and practically has, been forgotten in its entirety.
Out of one of the episodes have grown the popular Rumanian poems of the
Wanderer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>If folk-lore is to become an exact science I venture to think that
the problem of survivals will have to undergo a serious re-examination.
We shall have to revise our views and try to define more precisely the
method according to which we ought to label certain practices, customs
and tales as survivals, and also to determine the period to which such
survivals may be ascribed. A primary condition consists in establishing
historical continuity and ethnical unity.</p>
<p>If nations of diverse origin and of different ages possess the same
tales and practices, it follows that this common property cannot be a
survival, but each must have received all these at a certain fixed date
simultaneously, quite independent of their own ethnical or historical
and local past. All of them must have been standing under one and the
same levelling influence. This new influence may have brought with it
some older elements belonging to different traditions and to a
different past, and introduced them among these nations, as in the case
of the Barlaam legend or that of the legend of St. George and the
Dragon; but though locally accepted and assimilated they are <i>not</i>
original constituent elements of the local folk-lore of these nations.
These were only adopted and assimilated materials brought from
<i>elsewhere</i>. They are <i>not</i> local survivals.</p>
<p>The analogy between the study of folk-lore and that of comparative
philology can be pursued profitably much further. It may prove of
decisive importance. It is not an indifferent question as to whether
language and ethnic character are interchangeable terms. Russified
Tartars, Magyarised Rumanians, Anglicised Hindoos will speak Russian,
Hungarian or English as the case may be, but this will not change their
ethnical character. They will remain what they were: Tartars, Rumanians
or Hindoos. Thus also nothing can be proved for the specific origins of
folk-lore if found among any one of these nations; it may be just as
much Tartar as Russian, Rumanian or Hungarian, etc., for it can easily
have been taken over with the language.</p>
<p>The fact that these tales are found in Rumania and are told by
Rumanian peasants is in itself not yet sufficient proof of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>their
indigenous origin. We are taken out of the region of hypothetical
speculation into that of concrete facts by modern philology. In the
first place, it is put on record, on the irrefutable evidence of the
modern languages themselves, that there is no nation in Europe which
speaks a language of its own so pure as to be free from admixture with
foreign elements. All owe their very origin, in fact, to this clash of
languages, which was the determining factor in their creation and form.
English is typical in that respect in the west, and Rumanian in the
east of Europe. Both languages have been born through the combined
forces of at least two different languages. In England, through the
violent Norman conquest, French was superimposed upon Anglo-Saxon. In
Rumania, through peaceful penetration and religious influence, Slavonic
became part of the Rumanian language.</p>
<p>If, then, we should examine each of the European languages to find
the various elements of which they are composed, we should be able to
trace the origin of much that is also the spiritual property of these
nations. Every word borrowed from another language represents a new
idea, a fresh notion taken from elsewhere and embodied. We can study
the history of nations from their vocabulary. We can trace the
migrations of the Gipsies by the foreign words now in their language.
The proportion of these alien elements helps us to determine the period
which elapsed since they went from one nation to another. The large
number of Rumanian words in the Gipsy language shows that the Gipsies
must have lived a long time peaceably among the Rumanians, and the
Rumanian words in all the dialects of the Gipsy, from Spain to Siberia,
are conclusive evidence for the fact that Rumania was a centre of
diffusion for the European Gipsy. And yet step by step one can follow
up a modification; small at the confines of the Balkans, it grows
greater the further it is carried westwards.</p>
<p>The conclusion is obvious. In Rumanian, the language is
preponderantly of a Latin origin, but other tongues come in to make up
its present character. A comparatively large <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>proportion of the popular language&mdash;which
alone is of importance&mdash;is Slavonic; then follow in decreasing
proportions Hungarian, modern Greek, Turkish and Albanian elements, but
scarcely any trace of a more ancient local language. In the Hungarian
language there is a large proportion of Slavonic, then of Rumanian and
German elements. The other languages of the Balkans show a similar
mixture of heterogeneous influences. So thorough has been this process
of assimilation that the original Tartarian language of the Bulgars,
who hailed from the Volga&mdash;hence their name&mdash;has entirely
disappeared. The same has happened with the Cumans in Hungary. If there
is anything tenacious it is undoubtedly the human language, the means
of satisfying one&rsquo;s daily wants. And yet there is constant change
and assimilation going on all the time, one nation borrows freely from
its neighbour and enriches its own treasury with the possessions of the
others. How easily, then, could a philologist of the eighteenth
century, who wanted to compare these languages among themselves, by
collecting similar words haphazard prove that Rumanian was Turkish,
that Hungarian was Slavonic and that Bulgarian was Greek, or on finding
some Albanian words in Rumanian and Bulgarian how easily could he
declare these languages to be survivals of the ancient mythical
Pelasgians with whom the Albanians were connected. Thanks to our modern
comparative science these languages are placed on their proper basis,
and the words and elements are sifted and separated from one another.
Each one by the form in which it appears in the other languages yields
to the scholar the secret of the time when it was adopted. Having got
thus far, we may now apply these results to the question which is
before us, viz. the origin of these tales and apologues.</p>
<p>It is obvious that where new words went, stories could also go, and
very likely did go. It is clear that the presence of a large number of
foreign elements in the language denotes a peaceful intercourse between
these nations, long enough and intimate enough to make them borrow
freely from one another and to become fixed into one spiritual unity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>If a language contains a large number of foreign elements, no one
can deny the direct influence which the latter has exercised upon the
former. Words, then, are not a mere combination of sounds, they are the
outward expression of the mind. They are the materialised spirit of the
nation, and whither they go that spirit also goes. Spirit communes thus
with spirit. There is and there has always been such a give and take.
And it is for us to follow up this constant barter, in which the richer
unhesitatingly parted with their treasures to the poor, for the more
they gave the more was left with them, as is meet in the charmed realm
of folk-lore.</p>
<p>These nations learn from one another not only words, but the
thoughts and ideas expressed in words. The proportion of these
linguistic elements in the vocabulary connotes the proportion of
influence upon the other people. It must not be forgotten that we are
dealing with illiterate nations, and with &ldquo;oral&rdquo;
literature. It takes less time and it requires less influence to
disseminate a tale than to disseminate a language and cause it to be
acquired. The difficulty of borrowing is thus obviously eliminated. We
have the fact that even the language had been borrowed and thoroughly
assimilated. No archaic linguistic element has been found in these
languages. And it is therefore not possible to postulate for the tales
and apologues survivals of such antiquity as is now so often
assumed.</p>
<p>Two more points stand out clearly from this investigation into the
history of the language: First, the existence of numerous layers in the
modern languages, some elements being older, others of a more recent
origin. There is no uniformity either in language or in literature, no
contemporary unity of all the elements, but as far as can be seen none
are very old, except a few stray elements of an older period which may
have survived, always subject to the two fundamental conditions,
ethnical and geographical continuity.</p>
<p>The second point is the principle of concentric investigation. If
tales and apologues are borrowed, then those nearest the centre will
preserve the original form less changed; and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>further
a tale travels&mdash;always by word of mouth&mdash;the more it will
lose of its original character and the more it will become mixed up and
contaminated with other tales which have undergone a similar emaciating
and attenuating process.</p>
<p>Following up, then, this line of investigation, our first endeavour
is to find out whether there are parallels to these Rumanian animal
tales among the nations round about, and if so, how far they agree with
the Rumanian, and how far they differ. The fact itself that parallels
exist would be an additional proof that we are dealing here with matter
introduced from elsewhere, matter that has been transmitted from nation
to nation and possibly may have also reached the west of Europe,
although very few traces have been preserved to this day. This is not
yet a question of origin, but the next step towards the solution of the
problem. For obviously, if these tales had been imported, their origin
must be sought elsewhere. If we then compare Rumanian tales with those
of the ancient Byzantine Empire and especially with those of the modern
Greeks, then, in our case, it might be argued that the Greeks were the
repositories of ancient folk-lore. The logical conclusion would be that
these tales must be found most profusely and in a more archaic form in
the folk-lore of modern Greece, and that the variants and parallels
among the other nations must show a distinct falling away from the
original types. Literary tradition or written folk-lore is, of course,
excluded from this investigation, for once folk-lore becomes fixed by
being written in a book it is no longer subject to any appreciable
change.</p>
<p>We are dealing here exclusively with the oral folk-lore of
illiterate peoples. The relation between written and oral folk-lore and
the mutual influence of one upon another will be incidentally touched
upon in connection with the tales themselves. But, curiously enough, a
comparison of these stories with the known and published tales of
modern Greece is thoroughly disappointing. Only very few bird
tales&mdash;no insect or beast tales&mdash;seem to have been preserved,
and these mostly in Macedonia, the population of which is
overwhelmingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>Slavonic, but scarcely any from among the Greeks
proper inhabiting European Greece. On the other hand, those few tales,
which have been mentioned by Abbott and Hahn, are very significant.
They show the profound difference which separates these modern bird
tales from the &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; known in ancient Greek
mythology. A goodly number of changes into animals are recorded in
ancient Greek literature.&mdash;The story of Philomela and Halcyon is
sufficiently well known.&mdash;All these are, with perhaps a few
exceptions, the results of the wrath of an offended god, rewards for
acts of personal kindness or for steps taken to assuage physical pain.
They are all strictly individual in character, and while none of them
is intended to explain the origin of bird, beast or insect, still less
are they of the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; type, in which each animal
stands as the beginning of its species. And even in those few tales in
which supernatural beings are mentioned, very little of the
&ldquo;Moirai&rdquo; or goddesses of fate appears in the Greek form,
though the belief in them is now very strong among modern Greeks. Even
then these &ldquo;Moirai&rdquo; differ considerably from those of
ancient Greek mythology. Their attributes differ and their appearance
and shape have nothing in common with those of classical antiquity. The
name also has assumed a peculiar significance, different from that of
ancient times. This, then, is all which the modern Greeks have retained
of the ancient goddesses of fate; none of the other neighbouring
nations knows the &ldquo;Moirai&rdquo; by name. They have other
goddesses of fate, Vilas or Zanas, etc. Charon, who is now the angel of
death among modern Greeks, is remembered by them also as the boatman
who carries the souls over the waters of forgetfulness. The boatman
alone may still be found in one tale or another retaining something of
the Greek local colour. But no other direct parallels are found among
the animal tales of modern Greece. Much greater, on the contrary, is
the approximation with the Slavonic nations south and north of
Rumania.</p>
<p>Turning, then, from the Greek to the Slavonic tales, we shall find a
much larger number of parallels between them and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>Rumanian. In the collection of South Slavonic
tales and fables published by Krauss only one or two real
&ldquo;creation&rdquo; tales are found, and others are pure and simple
animal tales of the type of the &ldquo;Gnat and the Lion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Wedding Feast of Tom,&rdquo; etc., agreeing more or less
with the Rumanian versions. They prove thereby the popular character of
the Rumanian tales; yet they differ sufficiently from them&mdash;as is
shown later on,&mdash;when they are quoted in connection with the
above. One of the creation stories is that of the sheep which,
according to the South Slavonic tale, was made by the Evil One, when he
boasted that he could improve on God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>Incidentally I may mention the collection of tales from the Saxon
colony in Transylvania, collected by Haltrich. There is not one single
&ldquo;creation&rdquo; tale among them. Only two of the Rumanian animal
fables find their parallels in that collection. Turning to the Russian
tales, notably the great collection of Afanasiev, we shall find a large
number of animal tales, including also a number of
&ldquo;creation&rdquo; tales. In the former the central figures are, as
in the South Slavonic, Rumanian, Saxon, etc., the fox, the bear, the
wolf, the hedgehog and sometimes domestic animals, the dog, the cock,
the hen, the duck, etc. The same can be said also of tales collected
from the Lithuanians, Letts and Ruthenians, and to a smaller degree of
those from the Poles and Czechs. All, however, have retained definite
traces of such animal tales and legends. The animal character has been
thoroughly preserved. The fox is generally the &ldquo;clever&rdquo;
animal, but is, as often as not, outwitted by smaller animals or by
man. The general trend of these animal tales is to pit the cunning of
the smaller and weaker against that of the more powerful animal and to
secure the victory for the former. It is so natural for the people, who
live under the despotism of the mighty and powerful, to rejoice in
seeing the discomfiture of the great and stupid brought about by the
wit and cunning of the small and despised, and answers so aptly to
their feelings.</p>
<p>In these tales, which belong to the group of animal fables, we are
in a different atmosphere, far removed from that of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>creation
legend. We are approaching that phase in the evolution in which the
animal stands for a disguised human being, which, in spite of its
appellation, speaks and acts entirely in accordance with human ways and
notions. These have not yet been found among the Rumanians and those
nations whose folk-lore shows close affinity with theirs.</p>
<p>Having thus far established that these animal tales, fables and
creation legends are neither of a local nor an indigenous origin, nor
survivals from a remote past, and also that the Rumanian tales do not
stand isolated, but form part of a group of tales and legends common to
most of the nations surrounding Rumania in a more or less complete
degree, it behoves us to endeavour to trace these tales to their
probable origin, and also to account for the shape which they have
assumed, as shown in the course of this investigation. These tales
among the Eastern nations of Europe are so much akin to one another
that they must have reached these nations almost simultaneously. All
must have stood under the same influence, which must have been powerful
and lasting enough to leave such indelible traces in the belief and in
the imagination of the people.</p>
<p>A great difficulty arises, when we attempt to define the influence
which brought these stories and fables to the nations of the near East
and thence to the West. Some have connected them with the invasion of
the Mongols. If similar tales could be found among them, such a date
might fit also the introduction of the animal tales into Eastern
Europe, especially if they had originally a Buddhist background.
Nothing, in fact, could apparently harmonise better with the Buddhist
teaching of Metempsychosis and the principle of man&rsquo;s
transformation into beast in order to expiate for sins committed than
some of these tales.&mdash;Of course, Egyptian influences cannot be
overlooked in this connection. I may refer to them later on.&mdash;The
burden of the majority is indeed that the birds and insects are, in
fact, nothing else than human beings transformed into ungainly shapes
for some wrong which they have done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many theories have been put forward on the mediation, among them
also the theory of transmission by the Gipsies. These came first to
Thrace, and lived long enough among the nations of the Balkans, in
Rumania and Russia, to have exercised a possible influence upon them.
But this theory can be dismissed briefly. The Gipsies are not likely
carriers of folk-tales. They came too late, and their march through
Europe is nothing if not a long-drawn agony of suspicion, hatred,
persecution.</p>
<p>Some occult practices may have been taken over by some adepts of the
lower forms of magic, and possibly Playing Cards, originally an oracle
of divining the future, may have been brought by the Gipsies to Europe,
but popular tales, though they possess a good number, have certainly
not been communicated to Europe by them. They never had the favourable
occasion for meeting the people on a footing of equality, or of
entering with them into any intimate intercourse.</p>
<p>The Gipsy of the Rumanian fairy tale is mostly a villain, and is
merely the local substitute for the Arab or Negro of the Eastern
parallels. In the Rumanian popular jests the Gipsy is always the fool.
From such as these the people would have nothing to learn.</p>
<p>Next the Mongolian theory has long been put forward as a plausible
explanation, for it has been believed that Russia formed one of the
channels of transmission. This latter assumption, however, rests on a
geographical misconception, and also on a want of historical knowledge.
Up to comparatively modern times, the whole of the South of Russia was
inhabited by Tartars, and the Mongolian influence upon Russia could not
pass the border of the so-called White Russia. Nor can a temporary
invasion of Europe by the Mongolians, who left ruin and desolation
behind them, have been the means by which such tales could be
introduced. They are told at the peaceful fireside or in the
spinning-rooms, and are not carried by the wings of the arrow sped from
the enemy&rsquo;s bow, nor are they accepted if presented on the point
of the sword. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>are frightened away by the din of battle.
Years must pass ere the blood is staunched, the wounds healed, and only
after peaceable concord and social harmony have been established, can a
spiritual interchange take place; this was impossible between Russians
or Mongols. We must look elsewhere, then, for a possible channel of
transmission, always subject to the theory of
&ldquo;migration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides, to Kieff, the centre of Russian inspiration, the place
hallowed by the minstrels and poets, the Mongols never came. The only
influence which prevailed there was that of Byzance, and to that we
shall have to look as the channel of transmission and the centre of
dissemination of these tales and legends. These had come from Asia,
carried on the crest of the wave of that religious movement known as
Manichaeism and Bogomilism, and from there they started their
triumphant course throughout Europe. They came along with other
religious legends, carried by the current of thought which also taught
the doctrine of Dualism and Metempsychosis. This is the only possible
source for most of the legends and tales found among the Rumanians and
Slavs, and, as will be seen, it must have been the primary source for
such tales in the West of Europe.</p>
<p>A dualistic heterodox teaching with such a background reached from
the confines of India far into the South of France across central
Europe. It was probably the same agency which transformed the life of
Buddha into the legends of the saints Barlaam and Josaphat.</p>
<p>Nor is this the only legend invented, manipulated and circulated by
the numerous Gnostic sects. Those who have studied the history of the
apocryphal literature are fully aware of the apocryphal Gospels, Acts
of the Apostles and of the rest of the apocryphal tales which were
already put on the &ldquo;Index,&rdquo; in the first centuries of the
common era.</p>
<p>Some of the cosmogonic tales of the dualistic origin of the world,
of the influence of the Evil Spirit, of the origin of the Bee, the
Glow-worm, the Wolf and others show unmistakably such a Gnostic origin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is therefore not too much to assume that they have been brought
to Europe and disseminated by the same agency. These sectaries alone
came into direct contact with the masses of the people. They preached
their doctrines to the lowly and the poor. They were known themselves
as the pure (<i>Cathars</i>) and the poor (<i>Pobres</i>). They alone
reached the heart of the people, and were able to influence them to a
far higher degree than the murderous Mongols, or other nations that
ravaged the country.</p>
<p>The dualistic tales connected with the story of the Creation are
found also among other nations, especially among those in Russia and in
the countries which belonged to the ancient Persian Empire.
D&auml;hnhardt, who has made the investigation of such legends and
tales the object of special study (<i lang="de">Natursagen</i>, i.;
Berlin 1907), comes to the same conclusion that they rest ultimately on
the Iranian dualism of the Avesta. He believes that Zoroastrian
teaching has penetrated far into the North and West, and has produced
these peculiar dualistic cosmogonic legends.</p>
<p>The point to bear in mind in this investigation of the origin of the
Rumanian tales and legends is not so much to trace the remote possible
source of dualism, but the immediate influences which have been brought
to bear upon the shape which these legends have taken. This is the
salient problem. D&auml;hnhardt, of course, discusses the further
development of the dualistic conception, through Manichaeism and
Bogomilism, and thus far is helpful in establishing the connection
between Iran and Thrace, and in strengthening the argument that we must
trace a number of these &ldquo;creation&rdquo; legends to the
propaganda of these sects.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that these tales in the European versions have
a thoroughly Christian aspect. They presuppose the existence of God and
His saints; nay, they show a close acquaintance with apocryphal
narratives, which have gathered round the canonical biblical stories
and episodes. The Evil Spirit is a clearly-defined personality, and his
antagonism to God is not of the pronounced acute controversial
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>type as is the Angromainya who, in the teaching of
the Avesta, is the direct opponent and almost negative of God.</p>
<p>A complete transformation had taken place ere these tales became the
property of the Rumanian peasants, and for that, also, of the Russian
and other North-Eastern peoples, who also have similar tales akin to
certain of the cosmogonic legends&mdash;to which reference will be made
at the proper place in the short notes to the stories themselves. It
will not be disputed that some of them are imported, <i>i.e.</i> belong
to the circulating stock of popular literature. Mongolian
influence&mdash;as already remarked above&mdash;is entirely excluded,
in spite of D&auml;hnhardt. The Mongols never came in direct contact
either with the Rumanians or with the nations of the Balkans, who also
possess a number of similar tales, and must have derived them from
another source, more direct and, as will be seen, more complete than
the versions published by D&auml;hnhardt from Russia, Lithuania,
Finland and Esthonia, not to speak of Northern Asiatic nations. Of real
animal tales there are only a few among those studied by
D&auml;hnhardt, such as a peculiar version of &ldquo;the Bee and
Creation,&rdquo; very much shorter than the Rumanian version; then a
version of the creation of the Wolf and the Lamb, and of the
Goat&rsquo;s knees. These are all taken by D&auml;hnhardt from
South-Slavonic and Albanian collections, again corroborating the view
that we have to look to the Balkans as the immediate centre of this
class of &ldquo;creation&rdquo; tales, and then further back to Asia
Minor.</p>
<p>The appearance of the &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; legends in a
compilation of the seventh or eighth century is not to be taken as the
date of their origin. They may be very much older, and no doubt are,
and may have formed part of a primitive Physiologus in which the origin
as well as the peculiarities of the various birds and beasts were
described. This is not the place to discuss the remarkable history of
the Physiologus. The only point to be noted is that the symbolical and
allegorical interpretation of the tales contained in the Physiologus is
of a strictly religious Christian character. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>The absence from the popular literature of such bird and beast tales
as are found in the Physiologus&mdash;the Bestiaires of the
West&mdash;is not surprising, for the Physiologus deals mostly with
animals and birds which are of an outlandish character. Very few have
any reference to the animals with which the people are familiar, and in
which alone they take an interest.</p>
<p>Though the book was known also among the Rumanians, only a faint
trace of it could be detected among the popular tales in the present
collection. The oldest Fathers of the Church made use of this
Physiologus in their homilies, and the other sects have no doubt done
the same. Some of the creation legends may have found their way into
the old legendary homiletical interpretation of the creation, like the
Hexameron of Basil, and other kindred compilations. All these tales
form part of a wider cycle of allegorised animal fables. In Jewish
literature a collection of Fox fables is mentioned as early as the
second or third century.</p>
<p>Indian literature is full of such animal tales, approximating often
to some of the Rumanian fables. The collections of Frere, Temple,
Steele, Skeat, and Parker abound in such animal tales, in which the
more nimble and quick-witted, though small and weak, animal regularly
gets the best of the bigger and stronger, yet duller and slower rival.
No moral lesson is squeezed out of the tales, and the animal is not a
thinly-disguised human being. Yet there can be no greater fallacy than,
guided by this similarity, to assume a direct Indian origin for the
Rumanian fables.</p>
<p>None of these animal tales finish with the usual
&ldquo;moral,&rdquo; known to us from Aesop onward. Nor do the people
seem to be influenced by these artificial fables. In the literary
European fable the animal is merely a disguised human being. The
animals are performing acts which have nothing of the animal in them.
The Indian and Oriental fable differs in this respect from the
European, inasmuch as in a good number of them the animal character of
the performing beasts is faithfully preserved. Exactly the same happens
with the Rumanian animal fables. The cat <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>does not play the
r&ocirc;le of the queen, and the fox is not a sly courtier. Cat is cat,
and fox is fox. And yet they were not unaware of the fables of Aesop. I
have found these fables in many old Rumanian manuscripts, and one of
the first printed popular books of the country was the Collection of
Aesop.</p>
<p>Unquestionably a good many proverbs are intimately connected with
tales. The &ldquo;moral&rdquo; in Aesop has often dwindled down to a
simple proverb, or has expanded out of it. These proverbs are, as it
were, succinct conclusions drawn out by the people. Anton Pann (in the
middle of the last century)&mdash;to whom the Rumanian popular
literature will for ever remain indebted&mdash;therefore calls his
Collection of Proverbs and Tales &ldquo;<span lang="ro">Povestea
vorbii</span>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;The tale which hangs by the
Proverb.&rdquo; One and all of the hundred tales found in the second
and last edition of this book are mostly of a purely popular origin.
The process throughout is not to invent a story for the moral, but the
&ldquo;moral,&rdquo; such as it is, is to flow naturally from the
story.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss the origin of the animal fable in
general. But one cannot overlook the fact that all the Indian
fables&mdash;with the exception of some embodied in the
Panchatantra&mdash;are found in modern collections. All that we know of
them is that they live actually in the mouth of the modern people. They
may be old, they may be of more recent date.</p>
<p>Against these modern collections must be set now the story of
Ahikar, which carries us back at least to the fifth century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, and is thus far the oldest record of
animal tales. It has become one of the popular stories which circulated
in a written form, and became the source of many a quaint proverb, as
probably also of some animal tales.</p>
<p>The recent discovery among the Papyri of Elephantine in Southern
Egypt of the Story of Ahikar has carried back the knowledge of
allegorical beast fables to at least the fifth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> For not only do we find in that story the prototype of
the life of Aesop, but also a number of maxims <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>and
saws, and not a few beast tales, which are mentioned by Ahikar in order
to teach his ungrateful nephew Nadan. We find there, <i>e.g.</i> the
prototype of &ldquo;pious&rdquo; wolf, who appears in the Ahikar story
as an innocent student, but who cannot take in the lesson given to him,
his mind wandering to the sheep. There are other wolf, fox, rat and
bird fables in the Rumanian and, still more so, in the Oriental and
other versions. Ahikar himself relates the beast tales, allowing Nadan
to draw the lesson. By the manner in which these tales are referred to,
it is obvious that they must have been well known tales current among
the people.</p>
<p>The real importance of this discovery lies in the fact that we have
here a number of cleverly-used popular animal tales, more than two
thousand years old, whose home was in all probability Syria or Egypt,
embedded in a collection which has deeply influenced the apocryphal
Book of Tobit, and to a certain degree even the writers of the New
Testament, as shown by Professors Rendel Harris and Conybeare in the
Introduction to their edition of the <i>Story of Ahikar</i> (second
edition). The claim for an Indian origin of these fables will have to
be abandoned, unless someone could show older writings from India, and
the possible road by which these fables could have reached the Western
shore of Asia Minor and been taken up by the peoples of Syria and Egypt
at such an early date. It is not at all unlikely that some of the
fables, just as they travelled westwards, also travelled eastwards and
found a home in India as they found a home in Rumania and Russia. If
one remembers now that the fabulous &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of Aesop
ascribed to Planudes is almost identical with part of that of Ahikar,
as I have shown, as far back as 1883 in my <i>History of the Rumanian
Popular Literature</i> (Bucharest 1883, p. 104 ff.), it will not be
difficult to account for the West-Asiatic origin of the fables
themselves.</p>
<p>From a Rumanian MS. of the eighteenth century, I have since
published the fuller narrative of that version in an English
translation (the <i>Journal of the Royal As. Soc.</i>, 1900, pp.
301&ndash;319). The two tales contained therein have also been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>reprinted here at the end of the collection,
especially as they vary somewhat from the other ancient and
medi&aelig;val recensions of the Story of Ahikar. This story has become
one of the Rumanian popular chap-books in the shortened version of
Anton Pann. The practical application of the fable, the
&ldquo;moralisation,&rdquo; is a second stage, limited, as it seems, to
the purely literary composition. The people put their own
interpretations upon the fables and often dispensed with any such
interpretations.</p>
<p>We are brought back again to the same centre, Syria and Byzance, for
the dissemination of these fables. Such tales were then within the
reach of the teaching of the various sects, such as Manichaeans,
Bogomils, Cathars, etc., and travelled with them from East to West,
where they met the other current of the Aesopian fables transmitted to
the West through Latin and Arabic sources. According to this theory the
religious sectarians made deft use also of animal tales, for the
purpose of inculcating a moral, of drawing a lesson, of holding up the
Church and State to the ridicule and contempt of the masses, and thus
creating the animal satire, the best type of which is the cycle of
<i>Reynard the Fox</i>. I am not oblivious of the fact that an
allegorical use has been made of animal tales in the Arabic literature,
such as the &ldquo;Judgment of the Animals,&rdquo; under the title of
<i>Hai ben Yokdhan</i>, written in Arabic by Ibn Tophail, translated
into English by Simon Ockley in 1711, in which the lion holds a court,
and animal after animal appears to accuse man; or the collection of
Sahula (thirteenth cent.) in his ancient apologue <i>Mashal
ha-kadmoni</i>. But there is no real connection between this cycle and
that of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>.</p>
<p>Any reference to the epic of <i>Reynard the Fox</i> must be
incidental. It can only be alluded to here, and not followed up in
detail. A real Western origin for these tales, taking them separately
or as &ldquo;branches,&rdquo; as they appear in the old French
versions, has not been found, nor any explanation for their sudden
appearance in the eleventh or twelfth century. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are two or three points in connection with this cycle which
have to be kept steadily in view. In the first place its almost
complete independence of the purely Aesopian fable with its polished
form, with its thinly-disguised human attributes, and with its stilted
and stiff &ldquo;moral.&rdquo; Though modified somehow in Babrius,
Avianus, even Marie de France and Berachya, this latter cycle belongs
more to the literary class. The &ldquo;clerks&rdquo; could not take
umbrage at them. Not so the tales in the <i>Reynard</i> cycle. They are
thoroughly popular. The animals retain their natural attributes, they
act as they are expected to do, and they are utilised in the same
manner as &ldquo;political broadsides&rdquo; were in later times. The
human beings represented in these &ldquo;satirical sheets&rdquo; are
disguised as animals, and not the animals disguised as human beings.
There lies the profound difference between these two sets of beast
tales.</p>
<p>And because of their animal propensity, the human beings are
ridiculed and lampooned in the form of animals and held up to the scorn
and laughter of the reader. The bad man, as in the old story of Ahikar,
is likened to the beast, and chastised accordingly. The popular origin
and character of this kind of satire is self-evident. Courtiers and
clerks would not attempt such persiflage of their superiors, and
certainly not in so sustained a manner.</p>
<p>Of the men thus ridiculed none are so virulently assailed as the
Clergy. People do not mind occasionally a slight skit on priests and
other privileged classes, and there are abundant <i lang=
"fr">fabliaux</i> which leave very little to be desired from the point
of view of ridicule. But to have singled out the Clergy for such
unmeasured vituperation shows a deliberate attempt to lower and destroy
the influence and authority of the Church in general and of its
ministers in particular. Only partisans of heterodox teaching could
find pleasure and profit in applying the beast tales to break down the
walls of the Church. Only men in contact with the masses could throw
that leaven of critical examination into the hearts of the people and
open their eyes by means of animal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>tales to the weaknesses and
vices of their official clergy. Such outspoken criticism seldom comes
from within. It is often imported wholesale from without, or at least
comes from an opposing quarter. In their polemical propaganda these
heterodox teachers brought and used also some of those fox tales for
which, significantly enough, parallels are to be found mostly in
Slavonic tales from Russia and the Balkans.</p>
<p>If such be the partial origin of these Reynard tales, one can easily
understand why they appeared in the eleventh or twelfth century, and
notably in the countries then the very centres of such heterodox
teaching: South of France, Flanders and elsewhere. A very remarkable
fact seems to corroborate this hypothesis. One of the presumed authors
of a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of the French <i>Reynard</i> cycle, Pierre
Cloot, was burnt in Paris in 1208 for heresy. Here we have a man who
paid with his life for his heretic faith, actually working on these
tales. It may be a mere coincidence, still some connection between the
<i>Reynard</i> poem and &ldquo;heretics&rdquo; cannot be denied.</p>
<p>With the victory of the Church, <i>Reynard</i> nearly disappeared,
yet that satirical leaven has continued to work in those political
animal broadsides, which stretch from the &ldquo;Who killed Cock
Robin?&rdquo; in England to &ldquo;Who killed the Cat?&rdquo; in Russia
among the Russian broadsides.</p>
<p>There remains now still one section of these Rumanian tales to be
considered, that in which the origin of the animal is closely connected
with what is commonly known as the fairy tale. It is just in this fact
that the pre-eminence of these tales can be found. It is like a window
through which the East is looking westwards. It is noteworthy that the
&ldquo;fairy tales&rdquo; found here connected with the origin of the
birds and beasts do not stand so isolated as the legends. To more than
one of them parallels may be adduced from other than Eastern
collections. In spite of similarity, they differ, however, in many
points so profoundly that they lead to a very serious question. It
cannot be passed over, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>it cannot be treated here at such
length as the problem raised would demand. To put it briefly, the
difference between these fairy tales and those of the West, is that in
these versions of the former a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or perhaps a
plausible reason is given to the fairy tale which is often missing in
the general form of the fairy tales.</p>
<p>The question has been asked repeatedly, &ldquo;What is the meaning
of such and such a tale,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> the
&ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; tales or &ldquo;Bluebeard&rdquo;? To Miss
Cox&rsquo;s indefatigable labour we owe a monumental investigation of
the first-mentioned tale, and yet for all that the main question has
remained unanswered. This is but one example out of many.</p>
<p>Every collection of fairy tales teems with them. Of course, the
&aelig;sthetic pleasure of seeing innocence triumphant and virtue
rewarded might be a sufficient motive, and no doubt often is. The
people like to see, in the imaginary tale, a vindication of the justice
which they often miss in real life. The adventurous hero will also
appeal to the chivalrous instincts of the people, and especially to the
young. Such tales as the epic romances of old require no further
explanation. Still there are a good many fairy tales the reason and
meaning of which are anything but clear. If it can now be shown that
there is a cosmogonic background, or one which gives the clue to it,
inasmuch as it tells the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of certain creatures,
such a tale is at once its own explanation and justification: if
<i>e.g.</i> the final development of &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; is not
that she becomes the wife of a prince, but that she becomes the
&ldquo;dove&rdquo; or the &ldquo;sparrow,&rdquo; then
&ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; assumes a definite meaning. Under other
influences, when such heterodox teachings cannot be tolerated by the
powers that be, obviously the creation tales, with this specific
character, had to lose their &ldquo;tail,&rdquo; as the stork does in
the story, and hence the fairy tale became partly meaningless. Thus, if
the &ldquo;Bluebeard&rdquo; could no longer be &ldquo;a
cannibal,&rdquo; as in the tale No. 83, such a person not being
tolerated in a modern state, except as a wizard, lycanthropos, or
werwolf, he had to be changed into what he is now. The modern
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;Bluebeard&rdquo; is a mere pale reflex of
the original monster. He does not even make the flesh creep
sufficiently. This watering down may have taken place also in other
tales which appear to us without any sense. They have lost that
decisive part which gave point to the story.</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the objection which could be raised against this
view of the original character of some of our fairy tales. It might be
urged with some show of plausibility that the process might have been
an inverse one, that the popular story-teller used a fairy tale to tack
on his moral, that the question of the origin of the bird or insect was
an &ldquo;after-thought,&rdquo; and did not belong originally to the
tale. Theoretically, such an objection could be urged, and it might
even gain in force if applied to the fairy tales of the West. Andersen,
not to speak of minor poets, would supply a proof of it. But we must
bear in mind that we are dealing with the unsophisticated people, who
would not use the folk-lore material in the manner of the literary
artist. They have no preconceived idea to which a tale or legend is
made artificially to fit. Moreover, these tales and legends are
believed in implicitly. They bear the stamp of their primitiveness.
They do not represent a later degree of development, such as the
parallels from the West often show. The existence side by side with
them of other creation tales of animals is an additional support of the
view that the fairy tales have not been &ldquo;edited&rdquo; or adapted
to cosmogonic purposes to explain the origin of beast and bird.</p>
<p>Fairy tales are, as a rule, taken out of the range of the survival
theory. The similarity of fairy tales, so striking among a large number
of nations, precludes the possibility of seeing in them local
survivals, and yet it appears unscientific to separate one section of
oral literature from the other. The line of demarcation between
creation legend and creation fairy tale is so thin that it is often
indistinguishable. Both spring from the same root, and the theory that
endeavours to explain the origin of the one must also be applicable to
the other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the theory of survivals, however, no attempt is made to deal at
the same time with the question of origins. It has not yet been made
clear, by any of the more prominent representatives of the theory of
survivals, how the similarity in customs and ceremonies is to be
explained, in tales and fables, between the most diverse nations living
separated from one another. If these survivals represent local
tradition, which has persisted throughout the ages, how, then, does it
come to pass that they should resemble so closely other ceremonies and
customs observed by different nations also as local traditions? Is it
to be inferred that at some distant time, far back in the prehistoric
ages, some such ceremonies were used, that, in spite of evolution and
separation, they have survived everywhere almost unchanged, in spite of
the profound modifications of the nations in their ethnical, political
and religious status? Either they are local inventions, in which case
they could not resemble any other, or they all go back to one common
stock, and have survived in such a miraculous manner contrary to every
law of human nature. The only explanation feasible and satisfactory is,
I believe, the theory of transmission from nation to nation; those
resembling one another closely in modern Europe are not of so early an
age as has hitherto been assumed, but have come at a certain time from
one definite centre, and were propagated among the nations, and
disseminated by means of a great religious movement at a time when the
political and national consolidation of the peoples of Europe had
already assumed a definite shape.</p>
<p>To this conclusion we are forced by the examination of these
Rumanian animal tales in their manifold aspect, &ldquo;creation&rdquo;
tales, fables, fairy tales. They are all more or less of comparatively
recent origin. They owe their actual shape to the dualistic teaching of
the Manichaeans and Bogomils. They have come by these intermediaries of
the religious sects from Syria and the Balkans. These tales stopped
first among the nations in the Near East, and then by the same agency
were carried to the extreme West. Only in such wise can we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>explain
the appearance of these tales&mdash;whatever their archaic character
may be&mdash;among nations of comparatively recent origin like those
now under consideration, Rumanians, Bulgars, Russians and even Saxons
and Hungarians. This is the only possible explanation of the very
remarkable dualistic character, and of the peculiar teachings embodied
in these tales. For, whatever these nations have in common, there
cannot be any question of survivals, for the reasons advanced above.
All the nations are comparatively modern. It is impossible to assume
that what might be a Latin survival among the Rumanians could be so
closely connected with what might be a Turanian survival among the
Bulgars or a Pelasgian survival among the Albanians. There might be
found among these tales traces of more ancient beliefs, myths and
customs, just as it is possible to find similar traces among the
folk-lore of the nations of the West. But what I contend is that these
are not <i>local</i> survivals&mdash;that, whatever their primitive
character may be, they need not originally belong to the nations among
whom they are found now. They were brought by the same movement that
brought the tales and legends, customs and ceremonies. The new and the
old were carried along by the same stream of tradition and religious
influence. An adjustment and readjustment of materials, the placing of
layer upon layer, localisation and assimilation then took place. But
these are rocks swept along by the stream and deposited far away from
the place of origin, or, to take another simile, that of the insect and
the amber. The amber has been carried from the North Sea many centuries
ago, nay, thousands of years ago, along the trade routes from North to
South, and has found its way also to ancient Egypt. Embedded in the
amber we have here and there a North European insect which was caught
at the time when the amber was still a liquid, and, imprisoned in it,
became fossilised, and was carried a long distance. If found, then,
among the beads in the tombs of the ancient Pharaohs, no one could say
that that insect was of Egyptian origin, or that fly a remnant of the
local <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>fauna. It had come thither together with the amber
that carried it, and may have remained there if the amber had
decayed.</p>
<p>In the same manner ancient customs, ancient beliefs and ancient
tradition have been caught in the liquid tales, apologues and legends,
like the fly in the amber, and carried along with them from East to
West. In this manner they may perhaps be termed survivals, but
survivals of a different kind than has been assumed hitherto. They have
survived only as long as they were tolerated in the lore of the
people.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with dissemination go the assimilation and localisation
of these diverse elements. It is impossible to do more within the
compass of this introduction than merely touch the fringe of a
far-reaching problem which arises from the examination of these
peculiar beast and bird tales. One of the most instructive examples of
this religious syncretism, of the manner in which it has influenced the
people, and the form in which it has been preserved, localised, and
assimilated, among them, is shown to advantage in the stories of the
origin of the Glow-worm and in the stories of the Bee. Some of the
cosmogonic legends of the Rumanians are also found among the Balkan
people. They are a fragmentary reflex of a great conception of the
world. If I may use the mystical and symbolical language of the
legends, they are also sparks from a great light that had fallen down
from heaven. The creation of man, the fall of the angels, are here
curiously blended together. They represent part of the teaching that
went under many names but, in essence, was one. That is, of course, the
belief in the dualism of the creative powers, the good God and the
wicked one, styled Satan.</p>
<p>From these tales and legends, which are derived from well-known
apocryphal writings, we can see how deeply the latter have entered the
life of nations which have not yet fallen under the unifying sway of
strict dogmatism, and how unable the people are to grasp the higher
spiritual interpretations of the dogmas and practices of the Church.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>From a purely dogmatic point of view, all these tales are rank
heresy; but who among the simple folk knows the distinction between
orthodox and heretical teaching? The people are more easily disposed
towards a simple philosophy which explains satisfactorily the phenomena
of life. They listen with pleasure to tales of imagination. One of the
fundamental theories of Gnosticism or, rather later, of dualism, is
this peculiar conception of the creation. The world is divided between
the power of light and the power of darkness. The latter is anxious to
participate in the possession of light, and for that reason steals
some, which it breaks up into sparks and covers over with thick matter
so that it may not escape. These sparks are the human soul deeply
embedded in human clay, anxious always to be reunited with the ancient
glory.</p>
<p>In this Gnostic teaching we have the very source of the legend of
these angelic sparks now relegated to glow-worms, originally placed in
other &ldquo;earthly worms&rdquo;&mdash;the human race. We hear,
moreover, the faint echo of the fall of the angels and of the angels of
a lower rank inhabiting (and ruling) the planets and the stars. We even
have the legend, found in the <i>Book of Enoch</i>, of the angels who
fell in love with a woman and remain upon earth as evil spirits, whilst
she is translated to heaven and becomes a star. The interest lies not
only in the fact that these ancient religious conceptions have been so
faithfully preserved among the people, but also in the manner of their
preservation. They have been adapted to the understanding of the folk,
and, from dogmatic teachings, they have become beautiful popular
legends. But the inner meaning has been entirely lost. The old sparks
have been embedded in very thick clay indeed, as can be seen in the
treatment meted out to God, Christ, the Virgin, the Apostles and
Saints. They are greeted with an apparent lack of reverence and respect
that must disturb the equanimity of people of a Puritanic mind. The
gods could not have been put on a footing of greater familiarity; it
almost borders on the burlesque. Primitive nations show the same
apparent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>want of respect to their gods, idols or fetishes,
and we are inclined to put them on a lower scale of faith and reverence
than the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p>A better knowledge of the life and religion of the peoples in the
East and of the Eastern part of Europe would soon change such a view.
In fact, I believe, that if we could descend to the lower depths of the
masses of Western Europe, and especially of those in Catholic
countries, and get a peep into their innermost soul, we should not find
it very different from that of the Slav and the Rumanian. The Saints
are not treated differently in Spain and in Italy on the one hand, or
in Rumania and in Bulgaria, or even Russia, on the other. They have all
the same essential conditions in common, viz. all have a Pantheon of
Saints of various degrees and of both sexes. In Protestant countries
the people have been impoverished. All the saints have been driven
away; a cold abstract spirituality has taken their place, and yet depth
of fervour and strength of belief cannot be denied to these Eastern
peoples. There is, moreover, a sufficient fund of humour and innate
rectitude to keep them at a certain level of morality and albeit free
from the hypocrisy of the so-called higher <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2196" title="Source: civilisation">civilization</span>. So that,
if the Rumanians take liberties with God and the Church and the Saints,
and pay homage to the Devil by mocking and laughing at the jokes which
God performs for his confusion, it is all done more in the spirit of
good-natured banter, not in that of polemical or fanatical intolerance.
Why should the poor Devil not also occasionally have a good time? He is
always sure to be outwitted in the long run.</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the objection that may be raised against
attributing so much influence to the activity and propaganda of the
heretical sects. It may be argued, that their influence was not in any
way commensurate with the results ascribed to them, that they did not
carry the masses with them to such an extent as to leave indelible
traces on their religious life and popular imagery. Some may go so far
as to look upon their activity as similar to that of some of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>the mendicant friars during the Middle Ages. Yet
the mendicant friars were able to exercise a tremendous influence upon
the people and, helped by other political powers, they were able to
create a movement which led up to the Crusades. It seized upon the
masses of Europe with an irresistible force. In a minor, yet no less
effective manner, the same agencies were able to arm the Kings of
France against the Albigenses in Provence. Church history, however,
shows very clearly that the power of the Manichaeans was so great that
it has taken the Church many centuries to bring the fight to a
satisfactory close.&mdash;The Cathars (pure) have given the name Ketzer
to the German heretics, and every language in Europe shows traces of
this heretic nomenclature.&mdash;The struggle was a terrible and a long
one, and if it had not been for the secular arm which placed itself at
the service of the Church for political reasons, who knows whether the
Romish Church would have come out victorious in the struggle?</p>
<p>The question may be asked, How did it come about, that the teaching
of an obscure sect could be propagated from the Black Sea to the
Atlantic and could win the support of so many peoples? The answer lies
in a fact which has hitherto been entirely ignored. The connection
between Arianism and Manichaeism in Europe has to my mind not yet been
even hinted at; yet there must have been a very close and intimate one.
Arianism, in fact, prepared the ground for the new wave of heretical
teaching which, a few centuries after the former&rsquo;s official
extinction, followed in its wake. No one has, as yet, endeavoured to
trace the effect which the Arian teaching has had in Europe when it
became the national faith of the Goths. In them we have a nation which,
from the third century to the end of the sixth, practically dominated
central Europe. It established more than one kingdom between the Black
Sea and the Atlantic, in Illyricum, in Northern Italy, one of might and
strength in the South of France in Provence, with its headquarters in
Toulouse. It had overflowed into Spain, and broke down only after the
invasion of the Arabs. These Goths are described as rude barbarians,
because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>they differed in their life, and probably in their
original forms of faith, from the Greeks and the Romans. The modern
idea is that their original home was somewhere in the North-West of
Europe, that they came along the Vistula, and then migrated to the
country between the Don and the Ural.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss the question of their original
home, yet the whole history of the migration of the nations shows that
the movement came also from the same direction as that of the other
nations which followed upon one another from east to west, and that
these migrations were prompted by tremendous political changes among
the nations of Central Asia. It is therefore probable that the Goths
migrated from the western shore of the Caspian Sea, somewhere near Lake
Ascanius&mdash;hence the confusion&mdash;then to the countries between
the Ural and Don, and thence by slow degrees southwards and westwards.
This would explain many obscure points in the migration of the Goths.
Be it as it may, we find them in the second century settled in those
very countries in which we now find the Ruthenians and the Rumanians,
and stretching further into Pannonia. The Goths are said to have
adopted Christianity towards the end of the third century, as it is
alleged, by priests and lay Christians brought as captives from
Cappadocia and other parts of Asia Minor. As early as the Council of
Nic&aelig;a, 325, a Gothic bishop is mentioned among the signatories to
the decrees. An outstanding figure of the Gothic Christians was
Ulfilas, who, owing to pressure from the non-converted section of the
Goths, crossed the Danube and settled at the foot of Mount Haemus (the
Balkans) in the middle of the fourth century. He had become converted
to the Arian doctrine, and took part in the Council under the Emperor
Valens, which was held in Constantinople in 358.</p>
<p>Theodosius, who became the Great after his recantation of Arianism,
towards the end of the fourth century, promulgated decree after decree,
one more drastic than the other, for the persecution and extirpation of
this heresy; in fact, he was the very first to establish an inquisition
of faith. The example <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>set by Theodosius was followed afterwards by
the Catholic Emperors and Kings of the West, even down to the Holy
Office, as the Inquisition was afterwards called. But, in spite of
this, Arianism spread among the Goths, and, whatever were their
political vicissitudes, they kept staunch to this peculiar form of
Christianity, the greatest and most powerful enemy of the orthodox and
Catholic Church. They spread eastwards and westwards, partly as vassals
of the Huns and partly acting quite independently under their own kings
and rulers. They overran the Balkan peninsula, destroying every heathen
temple, and not sparing Catholic churches. They then sacked Rome,
entered Gaul, and occupied the South of France, with Toulouse as the
capital. They spread into Burgundy and conquered Spain. It took many
battles and many centuries to break the political power of the Goths.
It was rather the subtle influences of the Catholic women than
religious conviction that brought about the conversion to Catholicism
of the Gothic rulers in Spain and Italy. The Catholic Church, in the
year 507, armed the Frankish King Clovis&mdash;who adopted
Catholicism&mdash;against the Gothic Arian King Alaric, and thus
brought about the first &ldquo;crusade&rdquo; between Catholics and
heretics in the country north of the Pyrenees. A crusade was to be
renewed hereafter for a second time against the Albigenses in the very
same country and against the very same cities. Unfortunately very
little is known of the beliefs and practices of the half-heathen,
half-Christian Goths. The fact, however, remains that they held on to
their faith for many centuries in spite of the official conversion of
the leaders. In Burgundy, Arianism persisted down to the sixth century,
and among the Lombards (merely another tribal name for Goths) in
Northern Italy, it persisted to the eighth century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other nations poured into the Balkans. Whether they
entirely annihilated the Goths, or whether they assimilated with them,
will remain a problem unsolved. Very few Gothic words can, however, be
traced among the nations of the Balkans. The Slavs, probably coming
from Pannonia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>are first noticed in large numbers in the fifth
and the sixth centuries. The Bulgars from the old haunts of the Goths
near the Volga came in the seventh century. The last heathen king was
Boris, who was converted to Christianity in the middle of the ninth
century. No sooner has Christianity an official status among the
Bulgars than we hear of the heresy of the Bogomils and Cathars
spreading among them to such an extent that they almost overthrew the
orthodox Church. The break between the eastern and western
Churches&mdash;between Constantinople and Rome&mdash;at the end of the
ninth century also contributed, in a way, to weaken the allegiance of
the faithful to the orthodox Church, and the manner in which the
Orthodox vilified the Catholics must have been quite sufficient to
reconcile the people to heterodox doctrines. Manichaeans and Bogomils
took advantage of the schism and the violence of the two parties to win
the people over to their tenets. Bogomilism in a slightly varied form,
as Cathars and Albigenses, etc., spread henceforth from east to west,
following exactly the same course as that taken by the Goths in their
migration from east to west. The ground had been prepared for them, the
seed had been sown, and the work was made easy for them by the
preceding Arians.</p>
<p>There is one feature in this schismatic movement, the importance of
which cannot be appraised too highly. The Word of God was taught in the
vernacular, the Bible and, along with it, uncanonical writings, were
translated into the vernacular. While the Orthodox and Catholic
Churches kept strictly to Greek and Latin as the language of Scripture
and Service, the Arians no doubt, on the contrary, allowed the people
to pray and to learn in their own language. It was the outstanding
merit of Ulfilas that he translated the Bible into Gothic. This
practice of translating the word of God into the vernacular remained a
distinctive characteristic of the schismatic Arians and other
sectaries. They were thus able to reach the heart of the people much
more easily than the Catholic and Greek clergy, and to exercise a
lasting influence upon the masses, far deeper than that of the
representatives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>of a creed taught in a foreign tongue. This also
continued to keep the Arian-Goths away from the Catholic Church for
many centuries. The change, which came later on, was due to two
causes&mdash;the conversion of the kings and rulers, and, to a far
larger degree than has hitherto been recognised, the loss of the
Teutonic language. The Goths slowly forgot their own language and
adopted that of the nations in whose midst they lived as a
minority.</p>
<p>This explains much more satisfactorily than has hitherto been
attempted the mysterious disappearance of the Goths after the official
conversion of Recared in Spain, and the overthrow of Alaric by Clovis
in the beginning of the sixth century in the South of France. In Italy
they kept to their Arianism under the name of Lombards, down to the
eighth century. It must not, however, be assumed that with the public
disappearance of Arianism and that of the Goths as a ruling nation, the
Arian heresy and all that it brought to the people had also
disappeared. That teaching could not easily be uprooted. It was merely
driven underground. The Catholic Church was satisfied with having
obtained an official public victory. Then followed a slow process of
extirpation. The writings of the schismatics were hunted up and
destroyed, and thus the wells of heresy were dried up. The people were
weaned from their errors by the convincing power of sword and faggot.
But so long as these sinners did not belong to the higher classes, the
Church winked at their aberrations, especially when they kept quiet and
were not aggressive in their action.</p>
<p>Thus the fire of heresy smouldered on under the ashes of the
<i lang="fr">autos-da-f&eacute;</i> until it was fanned again into a
mighty blaze through the Cathars and Albigenses. The ground was
prepared for their reception by the Arianism of the Goths, and by the
Manichaean propaganda, which had penetrated into Europe from the West
as early as the fourth century.</p>
<p>It is important in this connection to refer, however briefly, to the
Priscillianites in Spain, who flourished from the middle of the fourth
to the second half of the sixth century, close <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>upon two
hundred years. The founder was Priscillianus (d. 385) a man of noble
birth and great achievement. He was a great scholar, and had become
acquainted with Gnostic and Manichaean doctrines. He was accused of
heresy, and was the first Christian who was executed by Christians for
preaching a different form of creed. The accusations made against him
and his followers were precisely the same which were raised centuries
afterwards against the Cathars and Albigenses, and no doubt just as
false. From them we learn, however, that he had apocryphal books and
mystical oriental legends, which he used for his teaching, and which
were believed by his followers. It took two, or close upon three
centuries, before the public traces of Priscillianism disappeared from
Spain and Gaul. The followers, probably, shared the fate of the Gothic
Arians settled in these countries. Then the conquest of Spain by the
Arabs or Moors prevented the Catholic Church from further sifting the
chaff from the grain. No doubt a good number of so-called heretics, who
could not enter the bosom of the Catholic Church, embraced Islam, just
as a good number of prominent Cathars in Dalmatia and Bosnia preferred
to become Mohammedans after the conquest of the country by the Turks
rather than become united with the Orthodox Church. When the Cathars
started their propaganda, they followed, as it were, in the track of
the Goths. They occupy exactly the same tracts of land as those held
for so many centuries by the former, and without a doubt they found
there remnants of the old heresy, popular legends and beliefs, even
tales and mystical as well as mythical songs, all so many welcome pegs
on which to hang their own teaching. It may in a way have been a kind
of revival, in which what had been preserved by the descendants from
the Goths of old was blended with the new matter brought afresh from
the East. Unfortunately&mdash;as already remarked&mdash;too little is
known of the beliefs and practices of the Goths in their pagan state
and afterwards as Arian Christians. That they, in spite of being
&ldquo;rude barbarians,&rdquo; had also some theological treatises is
evident from Anathema No. 16 of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>Council of Toledo (589), when
Recared forswore his Arianism and became a fervent Catholic. The
anathema runs against &ldquo;the abominable treatises which we composed
to seduce the provincials into the Arian heresy.&rdquo; Many such
compositions, especially in the vernacular, must be meant here; they
all fell under the ban.</p>
<p>The Cathars followed the same practice and were zealous propagators
and translators of the Bible and Apocrypha into the vernacular. They
knew the Bible so well that in disputations with the Catholic clergy
the latter were easily beaten. Almost every one of the
&ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; books, <i>i.e.</i> forbidden by the Orthodox
and Catholic Church, was preserved in old Slavonian (and Rumanian)
translations, and some are to be found this very day among the holy
books of the Russian schismatics. Nay, even the oldest French
translation of the Bible was the work of Albigenses. So much did this
affect the Catholic Church that she excommunicated it, and forbade the
people to read the Bible at the Council of Toulouse in 1229; the Bible
in the vernacular having before been ordered to be burned publicly by
the decree of the Church.</p>
<p>No wonder, therefore, at the popularity of these sectaries and the
immense influence they wielded upon the popular mind and imagination.
And if it be true that Arius set forth his religious views in doggerel
rhymes to be sung to popular tunes by the sailors and labourers, then
he initiated a movement which has continued ever since in religious
minstrelsy, and is practised amongst others, by the Russian blind
beggar-minstrels and other popular ballad singers on festive occasions
among the Rumanians and southern Slavs. Nothing, in fact, could better
serve the purpose of propaganda than such songs. They would appeal at
once to the primitive, unlettered nations, specially amongst those who
had such mythological epics of their own. The rude barbarians would be
deeply impressed, and they would very easily adopt such songs and the
teaching they contained. We can then easily understand a <i>Volsunga
Saga</i> or a similar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>saga originating under such influences, or
moulded in accordance with such new models. Neither the Orthodox nor
the Catholic Church knows of such popular religious songs of an epic
character, filled with the mysteries of the Holy Writ, much less of any
filled with mysteries from the apocryphal and legendary writings. They
have no more than Church hymns sung in the Church, only on special
occasions, together with a certain psalmody chanted by the officiating
clergy. And when these Greek (or Syriac) hymns were translated into
Slavonic or Rumanian, they practically lost their tune and their
inspiration, and they were recited with a peculiar monotonous
cantilation. Quite otherwise were the popular carols, and the popular
epic ballads with a distinctive religious background and full of
wonderful incidents from the life of the saints. Unlike the former,
they are not congregational litanies, but purely popular songs and
ballads, devoid of any official or liturgical character. This may also
explain the origin of the so-called Ambrosian chant as an attempt on
the part of St. Ambrose of Milan to counteract the other popular chants
by introducing, as it were, congregational singing into the Church. But
there it remained, whilst the other spread and has retained its
original popular character. Thus, through Gothic Arianism, a certain
continuity of the dualistic and peculiar schismatic form of religious
teaching has been established.</p>
<p>Moreover, an historic explanation has been found for the origin and
spread of these doctrines, tales and fables. Put to the test, these
beast tales yield a dogmatic system which approximates in many points
to such heterodox teaching. The old Ebionite conception of Jesus, taken
up by Arius and afterwards adopted by the Manichaeans, sees in him only
a deified human being, and very little more can be found in these
tales. Jesus is seldom mentioned, and even then is more like a deified
all-powerful human being. God Himself is often treated as a simple
human being, almost like the Ialdabaoth of the Gnostics or the inferior
God of the Manichaean doctrine. With this, agrees also the notion of
the dualism in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>the creation of the world, <i>i.e.</i> that the
evil creatures, wolves, poisonous snakes, etc., are the work of the
Evil One. This was also the view held by the Priscillianites. There
seem to be, also, reminiscences of such myths as &ldquo;the world
tree,&rdquo; the wolf, etc., which are found in Teutonic mythology and
which may also be of an Oriental origin. The Rumanian tales are almost
a running commentary on Grimm&rsquo;s <i>German Mythology</i> (Germ.
4th ed. 1876, ch. xxiii. pp. 539&ndash;581), which ought to be read in
conjunction with the present volume. The legend of the Cuckoo, the
hoopoe referred to by Grimm, can be read here under No. 43.</p>
<p>It is significant that there is not a trace of Mariolatry in these
tales and fables. If anything, St. Mary appears in a character far from
loveable. She is easily offended, she does not spare her curses, she
takes umbrage easily at the slightest mishap. She is altogether very
disagreeable, just as in the apocryphal literature, where there is not
much room for her. Her intercession is invoked only in some Rumanian
charms and spells in a peculiar stereotyped form. But of real worship
there is scarcely any trace. Quite different is the position which the
Catholic Church assigned afterwards to St. Mary. She has become there
second to none outside the Trinity.</p>
<p>More prominently almost than any of these points, stands out the
fact that, underlying these creation and other tales, is the belief in
the transmigration of the human soul into an animal body&mdash;the
well-known belief in Metempsychosis, or change of human beings into
animals, so important a feature of Manichaean teaching, in which all
the heretical sects seem to have shared.</p>
<p>It is impossible now to follow this question further. I am satisfied
to have indicated the r&ocirc;le which the Goths may have played in the
preparation for the dissemination of special myths and legends, branded
as heretical, which other sectaries had brought from the East and
propagated in the West of Europe.</p>
<p>As to possible ethnical and geographical continuity, it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>may be
remarked that the places where these tales are found were also the
homesteads of the Goths, in which they dwelt for at least two or three
hundred years. They were then after a short interval almost supplanted
by the Slavs. It is a moot point how long the Rumanians have dwelt
there, and when they were converted to Christianity. Not a single old
Teutonic word has hitherto been found in the Rumanian language. Any
direct contact or convivium of any length of time is thus excluded. The
tales may have been remnants carried along from Illyricum across the
Danube by the new missionaries of the dualistic doctrine. The problem
would be less intricate if we only knew anything definite about Gothic
heathen and Christian mythology.</p>
<p>With the Cathars and Bogomils we are on more solid ground. This new
stream of similar traditions was brought by a similar religious
movement and was propagated by identical means&mdash;viz. writings and
songs in the language of the people, legends and tales and a simple
creed understood by all.</p>
<p>It may be asked, if this theory is correct, if these tales and
legends were brought first into Thrace and then spread from that
country to the other nations, how does it come to pass that so few
traces of them can be found in Greek folk-lore? Paradoxical as it may
sound, the absence of such creation and other legends and tales from
the Greek folk-lore is, if anything, a further proof of the accuracy of
the theory advanced. It must be remembered that there was no more
ruthless persecution of ancient paganism, idolatry, ceremonies and
legends than that carried out by the Greek Church against anything that
reminded them of the Hellenic or pagan past. Nothing was spared,
neither shrines nor books. The Greek&rsquo;s subtle mind devised the
first thorough system of heresy-hunting and persecution. It ranged from
polemical and harmless dialogues to the handing over of the so-called
heretics to fire and sword. The secular power was there more than
anywhere else the representative of the religious power, and justified
its existence, as it were, only as the executor of the Church&rsquo;s
mandate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>One has only to read about the innumerable decrees of councils and
synods, to see the way in which Manichaeism, Arianism and Gnosticism in
every shape and form were mercilessly uprooted, and to understand that
this fight did not stop at Bogomilism. The polemics were carried out
even down to the time of Eutemios Zygabenos and even the Emperors on
the throne of Byzance did not consider it below their dignity to combat
heretical teaching, the followers of which were given no pardon. There
was also another factor which militated against the success of the
Gnostic teaching&mdash;the literary past of the Greeks. To the
circulation of apocryphal books and legendary tales, the Greeks were
able to oppose a vast literary array. In Greece the Bogomils did not
deal with simple-minded, illiterate folk at the beginning of whose
literature they stood; on the contrary, they had to fight against an
ancient influential literature, and against minds trained in the
subtlest dialectics. They could not, therefore, succeed so easily, if
at all.</p>
<p>Quite different were the conditions of the other nations with which
they came in contact. None of these had yet more than the very
beginnings of a literature. They were rude, simple-minded folk, and
wherever the Greek Church or Greek Emperors did not wield any influence
at all, as it happened in the Bulgaro-Vallachian kingdom established by
Peter and Asan (1185 to 1257), the Bogomils had an easy task. For
centuries, then, the Rumanians formed with the Bulgarians not only a
religious, but also a political unity. The Bulgaro-Vallachian kingdom
stretched from the Haemus to the Carpathians, and down to the end of
the seventeenth century Slavonic was the official language of State and
Church in Rumania. There could not have been a more close intimacy than
between these two nations, despite the difference of the language which
each of them spoke. They had their literature in common, and no doubt
shared the same traditions. Bogomilism was just as rife in Vallachia as
it was in Bulgaria. Even the written literature of Rumania shows how
profound its influence has been: still more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>so does
the oral literature of tales and legends, of fables and beliefs. Though
the Bogomils did not bring Christianity to these peoples, for they were
Christians, they brought at any rate a kind of religion to the mass of
the folk. It was one of their own making and in their own image. It was
clothed in beautiful tales, and answered the expectations of the rank
and file, satisfied their curiosity, and gave them a glimpse of the
moral beauty underlying the work of creation. In a way, it tended to
purify the heart and to elevate the soul by allegories, parables and
apologues, and thus it found ready acceptance, and struck deep root in
the heart of the people, unaffected by decrees of Councils and by the
fanatical intolerance of the established Church.</p>
<p>Not so successful, therefore, if successful at all, was the fight of
the Greek Church against the heretical sects even in the Balkan
Peninsula, where they were so numerous and so powerful. They persisted
down to the time of the capture of Constantinople and the Turkish rule.
A large number of the aristocracy in Bosnia and Dalmatia still adhered
to the teaching of the Cathars, and when the Turks occupied the country
in the sixteenth century, the majority of them embraced Islam, instead
of entering either the Catholic or the Greek Church. A whole mass of
apocryphal and spurious literature placed on the Index, has been
preserved in Slavonic and Rumanian texts with outspoken dualistic
views. Many of them have found their way into the <i>Lucidaria</i>, or
&ldquo;Questions and Answers,&rdquo; a kind of catechism, very popular
among the nations of the Balkans, the Rumanians and the Russians.
Similar <i>Lucidaria</i> were known in the West, but there they have
been thoroughly expurgated, whilst, in the above-mentioned
&ldquo;questions,&rdquo; many an answer is found to which no orthodox
Church would subscribe, but which form now a popular living belief
among these nations. The political lethargy which settled upon most of
these nations after the Turkish conquest created a happy brooding-place
for such tales, and thus it can easily be understood why they have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>lived to this very day practically undisturbed and
little changed.</p>
<p>To those who have followed the history of the religious development
of the Russians, it will therefore not be surprising to find among
their popular tales a number of variants closely allied to the Rumanian
animal tales, and, what is of the utmost importance in this connection,
not a few of the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; tales. No country perhaps has
been so much torn by religious discussions and sects as Russia. The
number of sects is legion. The most extraordinary notions, extreme
views on dogma and practice, heterodox principles expressed in worship,
belief and popular song or tale are all found in Russia: unadulterated
Dualism, Bogomilism, Manichaean teaching are openly professed by a
number of the sects persecuted and condemned by the Orthodox Church.
Almost all the books condemned as heretical in the early <i lang=
"la">Indices Expurgatoria</i> put forth by Councils and Church
Assemblies, have been preserved almost intact in the old Slavonic and
Russian language, and the religious and epic songs of the
&ldquo;blind&rdquo; minstrels of Russia are full of the legendary lore
of those heterodox sects. This fact has been established beyond doubt
by the researches of Russian scholars, and notably by Wesselofsky.
Among the Russians, then, we find the nearest parallels to the Rumanian
&ldquo;creation&rdquo; stories; a clear evidence of common origin, both
drawing upon the same source of information; the religious in the form
of apologues, legends and tales, so prominent a feature of heterodox
propaganda.</p>
<p>The weapons used by the Catholic Church in its persecution of
heretical sects are, almost every one of them, borrowed from the Greek
armoury. One learns to know this fact more and more from a closer
enquiry into the inner history of Byzance, its laws, decrees,
administration and practice. And, precisely the same influence
destroyed later the heretical teaching in the West as it destroyed it
among the Greeks. The power of the Church and the secular arm were both
used ruthlessly for exterminating any idea or any belief that ran
counter to the doctrines taught by the established Church. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>The
Cathars had also a much more difficult task in converting the East of
Europe, inasmuch as they were also confronted there by some amount of
literary tradition. Illiterate as were the masses, there were still
among them and among their clerics, men of ability, men of learning,
men trained in the scholastic schools, able, if not to refute, at any
rate to confuse, the strange doctrine.</p>
<p>All these forces combined, produced in the East the same result as
they have produced among the Greeks. We are thus on the track of one of
the most important sources of Western European folk-lore, always
remembering that the medium in which this propaganda flourished
differed considerably in the West from that in the East. In the former
such propaganda met with a more ancient layer of well-established
literary tradition. The Catholic Church, as mentioned above, was first
in possession. It was not a <i lang="la">tabula rasa</i> on which the
new teaching could be written, but yet that which existed was
profoundly modified and a new fund of highly poetic yet popular
material was added to the small store of knowledge possessed by the
common people. But in time the Church took up the challenge, and
remorselessly hunted down the apostles of popular heterodox teaching,
just as the Greeks had done, going even further. It punished with sword
and fire the followers of unauthorised practices, and branded every
deviation from the strait path as rank heresy. The books containing
legends and tales were burnt, and their possessors were often treated
in like fashion.</p>
<p>Inquisition, Church and other influences helped, as already
mentioned, to destroy them. In the tragedy of heresy-hunting and
burning of witches, the charge of devil worship was the basic
principle, the chief head of accusation. It was clearly devised against
the followers of the dualistic teaching. To tell a tale like any of
these Rumanian &ldquo;creation&rdquo; tales, would have been inviting
the heaviest punishment&mdash;to believe in it would have meant sure
death. No wonder that they disappeared quickly, or were changed into
harmless satires, as in the Reynard Cycle, or were even used for
political cartoons, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>in broadsides, like the Cock Robin Cycle in
the time of Charles II., which, when transplanted to Russia, became a
political lampoon on Peter and his Court.</p>
<p>Heresy-hunting becomes a popular distraction only when the official
clergy find it profitable to make it so, and when the people are made
to trace their own ills and troubles, their losses in field and stable,
to the evil machinations of these tools of the devil. So long as they
are not suffering in body or purse, the folk are absolutely indifferent
to dogmas, and they will eagerly accept anything that pleases them. It
will therefore not come as a surprise, in view of what has been stated,
if we find some weird conceptions among the Rumanian peasantry.</p>
<p>Studied from the point of view of heresiology or rather of popular
psychology, some of these tales will appear to us as so many living
records of the great spiritual movement, which for centuries dominated
Europe, and which has since died out.</p>
<p>Too little attention has been given hitherto to the influence of
those numerous sects, which stretched from Asia Minor to the south of
France, and overflowed even into England. Their dualism, the strong
belief in the Power of Evil, Satan and his host, the consequent duty of
the faithful to banish him or to subdue him, thus developed into belief
in sorcery and witchcraft, with the attending horrors of the
Inquisition.</p>
<p>Then came a period of wider education still less tolerant of old
women&rsquo;s superstition and nursery tales. What was left still
standing has been, and is being, finally destroyed by our modern
schools and schoolmasters. From this dire fate, the folk-lore of the
nearer East has as yet been preserved. The importance of the study of
folk-lore has happily been recognised in those countries, early enough
to stop the blight which had set in and which threatened to destroy it
more ruthlessly than even in the West. The modern &ldquo;man of
science&rdquo; is a more relentless iconoclast than the religious
fanatic. He starts from the mind in his attempt to destroy folk-lore,
using to this end cold reasoning, logical conclusions, spiritual
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>prepossession and intolerance. The religious
fanatic starts from the heart, with overwhelming passion, fiery zeal,
unreasoning hatred, from which there is a possible escape for mysticism
and mythical lore, whilst from the former there is none. Happily, our
science of folk-lore with its deep sympathy and profound appreciation
of these manifestations of the popular psyche has come in the nick of
time to rescue from total extinction what the schoolmaster and the
heresy-hunter have not yet annihilated.</p>
<p>I turn now to another aspect of these bird and beast tales. If, as I
believe, they show us what is at the back of the mind of the people,
they are of invaluable service to the student of anthropology, above
all to him who seeks enlightenment in the grave problems of education
and civilization; and they are not without importance for the solution
of political problems.</p>
<p>Attempts are made&mdash;well meant, no doubt&mdash;to foist that
state of culture which the West calls &ldquo;modern
civilization,&rdquo; or &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; pure and simple,
upon the reluctant people of the Near and Far East. We are forgetful of
the fact that these nations have had a civilization of their own, and
that something more important is included in this forcible change than
the change of a dress.</p>
<p>As the outcome of a long-drawn battle between feudalism and modern
society, as a result of political and economic evolutions, the
civilization of the West, when introduced among nations that have not
gone through the same experience, acts like the Juggernaut car, which
crushes under its wheels the worshippers of this new god and destroys
at the same time the foundations of the old order of things. Only
students of folk-lore, those who try to reach the hidden depths, nay,
to penetrate the inner soul of the people, are in a position to judge
of the results of these civilizing attempts. They can compare the past
with the present, and draw a proper balance between gain and loss. Are
the people happier, more contented, more moral, and even more religious
after the change, than they were before it? Surely not. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>And if
not, why not? The answer is very simple: because in this violent change
no tenderness is shown to those beliefs and practices which are dear to
the people and which help to lighten the burden of life by innocent
mirth and the wholesome play of fancy. Wire brooms may sweep well; but
they may do it too well, and they can sweep everything away, leaving
the home bare and the gardens stripped of every leaf and flower.</p>
<p>A few words concerning the order and grouping of these tales. They
have been arranged in three main groups. The first comprises those
tales which I have characterised as creation legends. In them the
origin of birds, beasts and insects is explained as the result of some
direct act of God, or the Saints, or the Devil. An attempt has been
made to follow a certain chronological order. Those tales stand first
in which God is acting at the beginning of the creation. Then,
following the Biblical order, the legends connected with the persons of
sacred history from Adam to the Apostles, including St. Mary and St.
Anne. Mystical Christmas carols or rather epic ballads, in which
similar subjects are treated, have been inserted between the legends.
The second section comprises such legends as are more like fairy tales.
The mythical personages are no longer those known through the
Scriptures. On the contrary, there are in these tales reminiscences of
ancient heathen gods and heroes, chief among them being Alexander the
Great.</p>
<p>In the third section the animal fables are grouped together. It is
the literature of the apologues without any framework or moral setting.
The parallels, as far as could be found, are given briefly at the end
of each legend, tale or fable. I have striven to be concise in my
references to the best-known collections of tales, such as Grimm, Hahn,
Cosquin, and Gonzenbach, where the student of fairy tales can easily
find the whole comparative literature.</p>
<p>For the genuine and unadulterated popular origin of these tales I
can vouch absolutely. Some I have heard in my early youth, but the
majority have been culled from the works <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>of S. Fl. Marian
(<i lang="ro">Ornitologia poporan&#259; Rom&acirc;n&#259;</i>, 2 vols.,
Cern&#259;u&#355;&#301; 1883; and <i lang="ro">Insectele</i>, Bucharest
1903), than whom a more painstaking trustworthy collector could not be
imagined. Some have been taken from the <i>Folk-lore reviews,
&#350;ezatoarea</i>, ed. by A. Gorovei (i.&ndash;xii., F&#259;lticeni
1892 to 1912), and <i>Ion Creanga</i>, published by the Society of that
name (i.&ndash;viii., Barlad 1908&ndash;1915). Anton Pann (<i lang=
"ro">Poveste si istoriaire</i>, Bucharest 1836) has given us a few
stories, as well as A. and A. Schott (<i lang="de">Walachische
Maehrchen</i>, Stuttgart and T&uuml;bingen 1845). The Pilgrimage of the
Soul is from S. Mangiuca, <i lang="ro">C&#259;lindariu</i>, pe. 1882,
Bra&#351;iovu 1881 and the Story of Man and his Years, No. 113, from M.
Gaster, <i lang="ro">Chrestomatie Rom&#259;na</i>, vol. ii., Bucharest
1891. These tales have been collected from every country where
Rumanians live, not only in the Kingdom of Rumania, but also from the
Rumanians of Transylvania and Bukovina, as well as from the
Kutzo-Vlachs of Macedonia.</p>
<p>I have added a few charms and also a few more mystical religious
songs and carols, which throw light on some of the beliefs underlying
the tales and legends, taken mostly from the great collection of G.
Dem. Teodorescu (<i lang="ro">Poesii Popularare Rom&#259;ne</i>,
Bucharest 1885).</p>
<p>In some cases I have given also variants of the same tale.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to render the stories as faithfully as the spirit
of the Rumanian and English languages allows, and I fear that I have on
sundry occasions forced the latter in my desire to preserve as far as
possible the quaintness and the flavour of the Rumanian original.</p>
<p>There is one characteristic feature in the collection of animal
tales and legends given here, upon which I should like to lay great
stress, and that is the complete purity which pervades them all. There
is no playing with moral principles. No double meaning is attached to
any story: and this, to my mind, is the best proof of their popular
origin. These tales are not sullied by a morbid imagination, nor
contaminated by sexual problems. The people are pure at heart and in
the stories their simplicity and purity appear most beautifully.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>In these tales and legends we have syncretism in full swing. It is
not a picture of the past which we have to piece laboriously together
from half-forgotten records, from writing half obliterated by the
action of time and by changes which have swept over those nations of
the past, whose life and thought we are endeavouring to conjure up and
to understand. In our midst, at our door, under our own eyes, this
process of mixing and adjusting, of change and evolution, of
differentiation, combination and assimilation is still going on. It is
a wonderful picture for any one who is able to discover the forces that
are at work, who can trace every strand of the webbing, every thread in
the woof and warp, to its immediate and to its remoter source. We see
the shuttle of human imagination, of human belief, flying busily
through the loom, charged at one time with one thread, at another with
a different one. Many of the ways of the human mind meet here, cross
one another, and new roads are thus created by busy wayfarers. And thus
paganism sustains a busy and robust life. The old Pantheon is still
peopled with the old gods, or, shall we better say, the Pandaemonium in
its highest and best sense is displaying itself with unexpected vigour.
The heathen gods, the Christian saints, God and the devil legends,
fairy tales, oriental imagery, mystical traditions and astrological
lore are all inextricably blended together. The line of demarcation
between man and animal has not been clearly drawn, or it has not yet
been attempted<span class="corr" id="xd21e2374" title=
"Not in source">.</span> These multifarious elements have not yet been
combined into one homogeneous structure. The problem arises whether
other nations have also passed through a similar mental and psychical
process; whether they have had a similar Pandaemonic mixture, out of
which their more colourless folk-lore had been distilled in the
crucible of &ldquo;civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Primitive people can often hear the footfall of men by putting the
ear to the ground. We may, by putting an ear to the ground, hear the
footfalls of the Past, and listen to the echo before it dies away into
eternity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

<h2 class="super">BIRD AND BEAST STORIES</h2>
<h2 class="label">I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE BEE BLACK, AND WHY IS IT MAKING HONEY? HOW
DID THE BEE OUTWIT THE DEVIL?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning only water and God and the devil
existed. These two were all the time moving about upon the surface of
the waters. After some time God, feeling rather tired of this flitting
about without rest or peace, said to the devil, &ldquo;Go down to the
bottom of the sea and bring up in my name a handful of the seed of the
earth.&rdquo; The devil did as he was told, but whilst he was plunging
in the depths he said to himself, &ldquo;Why shall I bring up the seed
in his name? I will take it in my own.&rdquo; And so he did. When he
came up God asked him, &ldquo;Hast thou brought the seed?&rdquo; The
devil replied, &ldquo;Yes, here it is.&rdquo; But when he opened his
hand to show the seed to God, lo, it was quite empty. The water had
wasted the seed away.</p>
<p>Then God told him to plunge again and bring up the seed of the earth
in his name. The devil, however, again took the seed from the bottom of
the sea in his own name, and when he opened his hand to give the seed
to God the waters had again washed his hand clean. For a third time God
sent him down to the bottom of the sea to bring up seed. This time the
devil bethought himself, and instead of taking the seed in his own name
as he had determined, now took it in God&rsquo;s name and in his own.
He would not do it in God&rsquo;s name alone. When he came up the
waters had this time also washed everything away that he had taken in
his hand. Only a few grains, however, remained under the nails of his
fingers. God asked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"
name="pb62">62</a>]</span>him whether he had brought the seed up, and
he replied &ldquo;To be sure.&rdquo; But when he opened his hand it was
again empty. Still, there were the few grains which had stuck under the
nails. God greatly rejoiced at these few, which he carefully scraped
out from under the nails, and made of them a small cake which he put
upon the water, where it floated, and God sat upon it to rest. Being
now very tired, God fell asleep on that little cake of earth. When the
devil saw God fast asleep, what did the unclean one think? &ldquo;What
a lucky thing that is for me,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I can
now drown him.&rdquo; And so he tried to turn the cake over, so that
God should fall into the water. But what happened? In whatever
direction God rolled, the cake of earth expanded and stretched under
him. He first rolled him towards the east, and the earth grew under
God. The devil then tried to upset the cake towards the west, and again
the earth stretched under God. Now, said the devil, &ldquo;Now there is
also room for me to rest,&rdquo; and he sat down on the opposite side
where the earth had grown bigger. There again he endeavoured with all
his weight to press down the earth, so as to make the earth turn
turtle, once towards the north, once towards the south; and God rolled
towards them and the earth grew in all directions.</p>
<p>Now by this continual rolling the earth grew so big that it became
wider and larger than the waters. When God awoke and saw what the devil
had done he did not know what to do with this huge earth, which had
become far too big. The devil, seeing what he had done, and being
afraid of God&rsquo;s wrath, ran away and hid himself in one of the
clefts of the earth. God then decided to ask the devil what he was to
do with this earth, which had become so big.</p>
<p>Now, of all the beasts and creatures which God had made, none was
more pleasing in his sight than the bee, which was then playing in
Paradise.</p>
<p>The bee was white, and not black as she is now, and I will tell you
presently how it came about that she changed her colour. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>God sent the bee to ask the devil what he was to do and what good
advice he could give him. The bee, at once, went as she was commanded,
and came to the place where the devil lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, uncle,&rdquo; said the bee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sister,&rdquo; said the devil. &ldquo;What has
brought thee to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, God has sent me to ask what he was to do with
this huge earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the devil grumpily and sneeringly replied, &ldquo;If he is God
he ought to know better than to ask a poor devil for advice. I am not
going to tell him. Let him find it out for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bee, who was a clever little thing&mdash;it was not for nothing
that God&rsquo;s choice had fallen upon her&mdash;pretended to fly
away. But she soon crept back quite stealthily and settled noiselessly
on the upper beam of the door. She knew that the devil cannot keep any
secrets, and he would surely speak out. So, indeed, it happened. No
sooner did he believe himself alone, than he started muttering to
himself, chuckling all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever man that God really is. He asks me what to do. Why
does he not think of mountains and valleys?&rdquo; You must know that
the earth when first made was quite flat, like a pancake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him take the earth in his arms and squeeze it a bit, and
it will fit all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bee overheard what he said, for he spoke loud enough, and
rejoicing that she had got the answer, spread out her wings and started
flying away. The buzzing of her wings betrayed her, and the devil,
hearing the noise, rushed out of his cave with his whip in his hand and
said: &ldquo;O you thief! So that is the way you have cheated me. Mayst
thou feed on what comes out of thy body.&rdquo; And he struck the bee
with his whip.</p>
<p>This changed her white colour into black. Moreover, he hit her so
badly that he nearly cut her in two. That is why <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>the bee
has such a narrow waist, that she looks as if she were cut in two and
barely hanging together by a thread.</p>
<p>Limping and sore, the bee came back to God and told him what she had
overheard from the devil. God was greatly pleased and, squeezing the
earth in his arms, he made mountains and valleys, and the earth grew
smaller.</p>
<p>Then turning to the bee he said, &ldquo;Out of thy body henceforth
shall come only honey to sweeten the life of man and he shall bless
thee for that gift; also shalt thou bring forth wax for candles on the
altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God went on to ask the bee what reward she would claim for the
errand which she had so well fulfilled. The bee, impudent and greedy,
replied: &ldquo;Why should man share in my gift and have my honey? Give
me the power to kill with my sting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God was angry at the impudence of the bee, and replied:
&ldquo;All the honey shall be thine alone, if thou art able to make a
gallon of it during the summer: if not, man may share it with thee. And
because thou hast asked for the power of killing with thy sting,
meaning to kill man by it, thine own death shall be by thy
sting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the reason why the bees work so industriously and
indefatigably during the summer. Each hopes to make a gallon of honey,
but they can never succeed. And this, too, is the reason why the bee
dies when it stings anyone.</p>
<p>There is another variant of the cosmogonic part.</p>
<p>The place of the devil is taken by the mole<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2438src" href="#xd21e2438" name="xd21e2438src">1</a> whom the
Rumanians believe to be a very deep fellow.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The story then runs as follows:</p>
<p>When God had made the heavens there was as yet no earth. So God took
a ball of string and measured the span of heaven. Then he called the
mole and told him to keep the ball whilst <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>he was busy making the
earth, according to the measure which he had taken. But whilst God went
on measuring by the string which he had rolled off the ball, the mole
very slyly let the ball roll on whilst God was tugging at the string.
And so it came to pass that the earth made thus by God was larger than
the span of heaven, and could not be got under it.</p>
<p>The mole, seeing what he had done, went away and hid himself in his
earth. Hither the bee was sent to get the secret from him how the earth
could be made smaller.</p>
<p>The story then runs on like the one just told, without the
explanation of the dark colour and of the narrow waist. Nor is any
reference made in that version to the sting and the gallon of
honey.</p>
<p>The dualistic conception of the creation of the world is here
clearly set out. The people believe in it. In the formation of the
earth the devil has his full, nay an equal share, though he always is
fooled in the end and is cheated even by a little bee.</p>
<p>To this creation story a few variants can be found among the
Bulgarians and Letts, but they are neither so full nor so complete as
the Rumanian version.</p>
<p>They are given by <span class="corr" id="xd21e2462" title=
"Source: Dahnhardt">D&auml;hnhardt</span>, <i lang="de">Natursagen</i>,
i. pp. 127&ndash;128 (Leipzig and Berlin 1907). The first part of the
story of the devil being sent down to bring up seed from the bottom,
and only that part, is found among the Gipsy tales from Transylvania,
published by Wlislocki, <i lang="de">Zigeuner-m&auml;rchen aus
Transylvania</i>, p. 1, No. 1.</p>
<p>Among the Russians, Ralston gives a short variant in which only God
and the devil are mentioned, nothing of the bee, and even the first
part is extremely short. (<i>Russian Folk Tales</i>, p. 329, London
1873.)</p>
<p>The existence of hills is accounted for by legendary lore in this
wise. When the Lord was about to fashion the face of the earth he
ordered the devil to dive into the watery depths and bring thence a
handful of the soil he found at the bottom. The devil obeyed, but when
he filled his hand he filled his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>mouth also. The Lord took the
soil, sprinkled it around, and the earth appeared, all perfectly flat.
The devil, whose mouth was quite full, looked on for some time in
silence. At last he tried to speak, but choked, and fled in terror.
After him followed the thunder and lightning, and so he rushed over the
whole face of the earth, hills springing up where he coughed, and
sky-cleaving mountains where he leaped. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

literally hedgehog, but no doubt the mole who burrows under the ground

the two animals are also confused with one another.</p>

<h2 class="main">HOW DID THE BEE OUTWIT THE MOLE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Another Version.</span></p>
<p>When the Lord made the heavens he took a ball and spanned the
heavens, and after he had finished spanning the heavens he started
making the earth. The mole, cunning little beast, came to him and said:
&ldquo;O Lord, let me help thee in making the earth&rdquo;; and the
Lord, who is always good, said in the goodness of his heart:
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and he gave the ball to the mole to keep
it.</p>
<p>The Lord started working, and was busy weaving and working making
the earth. But the sly mole let just a little bit of the thread go from
time to time, and the Lord worked on without noticing it. When he had
finished, how great was his astonishment when he found that the earth
was greater than the heavens. What was he to do? how could he fit them
together? He turned to the mole, but the mole was not there; he knew
what was coming and had buried himself deep down in the earth. So the
Lord walked up and down the earth, but could not find him. What was he
to do? At last he sent the bee to discover the mole and to find out
from him what was to be done. The bee flew away alone, and, buzzing
about, at last came to the hole where the mole was sitting buried in
the earth.</p>
<p>The bee came to him and said, &ldquo;Good morning, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings thee to me, my sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Lord God has sent me to ask
thee what is to be done. The earth is so big and the heavens so
small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mole, a sly beast, chuckled and said to himself, &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>Lord ought to know better than I. I am not going
to tell him, though I know what ought to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bee would not take this answer. She pretended to fly away, and
then went stealthily and settled herself in a flower which was near to
the mole&rsquo;s burrow. She knew that the mole would talk to himself,
and hoped to overhear what he would say.</p>
<p>So in sooth it happened. The bee overheard him chuckling and
laughing and saying to himself: &ldquo;Oh what a clever fellow I am! if
I had to do it, I would take the earth in my arms and squeeze it
tightly, and then mountains would be pressed out and valleys would be
sunk, and then the earth would get small enough to fit under the
heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the bee heard what the mole had said, than she started
flying away. The mole, who heard her buzzing, ran after her and said:
&ldquo;O sister, is that the way thou art dealing with me? Very well
then, now take my curse. Henceforth thou shalt feed on
thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bee never listened, and flew straight to the Lord and told
him what she had heard when the mole muttered to himself. And the Lord
took the earth in his hands and squeezed it, and from the flat that it
was, mountains rose up and valleys were cut, and it fitted the heavens
which God had spanned. And God, hearing of the curse with which the
mole has cursed the bee, turned it into a blessing. That is why the bee
makes honey and feeds on itself, whilst the mole always lives
underground and is frightened to see the sky. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Widow and her two
Children.</span></p>
<p>There is still another story about <i>the origin of the bee</i>,
totally different from those told hitherto.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time there lived a very poor widow. She had only two
children, a son and a daughter. When they had grown up, seeing that
their mother could no longer provide for them, they left her house and
went each one his or her way to find work. The girl went to a place
where they were building houses, and there she worked day and night
carrying bricks and mortar to the builders. The son went to a weaver
and learnt there to weave clothes.</p>
<p>Not long after that, the mother grew very ill, and knowing that her
end was approaching, she sent for her children to come to her. When the
message reached the daughter, she was carrying a heavy load of bricks
in her apron.</p>
<p>She did not hesitate for a moment, and saying, &ldquo;I must not
leave my poor mother alone,&rdquo; she dropped the load of bricks and
ran home as fast as she could, and there she found her mother on the
point of death.</p>
<p>When the message reached the son, he was sitting at his weaving. He
said, &ldquo;Let her die. I cannot give up my work. Here I am, and here
I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there he stayed quite alone, working away, surly and grumbling
all the time.</p>
<p>When the mother saw her daughter, who had left everything and had
come to her, she raised herself on her bed and, kissing her on the
forehead, blessed her, saying: &ldquo;Daughter, thou <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>hast
been sweet to me and a joy in my last hour. Mayst thou always be sweet
to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she heard what her son had said, and why he had not come, she
cursed him and said: &ldquo;As thou hast said so shall it go with thee.
Day and night shalt thou be weaving incessantly and never see the joy
of it: what thou doest, others shall destroy. In a corner shalt thou
sit, far away from everybody, and hated by everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words she died, and her blessing and curse both came
true. The girl was changed into the busy active bee, whose honey
sweetens everything, and of whose wax candles are made to be lit before
the ikons of the saints and in the churches, and put by the head of the
dying and the dead. The brother was changed into the spider, who sits
alone and sullen and spiteful in the corner and weaves his webs, never
finishing: whoever sees a web brushes it away, and whoever can, kills
the spider.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>To this story I have not been able to find a parallel. A different
kind of curse seems to rest on the spider, according to the legend of
the &ldquo;Lady Mary and the Spider,&rdquo; No. 54. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Bee and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>When God created the bee she was white of colour, hence her name
<i>albina</i>, the white one. One day, however, God sent the bee to the
Evil One to ask him for his advice, whether God should make one sun or
several. The bee went to the Evil One and told him God&rsquo;s message.
Then she slyly hid herself in his bushy hair, for the bee knew that he
would talk to himself aloud, and she would be able to find out his true
thought. And so it happened: for no sooner did he think that the bee
was not within earshot, than he started talking aloud to himself and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One sun is better than a number of suns, for if there were a
number of suns the heat would be much greater than my fire and I should
not be able to torture and to burn. Then, too, if there were several
suns, they would shine all day and all night, and the people would not
be able to fall into my power. One sun would be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bee had heard his reasoning and the conclusion to which he
had come, she started flying back to God. As she started, the Evil One
heard her buzz and, filled with anger at the trick which the bee had
played him, he struck her across the body with his whip. The white
colour was then turned black and the body of the bee nearly cut in
twain. The waist became as thin as a thread. In the beginning it was
white, and hence the name. It is due to the merit of the bee that there
is only one sun now in the heavens and not many. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Bulgarian parallel it is not a question as to how many suns
were to be created but whether the sun is to get married. The story is
as follows (D&auml;hnhardt, <i lang="de">Natursagen</i>, Leipzig u.
Berlin 1907, i. p. 127):</p>
<p>When God grew old he wanted to marry the sun. He invited all the
creatures. Among them also the devil, but he saddled his ass and rode
away angrily. Then God sent the bee to find out the thought of the
devil. The bee settled on his head and heard him mumble to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it is a long time since God had remembered me, who
helped him in the making of the world, but he does not know what he is
doing now. If he marries the sun he will destroy mankind and burn up
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bee heard it, and flying away went to God. The devil noticed her
and, thinking that she had overheard what he was saying, wanted to kill
her. He ran after her and shot at her. The bee hid herself in a willow
tree. After trying many times, he at last hit her and cut her in two.
With difficulty she reached God and told him what had happened.</p>
<p>The Lord blessed her and said, &ldquo;The lower part shall be thy
best and the upper part may remain as it is;&rdquo; and he joined the
two parts together. God thereupon stopped the wedding, and the sun has
remained an unmarried maiden to this very day, whilst the bee is making
honey even now.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The story of the marriage of the sun does not concern us here. In a
different form it occurs in <i>Rumanian Fairy Tales</i>, where we are
told that sun and moon were a brother and sister. They wished to woo
one another, but God forbade it, and therefore God put them in the
heavens and changed them into sun and moon, which never meet. When one
rises the other sets. (L. Saineanu, <i lang="ro">Basmele
Rom&acirc;ne</i>, Bucur 1895, p. 398.) Other mythical references to sun
and moon, and the way in which the devil tries to steal them from
Paradise, will be found in the Carol given below, No. 15. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Fallen Angel and the
Maiden.</span></p>
<p>When God had created the world, men multiplied. There were then
towns and hamlets and gardens and fields. So one day a band of angels
came to the Lord and said: &ldquo;O Lord, let us see the world which we
now see only from afar. Grant us in thy infinite mercy that we may go
down and see it more closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Lord in his infinite love granted their request, although he
who knows everything knew what would happen to them hereafter. And the
angels came down and mixed with the men and women and rejoiced at
everything they saw. After a time God Almighty came down to them and
told them that the time for their return to heaven had come. The angels
gathered together in a joyful band and went up to heaven. But there was
one angel who did not share in their joy. He walked sadly and
alone.</p>
<p>God asked every one of the angels what they had seen. And one told
him of the flowers and their sweet smell, and another one told of the
fruit and a third of the singing birds. Everyone had a pleasant tale to
tell. When the turn came of that angel who was walking sadly in that
joyful company, the Lord asked him whether he had anything to tell, and
whether he would like to return to heaven as his companions did, to
which he replied that he would prefer to remain on earth, for he would
not like to go back to heaven. And the good God asked him why he was so
sad and why he would prefer to remain in this world. The angel
hesitated for a while, and then he said that he had looked too far into
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>eyes of a girl, eyes which were as the blue of
heaven, and he could not bear to go away from her. And the Lord asked
who she was, and the angel replied, &ldquo;A shepherdess feeding her
flock on a mountain.&rdquo; And the Lord asked him, &ldquo;Hast thou
spoken to her?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;I could not forbear doing
so.&rdquo; And the Lord asked him, &ldquo;What didst thou tell
her?&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;I said I would forego my angelic
station rather than leave her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord, who had up till then looked very young, suddenly turned
very old and careworn, and, after looking at him for a long time,
walked on slowly and silently with the band of angels. When they
reached the Gates of Heaven the Lord stopped short and, turning to the
angels, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can no longer enter the heavenly abode. You are bringing
tidings of the ways of the world which must not be heard by the other
angels. And as you liked the world, you shall continue to look at the
soul&rsquo;s doings.&rdquo; Thereupon the Lord changed the angels and
made them into stars, which he scattered all over the heavens, and from
there they smile joyfully and kindly upon the earth.</p>
<p>But the angel who wished to return did not turn into a pleasant,
twinkling little star. He turned into a fiery star that, always blazing
and unsteady, looked angrily at the other stars. At last the Lord,
fearing that there would be strife between them, cast the red star down
to the earth, and it came down on the meadow where the shepherdess was;
it came down as a shower over the whole field. But the sparks never
died out. The glow-worms carry them still. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Devil hurled down
from Heaven.</span></p>
<p>Another legend about the origin of the glow-worm is of a similar
character. I will discuss later the possible origin, which will lead us
to the same remarkable results.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The time of separation between the good and the evil angels had
come. The good ones gathered to the right, and the evil ones, under the
leadership of the devil, gathered to the left. You can imagine what a
confusion and uproar there was, for they could not easily disentangle
themselves.</p>
<p>Whilst that confusion went on, there was a little devil who, after
all, did not like parting with the bliss of heaven. So what did he do?
He stole away from his own companions and hid himself among the good
angels, hoping that, by one way or another, he would get into heaven.
But he had not reckoned with St. Peter, who stands at the gate of
heaven and examines and searches every one asking leave of entrance.
Each angel had to present his pass, duly signed. St. Peter examined the
signature, and when he found it correct he allowed the angel to enter
heaven. So, one by one, they passed on, until the turn of the little
devil came. In vain did he protest that he was a good angel. He had to
produce his papers, and when St. Peter came to the end, there was no
proper signature. So St. Peter got very angry, and without much ado,
got hold of the little devil and cast him down to earth. He came down
with such violence that he broke up in millions of luminous sparks, and
these are the lights of the glow-worm. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE LITTLE WORM GLOW?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of St. Peter and the
Cuckoo.</span></p>
<p>The tale of the glow-worm tells us that in olden times the people
were better and the earth cleaner than to-day. It was on this account
that God&rsquo;s saints used to walk about upon the earth. The saints
and the apostles had also their establishments just as we have them
now, house, table, cattle, children and everything that appertains to
the house of man. The most important of the saints was St. Peter. He
used to walk about with God more than any of the others, but, like
every Rumanian, he also had his house and all that belongs to it, just
as beseems one of God&rsquo;s saints. The tale from our forefathers
tells us that, among other things, he also had a stable full of
beautiful horses; black of skin like the raven&rsquo;s wing, and quick
as the flame, they were eating up the clouds, so fleet were they. In
those times, unfortunately, as in our times, besides saints, there were
also wicked people, thieves and the like, for the devil has had and
will always have his share in this world. But in those times there were
only a very few thieves, and they were very much ashamed of their
doings. They used to live in forests to which no one else went except
evil spirits. To-day&mdash;for our sins&mdash;the thieves are so
numerous that there is not a spot which is free of them. They rob you
everywhere; in the very midst of the town and in the open light of
day.</p>
<p>In those days, there lived a great thief, whose name was Cuckoo. I
do not know how it came to pass, but he heard of St. Peter&rsquo;s
horses and made up his mind to steal them. One day St. Peter had gone
on one of his usual journeys to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>distant part of the country.
Cuckoo, who had learned of it, came in the night and stole the horses
and drove them into the forest. On the morrow, by a mere chance, St.
Peter came home from his journey and asked about the horses. They were
nowhere to be found. Do what he might, he could not find them; they
were gone. But who had taken them, and whither had he gone with them?
St. Peter asked God to give him some powerful dogs to go with him to
the forest. God gave him the wolves, and from that time they have
remained St. Peter&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>He went with them into the forest and searched high and low, but all
in vain. All through the day they hunted, but could find no trace of
the thief or of the horses. Night fell, and it was one of those dark
nights in which you can put your finger into your eye and yet not see
it. It was blacker and darker than the blackness and darkness of hell.
St. Peter did not know which way to turn, and he asked God to perform
some miracle for him to light up his way. God heard his prayer, and
before one could wipe one&rsquo;s eyes the whole forest was full of
glow-worms. St. Peter greatly rejoiced, and by the light of the
glow-worms he searched the forest all the night through, but returned
home with empty hands. Then St. Peter cursed the thief Cuckoo, that he
should be changed into a black, ill-omened bird, and wherever he should
find himself he was to call out his name. Since then the cuckoo became
a black and accursed bird, and when it sings (calls) at the back of the
house or in the courtyard it betokens death. It speaks nothing else,
but calls its own name, Cuckoo. The cuckoo is frightened of the
glow-worms, and, as soon as he sees them in the forest he stops
calling, for he thinks St. Peter is looking out for him to catch him
for stealing his horses. At the same time the glow-worms were blessed
by St. Peter and made the guides of the wanderers through the forest.
They come out about St. Peter&rsquo;s day. Then the cuckoo keeps
silence.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In these glow-worm stories, much of the apocryphal literature
concerning the fall of the angels has been preserved. It is not,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>however, the pride of Satan that causes his
downfall, but it is the love of the earthly woman which causes the
angel to fall. The story in this form is found in the Hebrew versions
preserved in the <i>Chronicles of Jerahmeel</i> (my ed. London 1899,
ch. xxv. p. 52 ff.), and in other kindred books, from which it has
passed through the Greek into the Slavonic apocryphal literature. The
contest between the devil and angels is, however, not unknown. It is
referred to here rather humorously in the story of the little devil who
wanted to steal slily into heaven in the rush and is detected by the
wily Peter. It is also referred to in the Dragon-fly story, No. 14.
Curiously enough, very little of it seems to have been preserved in
Slavonic literature. In Albanian literature a faint trace is recorded
by Hahn (ii. No. 107), where the connection with the Wolf story is
entirely missing, and therefore inexplicable there. But the fragmentary
Albanian tale is fully set out here in the Rumanian version about the
creation of the wolf, Nos. 7, 8, 9. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE WOLF FEROCIOUS?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God, St. Peter and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time God was walking with St. Peter. On the way they met
a dog who came close to them and frolicked round them, and God stroked
the animal. St. Peter looked at God questioningly, and God said,
&ldquo;I know what is in thy mind, but since thou art he who keeps the
key of heaven it is meet that thou shouldst know everything, and I will
therefore tell thee the story of the dog and the wolf, for thou must
know whom to let into heaven and whom to shut out. Thou seest, Peter,
what that brother of mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the devil?&rdquo; interposed St. Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;I mean him. You see what he has
done to me with Adam and Eve, and how he made me drive them out of
Paradise. What was I to do? When the poor man was starving I had to
help him, so I gave him the sheep to feed him and to clothe him. But
dost thou think the devil will give them peace?&mdash;no, not
he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;all very well, but what about
the dog? I know all that about Adam and Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be in such a hurry,&rdquo; replied God, &ldquo;I will
tell thee everything; bide thy time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where was I? It was when I made the sheep, and the devil
then must again try and do something to hurt Adam, so he is now making
the wolf, who will destroy the sheep and bring Adam and Eve to grief.
For that reason I have made the dog, and he will drive the wolf away
and protect the flocks of sheep, and will be friendly to man, whose
property he will guard with faithfulness.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>St. Peter said, &ldquo;I know that in thy goodness thou art going
again to help the devil, as thou hast done aforetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil had made many things aforetime, but could not give them
life or movement, and it was always God who helped and completed the
work. Thus the devil made a car, but built it inside the house, and did
not know how to take it out and use it until God widened the door and
took it out, and as the devil was pulling away at it he broke the hind
wheels, so God took the first part of the car and put it in the
heavens, and it forms the constellation known as the Great Bear (in
Rumanian, the Great Car).</p>
<p>Then the devil made the mill, but he could not start it, so God did.
Then he made a house, but put no light into it, so God had to make the
windows. Then the devil made a fire, but did not know how to kindle
it.</p>
<p>He was now working away at moulding the wolf from clay. He worked so
hard that the perspiration ran down his face. Scratching his head, he
pulled out three hairs, but would not throw anything away&mdash;they
were much too precious&mdash;so he stuck them in the head of the wolf
between the eyes.</p>
<p>When he thought he had finished, he turned to God and said,
&ldquo;See what I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied God, &ldquo;I see, but what is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt know more about it soon,&rdquo; replied the devil;
and, turning to the wolf, which lay there lifeless, he said, &ldquo;Up,
wolf, and go for him.&rdquo; But the wolf never stirred.</p>
<p>Then God turned to St. Peter and said, &ldquo;Just wait and see how
I will pay him out,&rdquo; and, waving his hand over the wolf, he said,
&ldquo;Up, wolf, and go for the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil can run fast, but never ran faster than on that day when
the wolf jumped up and ran after him. In running he jumped into the
lake. He dipped under the waters and saved himself from the fangs of
the wolf. And ever since that time, the wolf has power over the devil:
when he catches him, he eats him up. All the year round the devils are
hiding in pools and bogs, but, from the night of St. Basil (1st
January) until the Feast of Epiphany, the waters are holy, being
sanctified <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>through the Baptism. The devil can no longer stay
in the water, and he must get on to the land, where the wolf lies in
wait for him, and woe unto the devils who get too near the wolf.</p>
<p>When God and St. Peter saw the flight of the devil, they laughed
until the tears ran down their cheeks. Then God turned to St. Peter and
said to him, &ldquo;I give these wolves now into thy care.&rdquo; Poor
St. Peter trembled from head to foot when he heard the charge that was
given to him, but God reassured him and said, &ldquo;Never fear, Peter,
they will not harm thee; on the contrary, they will follow thee and
listen to thy command, as if they were friendly dogs.&rdquo; And so it
has remained. Once every year, on the day of the Feast of St. Peter, in
the winter-time, all the wolves come together to an appointed place to
meet St. Peter. Thither he comes with a huge book in his hand, in which
are written the names of all the persons who had given themselves over
to the devil, and he tells the wolves whom they are to eat.</p>
<p>The three hairs which the devil had put on the wolf are of a green
colour, and make the wolf look ferocious, for they are the
devil&rsquo;s hairs, and it is from them that the devil&rsquo;s fire
got into the wolves&rsquo; eyes, which are lit up by it. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Wolf, God and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>When God had finished the creation of the world, and had made all
the good animals and beasts, the devil thought he would also make some
creatures. He took some of the clay and made the wolf. When he had
finished God came to see what he had done. When he saw the brute he
asked the devil what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, thou wilt soon see what it is. Up, wolf, and go for
him.&rdquo; But the wolf did not stir. There he lay where the devil had
fashioned him. When the devil saw that the wolf did not move, that
there was no life in him, he turned to God and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just make him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God said, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before he made him go, he chipped the wolf about, and moulded
him and fashioned him a bit better than the devil had done. Out of
these chippings came the snakes and the toads. When he had finished
shaping him, God cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, wolf, and go for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up jumped the wolf and went for the devil, who got so frightened
that he ran away as fast as his feet would carry him.</p>
<p>When the devil saw that the wolf was running him close he pulled out
three hairs from his body and threw them behind him on to the wolf. The
wolf, who up to that time was hairless and smooth, was suddenly covered
with thick bristles, which, in one way or another, were to prevent him
from running so fast after the devil. It is for that reason that the
wolf has such thick bristles, and his eyes glisten in the dark.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>They are the hair of the devil and the sparks
which have got into him through the devil&rsquo;s hair. And since that
time when he hears the wolves howling the devil takes to his heels,
lest they catch him as God commanded them to do.</p>
<p>Polish, Lettish and other Slavonic variations of the legend
concerning the creation of the wolf by the devil are given by
D&auml;hnhardt (<i>l.c.</i> pp. 147 ff.), yet none so full as the
Rumanian version. According to one, the devil had made the wolf so as
to have a creature of his own. But he endeavoured in vain to call his
creature to life, for he would persistently say to it, &ldquo;Arise,
for I have made thee.&rdquo; Only, however, when he whispered into his
ear, &ldquo;Arise, God has made thee,&rdquo; did the wolf spring to his
feet. Then he attacked the devil, who ran away and escaped with
difficulty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God, the Devil and the
Stone.</span></p>
<p>According to a curious Rumanian version from Transylvania (in
<i lang="de">Archiv. f. Siebenburg Landeskunde</i>, 23, pp. 4&ndash;8,
abbreviated by D&auml;hnhardt, pp. 152&ndash;3), the devil went to God
and said to him, &ldquo;O Lord, thou hast created man and so many other
creatures, but thou hast not yet created the wolf.&rdquo; And God
replied, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and, showing him a huge boulder near
a forest, told him to go and say to the stone, &ldquo;Devil, eat the
stone.&rdquo; The devil went and said, &ldquo;Stone, eat the
wolf.&rdquo; The boulder did not move. The devil went to God and said,
&ldquo;The stone does not move.&rdquo; &ldquo;What didst thou
say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stone, eat the wolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;But thou must
say, &lsquo;Devil, eat the stone.&rsquo;&rdquo; The devil went again to
the stone and said, &ldquo;Stone, eat the devil.&rdquo; Whereupon the
stone moved and ate the devil, and in its place there stood a wolf with
the face of the devil. Since then there are no more devils in the
world, but wolves too many.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This story, as here abbreviated, is undoubtedly corrupted. The real
form must have been at the beginning, &ldquo;Stone, eat the
devil,&rdquo; but the devil changed it into, &ldquo;Devil, eat the
stone,&rdquo; until he spoke exactly as he was told, and the stone
turned into a wolf.</p>
<p>The wolf is dreaded as the most savage beast, and could therefore
only be conceived by the popular imagination as the creation of the
devil.</p>
<p>In the northern mythology there occurs the wolf Fenrir, whose father
is Loki, the God of Fire, who will play such a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>decisive
r&ocirc;le at Doomsday. Hahn (No. 105) contains the following
version:</p>
<p>After the creation of man, the devil boasted that he could create
something better. God allowed him to do so. He took some clay and
moulded it and made the wolf. Then God said to him, &ldquo;Give him
life, as I have done.&rdquo; The devil started blowing into the wolf
until he got red and blue in the face, but all in vain. Then God took a
cane and smote the wolf on his back, and that is why the back of the
wolf looks broken in the middle, and he said, &ldquo;Creature, eat thy
maker.&rdquo; Up jumped the wolf and ate the devil. (Cf. Grimm, 148.)

<p>In the beginning the goats had wings, and used to fly about eating
up the tops of the trees. They did it so thoroughly that they left no
leaf or bud, and never allowed a tree to grow up. When God saw what
mischief they were doing, and how they were destroying all the trees,

they should only be able to climb up crooked trees. And so they do.</p>

they went and made a pact with the devil, that they should henceforth
help one another. The devil willingly entered into an agreement with
them. It so happened that the devil&rsquo;s fire went out, and he was
not able to rekindle it himself, so he sent the two goats to God to
steal the fire from him. God had lit his fire, he had put the tripod
over the fire, and had hung on it the bowl to cook his food in. Then he
sat down quietly, watching the wood crackle and burn up. When the goats
came they started a conversation with God, speaking of this and
speaking of that, so that God should not see that they had come for the
purpose of stealing fire. When they saw they could not get on, they
decided to make a rush upon the fire, and to snatch a brand from
it.</p>
<p>So they ran towards the tripod trying to snatch the fire. God, who
knew what they were bent upon, took the ladle which was sticking in the
food, and with the hot stuff on it he smote the goats on their knees.
The goats started running, and they shrieked from the pain of the
burning food on their knees, which burned the skin so that all the hair
fell out, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>from that time the goats have no hair on their
knees, and the devil&rsquo;s beasts they have remained to this very
day.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In other South-Slavonian versions (D&auml;hnhardt, i. 142 f.) it is
the Evil One who invents the fire, and God is anxious to obtain it from
him in order to give it to mankind. The Evil One had deprived them of
it. God sends St. Peter to the Evil One with an iron rod in his hands.
This he was to poke in the fire until it got white hot; then he was to
touch some wood and the fire would leap up. Pursued by the Evil One,
who perceived the ruse, St. Peter struck the flint before the rod had
got cold, and thus got the spark inside the flint. Thus it is that
sparks fly when the flint is struck by iron.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>As for the goats, the following variants and parallels are of
interest:</p>
<p>According to an Armenian legend of Transylvania (D&auml;hnhardt,
154; Wlislocki, 12), the goat is the very work of the Evil One. Jealous
of God, who has made all the creatures, he boasted that he also would
make a creature of his own. When he saw how God fashioned the lamb, one
of the last of God&rsquo;s creatures, he set to work to make an animal
in the likeness of the lamb. So he made a goat. But he wanted to make
it more beautiful, so he added a beard and planted some pointed horns
on its head. Then he asked God to give life to his creation. God did
so, and thus made for man two new animals, the good, useful and meek
lamb, and the mischievous goat. God then took a vase, in which he had
put the intelligence of the animals, and, finding in it only a few
drops of the liquid at the bottom of the vase, he said to the devil
that he must be careful in the use of these drops. So he dropped a few
on the head of the lamb, but when he was going to pour some on that of
the goat the devil shook the vase, and thus many more drops fell on the
head of the goat than on that of the lamb. The devil laughed and said,
&ldquo;My creature is cleverer than thine.&rdquo; To which God replied,
&ldquo;That may be, but thy creature shall play the fool and live on
scanty food.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a Polish version (D&auml;hnhardt, i. 162), the goat is made by
the devil almost in the same manner as he made the wolf in the tales
Nos. 8, 9. And the goat comes to life only when, after saying
&ldquo;get up,&rdquo; he whispers, &ldquo;by the power of God.&rdquo;
When the goat rises, the devil in his fury gets hold of its tail and
pulls it off; and ever since the goats have had no tails.</p>
<p>In the South-Slavonic tale, curiously enough, the sheep take the
place of the goat and are made by the devil, which, in the light of the
above version, is due to some confusion made by the story-teller
between the ram and the goat. (Krauss, <i lang="de">Sud-slav.
Sagen</i>, Leipzig 1883, No. 29, p. 109.)</p>
<p>In a modern Greek legend, the devil made the goat, but he made the
knees stiff, and the goats perished from hunger. One day Christ was
walking upon earth, and he met the devil, who showed him the goats, and
said to him: &ldquo;I have also made something, but I cannot make it
sit down; its knees are so stiff; so the goats die off.&rdquo;
Whereupon Christ took his seal and placed it upon the goats&rsquo;
knees. Afterwards they could easily bend them. Hence the sign of the
seal upon the goats&rsquo; knees. (Politis, No. 842; D&auml;hnhardt,
pp. 153&ndash;4.)</p>
<p>In these two tales we have peculiar variants to some of the
incidents in the Rumanian version, only so far as the connection of the
goat with the Evil One and the bareness of the goats&rsquo; knees are
concerned, though the explanation is totally different from&mdash;nay,
opposite to&mdash;that given in the Rumanian version, where the
bareness is the sign of God&rsquo;s punishment of the goats.</p>
<p>A German tale (Grimm, 148) tells us: God made all the animals, even
the wolves, which were his dogs. The devil made the goats, which
destroyed the vines, the young trees, etc. The wolves then went and
killed the goats, and God offered to pay the devil the price of his
destroyed creatures, but only when all the oaks should lose their
leaves. But the devil was told that one oak in Constantinople keeps its
leaves all the year. He went in search of it for six months, and could
not find it. When he returned, the other oaks had got their leaves
again, and he got nothing. He poked out the eyes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>of the
goats, and put his own in instead, and therefore they have the
devil&rsquo;s eyes, and so the devil sometimes assumes their form.</p>
<p>These stories of the goat and the devil are probably one chapter of
the larger and yet unwritten book on the goat-devil in popular beliefs
and customs. It must suffice merely to mention the
&ldquo;scape-goat,&rdquo; the goat-demons (<i>seirim</i> of the Bible),
the Greek fauns and satyrs. Satan, worshipped under the guise of a goat
in the alleged orgies of the witches, is found in the record of the
Inquisition in medieval accusations against the heretics. Is not the
devil himself depicted in medieval imagery with the cloven
hoof&mdash;of the <i>goat</i> and with the horns of the <i>goat</i>?
The why and wherefore is another story. It is not here and now the
place to enter upon it. The mischievous character of the goat, the
amorous inclinations, the offensive smell, may to a certain extent have
contributed later on to justify this equation of goat and devil, but
there must be some other reason for making the goat, if not a type, at
least the friend of Satan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=

<h2 class="label">XI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">WHY DID NOAH GET DRUNK?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Goat, Noah and the
Vine.</span></p>
<p>It is said that the vine did not exist before the flood, and of
course, therefore, there was no wine. The giants, whatever mischief
they may have done, and however wicked may have been their ways, at any
rate were never drunk. They only drank water, which is the eternal
beverage for man and beast. When the flood came the giants and all the
living creatures, except those whom Noah saved in the ark, were
destroyed. When the flood had subsided, the animals went out, spread
themselves over the earth, and multiplied very quickly.</p>
<p>Thus from the few head of cattle, sheep and goats there grew up soon
a large number, and Noah was able to live by his cattle and his
goats.</p>
<p>Of all these animals, Noah loved the goats best, especially when he
saw them climbing about everywhere up the trees and up the rocks, going
freely in all directions. One day Noah saw that one of the he-goats
left the rest alone and went his own way, and when the evening came he
came down dancing and jumping, quite jolly; this he repeated many days,
and every evening he came home jumping and dancing, and frolicking like
a madman. Noah, anxious to find out what was the reason of this
peculiar behaviour of the goat, followed him quietly one day, and he
found out what it was. There, on one of the hillsides, he saw a tree
with very huge grapes, each one as big as a bucket. The goat went
straight to these and ate his fill. Getting drunk, he laid himself down
to sleep. When he woke up he started the game again, and so until the
evening, when he returned home quite jolly. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>Old Noah was greatly surprised at this sight, for he had never seen
before any grapes; and so, climbing up as best he could, he plucked a
bunch in order to take it home and show his family.</p>
<p>On his way home the heat grew unbearable, and he got very thirsty.
He turned to the right, he turned to the left; nowhere a drop of water
to be seen. I do not know what he thought; but, having the grapes in
his hand, he put one in his mouth, and sucked at it. He found the juice
very sweet and refreshing, so he took the other grapes and squeezed the
juice into his mouth. Not satisfied with that, as his thirst was not
yet quenched, he went back to the vine tree, and taking a whole
cluster, he sucked it dry. When he returned, he felt somehow that his
head had got rather heavier than usual, and his legs, on the contrary,
were much lighter than before. Altogether he felt in a merry mood, and
though old and advanced in years, he started singing a song. Getting
near his house, the goat overtook him, frolicking and jumping as it had
done every day.</p>
<p>What should enter Noah&rsquo;s head but to follow the example of the
goat, frolicking and jumping, and in that state of high merriment both
reached the house. When Noah got near the house, he looked at himself,
and he could not make out what had happened to him, for he had lost
almost all his clothes. They had fallen off him on the way. He could
not get into the house, but, dropping down in front of it, he fell fast
asleep. There his sons found him, and thinking that he was dangerously
ill, put him on his bed and began wailing over him, for they were sure
he was at death&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>The next morning, to their astonishment, he woke hale and hearty,
and there and then he told them all about the goat and the vine and the
grape and the sweet juice. Then Noah gave orders that the vine should
be taken from the hills and planted in his garden. Before he did so, he
killed the goat and poured the blood of it on to the roots in
remembrance of the fact that it was through the goat that he discovered
the vine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus far the Rumanian story, which, however, requires completion. As
far as it goes it agrees almost verbatim with a story found in a very
ancient Hebrew collection of legends (<i>Midrash Abkhir</i>); the
sequel there is as follows: When Noah started planting the vine, the
devil came and asked to be allowed to take a part in it. Noah willingly
agreed. After killing the goat, the devil brought a lion, whose blood
was also used to water the roots of the vine, and finally brought a
swine, and his blood was also poured over the roots of the vine.</p>
<p>For this reason it comes to pass that, when a man drinks a little
wine he gets merry and jumps and frolics like a young kid; and if he
drinks a little more, he becomes hot and roars like the lion; and his
last stage is reached when he wallows in the mire like the pig, for he
has drunk the blood of all of them.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a tale which shows how a man can become a beast
without changing his human form, not like all the other tales, in which
he remains a bird or a beetle to the end of his days.</p>
<p>A peculiar transformation of this legend is found in the following
variant, in which the bones of the animals are substituted for their
blood. The whole setting is different from the more primitive type
preserved in the Rumanian.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When Saint Dionysios was still young, he once made a journey through
Greece, in order to go to Naxia (the isle of Naxos), but the way being
very long, he got tired and sat down on a stone to rest. While he was
sitting, and looking down in front of himself, he saw at his feet a
little plant sprouting from the earth, which seemed to him so beautiful
that he resolved at once to take it with him and to plant it. He took
the plant out of the ground and carried it away; but, as the sun was
very hot just then, he feared that it might dry up before his arrival
in Naxia. Then he found the small bone of a bird, and put the plant
into it and went on. In his holy hand, however, the plant grew so
quickly that it peeped forth from both sides of the bone. Then he again
feared that it would dry up, and thought of a remedy. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>found
the bone of a lion, which was thicker than the bird&rsquo;s bone, and
he put the bird&rsquo;s bone, together with the plant, into the bone of
the lion. But the plant quickly grew, even out of the lion&rsquo;s
bone. Then he found the bone of a donkey, which was still thicker, and
he put the plant, together with the bird&rsquo;s and lion&rsquo;s
bones, into the donkey&rsquo;s bone, and so he came to Naxia. When he
was planting it, he saw that the roots had wound thickly round the
bones of the bird, the lion and the donkey; and, as he could not take
it out without injuring the roots, he planted it in the ground as it
was, and it quickly grew up and produced, to his delight, the finest
grapes, from which he made the first wine, which he gave to men to
drink. But what a wonder did he see now! When men drank of it, they
sang in the beginning like merry little birds; drinking more of it,
they became strong as lions; and drinking still more, they became
stupid like donkeys. (Hahn, <i lang="de">Albn. M&auml;rchen</i>, ii.
76; <i>v.</i> also Thumb, <i>Bulletin of the John Rylands Library</i>,
Manchester, vol. ii. No. 1, Oct. 1914, p. 38 and note 50).</p>
<p>I add here a Christmas carol about the shepherd and the sheep, for
it seems that at the basis of it lies the idea of God giving a special
blessing to the sheep. It is a second stage after the idea of creation

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE FLY CALLED THE DEVIL&rsquo;S HORSE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Fight of St. George and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>In Rumania, the dragon-fly is known as the devil&rsquo;s horse or
perhaps the dragon&rsquo;s horse. It is also known as St.
George&rsquo;s horse. The following legends explain this peculiar
name.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>We are told that in olden times there was continual strife between
God and the devil. God, however, who is peacefully inclined, let the
devil play his game as long as possible. He thought that perhaps after
some time the devil might become better behaved. But what can you
expect of the devil? He is what he is, and neither good nor bad
treatment will change him. And so it proved even to God. He waited a
very long time to see him quiet down and become more satisfied. But no
sooner had God granted him one thing, than the devil asked for another,
and so he went on asking continually. When at last God saw that nothing
could be done with Satan, he armed his host of angels and gave each one
a beautiful horse to ride on. One morning, at early dawn, they all
mounted their horses and, led by St. George, who was riding at the head
of the host, they started the fight with the devil.</p>
<p>After a time St. George&mdash;who rode a horse, which was like unto
none of the others, wondrously beautiful&mdash;felt suddenly that his
horse was backing instead of going ahead. So St. George found himself
involved among his own host, and some other horses following his
example, started moving backwards and hitting those who were riding
behind them. He then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>suddenly heard the voice of God telling him
to dismount, for his horse had been bewitched by the devil. &ldquo;If
that is the case,&rdquo; said St. George, &ldquo;then be it the
devil&rsquo;s own,&rdquo; and he let it go. And so it happened.
Scarcely had it made three steps when it was changed into a flying
insect, which we, upon this earth, call the devil&rsquo;s horse
(<i lang="la">libellula depressa</i>).</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A similar legend must have been current in West Europe and in
England, as otherwise the English name of Dragon-fly could not be
explained. At the root of it there must be some legend of St. George
and the Dragon, in addition to the fight between the hosts of heaven
and the army of Satan. This part must have entirely dropped out, and
the knowledge and recollection of the part which St. George played was
connected either with the worm, <i>i.e.</i> dragon probably transformed
into an insect, or the horse of St. George, believed to have been a
winged horse. To us here, however, the first part of the legend is of
the utmost interest, for it is nothing less than the Biblical legend of
the rebellion of Satan which led to the combat and to the fall. Satan
had lost Paradise, and ever since then he had been yearning for the
light of Paradise, either by attempting to steal the heavenly fire, as
in the Goat stories, or by stealing the sun and moon as in some of the
Christmas carols. Thereby he entered into a contest with the heavenly
power. Though these variants do not contain much of the legendary

<p class="first">This carol is full of apocryphal reminiscences and
mythical elements. The contest between Satan and God, and between the
evil and good powers is here described under the form of Satan,
stealing the sun from heaven and plunging the world into darkness, but
the angels, with the prophet Ilie (Elijah) at their head, are able to
defeat the machinations of Satan, and to restore the sun to Paradise.
Cf. among others the English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=

Hell,&rdquo; and the literature connected with the Gospel of Nicodemus.
Wesselofsky has studied the transformation of the prophet Elijah into
the Ilie of the popular faith, who rides the heavens with a thunderbolt
in his hands, and smites the devil wherever he finds him. It is a
combination of the prophet Elijah with a modified form of the Greek
Helias. The archangels Gabriel and Michael are here in their proper
place, whilst in the story of the dragon-fly they have been supplanted
by St. George. We shall find the same saint disguised as a knight and
almost forgotten as a saint in the legend of the Fly of Kolumbatsh, No.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God, the Sun and the
Bulls.</span></p>
<p>In those days when God used to walk through fields and lanes
carrying his knapsack on his back and feeding his herds and flocks, his
oxen and cows, his sheep and goats, it is told that, once upon a time,
feeling very tired, he went to sleep with his head upon a hillock of
earth. He slept for a long while, and woke up very late. Before lying
down, he told the older and stronger oxen to take care to behave
themselves well, and also to look after the younger ones, so that there
should not be any fight or trouble among them. But no sooner had he
closed his eyes, when such a shouting and bellowing was started that
one might think that the hills were falling and the earth was breaking
up. The Lord sprang upon his feet as if he had been touched by fire,
for the holy sun had come to him, and waking him up had
said:&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord, these creatures of yours have bellowed all
night long so loud and so vigorously that you might have thought that
they intended driving me away from the face of the earth. Look and see
what they have done to me. They have fought against me so long that
they have well-nigh torn my clothes into shreds and tatters, and with
great difficulty I saved myself behind that flower-bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What beetles are you speaking of?&rdquo; asked the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean your oxen which have behaved so badly. They are not
worthy to be anything else but horned beetles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be so! But I must first look into the matter, and if I
find them guilty, I will punish them just as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the Lord had said, so he did. For, finding them guilty, he
drove them away into the forest. There they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>climbed up the oak-trees, and suddenly they all
became horned beetles, bull-flies, with larger and smaller horns, viz.
the cows became cow-flies with smaller horns and the oxen bull-flies
with larger horns, through God&rsquo;s punishment. That is why they are
called the Lord&rsquo;s bulls and cows (<i lang="la">Lucanus
cervus</i>).</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>According to another legend, the bull-flies were originally the
angels who refused to help St. Elias in fastening the felloes to his
fiery chariot. Therefore their mouths have been closed as with a vice,
for ever, so that they be no longer able to speak, and that is why they
are also called wheelwrights.</p>
<p>The horns of these bull-flies are used by women, who tie them into
their hair against the evil eye. The sharp points of these horns have
the same magical properties as the sharp points of the coral, or of the
horns, fingers, etc., which figure so largely in the magical charms and
amulets against the workings of the evil eye. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of Ileana, Voinic and the
Archangel Gabriel.</span></p>
<p>The following legend is told of this little beetle.</p>
<p>I do not know how long ago it was that Ileana Cosinziana (Ileana the
fay) walked about with her young, beautiful, and brave hero (Voinic
inflorit), and, singing with a loud voice, they filled mountain and
valleys with their music. It must have been long ago, for at that time
the archangel Gabriel also walked the earth in the form of a very old
man, leaning on iron crutches. He went about warning the people that
God would send upon them a new flood of foreign tongues and wild
nations, if they would not stop their quarrels and put an end to their
curses. After having travelled through many countries and empires, St.
Gabriel found himself one day at the top of a cliff, so high that it
made your head turn when you looked down. There he met Ileana
Cosinziana, who was weeping and singing a doleful tune. With her was
Voinic inflorit, whom she had met in the land of the fairies, just as
God makes men meet in their journeys. &ldquo;How far art thou
going?&rdquo; asked Voinic, seeing the old man. &ldquo;Much farther
than thou wilt go,&rdquo; replied the archangel Gabriel. The young man
looked up, feeling wroth with the answer. And quite naturally so, when
he heard a very old man boasting that he was going much farther than
he. Was he not a young sturdy man, and more likely to walk ever so much
further than a bent-down old fellow grey of hair? &ldquo;O old man, you
must take me for a weakling, when you say that I cannot walk as far as
you do.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, your sweet, strong voice will not be heard any
more a year hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because such is the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that might be so if you were the brother of
Christ,&rdquo; replied the young man, sneering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not be the brother of Christ, but that of St. Peter I
may well be. If you do not believe me, let us enter a wager that a year
hence we will meet here again. But you will be weak and broken, much
more so than you think me to be now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be it so, but woe betide thee if I win the
wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And wishing one another good-bye, each went his own way, bent on
winning the wager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that daring old man?&rdquo; asked the Ileana;
&ldquo;it seems to me that he is not so old as his grey hair betokens.
He is a valiant man. God knows who he may be, but one thing is certain,
he is not an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when he put out his hand, he gripped mine with so much
strength that he very nigh burnt my soul out of me with the fire of his
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young Voinic heard it, he got so angry that he was more
like a wild beast than a human being, and being overpowered by his
fury, got hold of her by the hair of her head and hurled her down the
cliff so that she broke into a thousand pieces. He then began to run
away so fast that the earth seemed to fly away under his feet. And thus
he continued running through many lands and many countries, until the
year had come round when he was to meet the old man again. On the last
day of the year, Voinic remembered the wager, and looking into the
water at the bottom of a well, he saw himself much weaker and older
than the old man had looked a year ago. In his anger he threw himself
into the well. But, in accordance with the will of God, the water would
not keep him, and cast him out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>He had got very old indeed,
for the thoughts and worries had cut deep furrows into his face; his
hair from black, turned white as the snow. This was because in his fury
and in an unlucky hour he had killed his beloved Ileana by throwing her
down the cliff.</p>
<p>The archangel Gabriel, who knew all that had happened, changed into
a young man beautiful as the sun, valiant as a king and brave as a
lion. He was mounted on a charger black as the night and swift as the
wind. Thus arrayed, he came to the cliff where they had arranged to
meet. Voinic noticed that against his will he had also come to that
spot. How great then was his fright when, instead of a decrepit old
man, he found there so valiant a knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Voinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hail! I am no longer a hero full of sap; I am now an old
weak man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, he, seest thou now that what I had told thee has come to
pass? I have grown young and thou hast grown old. So it is, for who can
alter the will of God? He can do what he likes, and man must submit to
his decrees. So it is, indeed, but how now about our wager? Where is
that beautiful maiden of thine, in whom thou didst believe more than in
God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died soon after we met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, she is dead, for thou, O wretch, hast killed
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assuredly did not; she died by the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, thou hast thrown her down the cliff. I know it well,
for I have seen the rut on the cliff she fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true, for I have buried her with the assistance
of the priest of the next village. If thou dost not believe, come with
me, and I will show thee the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an infamous lie. Thou hast murdered her. Thou come
and I will show thee her real grave and her blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, getting hold of him, he took him down and showed him a place
which seemed covered with red blood. But it was no blood. It was a vast
number of small red beetles. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>&ldquo;Out of the blood of Ileana,
seest thou, have come these little flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Voinic heard this, he was seized with such a great fright that
he became changed from the old bent man that he was into a small black
insect, which unto this very day cries for his lost beloved Ileana. The
people call it the little cricket, or rather the bull or cow of the
Lord (<i lang="la">Lygaeus equestris</i>). The little red beetles which
come out of the blood of Ileana they also call Easter beetle, for it
was on Easter Day that she was thrown down the cliff. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of St. Mary and the Miserly
Farmer.</span></p>
<p>Another legend of a totally different character is also told of this
little beetle.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When the Holy Mother gave birth to Jesus, she had not enough milk in
her breasts to suckle the child. Next to her on the right lived a very
rich farmer who had a large number of cows. So the mother Mary sent to
him, and asked him to give her a little milk, as much as was necessary
to feed her little baby. But rich farmers are, as a rule, very stingy.
So he replied, &ldquo;I am not going to give my good milk to a witch to
bewitch my cows and take away their gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Holy Mother, on hearing his words, got very angry, especially
when she heard that he had called her a witch. But she kept her
counsel, and went to the neighbour on the left, who had only one cow.
He was a kind-hearted man, and gave her at once a bowl full of milk.
When she left, she blessed him and said: &ldquo;On the morrow thou
shalt not know what to do with the milk,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> he would
have so much milk that he would not know how to handle it. And so it
happened. When, on the next morning, he entered the stables he found
them full of beautiful fat kine, from which the milk was running, so
rich were they.</p>
<p>But the stingy neighbour the Holy Mother cursed, and said: &ldquo;On
the morrow thy stable shall be empty, and in lieu of cows, beetles
shall be there.&rdquo; And so also it happened. When he entered the
stables the next morning, he found them empty, and instead of the cows,
which were no longer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span>there, the stables were full of little red
flies with black spots on their backs, crawling up the walls and
filling the manger. And that is why they are called the cows and oxen
of the Lord.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>To obtain abundance of milk peasant women in the Bukovina go on a
Tuesday evening to a place where there are a number of these insects.
The next morning, before sunrise, they go there again and, taking a
number of them, bring them home, chop them up with their choppers and,
mixing them with the food, give them to the cows to eat. The cows will
then yield much milk. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Wicked Maiden and
the Archangel Michael.</span></p>
<p>In olden times, when the men were not yet so wicked and bad, there
was no hell, for the good God saw that it would remain empty, as there
would be no one to go there. The people were happy and grateful, and
satisfied with whatever God gave them. It did not enter their minds to
complain of God&rsquo;s wisdom and love. After a time the people
multiplied so much that they could no longer have enough of anything.
So they began to quarrel with one another. Those who had nothing,
without knowing that they were doing anything wrong, began to demand
whatever they wanted from the wealthy ones. They did not know that it
was forbidden to take another man&rsquo;s property. For up till then no
one knew what sin was. The Allmerciful God, who sees and knows
everything, noting that strife and quarrels increased more and more
among men, sent his trusty servant, the archangel Michael, to awaken
mankind to the sense of sin, and to train them to good deeds. The
archangel went among the people, enlightened their minds, and told them
all about sin and wrong-doing, and what they had to do in order to
avoid sin. That was just the knowledge that the people were lacking;
but no sooner did they know what evil was, than, curiously enough, they
took to wrong-doing. Jealousy, greed, strife, and murder were born
among them. When God saw the obstinacy and perverseness of mankind, he
let them go their own way to do whatever they liked, even if they acted
against his wishes. In order to punish them, however, he decided not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>to allow them to get into Paradise. At the edge
of the garden he made a deep well; so deep that it was very dark,
almost black. He then took a fiery morning star, and cast him into the
depth of the well, thus filling it with burning coals. And then he
turned every wicked man into that fire so that he might repent. He
called that place Hell: and so it has remained to this day. In order
that men should know that God knows how to reward them, he at times
left the gate of Paradise open, so that everyone, if he liked, could
enter into it and see how beautiful it was. He also opened the gates of
Hell, so that they might also see the tortures and hear the cries of
the wicked.</p>
<p>Many people went and looked, and when they looked into Paradise,
their hearts swelled with joy; but when they went and looked into Hell,
their hearts got as small as a flea on account of the great fright they
got, when they saw how severely God punished the sinner. They all
repented of their evil ways, all of them, great and small, except one
single person, who on no account would repent. This one was a girl as
beautiful as an angel, and clever beyond comparison. She was strong,
with a fine body, round and sleek as no other, and she had a head so
beautiful that you might believe it was a picture. Her long black hair,
soft like silk, shone like the feathers of a raven. Her eyes were black
and sparkling&mdash;she could almost burn you up with her
look&mdash;her mouth had lips as red as the berries of the
field&mdash;her cheeks were white and smooth as snow lit up with two
blood-red roses. I do not know&mdash;by God I do not&mdash;where there
is anyone who would not have fallen in love with her. God sent the
archangel Michael to take her out of this world and put her in Hell,
there to repent of her sins of obstinacy and perversity. He went, but
when he looked at her, he could not utter a single word. He felt as
though he had a knot in his throat when he was to tell her that she
must prepare for the journey. For he knew how terrible it is in Hell.
So he returned to Heaven without taking the girl with him to throw her
into the abysmal depths. When God saw him so sad, he asked him what was
the cause of it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; said the archangel, &ldquo;I have fulfilled
all thy commands except one, which I could not fulfil; I had pity on
the beauty of that girl. She is so beautiful that you cannot help
feeling full of pity, and to feel a sweet shiver passing through you
when you behold her. If it be possible, O Lord, let her live on for a
while, perchance she will repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my son Michael, thou dost not know that thy pity will cause
me much trouble and worry. Just look down and see. Since thou hast left
her, she has increased the number of the wicked and sinful. For whoever
looks at her is seized with lust. Everyone thinks only of her eyes and
her face. When I sent thee, she was the only one left who was wicked,
for she alone was possessed of pride, obstinacy and perverseness. Now
the number has grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Lord, if it be only possible, do not uproot that example
of womankind, for she is beautiful, and it is not likely that another
like her will ever be born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I will let her live on, perchance she will
repent and get better; but if she does not grow better at the end of
one year, I will send thee again, and then thou wilt throw her down
into the depths of Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let thy will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words they separated, God going to mend the hinges of
the world, and the archangel to teach and to enlighten the mortals. So,
going through many countries, walking on foot or riding in a car, when
a year had past he came at last again to the house of the beautiful
maiden. There was a vast multitude assembled before her house. He
pushed his way among the people to see at what they were looking. The
beautiful maiden was enticing the people to follow only pleasure and
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not good,&rdquo; so she spoke, &ldquo;to believe only
in what God and his counsellors tell us. We must do what we think best,
for no evil will happen to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the archangel Michael heard these words, he grew very furious,
and, with a mighty effort, he got near her, so as to seize her and hurl
her into the fire of Hell. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=

<p>&ldquo;Do not carry her to Hell,&rdquo; said the voice of God;
&ldquo;for she might start fresh mischief and wickedness there also,
and engender strife: she had better be changed into some insignificant
insect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the archangel heard the command, he got hold of her by the hair
of her head, and he whirled her round so many times that she became as
small as a speck; and then, throwing her away, she turned into a small
red insect with black points on her wings, which was called Bubureaza
(<i lang="la">Coccinella septempundata</i>). To this very day, when you
put her on your finger, she will show you the way you are to go, but it
is better for men to do the reverse and go in the opposite direction;
for she leads one only to evil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE GAD-FLY STING THE CATTLE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God, St. Peter and the
Lazy Shepherd.</span></p>
<p>In olden times God and St. Peter used to walk about in the world, to
see what was happening, and how the world was going on. And after they
had seen what happened in one province, they used to go to another.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, after leaving a certain village, they got into a
deep and dark forest. Walking along for a while, they lost their way,
and did not know how to get out of it. Tired and hungry, they walked
on, lost in that thick and gloomy wood, when suddenly before them they
saw a field, in which grass and flowers were growing and herds of
cattle were feeding. The cowherd lay fast asleep under the shadow of a
tree. He could take it easily, for the cattle were not suffering from
flies, and were wandering quietly about the field. God and St. Peter
rejoiced greatly when they saw a man lying there. They went up to him
and woke him, and asked him to tell them the way which would take them
out of the forest. The cowherd, being asked by God which was the
quickest road, did not even lift up his head to give a polite answer.
But lying outstretched on the grass, he merely moved his right leg and,
half asleep and lazy as he was, and pointing in one direction, said,
&ldquo;If you wish to get out to the world of men, just go that way and
you will get there.&rdquo; Then, turning over on the other side, he
again fell asleep.</p>
<p>God and St. Peter, resenting the rudeness of the cowherd, said,
&ldquo;Are these, then, thy manners? Very well, thou wilt no longer be
lazy from this day onwards. Thy cattle will no longer feed quietly; the
gad-fly, which I am sending, will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>sting them, and they will run
like mad whither their feet and their eyes will carry them.&rdquo; And
so it happened. The gad-fly came and the cows and oxen suddenly started
running like mad in all directions, and so it has remained to this very
day.</p>
<p>The cowherd, when he saw the cattle running like mad things with
their tails in the air, jumped up like one stung to madness, and
started running after them to bring them back. But in vain, for the
cattle, which had run away as quickly as you strike a spark from the
flint, entered into a swamp.</p>
<p>After they had thus punished the cowherd, God and St. Peter went on
walking without knowing whither they were going. So again, after a long
walk in that same forest, they came to another meadow, where a shepherd
tended his flock of sheep. But the sheep were running all the time so
fast that you could not see their legs. Hither and thither they went,
and the shepherd after them, out of breath, and the sweat running down
his face, hoping that he might get them together. But the sheep were as
if they had been bewitched, so fast did they run. And whilst the
shepherd could scarcely keep on his legs, and the sweat was standing on
his forehead like beads, God and St. Peter approached him and asked him
which was the way they were to go to come back to this world. Although
he was dead tired and hot, the shepherd none the less stopped still
and, wiping his face with the sleeve of his shirt, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, take that way, for if you follow that road, you will
soon get to the end of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took the way he showed them, and soon they found themselves in
this world. And God said to his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this day onward, the flock of this shepherd, who has
given us good advice, so courteously, shall no longer suffer from the
gad-fly (and the running madness), and they shall only run at times of
rain and wind. They will henceforth feed quietly, and the shepherd also
will be able to sit down and play his pipe.&rdquo; And from that day on
the sheep feed quietly, and the shepherd can tend them in peace and
comfort, for the sheep do not suffer from the gad-fly (<i lang=
"la">Hypoderma bovis</i>), whilst <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>the cowherds must weary their
legs, as otherwise their cattle would disappear.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There is a Macedonian variation:</p>
<p>Once upon a time God changed into a very old man. Walking one day in
a terrific heat, he met a cowherd and asked him for a drop of water,
for he said he would die of thirst. &ldquo;Die,&rdquo; replied the
cowboy, and would neither give him a drop of water nor tell him where
to find it.</p>
<p>God found afterwards a shepherd hotly pursuing his sheep, and the
perspiration running down him. &ldquo;Give me a drop of water, for I
die,&rdquo; said God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you willingly, but my sheep have run away and I do not
know how to gather them&rdquo;; and going to a fountain at the foot of
a hill he took some in his fur cap and gave him to drink. God gathered
the sheep, and blessed them to be God&rsquo;s flock, who should never
henceforth separate on the road or be scattered. Remembering the
cowherd, he cursed him and said: &ldquo;The gad-fly is always to
scatter his herd just when the heat is greatest, so that he may run
like mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore the sheep always walk together in flocks, and gather
together in hot summer weather in the shade. And for that reason the
oxen are driven mad by the fly in the hot season, and they run like mad
as if they were ridden by devils. The cowherd has to run after them,
and there are but few fountains in Thessaly from which to slacken his
thirst. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=

<p>Numerous ballads recount the same story of the origin of the
Poison-fly of Kolumbatsh, with slight variations, of which the most
complete is the following:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">High up in the green forest</p>

<p class="line">High up in the forest of Cerna,</p>

<p class="line">Through dew and mist,</p>
<p class="line">Three sisters,</p>
<p class="line">Beautiful maidens.</p>
<p class="line">The elder sister,</p>
<p class="line">Dressed sweetly,</p>
<p class="line">Fair like a pink flower,</p>

<p class="line">She is like the evening star,</p>

<p class="line">The flower of flowers.</p>
<p class="line">They played and frolicked,</p>
<p class="line">And gathered flowers.</p>
<p class="line">They made wreaths,</p>
<p class="line">And while they twisted them they sang.</p>
<p class="line">Through the forest the singing was heard.</p>
<p class="line">Thus they went on,</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;Dear Cuckoo mine,</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;My sweet one!</p>
<p class="line">I do not know</p>

<p class="line">The cuckoo replied:</p>

<p class="line">She was seized with terror,</p>

<p class="line">The forest resounded.</p>
<p class="line">High up the Cerna,</p>
<p class="line">Very high up the river,</p>
<p class="line">Many a brave has passed,</p>

<p class="line">A valiant Ruman,</p>
<p class="line">Ioan Iorgovan,</p>
<p class="line">Whose arms were like clubs,</p>
<p class="line">Was riding upon a horse,</p>
<p class="line">Swift as the eagle,</p>

<p class="line">Keen and quick.</p>
<p class="line">He was riding gaily,</p>
<p class="line">Walking up the Cerna</p>
<p class="line">Quite quickly,</p>
<p class="line">His horse prancing,</p>
<p class="line">Encouraging his dogs,</p>
<p class="line">And waving his lance.</p>
<p class="line">He suddenly heard a noise,</p>
<p class="line">But he did not understand,</p>
<p class="line">However much he strained,</p>
<p class="line">Whether it was the voice of a man</p>
<p class="line">Or that of a woman.</p>
<p class="line">For the waves of the Cerna raged,</p>
<p class="line">Sounding loud through the forest.</p>
<p class="line">So he turned himself back,</p>
<p class="line">And said to the Cerna:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;O my clean Cerna,</p>
<p class="line">Stop, I pray thee, stop,</p>
<p class="line">For I will throw</p>
<p class="line">Into thy bed,</p>
<p class="line">And I will give thee a silver lamprey,</p>

<p class="line">The Cerna heard him,</p>

<p class="line">Then Ioan Iorgovan,</p>
<p class="line">With arms like clubs,</p>
<p class="line">At once heard</p>
<p class="line">And knew the voice,</p>
<p class="line">That it was not that of a man,</p>
<p class="line">But that of a woman.</p>
<p class="line">Then he got angry,</p>
<p class="line">Spurred on his horse,</p>
<p class="line">And, striking it hard,</p>
<p class="line">He roared like a lion,</p>
<p class="line">Splitting the air.</p>
<p class="line">The dragon got sight of him,</p>
<p class="line">And, seized with fear, it ran away.</p>
<p class="line">But he followed it,</p>
<p class="line">And jumped across the Cerna,</p>
<p class="line">And approached it.</p>
<p class="line">The dragon waited for him,</p>
<p class="line">And asked him:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ioan Iorgovan,</p>

<p class="line">My head will rot.</p>
<p class="line">Worms will breed;</p>
<p class="line">Flies will swarm,</p>
<p class="line">Who will bite thy horse.</p>
<p class="line">It will burst of the poison,</p>
<p class="line">The oxen will run mad,</p>
<p class="line">The plough will come to a standstill!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Accursed snake!</p>
<p class="line">Thou still bandiest words.</p>

<p class="line">My horse will not die,</p>
<p class="line">But thou shalt perish,</p>
<p class="line">For I have heard</p>
<p class="line">That thou hast killed</p>
<p class="line">A beautiful maid</p>
<p class="line">With thy robber&rsquo;s jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ioan Iorgovan,</p>
<p class="line">When I heard thy approach,</p>
<p class="line">Thy horse&rsquo;s trot,</p>
<p class="line">Roaring like a dragon,</p>
<p class="line">I at once left the maid</p>
<p class="line">Safe and unhurt.</p>
<p class="line">I pray thee,</p>
<p class="line">Leave me alone,</p>
<p class="line">And turn back to thy home.</p>
<p class="line">I swear on my head,</p>
<p class="line">Worse shall I be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Ioan Iorgovan,</p>
<p class="line">With arms like clubs,</p>
<p class="line">Brandished his sword,</p>
<p class="line">Hit the snake,</p>
<p class="line">And cut it up in pieces.</p>
<p class="line">The maid looked on</p>
<p class="line">Until he had finished it,</p>
<p class="line">Then she showed herself,</p>
<p class="line">And thus she spake:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ioan Iorgovan,</p>

<p class="line">When he beheld her,</p>
<p class="line">Wonder seized him</p>
<p class="line">Of her beauty and of her youth.</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, my beautiful flower,</p>
<p class="line">Who art like a young fairy,</p>
<p class="line">Be then to me a wife</p>
<p class="line">As long as you be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">He then embraced her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="line">And kissed her.</p>
<p class="line">He then looked on&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">May it burst&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">There was the dragon&rsquo;s head</p>
<p class="line">Running away,</p>
<p class="line">Painting the Cerna red with his blood.</p>
<p class="line">And it ran across the Danube,</p>
<p class="line">Until it hid itself in the dark cave.</p>
<p class="line">There it rotted.</p>
<p class="line">The worms bred</p>
<p class="line">And flies swarmed.</p>
<p class="line">And so it is to this very day;</p>
<p class="line">When the fly comes out</p>
<p class="line">It bites the horses,</p>
<p class="line">It poisons the oxen,</p>
<p class="line">And stops the plough.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus far this, the most complete version.</p>
<p>There are a number of other variants, but the central idea is the
same, that the poison-fly (<i lang="la">Musca Columbaca</i>) comes from
the head of the dragon, slain by the knight Ioan Iorgovan.</p>
<p>The people show the imprint of the hoofs and the traces of
Iorgovan&rsquo;s dogs on the high cliff overhanging the banks of the
Danube.</p>
<p>This legend, localised in Rumania on the borders of Servia, is of
special interest for hagiography. It is nothing else but a variant of
the legend of St. George and the Dragon. It has assumed a peculiar
form, differing greatly from the other versions of that fight, which is
known all over the East and West, and lives in many forms and versions.
In the Rumanian hagiography there are at least two or three versions of
the legend as found in the <i lang="la">Vitae Sanctorum</i> and the
<i lang="la">Synaxarium</i> of the Greek and Slavonic Church. Thus it
is found in one of the oldest Rumanian prints, the <i>Homiliary</i> of
1646, the very first book printed at Jasi, in Moldavia, in the Rumanian
language. It occurs also in part in the <i>Lives of the Saints</i> by
the Archbishop Dositheus, who used MS. collections for his book,
printed also in Jasi, in 1682. An elaborate version is to be found in
the great collection of the <i>Lives of the Saints</i> in twelve
volumes, by Bishop Benjamin of Moldavia, and then reprinted in
Bucharest in 1836. All these collections are full of apocryphal matter,
and the <i>Life of St. George</i> makes no exception. There is one
point more to which attention must be drawn in this connection, viz.
the influence of the Genoese and Venetian traders who had established
emporia along the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>Danube and the Black Sea, among them one
which to this very day has retained the name of St. George. Along the
Danube, on the left bank, on what is now Rumania, stands that place,
called Giurgiu in honour of the patron saint of the Genoese who found
it. Thus, from many quarters, one or the other version became known to
the folk, and was localised at that point where the Carpathian
mountains seem to dip into the Danube, to emerge again on the other
side and continue rising and forming the chain of the Balkans. From a
philological point of view the name Iorgu Iorgovan denotes Servian
influences. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THERE A WORM IN THE APPLE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the False
Teachers.</span></p>
<p>Before God came upon the earth there were a number of men who were
very clever, and who followed the rule of the devil. They claimed that
they could change themselves into dogs and cats, for the devil, who
took much pleasure in his clever people, helped them. Those who saw
them, believed them to be gods, and worshipped them and brought them
gifts. The devil almost jumped out of his skin with delight, for he
hoped that all the nations would do likewise, and soon God would be
forgotten. But God was watching the doings of the devil quietly from
above, until at last, seeing to what lengths he was going, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God! it is no good sitting here with my hands in my lap. I
must go down and put matters straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So God took on the form of man, and went down among the people,
going from country to country and from village to village. At last, one
day, he made it known through all the land that all the clever men
should come together at a certain place to perform their arts, and
whoever would win in that competition, he would give him a sackful of
gold.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, all the clever men came together in a big hall
which God had prepared. It was surrounded by numerous apple-trees on
all sides. The clever men did what they could, each one more clever
than the other. They changed themselves into cats and dogs. At last God
said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all done very well, but I would ask you to make me
an apple like those on the trees here around.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>In vain did they try to make an apple, but they could not succeed.
So God sent lightning among them, which so terrified them that they
crawled into the apples to hide themselves there. And God turned them
into caterpillars that can only live in apples. This is the origin of
the worm (<i lang="la">Carpocapsa pomonella</i>) which infests the
orchards of apples and pears. In order to protect them from this pest
the Rumanians of Bukovina keep a special Day of the worms, on the
Tuesday in the first week of the month of May. On it, it is strictly
forbidden to work, and it is good to give away a cake and other good
things in alms for the benefit (of the souls) of these men turned into
flies. It is also good to bring into the orchard a red Easter egg,
which has been taken to Church.</p>
<p>Whoever catches an orchard worm and spits on its head, he spits on
the devil between the horns.</p>
<p>Whoever throws any of these worms into the fire throws into it the
devil&rsquo;s servant.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>If we should call the &ldquo;clever&rdquo; men by the name of
&ldquo;Perfecti,&rdquo; of which the former is an excellent
translation, we might find in this legend a slightly changed report of
an act of accusation raised by the Inquisition against the Albigenses
and Cathars whose teachers went by the name of &ldquo;Perfecti.&rdquo;
These men were accused of being the servants and tools of the devil,
and of possessing the power of changing themselves into animals, the
cat being the special animal of the devil. It was said, moreover, that
they enticed the world to the worship of the devil, and that they had
almost succeeded in turning whole nations away from the true worship of
God, so that it required his own interposition in order to save the
world from the machinations of these men. He turned them into worms,
which at any rate continued to exist in apples and pears&mdash;the
Inquisition has turned them into dust and ashes. And yet their memory
is preserved, in spite of persecution and lives on in the memory of the
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Arrogant King and
the Monks.</span></p>
<p>It is related that when the Emperor Por married his daughter he made
a great banquet, as big as had never been done before, for he called
all the kings and governors, and so many guests came together that one
might have thought that they would eat up even Por&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>But Por the emperor knew what he had to do, and he prepared food for
all. He opened casks of wine, which had been kept closed for a thousand
years, and he spread tables in a field as large as a country, and he
brought musicians who were so skilled that one would have liked to
listen to them for ever.</p>
<p>Everything had he prepared, only one thing had he forgotten. He did
not call the priests and the nuns. The priests he left out just because
he wanted to insult them, and he did not think of having the marriage
service performed in a Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want them for?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all this can
be done without their blessing, and to have popas (priests) always
about you in your house, by God, is not quite a lucky thing, for it is
well known if you meet a popa in your way you are sure to have no luck,
for you have met the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests, seeing that Por had mocked at them, and the mothers of
the Church (the nuns) got very angry. They began ringing the bells and
praying, and they fasted three days on end, hoping that God would
hearken to their prayer and would punish the Emperor Por in such signal
manner as God alone in his wisdom could do.</p>
<p>And God, as it seems, hearkened to their prayer, for while the
tables were laden with meat and drink, and all the guests <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>had
sat themselves down to eat and drink, suddenly the heavens grew dark, a
mighty wind arose, and out of the sky came down a thick black cloud of
winged things with large mouths, voracious and hungry.</p>
<p>They settled on the tables and devoured every bit of food that could
be found, and drank every drop of wine. The guests turned sick at this
horrible sight, and, falling ill, they all died there and then. From a
wedding feast it became a huge burial, the fame of which spread
throughout the lands. No one knew why this misfortune had befallen
them, only Por understood what had happened, and before his death he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be done without the mercy and grace of God. And
this has been my punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the locusts (<i lang="la">Pachytylus migratorius</i>)
which God sends upon men when they forget the true God.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The r&ocirc;le assigned here to the official priests, the
&ldquo;popa&rdquo; of the orthodox religion, is in perfect harmony with
that sectarian teaching which could not find words strong and
opprobrious enough against the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Church and its
ministers. The belief is still alive in Rumania that to meet a
&ldquo;popa,&rdquo; as he is called, is an evil omen, and the people
will often desist from some enterprise if a popa has met them. There
are practices by which the evil consequences of such a meeting could be
averted; but they belong to those of primitive society. This story
seems also to have been originally a satire against these popas. They
were the original locusts who descended upon the tables of the rich and
mighty, but now the point has been blunted and the lesson deliberately
turned round, making the locusts the means of punishment for ignoring
the priests. The man who told this tale must have had a mischievous
twinkle in his eye, not lost on his hearers, but evidently lost upon
him who wrote it down afterwards.</p>
<p>The Emperor Por is none else than the Indian King Porus who plays so
important a part in the legendary history of Alexander the Great. This
is one of the most popular Rumanian chap-books&mdash;probably the
oldest in Rumanian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>folk-lore. There are a number of traces of
this legendary history in the Rumanian popular literature. We shall
meet another reference to it in the history of the cricket, No. 65, and
of the cuckoo, No. 91.</p>
<p>This story evidently belongs to the cycle of legends in which an
emperor tries to invite God and his host to dine with him, boasting
that he would be able to feed them. He decks tables along the sea shore
and waits for God to come to the banquet. But a wind rises and blows
everything into the sea. A sage explains to the emperor that thus far
only one of the servants of God&mdash;the wind&mdash;has partaken of
his banquet. (<i>v.</i> Gaster, <i>Exempla of the Rabbis</i>,
<i>No.</i> 12.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of Jesus and the Unkind
Reaper.</span></p>
<p>Another large kind of locust or grasshopper is also known by the
name of &ldquo;little horse&rdquo; or &ldquo;mower.&rdquo; For the
explanation of the last name the following legend is told:</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time when Jesus and St. Joseph hid themselves for fear
of the heathen in some very high grass which reached to their waist, it
is told that a giant came there to cut the grass, and he carried a huge
scythe, and with each stroke he cut down a large swath. Christ and St.
Joseph, seeing the work of that man and fearing lest they should be
discovered by the heathen if all the grass were cut down, asked him not
to cut any more. But when he heard that Christ begged him to stop, he
just went on with his work more furiously, full of spite, for was not
he also a heathen who wanted to catch him? When Christ saw this he
prayed to God to put as many obstacles in the giant&rsquo;s way as
possible, for it was still some time before the sun would set, and he
would otherwise quickly finish the cutting of the whole field. God
heard him, and he sent a heat so fierce that it dried up even the
tongue in the man&rsquo;s mouth. The mower, however, did not care. He
only cast off all his clothes and went on with his work in his shirt.
When God saw that the giant would not stop he changed the weather and
made it so bad that you would not have allowed a dog to leave the
house. But the mower went on with his work undisturbed. The only thing
which he did was to pick up the clothes which he had cast off and to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>put them on again, and he made swaths as wide as
the high road.</p>
<p>When Christ saw the progress which he made he trembled like a reed.
He feared lest the heathen would catch him. Angrily, he knelt down, and
cursing the giant, he said: &ldquo;Cursed shalt thou be, thou
disobedient and callous mower, all thy life henceforth thou shalt be
always only mowing and never gain any benefit from it. As long as the
world stands thou shalt always be running to and fro among the reapers,
who will cut thy legs as a punishment for not having listened to
me.&rdquo; No sooner was this curse uttered, when the giant was turned
into a small green insect with long legs, which to this very day is
seen hopping between the blades of grass on meadows and fields, running
in front of the scythes of cutters of grass. This insect is called the
mower (<i lang="la">Locusta viridissima</i>). <span class=

<p>There is another legend of the origin of the grasshopper.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When Christ was born in the stable, the animals which were there
were starved to death by the owner. There was no one who would as much
as put a handful of hay into the manger. The Holy Mother, full of pity
for the poor animals, asked the master of the house to give them at
least a forkful of hay. The master, however, shrugging his shoulders
said that all that he had, was gone and he could not give her even as
little as a handful. &ldquo;If that be so, why did not you provide more
hay last summer?&rdquo; asked the Holy Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? just because I was too lazy to cut more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; replied the Holy Mother, angrily,
&ldquo;then thou shalt become a mower, and all thy life thou shalt not
do anything else, but from early morning to late at night thou shalt
cut grass and yet have no benefit therefrom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had she uttered these words than the master was turned
into the grasshopper called the &ldquo;mower,&rdquo; and such has he
remained to this very day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE NUN BEETLE COVER ITS FACE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of St. Peter and the Girl
Messenger.</span></p>
<p>In the time of the Holy Apostles, there was great trouble among the
heathen giants, as they did not know whom to elect as ruler. The
heathen then came in large numbers to the Christians, asking for their
vote, and came even to St. Peter, who was then the headman of the
Apostles. St. Peter, realising the importance of this election, took
counsel with his brothers the Apostles. They decided to call together
all the Christians in an Assembly to decide which part they were to
take. A good number came together. But as at that time the Christians
were scattered far and wide, and lived a good way distant one from
another, and also were afraid of the heathen, the greater number stayed
at home.</p>
<p>For in such troublous times who would have liked to leave his wife
and children alone at home? Moreover, at that time Christians were not
permitted to meet, for when the heathen caught them speaking to one
another, they poured oil upon them and burned them like torches. Still,
when St. Peter had got a few counsellors together, they discussed what
was best to be done. The one said one thing, the other another, as
people do even to-day when talking in council, but if you think you are
getting on any further, you are waiting in vain, for nothing comes out
of it.</p>
<p>St. Peter, who was more learned than the rest, saw that no good was
coming out of their deliberations, and as he was the headman, he got up
from his seat and said, &ldquo;If we are to give our people good and
sound advice, we all know that as for battle, good and strong men are
wanted, so we must also have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>clever men. Unfortunately,
however, there are no such men in our midst. We also know that if the
heathen see us going from house to house, and find out our intentions,
it might go very ill with us. We must therefore find out other means,
so that our enemies should not even suspect our action. I, as the
oldest among you, have come to the conclusion that we must get some
very clever women. We might then possibly win our case. Let us make a
list of all such women and instruct them carefully. We can then send
them to the houses of the Christians to advise them what to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; replied the other learned men, and they
called out all the clever women from the list which they had made, and
by teaching them day and night, they fitted them for their work and
sent them to the houses of the Christians. Before they left, however,
they were told that they were neither to turn back and look at
anything, nor were they to look straight into the eyes of strangers,
for their eyes were bewitched by the devil, nor should they speak to
strangers, who would pour poison into their souls. After receiving
these instructions, they all covered their faces and left only holes
for their eyes. Then they took food for the journey, taking care to
fast regularly for two days and eating only on the third. One of them,
called &ldquo;Nun,&rdquo; going into a town where the people were
dressed up more richly than in any other town, met a young man, tall as
a reed, white as foam, with a crisp upturned moustache, a small
well-proportioned mouth, and eyes glittering like those of a snake. He
stood quite alone! The young man, cunning as the young men of our days
are, no sooner set eyes on the young woman, when he began to tell her
of all that is in the heavens and upon earth, and made her forget her
errand and the instructions which she had received. So she unveiled her
face, and began to talk in such a manner that no man would have stopped
her from going on. In the end she told him even of the intentions of
the Christians and of the teaching of St. Peter. As soon as he had
heard all she had to tell him, the young man disappeared, for he was
none else than the son of Satan. St. Peter, who knew all that had
happened, for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>angel of God had told him, started after
the young woman in order that he might stop her from revealing to
others the intentions of the Christians. He found her in a meadow
playing with some children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy name is <i>nun</i>, thy name shall remain <i>nun</i>
(<i lang="la">Mantissa religiosa</i>), but thou shalt not have any
longer a human shape, as thou hast thrown away the veil, and has denied
thy beautiful face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the nun beheld St. Peter she got frightened, and tried to pull
the veil over her face, which was uncovered, but she could not do it,
for God had changed her into a little green beetle which to this very
day joins its front legs, and it looks as if it intended to cover its
face with them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This legend has been turned into a charm against a bad wife. Put the
nun under her head at night, and say three nights consecutively the
following charm:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Faithless Nun, St. Peter had taught thee;</p>
<p class="line">St. Peter has sent thee to do good to the Christians,
to give them good teaching; to the ignorant thou hast given
instruction.</p>
<p class="line">But thy conduct was bad,</p>
<p class="line">For thou hast spoken to the enemies,</p>
<p class="line">And hast shown thy uncovered face;</p>
<p class="line">And God has punished thee.</p>
<p class="line">I now have also a wife, like unto a spark, with bad
tongue and evil speech&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Evil in every way&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Bad, envious, cheating,</p>
<p class="line">Restless,</p>
<p class="line">Always in motion, with a heart full of sin.</p>
<p class="line">Thou, O faithless Nun, smitten by God,</p>
<p class="line">Condemned by men,</p>
<p class="line">Make my wife to become good.</p>
<p class="line">From bad and faithless, make her good and faithful.</p>
<p class="line">From cheating and envious, make her good and
loving.</p>
<p class="line">Otherwise, woe unto her.</p>
<p class="line">Woe unto thy kind,</p>
<p class="line">For I will set upon it and utterly destroy it.</p>
<p class="line">I will fall upon it and annihilate it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She will then repent of her evil ways. This charm is
only to be used in the case when the wife is younger than the
husband.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the charm we have the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; or narrative
element, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>in the legend we have the symbolical in the
application which is assumed to run on parallel lines&mdash;the woman
must also be faithful, obedient, chaste, must not look into other
people&rsquo;s eyes nor talk to strangers&mdash;a grave danger for her
soul. And finally the &ldquo;threat&rdquo; that unless the
&ldquo;nun&rdquo; will do the bidding, she will be severely chastised,
just like the demons in older conjurations, who are first cajoled and
then threatened. It is thoroughly typical, and shows the depths of
belief in the power of even the little insect which is, however, still
seen as a &ldquo;nun&rdquo; in a human form well instructed and
powerful, in spite of its actual &ldquo;disguise.&rdquo; No real line
of demarcation is drawn between the human being and the meanest
creature. In popular belief and imagination they all live and move on
the same plane.</p>
<p>There is another tale told about this insect, which seems to be
another attempt to explain its name Nun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>It is said that the devil&mdash;may he go into the wild desert and
remain there&mdash;had a very bad-tempered daughter. She was so bad
that in the whole world there was none other like her to make a couple
of them. When the devil saw that, devil though he was, he was yet no
match for his daughter, he slyly got her into a convent and made a nun
of her, in the hope that she might perchance repent and change for the
better. But the daughter remained what she was; ill-tempered and bad.
She kept making mischief without end. God, who could not tolerate a
daughter of the devil in a convent, and seeing also that the daughter
of the unclean was doing all kinds of mischief, changed her into an
insect. The other sisters, seeing what had happened, called it Nun, and
this has remained its name to our very days.</p>
<p>It is curious that this insect should bear the name
&ldquo;nun&rdquo; in almost all European languages. I am not aware,
however, of any legend except the Rumanian explaining the name.

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE WASP THE GIPSIES&rsquo; BEE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Wasp, the Gipsies
and the Rumanians.</span></p>
<p>In the beginning the wasp belonged to the Rumanians, and the bee to
the Gipsies. When the former saw how useless, nay, dangerous, the wasps
were, and how useful the bees, they cheated the Gipsies into changing
with them.</p>
<p>Those of aforetime tell us that when God made the living creatures
which move with the sun, he made the bee first. The Gipsy, impudent and
greedy, as he has remained to this very day, stole the bee from the
hand of God saying, &ldquo;Give it to me, O Lord, that I may eat of its
honey, I and my little ones. And of the wax&mdash;I will make candles
to light them up for thee in the Church.&rdquo; God did not say
anything, but kept silent and looked angrily at the Gipsy, for he was
annoyed at the Gipsy&rsquo;s impudence. He made up his mind to punish
him. He therefore at once made the big wasp, and, after he had made it,
he gave it to the Rumanians, saying, &ldquo;Take this, for the bee has
been ordained for the Gipsy, and he has taken his share.&rdquo; The
Rumanian took the wasp, and thanked God. Sometime afterwards the Gipsy
met the Rumanian, and he asked him whether his bee had brought him much
honey. The Rumanian, smart as ever, replied, &ldquo;My bee has filled
many barrels, for this bee carries the honey in bagfuls, as it was big
and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the Gipsy, &ldquo;I see that he has deceived
me; my bee has not filled a cup with honey, and my duckies have not
even rubbed their lips with honey. Let us exchange our bees, my little
Rumanian.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you give in addition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I give you? By God, I have nothing. I will make an
axe of my iron and give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let it be so. Bring here your hive and I will
bring you mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and the Gipsy went with the Rumanian to
the hut and gave him the hive. The Rumanian took it home, and when they
reached the forest the Rumanian showed him a big tree, as thick as a
barrel and high as the heavens, where the Rumanian had put before the
wasps and where they had grown to a very large number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you Gipsy, are my bees in this hollow tree. It is full
of honey enough to satisfy your whole nation of Gipsies and some to
remain over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. May God bless you,&rdquo; replied the Gipsy.</p>
<p>The Rumanian went home to look after the bees. The Gipsy gathered
his whole nation together. They brought copper pans and pots and
ladders, and came to the tree to eat of the honey to their fill.
Arrived there, they leaned the ladder just against the hole by which
the wasps went out and came in. Full of courage, as the Gipsy is by
nature, he took a pot for the honey and climbed up the ladder. No
sooner had he got there when a wasp thrust its sting into him. Another
stung him on the nose, and another, and again another, and the Gipsy
could not see out of his eyes because of the pain, and he began howling
there on the top of the tree. He forgot the honey and everything, and
cried, &ldquo;Keep the ladder, keep the pot, keep me also, for we are
falling,&rdquo; and down he came with a thud. How long he lay there
with broken bones I do not know, but I do know that he had had enough
of wasps&rsquo; honey to last him to the end of his days. Since then
the bees belong to the Rumanians, and the wasps are the Gipsies&rsquo;
bees. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=

Present.</span></p>
<p>When God had finished making the trees and grass, the sun and moon,
and all that lives and moves, he sat down on his seat and ordered all
the creatures to come to him that he might bless them. Every one came
and brought a gift according to its best, and God blessed each one
according to its nature. The sheep brought wool and milk, and the Lord
blessed it, and bade it clothe the house of the Rumanians with its wool
and feed the babies with its milk. The bee brought sweet honey and wax
with the perfume of all the flowers. God blessed it, so that with the
honey man&rsquo;s food should be sweetened, and the wax should light
the Church at the Holy Office. Thus each creature got the blessing
according to its ways. Now came the turn of the hornet, by nature lazy
and accustomed to live by theft. What could she bring? and again, how
could she come with empty hands before the throne of the Almighty? So,
finding a piece of cardboard, she picked it up and brought it to God.
The Lord understood the trick which the hornet wanted to play on him,
and how lazy she was. He, therefore, cursed her that all her work
should be as brittle as bits of cardboard, and she should live only by
theft. Her habitation should be the chimney, and her nest should be
broken by everybody. So has it remained to this very day. The nests
look as if they had been made of cardboard, they hang down from the
smoky chimneys of houses, as if they were to be smoked; she lives by
theft and even upon dead bodies, and her nest is always broken up.

<p>It is told that one of the descendants of Cain had many children,
one worse than the other. When sent on an errand to bring one thing,
out of spite they would bring another; they were of no good to anyone.
Their mother, who was a wicked and stingy bird (eagle), did nothing
else from morning to evening but curse and shout and peck at them. The
youngest, who was the worst, finding his mother in a violent temper,
started quarrelling with her so loudly that the noise could be heard at
the other end of the country. They even went so far as to fight one
another. The mother, who was a strong woman, got the best of her son at
first, but the youngster, biting her in the throat, drank all her blood
until she died. Before dying, however, the mother cursed him that none
of his children should ever be prosperous, though they should be very
numerous. They should live in the hollows of trees and feed on dead
human bodies. They should become flies with poisonous stings, and their
blood should change into poison. When he heard his mother&rsquo;s curse
the youth ran into the forest, and the quicker he ran the more it
appeared to him that he became smaller and lighter, until one morning
he found himself changed into a hornet with a yellow body. <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS THE WOODPECKER SUCH A LONG BEAK AND WHY DOES
IT PECK AT THE TREES?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the Inquisitive
Woman.</span></p>
<p>Know that the woodpecker was originally not a bird but an old woman
with a very long nose, which she put into everybody&rsquo;s pots and
pans, sniffing about, eavesdropping, inquisitive and curious about
everything whether it belonged to her or not, adding a little in her
tale-bearing and taking off a bit from another tale, and so making
mischief among her neighbours. When God saw her doings, he took a huge
sack and filled it with midges, beetles, ants, and all kinds of
insects, and, tying it tightly, gave it to the old woman, and said to
her: &ldquo;Now take this sack and carry it home, but beware of opening
it, for if your curiosity makes you put your nose into it you will find
more than you care for, and you will have trouble without
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; replied the old hag, &ldquo;that I
should do such a thing; I am not going against the will of God. I shall
be careful.&rdquo; So she took the sack on her back and started
trotting home, but whilst she was carrying it her fingers were already
twitching, and she could scarcely restrain herself, so no sooner did
she find herself a short distance away than she sat down in a meadow
and opened the sack. That was just what the insects wanted, for no
sooner did she open it than they started scrambling out and scampered
about the field, each one running his own way as fast as its little
legs would carry it. Some hid themselves in the earth, others scrambled
under the grass, others, again, went up the trees, and all ran away as
fast as they could. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the old woman saw what had happened, she got mightily
frightened, and tried to gather the insects to pack them up again, and
put them back into the sack. But the insects did not wait for her. They
knew what to do, and a good number escaped into the field. Some she was
able to catch, and these she packed into the sack, and tied it up. Then
came the Voice of God, who asked her what she had done, and if that was
the way she kept her promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the insects, beetles and midges, which I gave you
to carry? From this moment you shall change into a bird and go about
picking up all these insects until you get my sack full again, and only
then can you become a human being again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she changed into a woodpecker; the long beak is the long nose
of the old woman, and she goes about hunting for these midges, beetles
and ants in the hope of filling up the sack, when she would again
resume her human shape. But to this very day she has not completed her
task, and has remained the woodpecker. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the Disobedient
Man.</span></p>
<p>The story of the woodpecker finds its closest parallel in the story
of the pelican. It is difficult to say which of the two is the
original, and which has been borrowed from the other. Certain legends
have been adapted to more than one subject, in the same manner as
ballads and tales and legends are often transferred from one hero or
another. It is that elasticity of adaptation, which to a certain extent
gives them the popularity which they enjoy. It is the very essence of
the tale not to be too much localised, but on the contrary to be able
to pass from one country to another, and to be fitted to the most
diverse circumstances and persons, so long as the general framework has
been retained. Popular imagination has no patience, and, in fact, no
room, for rigid forms or for mathematical formulae. The material which
it handles must be soft as wax to be moulded and kneaded, and thin like
gossamer to be woven into many strands. Of course, the work of it can
be seen in the variations in the theme and in its adaptation to the new
purpose. Thus in the following story:</p>
<p>God and St. Peter were once upon a time walking upon the earth.
There came a great swarm of creeping things like rats, snakes,
scorpions and other vermin of this kind, as well as beetles, insects,
ants and so on. They crowded round them, and with great impudence
worried them, nay, even tried to bite them. St. Peter, who felt annoyed
by the constant worry of the vermin, said at last to God: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good of keeping all these vermin upon the earth?
see how impudent, how aggressive they are! They molest even us, and try
to bite us, what then must the poor human beings be suffering through
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;if it is thy wish, and
thou thinkest to save mankind of the attacks and molestations of these
animals, I will try to do as thou desirest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he gathered them all together and put them in a huge sack, and
tied it carefully by the mouth, and he said to St. Peter, &ldquo;Let us
go and throw it into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way they fell in with a man, who was going in the same
direction. And God said to him, &ldquo;Whither art thou
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to the sea for fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pay thee well,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;if you will
take this sack and take it to the sea and empty it into it. But mind,
you must not open it before you reach the shore; there, turning the
sack upside down, loosen it gently and let everything fall straight
into the water. Be careful and carry out my orders exactly, otherwise
instead of obtaining a reward you will get yourself into serious
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For sure,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;I know how to carry
out orders, you may rely on me, I will do exactly as I am
bidden.&rdquo; Then, shouldering the sack, he went on his way to the
sea. The sack was somewhat heavy and the way to the sea rather long.
Tired by the weight of the sack, he sat down in the midst of his
journey and rested. Then he asked himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be in that sack? why should those old men want me to
empty it into the sea? I will just loosen it a little and see.&rdquo;
And so he did. But no sooner had he loosened it a little when the
animals, which were all squeezed by God into the sack, pressed forward,
and, before the man could count two, out they were running, each one
wherever his eyes would lead him and his legs would carry him. Before
he had time to recover from his astonishment, he saw the two old men
standing by his side, and, pointing to the sack, God said to him:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the way thou hast kept thy promise? As a punishment
thou shalt no longer be a human being, but a bird with long legs to be
able to run quickly after all these animals, and with a long beak to
pick them up, and under thy throat I will fasten the empty sack to fill
it with the animals caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus he has remained to this very day, walking about on his long
legs, looking round with his keen eyes, and trying to pick up all
possible vermin which he espies crawling upon the earth. <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE TITMOUSE GET INTO THE PUMPKIN?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the Food of the
Titmouse.</span></p>
<p>When God had made all the creatures, he called every one of them and
told them what their food should be. Among the birds was the titmouse.
To her God turned and said, &ldquo;Thy food shall be the seed of the
pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The titmouse, knowing that the seed of the pumpkin was very sweet,
did not wait to hear whether God said anything more, but, greedy and
impatient, ran as fast as she could, relishing beforehand the
delightful food which God had given her. So coming down to the earth,
she alighted on a field in which maize was growing, and among it a
large number of pumpkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, now, I have the food ready for me, and I am going to
have a good time.&rdquo; But she had made a wrong calculation. When she
got up to the pumpkins, she found to her dismay that the skin of the
pumpkin was as hard as bone. So she tried to pick a hole in it. She
went round and round, but wherever she tapped it with her little beak,
she found the shell too hard for her.</p>
<p>Bitterly disappointed, she went away and tried to feed as best she
could by catching flies and beetles. So she eked out a miserable
livelihood only and solely because she was greedy, and had not waited
to hear what God had to say to her when he gave her that food.</p>
<p>The time came when God was walking upon the earth. The titmouse
heard of it, and knowing the loving-kindness and mercy of God, and that
he would have pity if he heard of her miserable life, she took courage
and went to meet him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>and told him how hard it was for
her, that after having had a gift from God, she could not enjoy it. She
asked God, therefore, that he would at least make a soft part in the
skin of the pumpkin that would become a hole, by which she could get
inside the pumpkin and eat the pips which were given to her for food.
God took pity on the little creature, who begged so piteously, and so,
taking a pumpkin, God made a hole in it. The titmouse got into it, and
did not leave the pumpkin until she had picked all the seeds. From that
time onwards the titmouse, whenever she sees a field of pumpkins, will
go round and round each pumpkin trying to find one with a hole, by
which to get into it and eat the pips.</p>
<p>The titmouse was too quick again this time, for it did not ask God
to make two holes, to get in by one and out by the other, so now the
pumpkin often becomes a snare and a prison. Boys have only to make a
hole in the pumpkin for the titmouse to get into it and then they catch
it without any trouble. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS THE NIGHTINGALE A DRAB COLOUR?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When God created the world he made all the living
creatures of one colour, or rather with none, for no one had any
colouring on its wings, feathers, or skin. So, one day, God called all
his creatures to paint them with different colours as he chose. All the
birds and beasts and creeping things came, and God gave every one a
different coat to wear. Only the nightingale did not come, as she had
not heard of God&rsquo;s command. At last some birds, seeing her, told
her what had happened. So she hastened to come to God. But when the
nightingale appeared before God, the paint-pot was quite empty, and no
trace of any paint (colour) was left. It had all been spent on those
who had come before. Thus nothing could be done, and the nightingale
remained with her drab colour. God, however, wanted to compensate the
nightingale for the lack of any colour, so he gave her a very beautiful
voice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS THE NIGHTINGALE TWELVE TUNES AND WHY DOES THE
TURTLE-DOVE COO?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time the nightingale met the turtle-dove.
After greeting one another, the nightingale said, &ldquo;Sister, let us
keep awake during the night and learn some tunes to sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite agreeable,&rdquo; said the turtle-dove, &ldquo;and in
the morning we shall see what each one of us has learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following night the nightingale kept awake and listened
attentively to all the sounds that could be heard. She heard the
shepherd playing on his pipe, and the wind whistling, and the dogs
barking, and lambs calling, and many more sounds, and thus learned no
less than twelve tunes. The turtle-dove, lazy as she is by nature, did
not keep awake, but went to sleep as soon as the night grew dark. She
slept almost the whole night through, and awoke only at the break of
dawn. There was no sound to be heard. It was all quiet. Suddenly she
heard a man driving his horses to the fields shouting &ldquo;trr,
trr.&rdquo; This sound she picked up, and no other. In the morning she
went to find her sister the nightingale, and asked her whether she had
heard anything, and whether she had learned any tunes. If so, would she
mind singing to her?</p>
<p>The nightingale replied, &ldquo;Oh, I have heard many songs, and
have learned many tunes.&rdquo; And without waiting any longer, she
began to warble her songs. The turtle-dove sat listening, lost in
admiration at the beautiful singing of the nightingale. When the latter
had finished her songs, she asked the turtle-dove: &ldquo;And what have
you learned, sister mine?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The turtle-dove, full of shame over her laziness, owned that she had
not kept awake, but had gone to sleep, and that the only sound and song
she had learned was &ldquo;trr, trr,&rdquo; which she had picked up
from the man who was driving his horses to the field. And so it has
remained to this very day. The nightingale sings all the night through
and stops towards the morning, when the turtle-dove awakens and starts
its &ldquo;trr, trr.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE NIGHTINGALE THE SONGSTER OF THE KING?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Nightingale, the
Blackbird and the Thrush.</span></p>
<p>The king of the birds, feeling one day in a good humour, wanted to
find out which of his subjects could sing best. So he sent an order to
his birds to select from amongst themselves those whom they thought to
be the best singers. All the birds came together, and, after having
heard many of the birds who said they could sing, they selected three
from amongst them and sent up, as the best singers for the king to
choose from, the yellow thrush, the blackbird, and the nightingale. The
thrush, with his beautiful golden feathers which glow in the light of
the sun, was allowed to go first as the most beautiful of them; nay, he
put himself at the head and walked first. The blackbird, which has a
yellow beak, and whose feathers are shining like silk, walked
immediately behind, whilst the little nightingale, small of build, with
the drab-coloured feathers, followed meekly in the rear. When they
reached the palace, the king, seeing how beautiful the thrush looked
with his golden feathers, received him affably and placed him at the
head of the table. The thrush, swelling with pride, began its song. The
king listened attentively, and being pleased with the song he praised
the thrush very much. Then came the turn of the blackbird; when the
king saw it, he welcomed it and ordered a chair to be brought near the
table. The blackbird took its place and started singing. It sang much
more beautifully than the thrush. The king was very pleased, and he
expressed his delight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>The last to come in was the
nightingale. When it entered the hall, it bowed down meekly to the
earth before the king, touching the floor with its little beak. When
the king saw that little ungainly bird, so small and meek and skinny
and of no appearance, he wondered what that bird wanted at the court,
and somewhat angrily he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; without even offering her a seat, as
he had done to the other guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your majesty, do not be angry with your
servant; I have been selected by the other birds to sing here before
your majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then; sing, I will just see what you can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nightingale, which did not even dare to look at the king, just
cleared her voice and started singing as she alone knows how to sing,
not like the others. When the king heard her singing, he was quite
taken aback with the beauty and sweetness of her voice; he was full of
admiration, for the nightingale had thrown the other birds into the
shade (lit. had put them under the bushel).</p>
<p>When the nightingale had finished her song, the king did not allow
her to stop in the doorway where she had been standing any longer, but
called her up to the head of the table, and gave her the seat of the
thrush, and, when the meal was over and all the guests rose from the
table, it was the nightingale who walked first, and the blackbird,
which sang better than the thrush, walked immediately behind, whilst
the thrush, in spite of his grand array, now came third, feeling
abashed and ashamed by his failure. And from that time onward the
nightingale has been recognised as the best singer amongst them all,
and all the birds must bow their heads before her.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There are a few more tales about the origin of the nightingale, but
they are somewhat confused. They do not seem to account either for the
beauty of its voice or for the simplicity of its appearance.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Boastful Thrush and
St. Peter.</span></p>
<p>It was in the month of March, when Christ was walking on the earth
with St. Peter. Going through a forest they saw a thrush strutting
about on the top of a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Thrush,&rdquo; said St. Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no time for you,&rdquo; replied the thrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, prithee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you see, I am just now making summer, and I am busy.
To-day I am going to be married, and to-morrow a brother of mine has a
wedding,&rdquo; he said, turning his back upon them proudly.</p>
<p>St. Peter and Christ said nothing, but went on their way. In that
afternoon there came a cold and heavy rain. It came down in torrents
all the afternoon, and during the night there came a frost from God
which made the stones crack, and it snowed heavily also. The next
morning, after they had done what they had to do, Christ and St. Peter
came again through the forest, and they found the thrush sitting now on
one of the lowest branches of the tree, huddled together and trembling,
with no more thoughts of marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Thrush,&rdquo; said St. Peter, when he saw
him sitting there huddled together and trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing now? Why are you sitting so huddled
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day I am dying, and to-morrow a brother of mine is
dying,&rdquo; he answered, letting his beak down and ruffling his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>feathers to protect himself a little more
against the frost which had struck him to the heart.</p>
<p>From that time on the thrush does not boast any more that he is
making summer, and that he is going to marry; but he cries anxiously:
&ldquo;Socks and sandals, for to-morrow it snows, good socks of cloth
and sandals of leaves to go in them to my beloved.&rdquo; This he sings
because of the fear of being caught again in snow and frost, and of not
being able to walk about in safety. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning the partridge had red feathers. God
had painted her so when he painted all the other creatures, but for one
reason or another the partridge was not very pleased with this colour.
After a time she thought she would go to God and ask him to change her
colour. When she came to God, he asked her, &ldquo;What ails
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not like the dye of my
feathers.&rdquo; And God asked her what was the reason for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not like it.&rdquo; Upon
which God, getting hold of her, threw her into a box filled with ashes.
When the partridge recovered her senses&mdash;for she was dazed by the
fall&mdash;she was mightily indignant at the disgrace, and, climbing
out of the box, she went as fast as she could to the nearest brook,
wishing to wash away the ashes in which she was smothered. She wished
to avoid being seen in that state by the other birds. So she started
dipping her beak into the water and trying to wash off the ashes on her
back. But, instead of washing the ashes completely off, she managed to
carry the ashes with her wet beak under her wings also and along her
sides. And that is why she has remained to this very day mottled and
freckled, the grey of the ashes being mixed with the red&mdash;the

see, God was too busy to bother about these little things. When he had
finished making everything that he intended to make, he called all the
birds together and said, &ldquo;Now, I am going to paint you with nice
colours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the birds heard that message, they came all overjoyed to God,
who took his brush and dipped in various pots filled with paint and
painted them one by one. When he had almost finished, who would come
but the thistle-finch, with his feathers all ruffled and out of breath.
When God saw the little bird, he said to him, &ldquo;Well, little
master, how do you look, where have you been, have you not heard my
command, why did you not come in time? Now all the paint is gone, I
cannot do anything for you, and it serves you right, you should have
come in time like the others did.&rdquo; And the little bird began to
weep and said, &ldquo;O God, I am quite innocent, just look at me and
see what a state I am in; I was very hungry and tried to find something
to eat, but could not find anything for a long time, until I espied at
last a few grains of millet in a bush of thistles. So I got in and
started picking. But, as soon as I moved, the thistles got hold of me
and would not let me go, and the more I tried to get out, the more
strongly did they hold me, and tore my feathers and dishevelled my
hair, and it was only after a long tussle that I was able to get myself
free and come here.&rdquo;</p>

can do,&rdquo; and taking his brush he endeavoured to pick up the drops
of paint which were left at the bottom of the various pots. Taking them
all on the tip of his brush, he sprinkled the little bird all over with
the drops of the various colours which he had picked up from the bottom
of the pots, and that is the reason why the thistle-finch has so many
spots and so many colours. His name has remained to this very day
&ldquo;little master&rdquo; (<i lang="ro">domnisor</i> in Rumanian) and
also thistle-finch, because the thistles ruffled his feathers and tore
at him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Brutish
Innkeeper.</span></p>
<p>There lived in a town a brutish man, a grocer, who had only one
care, and that was how to cheat and rob in the quickest fashion the
people who came to deal with him. But this was not all, for, bad as it
is, one might let it pass, as there are so many others who do likewise,
cheating their customers right and left. But this man was also a
usurious moneylender, and he managed it so well that, instead of
helping people, he took the last shirt off their backs and sent them
out to die in misery. He sucked the blood of everyone who fell into his
clutches.</p>
<p>But everything comes to an end. But no man is likely to repent
unless he has first come to grief. So it happened also to this wicked
man. Instead of being satisfied with what he had been able to get by
draining the very blood of his Christian fellow-men, he persisted in
his evil doings, robbing and fleecing right and left, without mercy and
without pity. When the cries of his victims came up to God, he decided
to punish him, and for his wickedness he changed him into the
bullfinch, which has still kept some of the features of the man, when
he was a human being. For he had a head like a melon, and a wide mouth,
and that is why the bullfinch has such a big head and such a broad
beak. The black feathers on its head are the black cap of lambskin
which he used to wear. The red breast is the blood of the victims whom
he had sucked dry, and the big body is the big belly of the voracious
fellow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now when a bullfinch is caught, remembering its evil deeds, it will
bite out its tongue and die rather than become a mockery to the people
whom he had ill-treated in his former life. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Hoopoe and its
Greed.</span></p>
<p>When God had created all the creatures, he gave everyone the food
which he thought best for them. When the turn of the hoopoe came, God
said to her, &ldquo;Thy food shall be millet seed.&rdquo; The hoopoe
was not satisfied. She did not think it was good enough for her. So God
in his goodness gave her barley grains for food, but the hoopoe cannot
easily be satisfied. So she went on asking for better food. And God
said, &ldquo;Let wheat be thy food.&rdquo; And still the hoopoe was not
satisfied. So God got angry, and said, &ldquo;Thou impudent and greedy
thing, I have given thee the best food that is in this world, and in
which even man rejoices and is satisfied, but as this is not good
enough for thee, thou shalt find thy food henceforth in the droppings
of other animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same happened when God arranged the dwelling-places of birds,
where they should build their nests. He had at first given to the
hoopoe sweet-smelling bushes and flowering trees to build her nest in.
But she wanted something better, and she was punished in the same way
as with the food. She now makes her nest in places which are anything
but clean and sweet-smelling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"

BIRD?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When God had made the world and all the creatures and
man, he gave to each one the food from which they should eat and be
satisfied. All the creatures thanked God, and whenever they eat their
food they are satisfied, except only the wagtail and the Gipsy who are
never satisfied. When God saw the greed of these two, he grew very
angry and said to the wagtail, &ldquo;You shall not be allowed to go
near any village unless the Gipsies, after having eaten, say with their
full heart that they are quite satisfied.&rdquo; And to the Gipsy he
said, &ldquo;When the wagtail will come into the villages, only then
shall you be satisfied.&rdquo; But the Gipsies, even when they are
invited to the meals freely given in honour of the dead, however much
they may eat and stuff and fill, will say as soon as they have got up
from the table and gone a few steps, &ldquo;I am starving; I am dying
of hunger.&rdquo; And therefore the wagtails never come near the
village. And it is also called the Gipsies&rsquo; bird, because it can
only come near the village, when the Gipsy says he has eaten enough and
is satisfied. But as such a thing never happens, this bird cannot
approach the houses of men like other birds. Also it is called
&ldquo;half a bird,&rdquo; for all the other birds get into the village

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Hoopoe, the Cuckoo
and God.</span></p>
<p>There are a good many stories told about the hoopoe, some of them in
connection with the cuckoo. These two birds seem to be found very often
together, and the people believe them to be a pair, the cuckoo being
the male and the hoopoe the female bird. The following story is told of
them:</p>
<p>The cuckoo had married the hoopoe, and they lived happily together
for a time. But after a time the hoopoe grew ambitious, and told the
cuckoo that if he wanted to have peace in the house, he must go to God
and ask that the hoopoe should become the head woman of the village.
God, who listens patiently to the weakness of his creatures, received
the cuckoo affably and said to him, &ldquo;Go home in peace, the wish
of your wife shall be fulfilled.&rdquo; So it came to pass. After a
while the hoopoe grew more ambitious, and she sent the cuckoo again to
God, and told him to go and ask God to make her the mayoress. And God
again listened to the cuckoo&rsquo;s pleading and made his wife a
mayoress. But a woman can never be satisfied. So, after a while, she
sent the cuckoo again to God to ask him to make her the queen over all
the birds. God again listened to his prayer, and he made her queen over
all the birds. Moreover, as sign of her queenly station, God gave her
the tuft of feathers on her head, which were to be like a crown. But
also this did not satisfy the foolish hoopoe, although God had told the
cuckoo, &ldquo;Mind, this is the last time thou comest to me to trouble
me for thy wife&rsquo;s sake; there are many more things in the world
for me to do, than to listen to her wishes.&rdquo; Still she insisted
on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>cuckoo going again to God, and to ask him that
he should allow her to sit next to him on his throne in heaven. When
God heard these words, he said, &ldquo;As thy wife has had the temerity
and impudence to make such a demand and to send such a request to me,
she shall now be the least considered of all the birds. She may whoop
henceforth as much as she likes, no one is to take any notice of her.
She is to hatch her eggs in dung, whilst thou, O cuckoo, shall be
singing for as many months in the year as thou hast spent in coming to
me with these messages, and everyone shall be pleased to hear thy
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it has remained as God said. The people like the cuckoo,
whilst the hoopoe is detested by everybody. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Cuckoo and the
Wonderful Bush.</span></p>
<p>Many a tale is told about the origin of the cuckoo. Curiously
enough, they generally agree in seeing in the cuckoo a man punished for
his wickedness and cruelty, or for his faithlessness against his
companion or brother whom he is now seeking in vain.</p>
<p>There are, however, also other tales and legends in which the cuckoo
is the victim of the cruelty of others; one is the preceding one, and
others now follow: in the first place, one which tells also of the
greed of the wife&mdash;The Story of the Cuckoo and Hoopoe.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time there lived in a village a man who was so poor that
sometimes days passed and he could not get a crumb of bread. So one day
he said to his wife, &ldquo;What is the good of my stopping here any
longer. We are both dying of hunger; I will go away into the wide world
and see what luck may bring.&rdquo; So he took up his axe and went
along. Before he left, his wife said to him: &ldquo;Do not go far away,
and do not forsake me and the children, for we have no one else to look
to for help.&rdquo; So he went away. Walking alone, he came to a
forest. At the edge of the forest he saw a beautiful bush with shining
leaves, and all the twigs of equal length. It was so beautiful that the
man thought, &ldquo;I will just cut it up.&rdquo; When he drew near,
how great was his astonishment when he saw the bush bending its boughs
towards him, and speaking with a human voice, it said, &ldquo;Do not
touch me, do not hurt me, for I will do you much good.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What good can you do me?&rdquo; enquired the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to the village and they will appoint you headman.
Just go and try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed as he was on hearing the bush speak, he said to himself,
&ldquo;I lose nothing if I go back; I shall see whether the bush is
speaking the truth. If not, woe unto it,&rdquo; and so he returned. No
sooner had he come near the village, when he saw the people coming out
to meet him, and without asking him any questions, they, for reasons of
their own, appointed him to be their headman. His poverty was now a
thing of the past, and he lived in cheer and comfort. This went on for
three years, and then, for the same reasons unknown to him, the people
changed their minds, and without saying anything to him one day he was
the headman, the next he was so no longer. They had put another man in
his stead. So he returned to his want, and again began to feel the
pinch of poverty. For a time he went on as best he could, but not being
able to stand it any longer, he again took his axe, and going into the
forest he went to the bush and said, &ldquo;Now I am going to cut you
down.&rdquo; The bush again began to speak, and said to the man,
&ldquo;Do not touch me; I will do you much good. You have seen what I
have done before. You go now to that and that town and they will
appoint you to be judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing the words of the bush, the man continued his journey, and
came to the town of which the bush had spoken to him; and there, as had
been foretold, without asking him a single question, the people
appointed him mayor over the place. The man now lived in affluence and
comfort, forgetting his time of poverty and suffering he had gone
through. Here, again, after three years, just as he was appointed
without a question, so he was dismissed by the people without a
question.</p>
<p>The evil days came back, and he was looking about for a crust of
bread, but could not find any for himself and his family. He bethought
himself again of the bush, and, taking his axe upon his shoulder, he
went away to find it. The bush <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>said to him:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me; much good will I do you, still more than I
have done hitherto. You go to such and such a kingdom, and there they
will appoint you to be their emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did as he was bid, and as he came near the town, all the people
came out to meet him, and they appointed him to be their emperor. He
took his wife and children with him, and there he lived in great state,
great power and riches. The law of that land was that no man could be
emperor for more than three years, so when the three years came round
he lost his position and another emperor was appointed in his stead. He
had meanwhile amassed great fortune and no longer feared poverty. But
his wife was ambitious, and was not satisfied at living in affluence
and wealth. Envious of the other emperor, she nagged the man and
worried him and sneered at him for being so meek and being satisfied
with his lowly state, and made him go to the bush to ask for something
more. She wanted him to be even better treated than any emperor. The
poor man, what was he to do? he could not stand the trouble in his
house, so again taking his axe upon his shoulder, he came for a fourth
time to the bush. When the bush saw him, it said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has brought you hither? You are no longer in want of
anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my wife has sent
me to you. She says you must make me as great as God, greater than all
emperors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bush grew angry, and said to him: &ldquo;O miserable wretch,
always dissatisfied! I have made thee headman and judge and emperor,
and thou lackest nothing. Thou art not in want of anything. Now,
because thou hast become impudent and insolent, for thy impious wishes
thou shalt be punished. From the man thou hast been thou shalt
henceforth be a bird, restless, without peace, and without quiet,
flitting from tree to tree, and from branch to branch, always
dissatisfied, without a home, without a family, and thy name shall be
Cuckoo. Tell thy wife, who, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>she had been urging
thee on and driving thee to do this impious thing, that she shall
become the hoopoe; puffing herself up she shall cry whoop,
whoop.&rdquo; And so it has remained to this very day. (Cf. Story in
Grimm, No. 19.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Cuckoo and the
Palace of the Goldfinch.</span></p>
<p>After the creation of all the birds, God called them together and
told them they should elect a king to rule over them.</p>
<p>The birds, like human beings, would chatter and chirrup, and talk
and fight, and never come to any decision.</p>
<p>When God saw that it was going on without an end, and that it was no
good waiting for them to make their choice, he picked out the goldfinch
and said, &ldquo;This is to be your king.&rdquo; The birds submitted,
as they were bound to do, and making their obeisance to the new king,
each one departed to its own place. Although the gathering had lasted
for some time, the cuckoo was still missing, and who was the last to
come but the cuckoo. When all the birds had departed, he turned up and
made his obeisance to the new king. The goldfinch looked at him and
said, &ldquo;Hallo, cuckoo, where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I lost my way in the forest, and it took me a long time
to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will forgive you,&rdquo; said the goldfinch, &ldquo;but on
one condition; you know the forest so well. Go and make me a nice
palace out of the bast of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cuckoo, glad to have got off so cheaply, said, &ldquo;Willingly
will I do so,&rdquo; and went away.</p>
<p>You know the cuckoo, how light-headed and unstable he is: he says
one thing one day and forgets it the next, so, light-heartedly he flew
from tree to tree and allowed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>summer to pass without
remembering the promise which he had made to the goldfinch.</p>
<p>When autumn drew near he suddenly recollected that the goldfinch
expected him to build him a palace out of the bast of the tree, for the
goldfinch wanted to live in a shining palace. And that was just what
the cuckoo never intended to do.</p>
<p>Fearing the wrath of the king, he stopped singing and hid himself in
the thickest part of the forest. The goldfinch waited month after month
to see the palace, and seeing the cuckoo flitting from tree to tree and
hearing him singing, thought he was busily at work. But when the autumn
came, and no trace of any palace could be seen, he looked round to see
where the cuckoo was. But catch him if you can, for he had
disappeared.</p>
<p>And that is why the goldfinch never had the palace which he desired.
And that is also the reason why the cuckoo stops singing from the feast
of St. John, lest he be discovered by the goldfinch and taken to task
for his broken promise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us turn now to the crow, with which the raven is
often confused in the popular mind.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Of all the birds, this is considered the ugliest, especially its
young fledglings. The legend tells that sometime after God had created
all the living beings, he called everyone to see them and their
offspring. He wanted to see how the young birds and animals looked, and
then to give them suitable gifts, and food for their little ones.</p>
<p>They came one by one, and God looked at them, patted some and
stroked others, and was very pleased with every one of them, for each
one had something of beauty in it. And so he blessed them and gave them
food by which to live. The last to come was the crow, bringing her
little brood with her, very proud of them. When God cast his eyes upon
the young crows, he spat in astonishment, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely these are not my creatures. I could not have made such
ugly things. Every one of my creatures has such beautiful young ones
that they are a pleasure to look at, but thine are so ugly that it
makes one sick to look at them. Whence hast thou got this one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where should I get them from?&rdquo; replied the crow; &ldquo;it
is my very own young child,&rdquo; she added with pride. &ldquo;You had
better go back and bring me another one, this is much too ugly, I
cannot look at it.&rdquo; Annoyed at the words of God, the crow went
away, and flew all over the earth to search for another young one that
would be more beautiful than the one she had brought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>to
God. But no other young bird appeared so beautiful in her eyes as her
own. So she returned back to God and said, &ldquo;I have been all over
the world, and I have searched high and low, but young birds more
beautiful and more dainty than mine I have not been able to
find.&rdquo; Then God smilingly replied, &ldquo;Quite right, just so
are all mothers; no other child is so beautiful in their eyes as their
own.&rdquo; Then he blessed the little crows and sent them away into
the world with his gifts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THERE ENMITY BETWEEN THE CROW AND THE
HAWK?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rumanians tell another tale about the ugliness of
young crows. It is the story of the crow and the hawk.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The crow was in very great distress, for however she tried and
whatever she did, she could not rear a family. No sooner were the young
hatched, than the hawk would come and pick them up. In vain did she try
to hide her nest in the hollows of a tree or in the thickets of a bush,
as sure as death would the hawk find them and eat them.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to do, she bethought herself and said, &ldquo;How
would it do if I try and get the hawk to be godmother, for then, being
a near relation, she is sure to spare my little ones?&rdquo; Said and
done. She went out of her place to search for the hawk, and finding
her, she said, &ldquo;Good morning, sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; replied the hawk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pleased I should feel,&rdquo; said the crow, &ldquo;if
you would become godmother to my children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied the hawk, &ldquo;why
not?&rdquo; And so they made up a covenant of friendship and of
good-fellowship between them.</p>
<p>Before leaving the hawk, the crow said to her, &ldquo;Now, sister, I
have one request to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; replied the hawk, &ldquo;what is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only beg of you to spare my children, do not eat them when
you have found them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the hawk, &ldquo;I shall certainly
not touch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>them, but tell me how they look so that in case
I meet them I may spare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; replied the crow, &ldquo;mine are the most
beautiful creatures in the world, they are more lovely than any other
bird can boast of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, rest assured. Go in peace.&rdquo; And they
parted.</p>
<p>The crow, being quite satisfied with the hawk&rsquo;s promise, began
flying about the next day trying to find something with which to feed
her children. The hawk the next morning went about her own business and
tried to find some nice little young ones to eat. Flying about, she saw
the young ones of the thrush, the blackbird, and of other beautiful
birds, and she said to herself, &ldquo;Surely these are the children of
the crow; look how lovely and beautiful they are, I am not going to
touch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went all day, without finding any little birds but these; and
she said to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must keep my word to my sister, I am not going to touch
them.&rdquo; And she went to bed hungry. The next day the same thing
happened, and still the hawk kept her word and would not touch
them.</p>
<p>On the third day she was so hungry that she could scarcely see out
of her eyes. Roaming about, the hawk suddenly lighted upon the nest of
the crow. Seeing the little, miserable, ugly things in the nest, the
hawk at first would not touch them, although she never dreamt that
these ugly things were the children of the crow, so much praised by her
for their beauty, and thought they must belong to some hideous bird.
But what is one to do when one is hungry? One eats what one gets and
not finding anything better, she sat down and gobbled them up one by
one, and then flew away.</p>
<p>Not long after the hawk had left, the crow came in, feeling sure
this time to find her little ones unhurt; but how great was her dismay
when she found the nest empty! First she thought the little birds had
tried their wings and were flying about in the neighbourhood, and she
went in search of them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>Not finding them, she began to be
a little more anxious, and hunting a little more closely, found on the
ground near some rushes some tufts of feathers with little bones and
blood. She knew at once that the hawk had again been there, feeding on
her children.</p>
<p>Full of wrath and fury, she went to find the hawk. Meeting her, she
said, &ldquo;A nice sister and godmother you are! After you had
promised most faithfully not to touch my children, no sooner had I
turned my back on them, than you come again and eat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand what you are saying,&rdquo; replied the
hawk. &ldquo;It is your own fault. You told me your children were the
most beautiful in the world, and those which I have eaten were monsters
of hideousness. If I had not felt the pinch of hunger so strong, I
would not have touched them, not for anything, such ugly things they
were! They nearly made me sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day on, the hawk, if it gets near the crows, attacks them.

<p class="first">It is said that the crow bathes its young in some
waters between frontiers. This water becomes poisonous, and is used by
witches for philtres and spells. If a man wants to obtain the water, he
must go to nine witches, who assemble on a Tuesday at midnight at the
fountain. Each one brings a stolen pot, or, in preference, the skull of
a dog. In each they take three drops of that water, and they say their
spell over it, waving over it a tuft of hair from a mad wolf. This
incantation they must repeat for nine weeks on each Tuesday at
midnight, and with the water thus obtained they make their
philtres.</p>
<p>The croaking of the crow is considered as evil an omen as that of
the raven. A very peculiar custom prevails among the people, who, when
the children lose their teeth, take them and throw them if possible on
the roofs of the houses and say: &ldquo;Here, crow, I give you a tooth

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Heron and the
digging of Wells.</span></p>
<p>When God had created the world, there were no springs or wells. The
only water from which to satisfy the thirst of all the creatures was
rain-water. After a time the rain was not enough to satisfy them all;
the grass and trees were fading and withering, burnt up by the fiery
heat of the sun, and the animals were perishing from thirst.</p>
<p>So God called all the birds together, and told them that they should
dig holes in the earth with their claws and beaks, in order that the
water from underneath should come up and water the earth and slake the
thirst of all the creatures. At the bidding of God all the birds came
together and started working with their beaks and claws. They all
worked together. The hawk worked side by side with the young chickens,
and the owl with the doves. Such a thing never happened before or
since.</p>
<p>The heron alone flew about as if it did not affect her. She was
quite indifferent to see how hard the other birds worked. She cared not
for the sweat which stood out like beads, and ran down the neck of the
lark as it went scratching away at the earth with legs as thin as two
straws, nor did she care for the titmouse which hacked away at the foot
of a hillock. And God asked her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou not do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I soil my feet with mud,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;when the rain-waters are not yet dried up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because thou hast not hearkened to my command, thou
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>shalt slake thy thirst only from the rain, and
then only by the water running down thy wings.&rdquo; From that time
onwards one hears the heron crying in time of drought. She prays to God
to send some rain to moisten her dry mouth. <span class=

<p>The same story is told of the kite in the following version:</p>
<p>When God made the world, he called all the birds together to help
him to dig wells for the water and beds for the rivers. All the birds
came except the kite, which, looking at its claws, said, &ldquo;See how
beautiful and dainty they are! I am not going to soil them with the mud
of the rivers and wells.&rdquo; Then all the other birds cursed her,
that she might never be able to drink water out of wells and rivers,
and should slake her thirst only with the dew and rain from heaven, nor
should she be able to drink by lifting her beak and catching the
falling rain, but she would only be able to drink the rain-water which
was running down her wings. Therefore, in time of drought, the kite
flies high up to God and prays for rain and dew, for if she drinks of
the water of rivers and wells she dies.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A remarkable parallel to this story has been given by Grimm in his
<i lang="de">D. Mythologie</i>, 4th ed. p. 561; and for a Russian
parallel, <i>v.</i> Ralston, <i>Russian Folk Tales</i>, p. 331.</p>
<p>An oriental version substitutes the raven for the kite as the bird
whose piteous cries bring about the breaking of the drought. It is said
that when Adam beheld his dead son Abel, he did not know what to do,
for he was the first man to die. A raven dug a hole and put into it his
companion who had died.</p>
<p>Adam saw this and followed his example. God therefore granted to the
raven that henceforth when there would be drought in the world, his cry
would bring about the breaking up of the drought and a downpour of rain

<p>When the world was made, there were no roads and no pathways. It was
very difficult to get about from one place to another.</p>
<p>Seeing this, God ordered all the animals to come and work together
and straighten out paths and make roads. All the animals came and
worked as they were commanded. Only the mole stayed away, so God asked
him why he had not come, when all the others had?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want any roads and ways, for they are of no use to
me,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I burrow under the earth and there I
spend my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall it always be henceforth,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;and
thou shalt not be able to make thy little hills on roads or highways,
and it shall not be a sin to kill thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it has remained to this day. No mole-hill has ever been seen

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Tortoise, St. Peter
and God.</span></p>
<p>When God and St. Peter were walking on the earth, one day they made
a very long journey, and grew very hungry. Coming to a little hut, they
found the woman in, and they asked her for something to eat.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have very little flour in the
house, but I am going to bake two loaves, and when you come back in
half an hour they will be ready and you will be welcome to one.&rdquo;
Taking the flour, she kneaded it in the trough and made two loaves, one
for herself and one for the travellers. Meanwhile they went to church,
but they said before going that they would come back at the end of the
service.</p>
<p>The woman covered over the dough, and to her great astonishment,
when she lifted the cover, the dough of the loaf for the strangers had
risen much higher than the other. Then she put both loaves in the oven.
How great was her surprise, on taking out the loaves from the oven,
when she found that the one for the travellers had been baked nicely
and was a very big loaf, whilst the one for herself was half burned and
almost shrivelled to a pancake. When she saw the miracle her greed
overtook her, and she forgot the promise which she had made to the
travellers. She said to herself: &ldquo;Why should I give my best bread
to strangers whom I do not know? Let them go elsewhere to richer people
than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she took the pasteboard and put it on the floor, and crouching on
it, covered herself over with the trough. She told her little girl to
stand in front of the door, and if two old people should come and ask
for her she was to say that her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>mother had gone away and that
she did not know where she was. The travellers then, of course, would
not come in, and she would be able to enjoy the loaf.</p>
<p>After a while God and St. Peter came back from church, and asked the
little girl where her mother was, to which the child replied as she had
been told. God said, &ldquo;Where she is there shall she remain&rdquo;;
and went away. The child came in and tried to lift the trough off the
back of her mother, who <span class="corr" id="xd21e5053" title=
"Source: way">was</span> lying hidden underneath, but try as hard as
she could the trough would not come off. It had grown on to the back of
her mother, and the pasteboard had grown underneath on to her. The
woman was only able to put out her little head with the glistening,
greedy eyes, and her tiny little hands and feet, and the handle of the
pasteboard had turned into a waggling tail.</p>
<p>And that is how the tortoise was made, when the old woman became the
tortoise always carrying the trough and the pasteboard with her.

<p>One day a spider, meeting the Holy Mother, challenged her as to
which of the two could spin the finer thread. The Holy Mother accepted
the challenge, and started to spin a very fine thread indeed. But,
however fine her thread was, the yarn spun by the spider was much
finer, and then, to add to the discomfiture of the Holy Mother, the
spider let himself down on one of its threads and remained dangling,
and, turning to the Holy Mother, he said to her: &ldquo;Can you do
anything like it?&rdquo; And the Holy Mother replied, &ldquo;No&rdquo;;
and being angry she cursed the spider, and said, &ldquo;Thy web shall
be of no use to anyone, and because of thy spite, whoever kills thee
shall be forgiven three of his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>We meet the spider again in controversy with the Holy Mother on a
more dramatic occasion.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>She was searching for her son, and going to St. John, she asked him
what had happened to him, as she had not seen him for some time.
&ldquo;The cruel people have taken him and are torturing him.&rdquo;
Going on her way she met the carpenters, who said to her that instead
of making a light cross they had made a heavy cross. She cursed them,
saying, &ldquo;May you work all the year and see no profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she met the smiths, who, instead of making short nails, had
made long nails, and she cursed them likewise. She came to the gate of
the palace of Pilate, and on her touching the gate, it opened, and
going in, she saw all that happened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>On her way, weeping
and crying, she met a flight of swallows, who asked her why she was
crying and weeping, and she replied, &ldquo;My only son has been taken
away from me.&rdquo; And they replied, &ldquo;Do not weep and do not
cry, for three days hence thou shalt see him alive, thou and thy
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Holy Mother blessed them, that they should always be welcome
in the house of the people, that they should nest on the roofs, and
that no one should disturb them, and that whosoever should kill a
swallow should be guilty of three sins.</p>
<p>Going further, she met the spider, and the spider asked her why she
was weeping and crying, and she replied, &ldquo;My only son has been
taken away.&rdquo; And the spider replied, &ldquo;You may cry till the
day of doom; what is gone is gone, and can never come back
again.&rdquo; Next to the spider was standing the mouse, and the mouse
chimed in: so the Holy Mother cursed him and went on her way, but
finding that her way led her nowhere, she came back the same road.</p>
<p>When she had gone, the mouse said to the spider: &ldquo;The Holy
Mother has not blessed us, so I think you had better make a rope and
stretch it from tree to tree, and I will dig a pit underneath, and when
she comes back we will hang her by the rope and throw her into the
pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Holy Mother knew what they were plotting, and when she came
back, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou ugly and spiteful spider, worms shall settle on thee,
and by thy own rope shalt thou hang. All the days of thy life an
unclean animal shalt thou be. And thou, O mouse, who hast plotted
against me, thy habitation shall be henceforth in the pits and hollows
of the earth, and thou shalt be an unclean beast. Whatever thou
touchest shall be defiled, and whoever kills thee or the spider shall
be forgiven three sins.&rdquo; And so it has remained to this very day,
the spider hanging on its own rope, and the mouse lying hidden under
the earth, and both are killed by men and beasts.</p>

went all the creatures wept with her, and the flowers in the grass of
the field bent low in sign of mourning. A flight of swallows met her in
the beautiful meadow, and seeing her crying, comforted her, and said:
&ldquo;Do not weep, for thy son will come to life again three days
hence, and will show himself to thee and to the Apostles.&rdquo; Then
the Lady Mary became more comforted, and said to the swallows<a id=

shall be the cleanest birds on the face of the earth, and the house at
which you build your nests will be a happy one, and whoever destroys
your nest shall be cursed.&rdquo; The Lady Mary went on her way, and
passing on her way she met a spider weaving his web, and a mouse
burrowing in the ground. When they saw her weeping they mocked at her,
and said: &ldquo;In vain dost thou weep and cry. Know that thy son is
dead; he will never come to life again, although thou mayest believe

way she returned the same way as she had gone. The spider and the
mouse, seeing that she had not blessed them, took counsel together to
hang her on a rope and to kill her the next time they met her again.
And the mouse said to the spider: &ldquo;Now thou weave a rope and get
it ready, and upon that rope <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=

our eyes on her.&rdquo; A short time afterwards the Lady Mary returned,
and came back to the same spot. Meanwhile the spider had woven a strong
rope, and had tied one end to a branch of the tree, and the mouse had
digged a deep pit under that tree. But the Lady knew what they had
intended, and she said: &ldquo;Thou, O spider, hast woven a rope for
hanging me, thou shalt always dangle on a rope. Thou shalt be unclean
and full of vermin, and whoever catches thee shall kill thee. And thou,
O mouse, thou shalt be so dirty from this day onwards, that wherever
thou diest that place shall become unclean, and whoever sees thee shall
kill thee, and whoever will kill a mouse or a spider God shall forgive

ITS BREAST?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of Lady Mary and the Wicked
Stepmother.</span></p>
<p>In Oriental folk-lore the swallow seems to be considered everywhere
as a sacred bird, of which many legends are related. We hear, that when
the Temple was burning in Jerusalem the swallows were the birds which
brought water in their beaks with which to quench the flame, whilst the
spider brought fiery coal to fan the flame. Hence he who kills a
swallow commits seven sins, whilst he who kills a spider is forgiven
seven sins. In the Appendix, No. III., a peculiar legend is also told
of the spider, the gnat and the swallow. As for the origin of the
swallow, which would account for the forked tail and for the colour of
the feathers, the Rumanians have the following tale.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is a story of a mother-in-law, who, like all mothers-in-law,
treated her daughter-in-law in a most cruel manner. Whatever the young
woman did was not right. Her mother-in-law persecuted her from morning
till evening, and gave her neither peace nor rest. One day, seeing that
she could not get rid of her by any other means, she killed her, and
cut her up in pieces. Her son, who had been away, came in just in time
to see the foul deed which his mother had done. Enraged, he made a pile
of wood, and dragging his mother on to it, he lit the wood, so as to
burn his mother on the fire. For reasons which we do not know, St. Mary
came down from heaven and pulled the old woman away from the fire after
her. Her clothes had already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>began to burn. She got hold of
her, changed her into a swallow, and pulled her through the chimney. As
soon as she saw herself saved, the wicked woman wanted to fly away. But
St. Mary said: &ldquo;Stop, and do not fly away. Do not imagine that
because I have saved you from being burned on the fire, I will let you
go away like that: you just wait, for I must put a sign on you, that
everybody may know what a good mother-in-law you have been, and that
you have killed your daughter-in-law.&rdquo; And as she said these
words, she caused her tail to become like a pair of scissors, or rather
like two sharp knives joined in one point, like the knives with which
she had cut up her daughter-in-law. But this was not the only sign. For
when St. Mary pulled her through the chimney, a lot of soot fell on
her, and wherever it fell it made the feathers black, and so they have
remained to this very day. The red spot on the breast of the swallow is
the red blood of her daughter-in-law, and the white spots are the
remnants of the shirt which remained unburned when all the other
clothes had caught fire, but it has not kept white either, for it was
just a little singed.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There are besides these a number of tales about the swallow. They
are told in Nos. 86, 87. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Tortoise and Lady
Mary.</span></p>
<p>The blessed Mary, great and glorious as she is&mdash;she must not
take it amiss&mdash;was one day too lazy to go out on behalf of her son
to distribute his gifts among the children of the village. So when she
left the house with the loaves of bread, some cake, and other gifts
which she was to distribute, under her arm, she met the tortoise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the one. &ldquo;Welcome,
daughter,&rdquo; said the other. St. Mary said, &ldquo;Prithee, auntie,
just give this bread as alms for souls to the boys of the
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not much, my daughter, I will willingly do it,&rdquo;
and taking the bread under her arms, there she went crawling along
until she came to the boys.</p>
<p>The tortoise had scarcely left her, when St. Mary bethought herself
that it might have been better if she herself had given the alms away,
and not sent them through a stranger. So without more ado she followed
the way the tortoise had gone, and came to the school.</p>
<p>What did she see there? Auntie tortoise performed her deed as she
had promised, and going from boy to boy gave everyone a bit. But when
at last she came to the youngest, who was her own child, she took out
the cake and gave it to him. &ldquo;I should like to know,&rdquo; said
St. Mary, &ldquo;how it happened that the last piece to be given away
was a cake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, daughter, or rather mother, I had kept the cake for the
most beautiful child, and I could not find anyone more beautiful than
mine.&rdquo; St. Mary, who had heard many things, when she heard this,
could not help laughing aloud. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>When she stopped laughing she was rather sorry, for why should she
have laughed so loud? She said, &ldquo;Verily, there is nothing more
beautiful in the eyes of a mother than her own child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her beautiful face grew sad, and in order that her laughter should
not bewitch the little tortoise&mdash;as if struck by the evil eye for
being praised as beautiful&mdash;she spat out upon the ground, and out
of the spittle there grew the silkworm. St. Mary blessed it and said,
&ldquo;Thou shalt live upon green leaves, and thou shalt draw out fine
silk threads&rdquo; (like the thread of the spittle). It is therefore
forbidden to say anything evil of the silkworm, or to touch it whilst
it is spinning the cocoon, for no sooner is an evil word spoken or the
worm touched, than it stops drawing the silk.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The variant from the Balkans is as follows:</p>
<p>When Jesus went up to Golgotha, the Virgin Mother followed, crying.
There she saw in the procession also a tortoise, and she could not help
laughing. She then reproached herself, and said, &ldquo;O evil mouth,
thou art only good for worms.&rdquo; There and then she spat on the
ground in disgust, and worms came out of the spittle. But having come
from a holy mouth the worms which grew out of the spittle became the
silkworms, which have remained so to this very day.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A peculiar variant in which, however, the second part&mdash;the
origin of the silkworm&mdash;is omitted, is found among the Kutzovlachs
of Macedonia as &ldquo;The Story of St. Mary and the
Tortoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once upon a time the Virgin Mary sat sadly at the door of the
school, waiting for her son, who was learning within, to come out so
that she might give him a piece of cake which she had brought with her.
Whilst she was sitting there she said to herself, &ldquo;I will wait
and see whether all the creatures recognise my son to be the most
beautiful child in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tortoise just then came along. In order to put her to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>test, St. Mary said to her, &ldquo;Would you
like to give this cake to the most beautiful child here in this
school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied the tortoise, and taking the cake
she went into the school room. It so happened then that her own child
was also among the pupils. She went straight up to it, and without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation gave it the cake destined for the most
beautiful child in the school. When St. Mary saw what the tortoise had
done, instead of being angry she laughed heartily, and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast acted as every mother would act, for to a mother no
one could be more beautiful than her own child. And because thou hast
driven away my sadness, the finest and softest grass shall henceforth
be thy food, and when thou diest thy bones shall not rot
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it has remained to this very day, and the shell of the
tortoise remains sound. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Sparrow and the
Crucifixion.</span></p>
<p>Another legend brings us again to the same events. This time it is
in connection with the sparrow. It is said that the sparrows were
originally much bigger birds than they are now, but at the time of the
crucifixion they flew round the cross and cried half mockingly,
&ldquo;Jiviu Jiviu,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Live, live.&rdquo;
Christ, who was in pain, and annoyed at their behaviour, cursed them
and said, &ldquo;May you live only on the crumbs which you will pick up
on the roadside, and henceforth, becoming smaller, you will be snared
by little boys and tormented by them, and the passers-by shall hit at
you with whips, and kill you.&rdquo; And so it has remained to this
very day.</p>
<p>They live on crumbs wherever they can pick them up. They have become
very small birds. They are snared by children, who often play with them
cruelly, and the passers-by strike at them with a whip, and kill
them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A Russian Legend, Afanasief, p. 13, is a close parallel to this

<h2 class="main">WHY SHOULD THE OAK TREE NOT BOAST?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Sparrow and the Oak
Tree.</span></p>
<p>The people regard the sparrow as one of the greatest pests, for he
eats up the seeds and the crops. The people believe that the sparrows
reach an age of over nine hundred years, and they tell the following
tale about it:</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In a clearing of a huge oak forest, there grew up a tiny little
tree. All the other trees looked upon it with pleasure, it was so green
and so tender. Suddenly a sparrow flying over the trees came down and
settled on that little sapling, which bent under the weight of the
bird. Angrily, the little tree said to the sparrow, &ldquo;It is a
great shame that thou shouldst have come and settled on me, I who am so
weak and tender and scarcely able to stand up, why didst thou not go
and settle on one of those huge trees of which the forest is
full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sparrow, feeling ashamed and angered at the words of the little
sapling, replied: &ldquo;Very well, I am going, but when thou shalt be
on thy death-bed I will come back, and thou wilt have to render me
account for these offensive words which thou hast spoken to me.&rdquo;
And the sparrow went away.</p>
<p>Now it is known that an oak lives for nine hundred years: for three
hundred years it grows in strength and might, the next three hundred it
rests quiet, and during the last three hundred it slowly decays and
dies. First the heart, that is, the core, dies, then the wood is slowly
eaten away, the branches fall off, and at the end of nine hundred years
the tree is changed into dust. And so it happened with that little
sapling. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>grew for three hundred years, it stopped still
for the next three hundred years, and finally it decayed and died at
the end of the last three hundred years. When the last day of the nine
hundred years had come, and scarcely anything was left of the tree but
dust, the sparrow came back, and rolling about in the dust it said:
&ldquo;Dost thou remember when thou wast a mere sapling, how thou didst
insult me, thou didst believe thou wouldst grow on and live for ever?
Dost thou see that my word has come true, thou proud tree of the
forest, now thy head is lying low and thou hast been changed into dust,
thou hast been humbled, whilst I am still living on in strength, and I
am now as I have then been.&rdquo; This longevity of the sparrow makes
him the dread of the peasants and farmers, and among the means taken to
save the crops from the inroads of this pest are magical practices and
charms.</p>
<p>I will only quote one or two.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p><span class="sc">Charms against the Sparrow.</span></p>
<p>On the first day of Lent the man must collect all the crumbs and
bones from his table after he has finished his meal, and, taking them
out in the table-cover, he must strew them upon the field, and say,
&ldquo;O ye birds of heaven, here I have brought you of the food from
my table, eat this, and do not touch the food from off the
field.&rdquo; Or, taking a handful of corn and standing with one foot
on his field and with the other on the roadside, he must throw the corn
on the road outside the field and to say, &ldquo;O St. Mary, here I
have brought food for the birds of heaven. Let them feed on this seed
and not on the seed which I sow in my field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is still another charm.</p>
<p>At the time when the sparrows begin to pick at the corn the youngest
of the household must go to the field. He must take off all his
garments, then, tying a kerchief over his eyes, he must hold in his
hand a candle, which has been burning at the head of a corpse, and
carrying also a tuft of hair cut off from the head of the dead, he is
to walk with the lighted candle in his hand over the four sides of the
field and say, &ldquo;As I do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>see now, and as the dead man
does not see, so shall the birds not see this field with the corn
growing in it. And the mind of the birds should be taken off from this
field, as the mind of the dead is off it.&rdquo; When he comes to the
fourth corner of the field he must tie the hair of the dead round some
of the ears of corn and say, &ldquo;I do not tie up this crop, but I
tie the mouth of the birds, that they may not be able to eat it, as the
dead man is unable to eat it. And they shall not be able to see the
corn, as the dead man does not see the world.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of King Pic, Lady Mary and
the Sun.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time St. Mary talked with the sun about the sins of this
world. They also talked about the wicked deeds of the Emperor Pic among
others, of whom an evil report had spread on account of his cruelty.
The sun talked to her about all that he had seen, and St. Mary,
weighing up all his sins, came to the decision that he should be thrown
into the depths of the sea, so that even his memory should be lost to
the end of days.</p>
<p>But before she had time to pronounce her judgment, up came the
Emperor Pic himself in mighty wrath. He caught hold of St. Mary by the
hair of her head, for was he not the emperor, and was there anyone of
whom he should stand in awe? He feared no one, and cursing as fast as
he could fill his mouth with blasphemous words, he started fighting the
sun. When St. Mary wanted to remonstrate with him he gave her a blow on
her mouth, so as to stop her from speaking. The sun, seeing this
infamous conduct, got angry, and catching him by the throat, hurled the
Emperor Pic into a well with the intention of drowning him before he
could utter a single word. The only sound which he made before sinking
was Zi Zi Zi. St. Mary, having pity upon him, wanted to save him from
drowning, and tried to draw him out of the water. But she looked in
vain for him. Instead of finding Pic in the well, she only found a
little insect that was shivering with cold and was hiding under one of
the beams of the well. God had no doubt punished Pic for his impudence.
The mosquito (<i lang="la">Culex pipiens</i>) does not leave his hiding
place until the sun disappears, for he is frightened of him, and this
fear has remained with him. For this reason no mosquito will come out
during the daytime: he will wait until it gets dark, then he will come
out and, sitting on the edge of the well, sings Zi, Zi, Zi.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the Food of the
Mosquito.</span></p>
<p>After God had made all the creatures, he called them together, to
tell them what they would have to do so that they might live. They all
came, and God gave every one its gift and the manner of its food. All
had come and gone, but the mosquito did not come until very late. When
asked why he had done so, he started telling tales, until God got angry
and, turning to him, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no time to waste with thee, hurry up and tell me
quickly, what kind of food dost thou wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mosquito replied, &ldquo;I wish to live by sucking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it shall be,&rdquo; replied God, &ldquo;now go and suck
the juice of trees and plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was he to do? He went and sucked the trees and plants. After a
fortnight had passed he got weak and shrivelled from this kind of food.
His wife, seeing the state into which he had fallen by his foolish
demand, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what has become of you! You are shrivelled up and weak, a
few days more and you are sure to die. You had better go to God and beg
him to give you another food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said, &ldquo;I cannot go; if you have the impudence you had
better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I will go,&rdquo; replied the female
mosquito, and up she went to God.</p>
<p>When he saw her he asked her, &ldquo;What has brought you to
me?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The miserable food which my husband has got is killing us. We
cannot live by it. We are getting shrivelled up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;I will give you the right to
suck also blood from man and beast, but as soon as you cannot get blood
you must die. Your husband, however, he may live on the blood and juice
of plants alike.&rdquo; And so it has remained, the female dies when
she cannot find blood to suck.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>According to some local tradition, the mosquito has been made out of
the smoke of the devil&rsquo;s pipe, and for that reason he hates the
smoke. According to another they are also the servants of the devil and
the enemies of the angels, who cannot come into a room where there are

Magician.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time the rumour spread through Palestine that there was
a man who could perform greater miracles than God. St. Anne, hearing of
it, determined to go and see him, and so she did.</p>
<p>When she approached the house where he lived, she washed her feet,
as it is customary in those parts of the world, and with meekness and
devotion she went in and asked the man to change a withered trunk into
a green tree. The man got very angry, and said he did not perform
miracles, and after insulting her before the assembled multitudes,
seized her hands and thrust her out of his house.</p>
<p>When St. Anne saw what he had done she fell upon her knees and
prayed to God to punish him. As she was lifting up her hands in prayer
she suddenly noticed that the ring which she had from her dear mother
had gone. She remembered that the man had got hold of her by the hand,
and she understood that he then must have slipped the ring off her
finger. So she prayed that God would punish this impostor, thief, and
robber.</p>
<p>And God heard her prayer. Of a sudden the man disappeared from
amongst the people, and a small ring appeared round one of the boughs
of the tree outside the house. Whilst the people were gazing upon this
ring into which the thief had been changed, it opened, and out of it
came a hundred of small butterflies with the mark of the ring on their
wings. This was the sign of the ring, which had been stolen from St.
Anne. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=

<p>The miracle which St. Anne asks the man to perform, namely, to
change a withered trunk into a green tree, belongs to the large cycle
of similar miracles starting from the rod of Aaron, the story of Lot
and Abraham, the Tannh&auml;user legend, etc. (<i>v.</i> Gaster,

<p>This ring of small insect eggs round the twigs of trees is also
known as the cuckoo&rsquo;s ring, and taken off from the tree is used
for charms by girls, who say &ldquo;as men are pleased to hear
me.&rdquo; This ring is also called &ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; and it is
therefore often put into the cradle of restless children in order to
cause them to sleep. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"

<p>It is said that at the time of the birth of Christ, there was a
beautiful little bird with feathers, yellow as gold and with a beak
shining like silver, and a thin, fine little body. Just as the bird was
beautiful, so she was insolent and disobedient. She was a friend of St.
Mary, who liked her singing. When she was sad, the bird would come and
comfort her with her sweet songs. And the Holy Mother also helped the
little bird when she was in trouble, and when the nest was broken, she
helped to mend it.</p>
<p>But when the Holy Mother got Jesus, her friendship with the bird
came to an end. For the bird did not like children. It could not stand
their crying. The bird believed that the crying child mocked at her
singing, and therefore, whenever she saw Christ, she made faces at him
and mockingly chirped, Gri Gri Gri. Christ, hearing it, got frightened
and cried bitterly. When St. Mary saw the insolence of the bird, she
drove her away from the house, and, cursing her, said: &ldquo;From the
beautiful bird which thou art, thou shalt become one of the most
hideous insects, and, living only in clefts and holes, thou shalt sing
only Gri Gri Gri, as a punishment for having mocked at God&rsquo;s
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since then, that bird has entirely disappeared, and all of her kind
which were living at that time were turned into crickets chirping in
the hearths and mocking at the children of men, Gri Gri Gri.

Knight.</span></p>
<p>There is another legend of the origin of the cricket which leads us
to the cycle of the Alexander legends.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is told that in the time of Alexander there lived a young man
who, when he was sixteen years old, was more beautiful than any one had
been before him, or after him. The princesses were fighting for him,
calling one another as many names as the moon and stars, and each one
vowing that hers only he was to be, none other was worthy of him. Still
more beautiful was his singing, for when you heard him your mind
stopped still, so sweet was his voice. Even the mothers of the maidens
fell in love with him. And grey-haired old kings with long, white
beards and bushy eyebrows, would lift their brows to see him, who was
as beautiful as a wonder and dear as a ball of gold. But whilst
everyone liked him, Alexander could not suffer him. He must hate him,
for though Alexander was the mightiest emperor of the world, yet none
could please him, no not one even of those princesses. For this reason
there grew up an enmity between them, which became so strong that even
the sun, which used at that time to walk about on the earth, could not
make peace between them. Alexander might perhaps have made peace, but
he would do so only on the condition that the other would not make love
to his own favourite.</p>
<p>But the young knight would not hear of any conditions, and in order
to spite him still more, he went more often than before to
Alexander&rsquo;s favourite wife, and sang to her as much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>as
he could. When the sun told how insolent he was, Alexander turned on
him and drove him out of the house. The sun chased him and burned him,
so that from the white that he was he turned as black as a coal, and
from the big and tall man that he was he shrivelled up and became as
small as a hazelnut, and hid himself away under the hearth of a poor
woman&rsquo;s house, from which he squeaked &ldquo;Griji, Griji ( =
take care) that the sun does not catch me.&rdquo; When the sun heard
it, he said, &ldquo;Now thou shalt always live here where thou art, and
hungry and thirsty shalt thou cry Griji, Griji without stopping.&rdquo;
When the beautiful maidens heard what had happened, they became very
angry, and then, turning into ants, they brought food to the poor
cricket. To this very day they bring him food, so that he may not die
of hunger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=

<p>In the beginning there was no enmity between the cat and dog, and
they lived on friendly terms together and served their master (Adam)
faithfully, each one doing its own work. But as you know, it is very
much better to have a written agreement at the beginning than to have a
row afterwards, so they decided to draw up an agreement defining the
work which each had to do, and decided that the dog was to do the work
outside the house, and the cat the work inside. For greater safety the
dog agreed that the cat should take care of the agreement, and the cat
put it in the loft.</p>
<p>After a time, the devil, who could not allow peace to last for a

dog remarked to the cat that he was not fairly treated, he did not see
why he should have all the trouble outside the house, to watch for
thieves and protect the house and suffer from cold and rain, and only
have scraps and bones for food, and sometimes nothing at all, whilst
the cat had all the comfort, purring and enjoying herself, and living
near the hearth in warmth and safety. The cat said, &ldquo;An agreement
is an agreement.&rdquo; The dog replied, &ldquo;Let me see that
agreement.&rdquo; The cat went quickly up the loft to fetch the
agreement, but the agreement, which had been a little greasy, had been
nibbled by the mice who were living in the loft, and they went on
nibbling away until nothing was left of it but a heap of paper fluff,
and as it was as soft as down the mice made their home of it. When the
cat came up and saw what the mice had done, her fury knew no bounds,
she pursued them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>madly, killing as many as she could seize,
and running after the others with the intent of catching them.</p>
<p>When she came down the dog asked her for the agreement, and as the
cat had not brought it, the dog, taking hold of her, shook her until he
got tired of shaking her.</p>
<p>Since that time, whenever a dog meets a cat he asks her for the
agreement, and as she cannot show it to him he goes for her, and the
cat, knowing what the mice had done to her, runs after them when she
sees them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the South Slavonic folk-lore (Krauss, No. 18) there is a parallel
to this story, but greatly changed from the original form. It is no
longer a &ldquo;creation&rdquo; legend. It runs as follows:</p>
<p>The dogs used to receive all the meat that fell off the table. This
became a habit, and so he and the cat drew up a statement to that
effect, and made it a permanent rule. They wrote it on the hide of an
ass, and the king of the dogs gave it to the cat&mdash;the first
chancellor&mdash;to take care of it. The cat hid it away in the rafters
of the house. There the skin was found by the mice, who nibbled it
until there was scarcely anything left. One day a dog got badly beaten
because he picked up some meat that had fallen from the table. He went
and complained to the king, who sent the cat to find the document. The
cat could not find it, and saw that the mice had eaten it. Since then
there is a continual feud between the cat, the mice and the dog.</p>
<p>In this version, the entire origin of the tale has been lost. It is
no longer referred to Adam, nor is there any question of a compact
between a cat and dog which was broken by the latter. In the Slavonic
tale there is no authority for this arrangement.</p>
<p>The Rumanian version approximates much more closely to the Oriental,
and seems to have preserved much more faithfully the ancient form. The
oldest which can thus far be traced is that in the &ldquo;Alphabet of
Pseudo Sirach,&rdquo; printed here in the Appendix (No. III.).

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of Adam and Eve and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>When Adam and Eve had lived for some time together, Adam suddenly
noticed a change in his wife&rsquo;s demeanour. Watching her narrowly,
he found that she had fallen in love with the devil. She had introduced
him into the house, which she had built close to the seashore. Adam, as
a wise man, kept his peace, but he thought day and night what was he to
do to get rid of the devil and to save his wife? At last he thought
that the only way would be to take his wife away into some distant land
across the sea, where the devil could not follow him. But how were they
to cross that sea? At last he discovered that the best way to cross the
sea would be to make a boat, and then, when it was ready, he would take
his wife quietly and they would both sail away. But the devil has
nothing to do but to watch other people&rsquo;s doings, and to put a
spoke into the wheel wherever he can. He was therefore not to be
outdone in as simple a manner as Adam thought. He saw that Adam was
cutting wood, and making timber and laths, and joining them together,
but whenever he asked Adam what he was doing he would not answer
him.</p>
<p>So at last he came to Eve and told her: &ldquo;Look here, that
husband of yours is preparing some trick, and it is meant against you
and me. You better find out what is in Adam&rsquo;s mind. What is he
doing, and what is the meaning of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve, in order to please the devil, asked Adam what he was doing, but
he knew it was no good giving a secret into the keeping of a woman. So
he kept his counsel to himself. At last, when the devil saw the boat,
he told Eve: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what Adam means, he wants to take you away and leave
me here alone. That you must not allow, but when everything is ready
and he is coming to fetch you, you ask him to allow you to bring the
house-snake with you. He will not refuse you, and I will take the form
of the snake, and so you will carry me with you into the boat. Then we
shall see who will be the cleverer, Adam or I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when Adam came to fetch Eve, she asked him to be allowed to bring
also the house-snake with her. Adam, good-hearted fellow as he was, did
not refuse her. What did the devil do? He took the form of the snake,
and to make sure of being carried into the boat, he coiled himself
round Eve&rsquo;s bosom, and so was carried by her into the boat,
chuckling all the while at the stupidity of Adam. Adam had no suspicion
who the passenger was, he had brought with him.</p>
<p>One day, after he had sailed a long time, Adam, tired from his work,
laid himself down to rest, when he suddenly felt that the boat was
sinking. Up he jumped, trimmed the sail, and looked round to see
whether the boat had sprung a leak and was making water, for he could
not understand why the boat should suddenly sink and let the water in.
The devil, thinking that Adam was asleep and not able to watch his
tricks, had made himself heavy like lead in the hope of sinking the
ship and drowning Adam. But he had reckoned without his host, for Adam
woke up in the nick of time and caught the Wicked One at his evil
deeds. When the devil saw that Adam was awake, he changed himself
quickly into a mouse. Adam did not trouble, but thought his time would
come. The devil, who cannot keep quiet but must do mischief whenever he
can, was not content to be left in peace, and be carried across the
water, but he must needs start gnawing away at one of the planks of the
ship, and so make a hole and drown Adam. His misfortune was that, just
when the plank at which he was gnawing had got as thin as a sheet of
paper, Adam surprised the Black One at his work. What did he do? He
took off his fur glove and threw it at the mouse. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fur glove changed into a cat which, seizing the mouse, killed it
and ate it up. And thus the cat got the devil into it. And that is why
the cat&rsquo;s hair bristles and makes sparks, and the eyes of the cat
glisten in the dark. These are sparks of the devil in the cat.

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Devil, Noah and the
Ark.</span></p>
<p>There is another version of this tale which transfers the origin of
the mouse to the ark of Noah. Noah would not allow the devil to get
into the ark which he had built. In order, therefore, to get in, the
devil transformed himself into a mouse, which, being surprised at the
same work of gnawing away the boards of the ark, was eaten up by the
cat&mdash;the fur glove which Noah threw at her.</p>
<p>A legend concerning the cat and mouse is found in the so-called
&ldquo;Alphabet of Pseudo Sirach,&rdquo; here in the Appendix, No. III.
According to a Bohemian legend, the devil created the mouse that it
might destroy &ldquo;God&rsquo;s corn,&rdquo; whereupon the Lord
created the cat. (Ralston, p. 330 note.)</p>
<p>The apocryphal interpretation of the temptation of Eve by the
serpent which has been identified with Satan is found in many ancient
biblical legends. This story of the temptation has been transformed
into a somewhat primitive love story between Eve and the
devil&mdash;her paramour&mdash;who assumes the form of the house-snake
and then wishes to drown poor unsophisticated Adam. <span class=

Noah.</span></p>
<p>When Noah had built the ark, he kept the door wide open for the
animals to enter. After they had all gone in, his own family came, and
last of all his wife.</p>
<p>Noah said to her &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; She obstinately said
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Noah again said &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; She again said
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Noah, getting angry, said &ldquo;Oh, you devil, come
in.&rdquo; That was just what the devil was waiting for. He knew that
Noah would not allow him to come in otherwise, and so he waited for an
invitation, of which he promptly availed himself. Getting into the ark
the devil changed himself into a mouse.</p>
<p>When the devil has nothing to do he weighs his tail. But here he
found plenty to do, for, he thought, now is an opportunity of putting
an end to the whole of God&rsquo;s creatures. So he started gnawing on
one of the planks, trying to make a hole in it. When Noah surprised him
at this devilish work he threw his fur glove at him. It turned into a
cat, and, in the twinkling of an eye, the mouse was in the mouth of the
cat.</p>
<p>But Noah could not allow the peace of the ark to be broken, the
animals had to live in peace with one another. So he seized the cat,
with the mouse in her mouth, and flung her out of the ark into the
water.</p>
<p>The cat swam to the ark and, getting hold of the door step, climbed
on to the sill and lay down there to bask in the sun.</p>
<p>There she remained until the water had subsided: and ever since
then, the cat likes to lie on the doorstep of the house and bask in the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of God and the Giants of
the Flood.</span></p>
<p>In olden times, huge giants existed in this world. They were so big
that they could put one leg on the top of one mountain and the other on
the next one. They reached as high as the heavens, and getting hold of
the handles of the great gate would shake it as a man shakes a kettle.
They even rebelled against God, for they knew no fear. At last, God,
realising their nature, decided to destroy them, and he sent a flood
which covered the highest mountains, so that you could not see of them
as much as the black under the nail. So all the giants died, except
one, who was the biggest of them all. He stood with one leg on the top
of one mountain, and with the other on the next mountain, and with his
hands he got hold of the handles of the gate of heaven. But God would
not tolerate a single one of these giants, for he had decided to make
men, very similar creatures to giants but smaller and more obedient. So
he sent a fly to pick at his eyes, and worms to gnaw at the soles of
his feet. Feeling the pain in his eyes, the giant let the gate of
heaven go and wiped his eyes, with his hand, but he could not stand the
gnawing of his feet, and he, falling down into the water, was drowned.
From the gnawing of the soles the instep in man&rsquo;s foot has come,
and these flies (<i lang="la">Sarcophaga carnaria</i>) and worms still
eat up the human bodies and all the carcases.</p>
<p>It is therefore a bad sign if such a fly settles on a sick man; a
sure sign of death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216"

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Pact between God and the
Devil.</span></p>
<p>When God created the world, I do not know how it came about and why
it was done, enough that it was done, God made a pact with the devil
which they signed and sealed, and God kept the document in which it was
stated that they had divided the world between them. It was settled
that all the dead should go to the devil and all that was living should
belong to God. After a while, the devil repented himself of this
arrangement and tried to get hold of the contract. Taking advantage of
God&rsquo;s indulgence, he stole into heaven, and, taking the document,
he made off with it. Clever though he thinks himself to be, the devil
is a fool and remains a fool. So, going down from heaven, he lost the
document, and did not even notice his loss until after he had plunged
deep down to the bottom of the sea. The document which had fallen out
of his hands was lying on the sand of the seashore.</p>
<p>When God noticed what the devil had done, he sent a frost so hard
that it split the stones and covered up all the waters with a thick
crust of ice, so that the devil could not get out. Then God sent St.
Peter to fetch the agreement where it lay. St. Peter descended and was
about to take it, when a magpie which watched his doings went to the
sea, and whack! whack! made a hole in the ice with its beak. That was
just what the devil was waiting for, and quick as lightning he came up
from the bottom of the sea. But quick as he was, St. Peter was quicker,
and picking up the pact he went up to heaven. The devil went after him,
but could not catch him up.</p>
<p>When St. Peter got near the gate of heaven, the devil, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>seeing that he had escaped him, threw his spear
after him. He missed him; but not entirely, for he hit St. Peter in the
sole of his foot. St. Peter cried out of pain. God asked him what had
happened, and he replied, &ldquo;The devil has hit me in my foot with
his venomous spear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that bit out and throw it away,&rdquo; said God.</p>
<p>St. Peter did as he was told, and, cutting out the wounded part from
the sole of his foot, threw it at the devil. Since then the human foot
is short of that bit which St. Peter had cut out when the devil had hit
him with his spear.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is not quite clear from the story as it stands whether the magpie
acted as a confederate of the devil, and picked a hole in the ice
deliberately so as to free him from the imprisonment, or whether the
magpie quite innocently went and helped the devil against St. Peter.
There is no sequel here to its action. It is neither punished nor
rewarded. In this respect the story is imperfect.</p>
<p>There exists another popular legend intended to explain the arch in
the sole of the human foot. According to the latter, it so happened
that the Archangel Michael was the foremost angel in the fight between
Satan and the heavenly hosts, which added to the discomfiture of Satan.
When he finally was hurled down from heaven he tried to get hold of the
archangel. But the angel was too quick for him. The devil missed him,
but not entirely, for he seized the archangel by the sole of his foot
and tore out a part of the flesh. Since then the sole of the human foot
is curved in the middle. That portion is missing, which was torn out of
the sole of the archangel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS A SNAKE NO TAIL? AND WHY DO FLEAS SUCK HUMAN
BLOOD?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Devil in
Noah&rsquo;s Ark.</span></p>
<p>When God had brought the Flood, and Noah&rsquo;s ark was floating on
the face of the waters, the wretched good-for-nothing devil wanted to
destroy Noah with all those who were with him in the ark. So he fell
a-thinking for a while, and invented an iron tool called now gimlet,
with which he could bore holes in the wall of the ark.</p>
<p>The murderous devil started on his work, and poor Noah and those
with him were in great danger of being drowned. They all worked hard to
get the water out, but who can get the better of the devil? He worked
much more quickly, and making many holes in the boards, the waters came
in fast. They all believed themselves lost. But God, who does not
desire the death of the sinner, and did not wish to see the work of his
hands destroyed, gave cunning to the snake, and it is possible that
since that day the snakes have remained wise, for does not Holy Writ
tell us to be wise as the serpent? The snake came to Noah and said,
&ldquo;What wilt thou give me if I stop up the holes which the devil is
making by which the water enters the ark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou want?&rdquo; replied Noah in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Flood thou art to give me a human being every day
to be eaten by me and my seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noah, hard pressed by the imminent danger, promised to do so. No
sooner did the devil bore a hole than the snake stopped it up with the
tip of its tail, which it cut off, leaving it in the hole, and that is
why ever since the snakes have no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>tails. When the devil saw
that his plan had failed, he ran away and left Noah&rsquo;s ark in
peace and all those who were in it. As soon as the Flood had passed
away, Noah brought a thanksgiving sacrifice to God for having been
miraculously saved. In the midst of these rejoicings the snake took
courage and came up to Noah, asking for the human being of which he had
promised to give her one every day to be eaten by her and her seed.
When Noah heard it, he got very angry, for he said to himself,
&ldquo;There are so few human beings now in the world, if I give her
one every day, the world will soon come to an end.&rdquo; So he took
hold of the beast which dared to speak to him in such a manner, and
threw it into the fire. God was greatly displeased with the evil smell
which arose from the fire in consequence, and sent a wind which
scattered the ashes all over the face of the earth. From these ashes
the fleas were born. If one considers the number of fleas that are in
the world, and the amount of human blood which they are sucking, then,
taking them all together, they eat up without doubt as much as a human
being every day. And thus the promise made by Noah is being
fulfilled.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A similar tale seems to be known among the Russians, as far as the
first part of this legend is concerned. According to Ralston,
<i>Russian Folk Tales</i>, p. 330, when the devil in the form of a
mouse gnawed a hole in the Ark, the snake stopped it up with its head.
In the Russian tale the two tales of the mouse and the snake are thus
combined.</p>
<p>An Oriental legend which seems to have retained some of the
incidents in the Rumanian legend is referred to in Hanauer, <i>Folk
Lore of the Holy Land</i>, p. 283. We are told that Iblis (the devil)
promises the serpent the sweetest food in the world, that is, human
blood, if it helps to deceive Eve. Adam protests, as no one knew yet
which is the sweetest blood. The mosquito is sent out to suck the blood
of all the animals, and find out which is the sweetest. The swallow
shadows the mosquito, and in the end plucks out its tongue so that it
shall not be able to tell. The serpent, enraged, darts after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>the swallow, but only gets hold of the middle
feathers of the swallow&rsquo;s tail, which it plucks out, hence the
forked tail of the swallow. The serpent still tries to hurt man, but
cannot do so in virtue of any claim.</p>
<p>The flea is also called the devil&rsquo;s horse, for Satan rode upon
a flea when he started on his rebellious fight with God. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the first quarter of the moon she who wishes to
make the charm must be told by a neighbour that the moon has just
risen. She then takes a glazed dish or bowl, which she has bought at
the fair of the Mummers (Mo&#351;ii) at the Eastertide, or one that has
been given to her at that time. She fills it with &ldquo;living&rdquo;
water taken from three wells in three new jugs brought by three
virgins, who must not look back from the time they have drawn it.</p>
<p>This bowl filled with water is put on the window facing the moon,
and she waits until the moon strikes the window and the bowl. When she
can see the moon well in the bowl and at the bottom of it, she begins
to charm (conjure) the fleas, etc., with three stalks taken from a new
broom, and says, &ldquo;New moon in the house, bugs, vermin, fleas, get
ye out of the house, leave this house, be scattered&mdash;let no one
meet the other before mountain meets mountain&mdash;and hill top knocks
against hill top&mdash;then and then only may they meet, and not even
then.&rdquo; She repeats the charm three times, then she pours the
water into four vessels, places them in the inner four corners of the
house, and in the morning she is sure to find some of the house vermin
in the vessels. These she must take out, and put into an empty box,
stolen from somewhere. She must wait for a car that returns home after
everything brought in it has been sold at the market, and must throw
the box into that empty car, saying: &ldquo;Yes, fleas, little
fleas&mdash;from the house have I taken you, into a stolen box have I
put you, charmed, drowned, cursed, thrown into a box, charmed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=

devil&rsquo;s own, may you become numbed and stiff&mdash;in the nine
countries&mdash;beyond the nine seas&mdash;for there they are waiting
for you&mdash;at spread tables&mdash;with torches lit up.
Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary to discuss at any length the charms against
fleas, etc., which were considered the special tools and associates of
the Evil One. The philtres in the Western countries consist mostly of
poisonous ingredients taken from toads, snakes, etc., and some of the
oldest charms are against flies, fleas, midges, etc. This is now,
perhaps, the only complete charm in which not only the formula has been
preserved, but also, what is of the highest importance, a detailed
description of the ceremonial used on that occasion.</p>
<p>Every detail of this magical operation might be made the starting
point of a separate investigation. The symbolic character of some of
them is too clear to be gainsaid. We have here the crescent of the moon
as an operative factor: the bowl and the box must be stolen, probably
to bring down a curse upon the thief and upon him who uses it. The
living water, the three maidens, the three wells, the curse of the
vermin, the empty car carrying it, as it were, away for ever, the
inducement for those fleas to remain there in the mythical nine
countries for a feast that is awaiting them. Each and all are found in
other charms, but here we have the whole operation minutely described.
It is, moreover, typical of a large class of such enchantments or
binding by charms. For our purpose it must be deemed quite sufficient.
I have only introduced it as it is one affecting the insects and
throwing light on many more charms and conjurations in which the
Rumanian literature abounds. I may on another occasion discuss the
whole range of the Rumanian charms. They cover the whole field of human
ailments and physical troubles&mdash;a wide range indeed. <span class=

<p class="first">Curiously enough, there do not seem to be any special
legends about the origin of the bugs, but there are a good many charms
which are used for getting rid of these troublesome vermin. The charms
are of a symbolical nature. A suggestive action is performed which the
conjurer believes will be followed by the conjured bugs. Thus: A woman
in a complete state of nudity takes a mealie cake into one hand, or a
crust of bread, or some other flour, and a brush used for whitewashing
in the other. She nibbles at the cake or food, and whitewashes the
wall, and while she is doing it, she says: &ldquo;As I am eating my
food and cleaning my walls so may you eat up one another and leave my
walls clean of you,&rdquo; after which the bugs will perish.</p>
<p>It is advisable to do this when the moon wanes, and the whitewashing
should start from the wall which faces the door and then go on to the
right until the door is reached again.</p>
<p>Another charm&mdash;A boy in a state of complete nudity takes bread
and salt into one hand, and in the other he holds his flute and also a
number of bugs, called the wedding party. Thus equipped, he goes into
the high road until he passes the boundary of his field. There he
starts playing the flute, and then he throws the bugs away into the
road, saying: &ldquo;Here I have brought for you bread and salt, and I
have been singing to you with my flute, now go and have a merry
wedding, and remain where you are, never returning to my home.&rdquo;
The bugs then never return.</p>
<p>Another charm, like that of the fleas, is connected with the new
moon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the new moon appears, a man, coming outside his house and
seeing it, exclaims, &ldquo;A new king in the land, a new king in the
land.&rdquo; To which one in the house standing by the window replies,
&ldquo;All the bugs must now go out of the house one by one, so that
none remain behind.&rdquo; And after repeating these words three times
he rides on a besom, poker, or the oven-peel (with which the bread is
shovelled into the stove), and running through the house he begins
sweeping the rooms, and says whilst so doing, &ldquo;Get out of the
house, ye bugs, for the new king is getting married, and he invites you
to his banquet, for he has no one to eat, to drink, or to dance there.
Get ye out and you will eat and drink and dance until you are
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words must be repeated three times, viz. at the beginnings of
three months. The bugs are then believed to leave the house in the form
of a swarm, and to go elsewhere. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Little Boy and the
Wicked Step-mother.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had a wife and two
children, a boy and a girl. He was so poor that he possessed nothing in
the world but the ashes on his hearth. His wife died, and after a time
he married another woman, who was cantankerous and bad-natured, and
from morning till evening, as long as the day lasted, she gave the poor
man no peace, but snarled and shouted at him. The woman said to him,
&ldquo;Do away with these children. You cannot even keep me, how then
can you keep all these mouths?&rdquo; for was she not a step-mother?
The poor man stood her nagging for a long time, but then, one night,
she quarrelled so much that he promised her that he would take the
children into the forest and leave them there. The two children were
sitting in the corner but held their peace and heard all that was going
on.</p>
<p>The next day, the man, taking his axe upon his shoulder, called to
the children and said to them, &ldquo;Come with me into the forest, I
am going to cut wood.&rdquo; The little children went with him, but
before they left, the little girl filled her pocket with ashes from the
hearth, and as she walked along she dropped little bits of coal the way
they went. After a time they reached a very dense part of the forest,
where they could not see their way any longer, and there the man said
to the children, &ldquo;Wait here for a while, I am only going to cut
wood yonder, when I have done I will come back and fetch you
home,&rdquo; and leaving the children there in the thicket he went
away, heavy hearted, and returned home. The children waited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>for a while, and seeing that their father did
not return, the girl knew what he had done. So they slept through the
night in the forest, and the next morning, taking her brother by the
hand, she followed the trace of the ashes which she had left on the
road, and thus came home to their own house. When the step-mother saw
them, she did not know what to do with herself, she went almost out of
her mind with fury. If she could, she would have swallowed them in a
spoonful of water, so furious was she. The husband, who was a weakling,
tried to pacify her, and to endeavour to get the children away by one
means or another, but did not succeed. When the step-mother found that
she could not do anything through her husband, she made up her mind
that she herself would get rid of them. So one morning, when her
husband had gone away, she took the little boy, and without saying
anything to anybody, she killed him and gave him to his sister to cut
him up, and prepare a meal for all of them. What was she to do? If she
was not to be killed like her brother, she had to do what her
step-mother told her.</p>
<p>And so she cut him up and cooked him ready for the meal. But she
took the heart, and hid it away in a hollow of a tree. When the
step-mother asked her where the heart was, she said that a dog had come
and taken it away. In the evening, when the husband came home, she
brought the broth with the meat for the husband to eat, and she sat
down and ate of it and so did the husband, not knowing that he was
eating the flesh of his child. The little girl refused to eat it. She
would not touch it. After they had finished, she gathered up all the
little bones and hid them in the hollow of the tree where she had put
the heart. The next morning, out of that hollow of the tree there came
a little bird with dark feathers, and sitting on the branch of a tree,
began to sing, &ldquo;Cuckoo! My sister has cooked me, and my father
has eaten me, but I am now a cuckoo and safe from my
step-mother.&rdquo; When the step-mother, who happened to be near the
tree, heard what that little bird was singing, in her fury and fright
she took a heavy lump of salt which lay near at hand, and threw it at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>the cuckoo, but instead of hitting it, the lump
fell down on her head and killed her on the spot. And the little boy
has remained a cuckoo to this very day.</p>
<p>This tale is more or less a variant of a well-known type of fairy
tales. Nos. 43, 44 are tales of men with inordinate and foolish wishes,
who by constantly changing bring about their own undoing. This last is
a variant of the story of the bad step-mother and the two children. But
here the fairy tales assume a different character. <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES A WAGTAIL WAG ITS TAIL?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Cuckoo and the
Wagtail.</span></p>
<p>The wagtail did not have the tail from the beginning. This tail
originally belonged to the wren, but it happened in this manner. The
wagtail was one day invited to the wedding of the lark, and as she felt
ashamed to go there without any tail, as she had none, she went to the
wren and asked the wren to lend her her tail for a few days. The wren,
which had as now a small body but in addition a long tail, did not wish
to be churlish, and lent her the tail. When the wagtail saw herself
with a long tail, she did not know what to do with herself for joy, she
was dancing and prancing all the way to the wedding. The wedding lasted
some days. When it was over, the wren came to the wagtail and asked for
the tail, but the wagtail, finding that the tail suited her so well,
pretended not to hear and not to see, and took no notice of the wren.
And thus it came about, from the time of the lark&rsquo;s wedding, that
the wren has remained without a tail, and the wagtail with one. But,
fearing lest the wren would come one day and steal it, the wagtail is
wagging its tail continually to be sure that she has it, and that it
has not been taken away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS THE HOOPOE A TUFT?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Hoopoe and the
Cuckoo.</span></p>
<p>The tuft of the hoopoe&rsquo;s head has given rise to a tale,
similar to some extent to the story of the tail of the wagtail, and yet
not quite identical. Like the wagtail, which originally had no tail,
the hoopoe had originally no tuft on its head. But when the lark had
her wedding, she invited all the birds. Among them also the hoopoe. She
did not want to come with her simple feathers, but went to the cuckoo
and borrowed them from him, for he had the tuft, promising to return it
to him as soon as she had come back from the wedding. The cuckoo, who
was a good natured and obliging fellow, trusted the hoopoe and lent her
the tuft.</p>
<p>She went to the wedding, and her beautiful ornament was greatly
admired by all the birds. Most of all was the lark pleased with it. The
hoopoe grew very elated, and thought she had better keep it. And so she
did. She came home, and entirely forgot the cuckoo and her promise to
return him his tuft. The cuckoo waited for a while for the hoopoe to
return to him the tuft which he had lent her. But the hoopoe was
nowhere to be found; she never showed herself. Seeing this, the cuckoo
went to her and asked her to return the tuft. She pretended not to know
what the cuckoo was saying, and coolly replied, &ldquo;I do not know
what you are talking about.&rdquo; Enraged at her callous conduct, the
cuckoo called all the other birds together to lay his case before them,
and to ask them to pass judgment on the hoopoe. When the birds came
together, they appointed the lark to be the judge, but the lark had
taken a fancy to the hoopoe ever since the wedding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>day,
so, in spite of the protestations of the cuckoo, he decided that the
tuft must remain with the hoopoe, as it suited her so much better. And
so it has remained to this day. But since then there is no friendship
between the cuckoo and the lark, who delivered a wrong judgment.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>An Eastern popular tale, Hanauer, <i>Folk-lore of the Holy Land</i>,
p. 254 ff., explains the origin of the tuft on the head of the hoopoe
as a crown given by King Solomon to this bird for its wisdom in
refusing to pay homage to women. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231"

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE EAGLE LIVE ON RAW MEAT?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Bewitched
Brothers.</span></p>
<p>Let us pass to the story of the eagle. It is the largest bird of
prey known in Rumania, and lives on young animals, lambs, goats, and so
on. The story runs as follows.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time there was such a famine in the land that the people
lived on grass and even on sawdust, and were dying of hunger in untold
numbers. At that time there lived a widow who had managed to husband a
little flour. When she found that nothing else was left to her she took
that flour and mixing it with water kneaded it into dough. Then she lit
the furnace, and got a shovel to put the dough on it and thence into
the furnace to bake. This woman had two sons and one daughter. The two
boys came in just at the moment when the loaves of dough were on the
shovel. They were so hungry that they did not wait for the dough to be
baked, and before their mother had time to put the shovel into the oven
they got hold of the dough, raw and uncooked as it was, and ate it up
to the smallest bit. They did not leave even a little piece for their
mother and sister. When the mother saw the terrible greediness of her
children, and that they ate the raw stuff and did not leave even a
small piece for her or their sister, she cursed them and said,
&ldquo;May you be cursed by God and be changed into two birds; may you
haunt the highest peaks of the mountains; may you never be able to eat
bread even when you see it, because you did not leave any for me this
day.&rdquo; No sooner had the boys gone out of the house than they were
changed into two huge eagles, who, spreading their wings, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>flew
away to the ends of the earth, no one knowing whither they had gone. A
short time afterwards their sister, who had not been at home when all
this had happened, came in, and she asked the mother where her brothers
were. Her mother did not tell her what had happened, and said that the
brothers, finding it was impossible for them to live any longer here,
had gone out into the wide world to live by their own earnings. When
the girl heard this she wept, and said, &ldquo;If that be so, then I
will also go out into the wide world, and will seek my brothers until I
find them,&rdquo; and would not listen to the words of her mother, who
wanted to keep her back. She said good-bye and departed, and travelled
on and on for a long time, until she came to the ends of the earth,
where the sun and moon no longer shone and the days were dark.</p>
<p>So she fell a-praying, and said, &ldquo;I have gone in search of my
brothers; O God, help me,&rdquo; and as she turned round she saw a
forest full of high trees which she had not noticed before, and she
said to herself, &ldquo;I will go into that forest; I am sure nothing
will happen to me,&rdquo; and so she did. She went into the forest not
knowing where she was going. In the midst of it she saw a beautiful
meadow full of singing birds, and there was a huge castle surrounded by
thick walls and closed by a gate with six locks. At the entrance of the
gate there were two huge monsters. She was very frightened. Still she
watched until these monsters had fallen asleep, and then slipping past
them she entered the gates. There she was met by a fox, who said to
her, &ldquo;What has brought thee hither into this the other world from
the world outside? I fear our master will eat you up. As soon as he
comes home he will swallow you.&rdquo; Still she went on, and on
entering the house she met the mistress of the house, who asked her the
same question, and she told her what had happened to her from the
beginning to the end, and that she had gone out into the wide world to
seek for her lost brothers. When the mistress heard her tale she took
pity on her, and taking her into the innermost chamber she hid her
there, and then went to await the home-coming of the master. About
midday, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>the sun stands on the cross-ways of heaven,
there was a great noise in the house; the place shook, for the master
had come, and he was none other than a huge lion.</p>
<p>At table, the mistress said to him, &ldquo;O my master, thou hast
always been so good to me; I ask you to be once more good and kind;
promise me.&rdquo; And he promised, and asked her her request. She told
him what had happened to that girl, and said that she had come there
from the other world in search of her brothers. The lion called the
young girl, who was greatly frightened, and she told him again all that
had happened to her. He then said, &ldquo;I will call together all my
subjects and ask them whether they have seen your brothers passing by
this way, or whether meeting them they have eaten them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he called from far and near all the animals who were in his
dominion, and he asked them about the brothers. But they all said that
these had never passed through the land, and they had neither seen them
nor eaten them. So the lion told her to go on. She went on and came to
another forest, very big and dark, and walking for a time in it she
came to another meadow full of birds singing so beautifully that you
could not hear enough of them, and there in the midst was a house deep
down in the ground with a thatched roof. The girl went in the house,
and there was an old woman sitting on the oven.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5719src" href="#xd21e5719" name="xd21e5719src">1</a> &ldquo;May
God help you,&rdquo; said the young girl, and the old woman replied,
&ldquo;Welcome, my daughter, what has brought you here into this part
of the world never yet trodden by human foot?&rdquo; And the girl told
her that she had left her mother&rsquo;s house and gone in search of
her brothers. The woman said, &ldquo;Your brothers are alive, but they
are under a spell, for they have been charmed into huge birds, and they
live yonder in the castle on that steep mountain. If you can reach that
place you will be able to see your brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full of joy at these tidings, the girl went to the mountain and
found that it was a bare, steep, high cliff with little patches of
grass here and there, just the place for eagles&rsquo; nests. Taking
courage, she started climbing up, and after endless toil reached
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>the top. There she saw a huge palace surrounded
by iron walls, and going inside she saw a room; the table was set and
food was on the table. As she was very hungry, she went round the table
and took a bit from every dish. Then she hid herself, watching to see
what would happen. She had not to wait very long, for soon two huge
eagles came from the depths of heaven. They entered and sat down at the
table and began to eat their meal. Suddenly one of them said to the
other, &ldquo;Halloo, some one must have been here, for I see that my
food has been nibbled.&rdquo; The other said, &ldquo;It is impossible
for any one to come here,&rdquo; and took no further notice of it.</p>
<p>On the second day they noticed that once again some of their food
had been eaten again, and so on the third day, when more of it had been
eaten. So they started hunting through the house to find out who was
hidden there, for surely some one must have come to eat the food. After
a long search they found the girl huddled up in a small room. As soon
as they saw her they recognised her as their sister, and taking her
into the large hall they asked her what had happened and what had
brought her to them. She told them all that had happened to her, and
how she had been through the forest and climbed up the mountain, and
that she was now there with them. The brothers then said to her,
&ldquo;We are under a spell; mother has cursed us. We have now been
changed into birds of prey; but if you will stay here for six years and
not speak a single word, that will save us; the spell will be broken,
and we shall again be human beings.&rdquo; The girl promised to do all
they wished, as the old woman whom she had met before had told her that
she was to do whatever her brothers would wish her to do. And there she
remained. Her brothers spread their wings and flew away. Five years had
past, the girl not seeing anything of them, and not speaking all the
time. After that time she said to herself, &ldquo;What is the good of
my sitting here and keeping silent when none of them have come;
perchance they are dead, or who knows what has happened?&rdquo; No
sooner had she opened her mouth and spoken a word when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>in
came her two brothers, and said to her mournfully, &ldquo;Thou hast not
kept thy vow, thou hast broken thy promise, thou hast spoken! If thou
wouldst have waited one more year we would have become human beings,
and the spell would have been broken. Now we are cursed forever. We
must remain eagles and birds of prey.&rdquo; And so they have remained
to this day, preying on birds and beasts, living on raw meat, never
being able to touch bread, and even picking up children under six years
of age, the years which their sister had to wait in order to break the
spell.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In this story we find again well-known motives from fairy tales,
especially that of &ldquo;Snow White and the Dwarfs,&rdquo; in which
Snow White comes into the house and nibbles at the food which is on the
table, so that her presence is thereby disclosed. But here the tale has
been used for the purpose of explaining the origin of the eagle. Other
details there are in that tale which are not clearly brought out in
this, for at the bottom of it lies the tale of the grateful animals.
That is the reason why the lion spares the girl and also the good
fairy, whom she serves faithfully, here represented by the old woman in
the house with the thatched roof, by whom she is rewarded by being
shown the way to her lost brothers.</p>
<p>All these elements have here been combined in the bird tale. A close
parallel to this tale is to be found in Grimm, No. 25. <span class=

Mountain.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a man who was under a spell. He got
married to a woman, and after a time he suddenly disappeared. He was
carried away by the spell, no one knew whither. The poor woman waited
for him one day and another day and a third day, and seeing that he did
not return she went out into the world to search after him. And so,
passing through many a country, she came at last to the house where
Holy Thursday lived, a good old woman, who was the mistress of a third
of all the birds in the world. When she saw the traveller, she asked
her what had brought her there, and the poor woman, weeping, told her
how she had gone in search of her husband, who had suddenly
disappeared, and whom she had not been able to find anywhere in the
world.</p>
<p>Holy Mother Thursday said to her, &ldquo;Wait, I will call all my
birds together, and I shall hear from them whether they know where your
husband is.&rdquo; In the evening she called all the birds who were
under her rule, and asked them whether they knew what had happened to
the man. They all replied that they had not seen him, and they did not
know whither he had gone. Sad at heart, the poor woman went away, and
came to Holy Mother Saturday, who ruled over half the birds in the
world. She asked the young woman how she had come to that part of the
world, and what had brought her thither.</p>
<p>The poor woman told her tale, and also that Holy Mother Thursday
could not find where her husband was. So Mother Saturday called her
birds, and asked them whether they had seen anything of the poor
woman&rsquo;s husband. They all replied <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>that they had not
seen anything of him, and did not know what had become of him. Greatly
disappointed, the poor woman went on her way, until she came to the
house of the Holy Mother Sunday, who ruled over all the birds. After
hearing from the woman what had brought her to her house, she called
all the birds together, and put the same question to them. None of the
birds knew where the husband was except the cock lark. He said he knew
where the husband was, a very long way off. Then Mother Sunday asked
the bird whether he could carry the woman to that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly will I abide by your command, O mistress,&rdquo;
said the bird; and taking the woman on his back, he rose up high in the
air, and started flying to the place whither the husband had been
carried. And so flying, they came at last to a high mountain made all
of glass. The bird could not go up that mountain, so they shod his
little feet with iron, and slowly, slowly, they climbed up that
mountain until they came to the top. The woman, however, was so much
frightened by the flight that she clutched at the feathers on the top
of the lark, and held tightly to them, fearing to lose her hold. Since
that time the ruffled feathers have remained upstanding, and hence the
tuft on the head of the male lark.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is peculiar that the tale here ends abruptly without telling us
whether the woman met her husband, or whether she was able to break the
spell. It is probably tacitly assumed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Another story of the lark tells of one who went in search of his

Samodiva.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5773src" href="#xd21e5773" name=

saw an old man with a long white beard, who told him to go in search of
her, for he was sure to find her. On his way he came to a very old man,
who turned out to be the king of all the birds. In the evening all the
birds came to him to be fed, but one bird was missing. It came in
rather late, limping and tired, and when the king saw it he recognised
it to be the lark. And he asked the bird why it was so tired and what
had befallen it. The bird said, &ldquo;Thou hast ordered me to live so
far away that it takes me a very long time to come to the court, and it
is with great difficulty that I have been able to come here to this
place in obedience to thy command.&rdquo; Then the king asked the lark
where he had his nest, and when he replied in the gardens of Sila
Samodiva, the brother was full of joy, for that was the place where his
sister had been taken. Then the king asked the bird whether he could
lead the man to that place. &ldquo;Willingly will I do so,&rdquo;
replied the lark. &ldquo;I will jump from tree to tree and from bush to
bush, and flutter about gently, and if he follows me I am sure to lead
him to the place of his desire.&rdquo; And so following the bird, he
reached a golden palace in which the fairy Sila Samodiva was living. He
entered the palace by holding on to the tuft of the lark, which has
since remained dishevelled. A fairy put him to various trials, which he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>successfully accomplished, and thus was able to
rescue his sister and to return home in safety.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Needless to point out, that in these two tales we have parallels to
the famous legend of the hoopoe in the Solomonic cycle. In it Solomon
orders all the birds to come and render homage; only one bird does not
appear at the proper time. It comes in very late, limp, tired and
exhausted, and excuses itself by telling Solomon of its long flight
from the court of the Queen of Sheba, to whom King Solomon then sends a
message by means of the same bird. But we are not told in this story
anything of the origin of the bird, except that it is described as one
leading the travellers to the places in the other world which they wish
to reach. Another very elaborate fairy tale gives us the origin of the
lark. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Princess and her
Love for the Sun.</span></p>
<p>A very long time ago, so long indeed that no one can remember when
it happened, there lived a king and queen. They had everything which
their heart desired, except that they had no children. They were good
and charitable people, and distributed alms and prayed, but all in
vain. At last, when they had given up every hope, they were suddenly
blessed with a child. It was a little girl, and she was so sweet and so
beautiful that they called her Little Light. The parents could not see
enough of her, and so they kept her in their palace all the time, until
one day her mother allowed her to go out into the garden.</p>
<p>In the wall of the garden there was a small gate leading into a
beautiful meadow. The young princess opened the gate and went into the
meadow and looked around her, for she had never before been out of her
rooms. She rejoiced at the flowers and birds and animals, but more than
anything was she pleased with the sight of the sinking sun, and with
the golden rays which he sent through the heavens. She was so pleased
with that sight that she went every day in the afternoon to watch for
the glorious sun and his golden rays. Thus one day passed, and again
another day, and she fell deeply in love with the sun, and being in
love, she decided that she must go and find him. So great was her love
that she did not look at any young man, and grew thinner, weaker and
sadder every day, until she could not bear it any longer; and going to
her parents, she said that she could not stay any longer at home, and
that she must go out into the world. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>parents tried in vain
to keep her at home, but, seeing that all their efforts were of no
avail, they let her go, and she went. She took money and food with her,
and went along not knowing the right way.</p>
<p>So long as the money and the food lasted she felt quite happy, but a
time came when both had come to an end, and she was in a very sore
plight, not knowing what to do. Moreover, she was frightened to go
alone, for she was in woman&rsquo;s clothes. Suddenly she found herself
in the midst of a wide field full of dead bodies. A battle had been
fought there, and the field was strewn with the dead. So she took one
of the uniforms of the soldiers, dressed herself up in a man&rsquo;s
garb, and, finding a horse, mounted on it and rode along with her face
turned towards the sinking sun. On the way she found then an old woman
dressed all in black, sitting close to a well, and weaving gossamer and
cobweb. She addressed her as the Black One, which seemed to please the
old woman, who told her to turn towards the rising sun until she would
come to a glass mountain; she would have to reach the top of the
mountain, and then she was sure to find her way to the palace of the
sun. She rode on and came to the glass mountain. When she had reached
the top, after having had the horse shod again at the bottom of the
hill, she found a palace, but it was not that of the sun. It was
inhabited by three sisters, who received her in very friendly fashion,
and treated her with great hospitality. Thinking that she was a man,
they all fell in love with her; but she told them she was a woman, and
they left her to continue her quest. Before leaving they gave her a
magic sword, which, if drawn half out of its sheath, killed half the
number of an army, and if drawn entirely, killed the entire army of the
enemy. By this means she was able to vanquish the enemies of a great
king, who, discovering her to be a girl, wanted to marry her; but she
escaped and continued her journey towards the rising sun.</p>
<p>On the way she met with a very old man, whose white hair had grown
down to his ankles, and who was so weak that he could scarcely open his
mouth. Little Light washed him and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>fed him and cut his hair.
When he had eaten and felt himself refreshed, he told her which way to
go; then he gave her a piece of bread, and told her that on her way to
the palace a wild dog would come out against her; she must give him
that bread and none other, and before entering the palace she must
drink of the water of the fountain at the gate of the palace. A
three-headed dog met her, she gave him the bread, and he suddenly
disappeared after having eaten it. Then she went and drank of the water
in the well, and was able to look at the golden palace in front of her,
which was so radiant and so luminous that no human eye could look at it
without being blinded. Then she went into the palace, and there, in the
middle of the hall, who should be sitting at the table and eating but
the glorious sun, beautiful and luminous as only the sun can be?</p>
<p>When Little Light saw him, she almost fainted with joy, but he also,
turning to her and seeing her beautiful face, felt himself drawn to
her, for he had never yet seen such a wonderful human being. There in
the hall was also the mother of the sun. When she saw Little Light, she
turned fiercely on her, and cursing her said, &ldquo;O thou wicked
child of man, born of sin, thou hast come here to defile the immaculate
purity of my son and to lead him on to sin and wickedness. Thou shalt
no longer remain a human being, thou shalt become a bird flying as high
as to get near the sun, and there, seeing the beloved who cannot be
thine, thou shalt cry plaintively for him whom thou hast won and yet
lost.&rdquo; At that moment Little Light was changed into the lark,
which at the break of dawn, before the sun rises, flies up into the sky
trying to get as near as possible to the sun, and there cries
plaintively at the loss of her beloved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE LARK.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Another Version.</span></p>
<p>A variant of this story tells us that after the girl had left the
king&rsquo;s palace and had gone on seeking for the sun, she came to a
river, and did not know how to cross it. Whilst she was sitting there
at the bank of the river, not knowing what to do, there came out of the
river a girl dressed in white, who told her that she would reach the
palace and yet not reach it; and as she spoke these words, there came a
bridge and spanned the river. The girl went across the bridge, and
going on in her journey, she came to a field where an old woman was
watching a flock of geese. Curious as old women are, this one asked the
girl what had brought her hither, and whither she was going, and who
she was. The girl answered politely, and the old woman, being touched
by her beauty, gave her a twig in her right hand and placed a ring on
her left hand, and told her to cross herself with the twig, and then
she would see what would happen. She did so, and she suddenly felt
herself lifted up high in the air and carried as fast as a thought to
some distant land. When she found herself again on the ground, she saw
the palace of the sun facing her, but the palace was surrounded by a
river, over whose waters, clear as tears, there was no bridge. An old
man carried the passengers across, but he had to be paid with a silver
coin. Those who did not pay had to wander round that river for a year.
Remembering the ring which the old woman had given her, she offered it
to the old man instead of a coin; he accepted it and carried her
across. On the other side a two-headed dog came out and barked at her
furiously. At his barking an old woman came out, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>was
none other than the mother of the sun. The poor girl did not know who
it was; she might have been careful with her answer if she had. The
woman asked her who she was and what she had come for. The girl, who
was truthfulness itself, said in her simplicity that she had come to
see the sun whom she loved so much. When the old woman heard this, she
cursed her, and thus she became the lark flying about high in the air,
and trying in vain to reach her beloved.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is evident that we have here reminiscences of ancient myths,
which have assumed a very peculiar shape in the mind of the people. It
would be difficult to say whether these are survivals of Greek myths,
of Charon, who ferries the dead across the river, and other legends
connected with Apollo, or whether we have here later stories which have
lingered on in the Balkans and have then been carried across the
Danube. Whatever the connection, one cannot deny that we are dealing
here with materials closely akin to those which form the substance of
some parts of ancient Greek mythology, but in a modified form. Charon
has survived to this very day in the legends and in the folk-lore of
modern Greece, no less than in that of Macedonia and the other peoples
of the Balkans. It is curious, however, that in this tale no blending
with Christianity has taken place. We find various layers of religious
belief which seem to have been superimposed upon one another, each one
as it were leading an independent life of its own, seldom mixing to
such an extent that the line of demarcation between what, in the
absence of another term, one might call heathen mythology and Christian
mythology or legendary lore. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=

<p class="first">This belongs to the series of the sun myths, curiously
connected here also with the peacock. I am not aware of any parallel to
this legend. Here a young man tries to woo the sister of the sun. In
the lark stories it is the young girl who wishes to marry the sun,
represented as a young man. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>all belong to the same cycle,
into which apparently so far the Christian element is absent. The
remarkable part of it is, that this and the other songs are Christmas
carols, connected probably with the Festival of the Sun with which
Christmas was originally connected. It is the time of the winter
solstice and the birth of the new sun. This probably explains the part
which the sun legend plays in so many Rumanian Christmas carols.

<h2 class="main">WHERE DID THE SWAN COME FROM?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Swan Maiden and the
King.</span></p>
<p>This is in its essence the well-known story of the swan-maidens, but
with a very marked difference. It is here used more or less to describe
the origin of the swan, whilst the tale of the swan-maiden presupposes
the existence and knowledge of such birds.</p>
<p>The version, which I have been able to find is, however, not
complete; still it is clear enough for our purpose. It runs as
follows:</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time a king went out hunting, and after he had been
hunting in the forest for a long time without finding anything, he
found himself suddenly in an open plain, in which there was a huge
lake, and in the midst of the lake he saw there a bird swimming about,
the like of which he had never seen before. It was a swan.</p>
<p>Drawing his bow, he wanted to shoot it. To his surprise it spoke to
him in a human voice, and said, &ldquo;Do not kill me.&rdquo; So he
tried his best to catch it, and succeeded. Pleased with the capture of
the bird, he carried it home alive, and gave it to the cook to kill it
to make a meal of it for him. The cook was a Gipsy. She whetted her
knife and went to the bird to cut its throat, when, to her
astonishment, the bird turned three somersaults, and there stood before
her a most beautiful maiden, more beautiful than she had ever seen
before. So she ran to the king and told him what had happened.</p>
<p>The king, who first thought that the cook was trying to play some
trickery with him, did not listen to her, but when she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>persisted in her tale, the king, driven by
curiosity, went into the kitchen, and there he saw a girl more
beautiful than any that he had ever yet set his eyes upon.</p>
<p>He asked her who she was, and she said she was the swan who was
swimming on the lake, that she had wilfully gone away from her mother,
who lived in the land of fairies, and that she had left two sisters
behind. So the king took her into the palace and married her. The
Gipsy, who was a pretty wench, had thought that the king would marry
her, and when she saw what had happened, she was very angry. But she
managed to conceal her anger, and tried to be kind to the new queen,
biding her time all the while.</p>
<p>The king and queen lived on for a while in complete happiness, and
after a time a child was born unto her.</p>
<p>It so happened that the king had to go on a long journey, leaving
the wife and child in the care of the Gipsy. One day the Gipsy came to
the queen, and said to her, &ldquo;Why do you always sit in the palace?
come, let us walk a little in the garden, to hear the birds singing,
and to see the beautiful flowers.&rdquo; The queen, who had no
suspicion, took the advice of the Gipsy, and went with her for a walk
into the garden. In the middle of the garden there was a deep well, and
the Gipsy said artfully to the young queen, &ldquo;Just bend over the
well, and look into the water below, and see whether your face has
remained so beautiful as it was on the first day when you turned into a
maiden from being a swan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen bent over the well to look down into the depths, and that
was what the Gipsy was waiting for, for no sooner did the queen bend
over the well, than, getting hold of her by her legs, she threw her
down head foremost into the well and drowned her. When the king came
home and did not find the queen, he asked what had happened, and where
she was. The Gipsy, who had meanwhile taken charge of the child, and
looked after it very carefully, said to the king that the young queen,
pining for her old home, had turned again into a swan and flown
away.</p>
<p>The king was deeply grieved when he heard this, but believing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>what the Gipsy had told him, he thought that
nothing could be done, and resigned himself to the loss of his
wife.</p>
<p>The Gipsy woman looked after the child with great care, hoping
thereby that she might win the king&rsquo;s love, and that he would
marry her. A month, a year passed, and nothing was heard of the wife.
And the king, seeing the apparent affection of the Gipsy for the child,
decided at last to marry her, and fixed the day of the wedding. Out of
the fountain into which the queen had been thrown, there grew a willow
tree with three branches, one stem in the middle and two branching out
right and left. Not far from the garden there lived a man who had a
large flock of sheep. One day he sent his boy to lead the sheep to the
field. On his way the boy passed the king&rsquo;s garden with the well
in the middle of it.</p>
<p>As the boy had left his flute at home, when he saw the willow he
thought he would cut one of the branches and make a flute.</p>
<p>Going into the garden, he cut the middle stem, and made a flute of
it. When he put it to his lips, the flute by itself began to play as
follows: &ldquo;O boy, do not blow too hard, for my heart is aching for
my little babe which I left behind in the cradle, and to suckle at the
black breast of a Gipsy.&rdquo; When the boy heard what the flute was
playing, not understanding what it meant, he was greatly astonished,
and ran home to tell his father what had happened with the flute.</p>
<p>The father, angry that he had left the sheep alone, scolded him, and
took away the flute. Then he tried to see whether the boy had told the
truth. As soon as he put it to his mouth the flute started playing the
same tune as when the boy had tried to play it. The father said
nothing, and wondering at the meaning of the words he hid the flute
away in a cupboard.</p>
<p>When the king&rsquo;s wedding-day drew near, all the musicians of
the kingdom were invited to come and play at the banquet. Some of them
passed the old man&rsquo;s house, and hearing from them that they were
going to play at the king&rsquo;s banquet, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>remembered the marvellous flute, and he asked
whether he could not go also, as he could play the flute so wonderfully
well. His son&mdash;the young boy&mdash;had meanwhile gone into the
garden in the hope of getting another flute, as the willow had three
branches. So he cut one of the branches and made a flute of it. Now
this flute did not play at all.</p>
<p>When the old man came to the palace, there was much rejoicing and
singing. At last his turn came to play. As soon as he put the flute to
his lips, the flute sang: &ldquo;O man, do not blow so hard, for my
heart aches for my little babe left in the cradle to be suckled by a
black Gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gipsy, who was the king&rsquo;s bride and sat at the head of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6155" title="Source: she">the</span> table,
at once understood the saying of the flute, although <span class="corr"
id="xd21e6158" title="Source: the">she</span> did not know what the
flute had to do with the queen whom she had killed.</p>
<p>The king, who marvelled greatly at the flute and at the tune which
it was singing, took a gold piece and gave it to the man for the flute,
and when he started blowing it, the flute began to sing: &ldquo;O my
dear husband, do not blow so hard, for my heart aches for our little
babe whom I left in the cradle to be suckled by the black Gipsy.
Quickly, quickly, do away with this cruel Gipsy, as otherwise thou wilt
lose thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests who were present marvelled at the song, and no one
understood its meaning. The Gipsy, however, who understood full well
what it meant, turning to the king, said, &ldquo;Illustrious king, do
not blow this flute and make thyself ridiculous before thy guests,
throw it into the fire.&rdquo; But the king, who felt offended by the
words of the Gipsy, made her take up the flute and blow. With great
difficulty she submitted to the order of the king, and she was quite
justified in refusing to play it, for no sooner had she put the flute
to her lips when it sang: &ldquo;You enemy of mine, do not blow hard,
for my heart aches for my little babe left in the cradle to be suckled
by thee, thou evil-minded Gipsy. Thou hast thrown me into the well, and
there put an end to my life, but God had pity on me, and he has
preserved me to be again the true wife of this illustrious king.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>Furious at these words, the Gipsy threw the flute away with so much
force that she thought it would break into thousands of splinters. But
it was not to be as she thought, for by this very throw the flute was
changed into a beautiful woman, more beautiful, indeed, than any had
ever seen before. She was the very queen whom the Gipsy had thrown into
the well.</p>
<p>When the king saw her, he embraced her and kissed her, and asked her
where she had been such a long time. She told him that she had slept at
the bottom of the well into which she had been thrown by the Gipsy, who
had hoped to become the queen, and this would have come to pass had it
not been for the boy cutting a flute out of the stem of the
willow-tree. &ldquo;And now, punish the Gipsy as she deserves,
otherwise thy wife must leave thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard these words, he called the boy and asked him
whether he had cut himself a flute from the stem of the willow tree
which had grown out of the well in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, O illustrious king;&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;and
may I be forgiven for the audacity of going into the king&rsquo;s
garden. I went and cut for myself a flute from the stem of the willow
tree, and when I began to blow it, it played, &lsquo;Do not blow so
hard, O boy, for my heart is aching within me,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo; Then
he told him he had gone back to his father, who instead of praising him
for the marvellous flute, gave him a good shaking. He had then gone a
second time into the garden, and had cut off one of the branches to
make a flute; but this did not play like the first one. The king gave
the boy a very rich gift, and he ordered the Gipsy to be killed.</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, the queen came to the king and asked leave to
go to her mother to tell her all that had happened to her, and to say
good-bye for ever now, as she henceforth would live among human beings.
The king reluctantly gave way. She then made three somersaults, and
again became a swan, as she had been when the king found her for the
first time on the waters of the lake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>Spreading her wings she flew far away until she reached the house of
her mother, who was quite alone. Her two sisters were not there. They
had left her some time ago and no one knew whither they had gone. The
young queen did not go into the house, she was probably afraid lest her
mother would not let her go back again, so she settled on the roof, and
there she sang: &ldquo;Remain in health, good mother mine, as the joy
is no longer granted thee to have me with thee in thine house, for thou
wilt only see me again when I lose my kingdom, dear mother mine, not
before, and not till then.&rdquo; And without waiting for the answer of
her mother she returned back again to her husband. Sitting on the
window sill, she sung again: &ldquo;Rise up, O husband, open the doors,
wake up the servants and let them be a witness of my faithfulness to
thee, for since I have married thee I have left my mother, and my
sisters have gone away from me, and from a swan I have become a true
wife to live in happiness with thee. Henceforth I shall no longer be a
swan, but thou must take care of me that I do not go hence from thee. I
do not know whether my fate will be a better one by being a queen in
this world. O sweet water, how I long to bathe in thee! And my white
feathers, they will belong to my sisters. Since I am to leave them for
ever, and my mother with them, O Lord, what have I done? Shall I be
able to live upon the earth, and shall I keep the kingdom? Thou, O
Lord, O merciful, hearken unto me and grant that this kingdom may not
be in vain.&rdquo; And turning again head over heels, she became a
woman as before, and entering the palace she lived there with her
husband&mdash;the king&mdash;and if they have not died since they are
still alive.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Here we have the origin of the swans, for since that time the swans
have come to this world.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable tale, in which the element of the swan-maiden
story has been mixed up with the type of the false wife. It claims,
however, special attention, for we have here what I believe to be
&ldquo;the song of the dying swan.&rdquo; It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>practically the song of the swan before her
death as a swan, and her rebirth as a fairy maiden, which is contained
in the concluding portion.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any other parallel to this peculiar song, although
the fable that the swan sings a very beautiful song before his death is
well known from antiquity.</p>
<p>Here follows another version of the swan legend in the form of a
ballad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=

<p class="first">Here we have a remarkable &ldquo;carol,&rdquo; full of
mystical lore, in which the swan-like maiden in the tale is really a
fairy in disguise. The bird of heaven, and the crown of paradise, and
all the rest stand here for the tests which often are found in fairy
tales. The hero must first win these mythical beings before he can
obtain the love of the maiden, or probably before she can turn from a
swan into a human being, and remain as such. We have here thus a
version of the large cycle of the Swan Maiden (<i>v.</i> Cosquin, ii.
16; Saineanu, p. 264 ff.). Such miraculous birds occur very often in
Rumanian (<i>v.</i> Saineanu, p. 410 ff.). <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE DUCK FEED ON REFUSE?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Cannibal
Innkeeper.</span></p>
<p>This is more or less a fairy tale, but of a very complicated
character. Various elements are combined in it. It begins as do many
tales, with the fact that a couple had a child after many years: that
child is a beautiful girl, who, left as an orphan, dresses up in a
man&rsquo;s clothes, works at the house of a rich man, where she after
a time resumes her character as a girl: the chieftain of robbers falls
in love with her, but when he asks his companions to go and steal her
away from her master, everyone refuses. He then goes himself, disguised
as a servant: he stays for some time in the same house: when he asks
her to marry him, she refuses. His attempts at stealing her are
frustrated by a little dog which she had received from her parents. One
night he succeeds in catching the dog, and, assisted by some of his
comrades whom he had summoned for the purpose, he is able to carry her
away to his house. There she refuses again to marry him, and when he
finds that neither good words, nor threats, nor beating make her change
her mind, he gets so furious that he decides to sell her to a wild and
cruel innkeeper who lives some distance away.</p>
<p>Now this innkeeper used to rob the travellers: then he used to kill
them, cut them in pieces, and, after having cooked them, he gave their
flesh to his customers to eat. When he received the girl he took her
first into a very large room, in which there was only a table and
chairs round it. That was the room where he used to feed all the
travellers who came to him. Then he took her into another apartment
which was full of gold and silver and vestments of silk, and round the
walls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>were hanging weapons of all kinds, all robbed
from the people who had lodged in that place, and whom he had murdered.
Then he took her into a third room. There was a pillar, and on it were
hanging two knives and an axe, with which he used to kill and cut up
his victims; and along the walls there were hooks, and on each hook a
human head. He showed all these things to the girl, who was greatly
frightened, and who expected now to be killed by this cruel man. But he
somehow seemed to have taken some pity on her, or perhaps he wanted to
keep her for some time longer; whatever the reason, he took her and
pushed her into another room, quite behind all these rooms, and locked
the door upon her; and he told her to wait until he came back, and she
was to do all that she was told. She had taken the little dog with her,
and that seemed to comfort her. Soon afterwards he brought in a boy
whom he had captured in the forest gathering berries, and taking him
into an inner apartment he cut his head off, and cut him in pieces, and
calling the girl in, he told her to take the meat and cook it and get
it ready for the customers whom he was expecting. When the people came,
he fed them in his usual way with human flesh. The people did not know
what manner of food it was they were getting, but they seemed to like
it; then he did with these guests what he had done with all the others,
and so it went on day after day, the poor girl was kept there locked up
and helping to prepare the food of the chopped-up men.</p>
<p>One day a very old woman was brought in, whom the man had bought,
but she was so ugly and so wizened that one could scarcely recognise a
human countenance. Not knowing who she was, the wild man thrust her
into the chamber where the young girl was: very likely he wanted to
kill her later on, as he had killed all the others, but possibly he
wanted first to feed her up, as she was only skin and bones. When the
young girl saw that bag of bones, she was very frightened; but the old
woman spoke in friendly fashion to her, and asked her who she was and
how she came to be in that house, telling her at the same time that she
was a great witch, she could do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>anything, change everything,
and that she had cursed her son for his cruelty, when he was still a
young boy, and that she had come now to punish him. She had disguised
herself in this ugly form, for she knew that if her son recognised her
he would not wait long, but would kill her at once without mercy. The
girl then told her her pitiful tale, and begged of her to save her. She
told her what a terrible life she was leading, how she had been fed on
human flesh, and that he was probably only waiting for an opportunity
to kill her also and to give her flesh to others to be eaten. The old
woman took pity on her, and told her she need not fear; though her son
had put her in the innermost recess and there was no outlet, yet she
would be able to escape. She must kill the little dog, and taking out a
small bit from the heart was to swallow it. While she was doing it, the
old woman took out some ointment from her bosom and began to rub her
with it all over her body, when she suddenly became changed into a
duck. There she sat quietly in a corner, and when the wild man came and
opened the door she flew away and escaped into the open. The man looked
round, and not finding the girl he went all over the place searching
for her. At that moment the mother followed him out of that room, and
uttered a terrible curse, on which the whole house fell down over him
and killed him. When the duck had flown some distance away, she turned
back to see what had happened, for the old woman had foretold her that
she was going to destroy it. When she turned round she saw the heap of
ruins, but as the old woman had not told her how she could again become
a human being, the spell remained unbroken, and she has remained a duck
to this very day.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that ducks are so fat, and they seek their
food among the dead bodies and dirty places.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It will be seen that we have here a remarkable parallel of the
Bluebeard story, but in a much more primitive form, for this Bluebeard
does not kill only his wives, but he kills indiscriminately all those
upon whom he can lay his hands, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>then he uses the
flesh of his victims for food. There are dim recollections of
cannibalism in this tale, which in a way also reminds us of Polyphemus,
who keeps Ulysses and his companions for the purpose of killing them
and eating them, and the same story is found in another form in the
adventures of Sindbad the Sailor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263"

<h2 class="main">WHY HAS THE STORK NO TAIL?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Water of Life and
Death.</span></p>
<p>This tale, though part of a longer fairy tale, is still complete in
itself.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The hero of the tale, Floria, having shown some kindness to a stork,
who afterwards turns out to be the king of the storks, receives from
him a feather, which when taken up at any time of danger would bring
the stork to him and help him. And thus it came to pass that the hero,
finding himself at one time in danger, remembered the gift of the
stork. He took out the feather from the place where he had hidden it,
and waved it. At once the stork appeared and asked Floria what he could
do for him. He told him the king had ordered him to bring the water of
life and the water of death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6528src" href=
"#xd21e6528" name="xd21e6528src">1</a></p>
<p>The stork replied that if it could possibly be got he would
certainly do it for him. Returning to his palace, the stork, who was
the king of the storks, called all the storks together, and asked them
whether they had seen or heard or been near the mountains that knock
against one another, at the bottom of which are the fountains of the
water of life and death.</p>
<p>All the young and strong looked at one another, and not even the
oldest one ventured to reply. He asked them again, and then they said
they had never heard or seen anything of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the waters of life
and death. At last there came from the rear a stork, lame on one foot,
blind in one eye, and with a shrivelled-up body, and with half of his
feathers plucked out. And he said, &ldquo;May it please your majesty, I
have been there where the mountains knock one against the other, and
the proofs of it are my blinded eye and my crooked leg.&rdquo; When the
king saw him in the state in which he was, he did not even take any
notice of him.</p>
<p>Turning to the other storks, he said: &ldquo;Is there any one among
you who, for my sake, will run the risk and go to these mountains and
bring the water?&rdquo; Not one of the young and strong, and not even
any of the older ones who were still strong replied. They all kept
silence. But the lame stork said to the king, &ldquo;For your sake, O
Master King, I will again put my life in danger and go.&rdquo; The king
again did not look at him, and turning to the others repeated his
question; but when he saw that they all kept silence, he at last turned
to the stork and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou really believe, crippled and broken as thou art,
that thou wilt be able to carry out my command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will certainly try,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou put me to shame?&rdquo; the king again said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not; but thou must bind on my wings some meat for my
food, and tie the two bottles for the water to my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other storks, on hearing his words, laughed at what they thought
his conceit, but he took no notice of it. The king was very pleased,
and did as the stork had asked. He tied on his wings a quantity of
fresh meat, which would last him for his journey, and the two bottles
were fastened to his legs. He said to him, &ldquo;A pleasant
journey.&rdquo; The stork, thus prepared for his journey, rose up into
the heavens, and away he went straight to the place where the mountains
were knocking against one another and prevented any one approaching the
fountains of life and death. It was when the sun had risen as high as a
lance that he espied in the distance those huge mountains which, when
they knocked against one another, shook the earth and made a noise that
struck fear and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>terror into the hearts of those who were a
long distance away.</p>
<p>When the mountains had moved back a little before knocking against
one another, the stork wanted to plunge into the depths and get the
water. But there came suddenly to him a swallow from the heart of the
mountain, and said to him, &ldquo;Do not go a step further, for thou
art surely lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou who stops me in my way?&rdquo; asked the stork
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the guardian spirit of these mountains, appointed to
save every living creature that has the misfortune to come near
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do then to be safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou come to fetch water of life and death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be so, then thou must wait till noon, when the
mountains rest for half an hour. As soon as thou seest that a short
time has passed and they do not move, then rise up as high as possible
into the air, and drop down straight to the bottom of the mountain.
There, standing on the ledge of the stone between the two waters, dip
thy bottles into the fountains and wait until they are filled. Then
rise as thou hast got down, but beware lest thou touchest the walls of
the mountain or even a pebble, or thou art lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stork did as the swallow had told him; he waited till noontide,
and when he saw that the mountains had gone to sleep, he rose up into
the air, and, plunging down into the depth, he settled on the ledge of
the stone and filled his bottles. Feeling that they had been filled, he
rose with them as he had got down, but when he had reached almost the
top of the mountains, he touched a pebble. No sooner had he done so,
when the two mountains closed furiously upon him; but they did not
catch any part of him, except the tail, which remained locked up fast
between the two peaks of the mountains.</p>
<p>With a strong movement he tore himself away, happy that he had saved
his life and the two bottles with the waters of life and death, not
caring for the loss of his tail. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he returned the way he had come, and reached the palace of the
king of the storks in time for the delivery of the bottles. When he
reached the palace, all the storks were assembled before the king,
waiting to see what would happen to the lame and blind one who had
tried to put them to shame. When they saw him coming back, they noticed
that he had lost his tail, and they began jeering at him and laughing,
for he looked all the more ungainly, from having already been so ugly
before.</p>
<p>But the king was overjoyed with the exploit of his faithful
messenger; and he turned angrily on the storks and said, &ldquo;Why are
you jeering and mocking? Just look round and see where are your tails.
And you have not lost them in so honourable a manner as this my
faithful messenger.&rdquo; On hearing this they turned round, and lo!
one and all of them had lost their tails.</p>
<p>And this is the reason why they have remained without a tail to this
very day.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Young Maiden and her
Husband the Demon.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a widow who had one only child. She had a
flock of sheep and a magic dog. The widow died, and the girl was left
quite alone. So she took the flock of sheep and went to feed them in
the mountain, accompanied only by her faithful little dog. After some
time, there came also to the same pastures a young shepherd leading his
flock. Before leaving, the girl had put on man&rsquo;s clothes, and so
when the other shepherd, who was the son of a she-demon, came, they got
very friendly, and the girl often went with her flock to spend the
night in the house of the demon. She did not know who the other
shepherd was, nor who was his mother. After a time, the young man began
to feel suspicious about his comrade, and he said to his mother,
&ldquo;Methinks my friend is a girl, despite his man&rsquo;s clothes;
his gait and his speech are just like that of a maiden.&rdquo; The
mother would not listen; but after a time, when the son went on saying
that he believed his mate to be a maiden, she said to him, &ldquo;Very
well, then, we will put him to the test, and we can easily find out
what he is. I will take a special flower and put it under his pillow,
and if it is faded in the morning he is for sure a maiden.&rdquo; The
dog, who knew what the old woman was up to, called the girl aside and
told her: &ldquo;Listen to me, my mistress. Follow my advice, it will
go well with thee. The old dragon is going to put a flower under thy
pillow as soon as thou hast gone to bed; now keep awake, take it out
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>under the pillow and put it on the pillow. Early
in the morning, before any one else is awake, put it back under the
pillow, and nothing will happen to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did as the dog had told her. She took the flower from under
her pillow, and kept it on her pillow all through the night, and put it
back again early in the morning. The old woman afterwards took the
flower out; she found it was even fresher than it had been the night
before. So she told her son that he must be mistaken. His companion
could not be a maiden. He persisted in his belief despite of it, and so
the woman said to him, &ldquo;Go and ask your companion to bathe, and
if he is eager to do so, be sure it is not a girl; but if he makes any
difficulties, you will know that you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog, who knew of the plotting of the old woman, told the girl to
put on a pleasant face, and not to hesitate to go to the river with her
companion, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no sooner will you be
near the water than I will get among the flock, and so you will have to
jump up and run after the sheep, and there will be no more question of
bathing.&rdquo; As the dog said, so he did, and again the young man did
not know what to make of his companion. The mother then told him to go
with his companion to the forest, and to find a big tree, and to ask
his companion what it would be good for. If he replied for distaff and
spindle, then it is a girl; but if he answered it was good to make
carts out of, then it was a boy.&rdquo; So he took her into the forest,
and, finding a big tree, he asked her what could be best made out of
the wood. The girl replied &ldquo;carts.&rdquo; When the girl saw that
the boy troubled her too much, she went to the sea-shore, and, smiting
the waves with her shepherd&rsquo;s staff, she rent the waters in
twain, and passed dryshod with her flock and dog to the other shore of
the sea. The other shepherd&mdash;the demon&mdash;came to the sea-shore
just when she had already passed over to the other side. She removed
her fur cap, and her long golden hair fell down to her knees. Then she
moved her wand, and the waters again closed up. When he saw that she
had escaped him, he was very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>angry, and he went to his mother
and told her all that had happened. She said to him, &ldquo;Do not
mind; I will help you to get her into your hands.&rdquo; So the old
woman went to the sea and built there a huge ship. This she filled with
all kinds of merchandise, and told the young man to sail in it across
the sea, and try and find his beloved; and she told him how to get hold
of her when he had found her. So sailing along in the boat he got
across, and anchored near a great town. The people came out to look at
the wares which he had brought. The last to come&mdash;led by
curiosity&mdash;was the girl. As soon as he saw that she had entered
the boat, he set sail, and off he went. When the girl saw what had
happened, she recognised him, and, finding herself in his power, she
offered no resistance. But when they were in the middle of the sea, she
took off the ring which she had on her finger, and, casting it into the
sea, she said to him, &ldquo;From this day onward I shall remain dumb.
I shall not speak to thee until this ring is brought back to me&rdquo;;
and she kept her word faithfully. For many a year she lived with him,
but never spoke a word. One day her mother-in-law thought that it would
be better to get rid of her. As she herself dared not kill her, she
sent the girl with a message to her elder sister to bring her the sword
and the threads, knowing full well that her sister would kill her. When
her husband heard the errand on which she was sent, he came out
quietly, and, meeting her outside the house, he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you go to my mother&rsquo;s sister, she is sure to offer
you some food; take the first bite, and keep it under your tongue. Then
you may eat; otherwise you will be lost.&rdquo; The girl never replied,
but listened attentively to what he had said. So she came to the old
crone, who was ever so much worse than her own mother-in-law, and she
certainly was bad enough. As soon as she entered the house, the young
woman greeted her. Great was the surprise of the old woman, who said,
&ldquo;Now who is to believe my sister; she made that girl out to be
dumb, and now she speaks so sweetly. Come in, my child.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then she went out, killed a cock, grilled it, and gave it to her to
eat.</p>
<p>The young woman, remembering her husband&rsquo;s advice, took the
first bite and put it under her tongue; then she sat down and made a
hearty meal of the cock. When she had finished, the old woman said,
&ldquo;I do not have the sword or the threads; they are with my younger
sister. She lives not very far from here; you just go to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking leave, she went a little way further, and she came to the
second sister, who was worse than the other. She saluted her when she
came in, and this sister also said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is one to believe your mother-in-law? She made you out to
be dumb, and now you speak so sweetly and so nicely. What have you come
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;I have come for the sword and the
threads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and eat, my child,&rdquo; she said, and, going out,
she took a young lamb and killed it and prepared it for her.
Remembering the advice given to her, she put the first bite under her
tongue, and then she went on eating until she had satisfied her
hunger.</p>
<p>When she had finished eating, the old woman said, &ldquo;I do not
have that sword; it is with my younger sister. You must go further; she
lives quite close by, and she will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went to the third sister, and greeting this third one, who
was the worst of all and the ugliest of all, said to her, &ldquo;Sit
down and eat.&rdquo; Then she took out the hand of a dead man and gave
it to her to eat. But this the wife could not do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the old woman had gone up into the loft of the house,
saying she was going to fetch the spade, but in reality to watch the
young woman to see what she was doing.</p>
<p>When she was left alone, she took the hand and threw it under the
hearth. Then came a voice from the loft crying. &ldquo;Hand, hand,
where art thou?&rdquo; and from under the hearth the hand replied,
&ldquo;Here I am under the hearth.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>So she turned on the
young woman and said, &ldquo;You eat this or something worse will
happen to you; I am going to eat you.&rdquo; She was very frightened;
so she took it and put it in her bosom under her girdle. And again the
old woman cried, &ldquo;Hand, hand, where art thou?&rdquo; and the hand
replied, &ldquo;I am under her heart.&rdquo; The old witch thought that
she had eaten it, and coming down, she brought the sword and gave it to
her together with the threads. Before she left, the old witch asked her
to give her back the hand; so she put her hand in her bosom, and drew
out the dead hand and gave it back to her. And so she had to let her go
in peace, as she had retained nothing.</p>
<p>Then, coming to the other sister, this one said to her, &ldquo;Give
me back my lamb.&rdquo; The young woman heaved, and out came the little
lamb quite alive and started frolicking through the house. It was
because she had kept the first bite under her tongue. She therefore had
to let her go unharmed. Then she came to the eldest one. And she said
to her, &ldquo;Give me back my cock,&rdquo; and then the young woman
spat, and out came the cock, running and crowing through the house. And
so she came back to her own house with the sword and the threads.</p>
<p>Shortly before she had come, some fishermen had caught a large
number of fish, among them a huge fish which her husband had bought.
When he opened that fish, he found the ring which his wife had cast
into the sea. So, full of joy, he ran out to meet her and to give her
the ring. He embraced her with one hand, and with the other, which was
full of the blood of the fish, he stroked her chin gently, saying to
her, &ldquo;O my dear little girl, here is thy ring.&rdquo; No sooner
had he spoken these words, when the woman was changed into a bird with
a red breast, the mark of the blood stains on her chin; then, breaking
a pane of the window (lit. an eye of the window), she flew away. Her
husband tried to catch hold of her, but he only got hold of the middle
feathers of the tail, which remained in his hand. The bird flew away.
The young woman had become a swallow. For that reason the tail looks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>like two prongs of a fork, for the middle part
was plucked out by the husband in his attempt to catch her.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In this legend we have a combination of many tales. The central
incident of the magical ring recovered from the depth of the sea inside
the fish, upon which the whole future depended, is somewhat obscure in
this tale. It is part of the Polykrates tale, but still more so of the
Solomonic legend, where the recovery of the ring means the recovery of
power by King Solomon. It is a curious romance, in which Solomon is
married as a poor man, <i>i.e.</i> in disguise, to a princess, for his
ring by which he was able to rule all the spirits and demons had been
cast into the sea by a demon and swallowed by a fish. From that fish
Solomon recovered it later on, and with it his kingdom and power. The
incident of the sword and the threads is an obscure episode. No doubt
it is a magical sword, by which the power of the ogre is to be broken,
and the threads are magical threads, by which he is to be tied and made
powerless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE SWALLOW LIVE IN HOT PLACES?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Swallow and Holy
Mother Sunday.</span></p>
<p>In another tale the swallow was originally a servant of Holy Sunday.
Holy Sunday, going to church, told her servant, whom she had left at
home, that she was to prepare the dinner for her, and that she should
take care that it should neither be too hot nor too cold, but just as
she liked it best. The servant remaining at home did as she was told;
she cooked the dinner, but forgot to take the food off the hob in time
to get it cool enough for Holy Sunday when she came home from
church.</p>
<p>When Holy Sunday came home and began to eat the food burned her
mouth, as it was too hot, having been left on the fire so much too
long. So she got very angry, and cursed the servant, saying, &ldquo;As
thou hast not done my will and hast burned me with the food, so mayest
thou now be henceforth a bird burned and frizzled up by the great heat
of the places and the countries where thou shalt dwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Holy Sunday spoken these words, when the servant girl
was changed into a swallow, and therefore it makes its nest in the
lofts of houses where it is hottest, and travels the countries where
the sun is burning like fire, frizzling up the inhabitants with its
heat.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Holy Sunday is here merely a Christianised form of some of the older
divinities, who did not scruple at the slightest provocation to vent
their feelings and to punish their sub-ordinates without pity and
without mercy.</p>
<p>It is not here the place to discuss the personification of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>the days of the week in the form of divinities.
They occur very often in Rumanian legends and tales, and are in most
cases described as choleric old women, spiteful and revengeful. On rare
occasions they are helpful. They resemble much more the three
<i>parcae</i>, Moirai or Fates of the Roman and Greek mythology and the
Norns of the Teutonic mythology, than Christian saints. That these
divinities are identified with special days of the week belongs to that
process of heretical teaching to which I have referred already, and in
which certain days of the week are endowed with a peculiar character of
sanctity; and the apotheosis has reached such a degree that they are
looked upon as real saints. And the swallow still is looked upon as a
more or less sacred bird. According to popular belief, swallows will
not build nests in bewitched or cursed houses; to kill a swallow is
considered a heinous sin, almost tantamount to killing one&rsquo;s wife
and children. As the people believe that the swallow was originally a
girl, they refrain from eating it. They consider it wrong to eat a
swallow. They are also called &ldquo;God&rsquo;s hens,&rdquo; and are a
sign of luck to the people where they build their nests. <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY IS THE DOVE A HOMING BIRD?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Bewitched Calf and
the Wicked Step-mother.</span></p>
<p>It is very curious that, so far, very few tales and legends have
been collected referring to the dove, a bird which plays so prominent a
part in Ancient Greek and heathen worship. I have not been able
hitherto to discover more than passing references to the dove in
legendary tales, nor is there anything in Rumanian folk-lore that would
explain the origin of the dove. There is only one legend, which is in a
way a distinct variant of the Cinderella cycle.</p>
<p>I will give it here briefly.</p>
<p>The beginning agrees on the whole with the usual type. There is the
bad step-mother, who has an ugly daughter, and persecutes the beautiful
daughter of her second husband. Among other trials, besides keeping her
unkempt and dirty and sending her out to feed the cattle, she gives her
one day a bag full of hemp, and tells her that in the evening she is to
bring it home carded, spun, woven into cloth and bleached. The poor
girl did not know what to do. Her father had given her a calf. This
calf was &ldquo;a wise one.&rdquo; So the calf came to the girl and
said, &ldquo;Do not fear; look after the other cows: by the evening it
will be all ready.&rdquo; So it was.</p>
<p>When she brought the white cloth home, her step-mother did not know
what to say. The next day she gave her two bags full of hemp, and again
the little calf worked at it and got it ready by the evening. When the
woman saw what had happened, she said, &ldquo;This is uncanny; no human
being can do such work in one day. I must find out what is
happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning she gave her three bags full of hemp <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>and
followed her stealthily to the field to see what she was doing. There,
hidden in a bush, she overheard the conversation between the little
calf and the girl. Straightway she went home, put herself to bed, and
said that she was very ill and was sure to die.</p>
<p>Her husband, coming home and finding her in what he thought was a
very sorry plight, believed that she was really very ill. She called
him to her bedside, and said, &ldquo;I know I am dying; there is only
one way, however, by which I can be saved, and that is to kill the
little calf and to give me some of its meat roasted.&rdquo; The poor
man did not know what to do, and he said to his wife, &ldquo;Why, that
is all that my little girl has, and if that calf is killed she will
remain with nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you like,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if you prefer a
calf to my life.&rdquo; The little calf, which was &ldquo;wise,&rdquo;
knew what was going to happen, and told the girl that the step-mother
was sure to have it killed, but she must not grieve. The only thing the
calf wanted her to do was to gather up all the bones after the meal,
and to hide them in a hollow of a tree not far from the field.
Everything happened as the calf had foretold, and on the next day the
woman ate as one who had been starving for a week, as ravenously as if
the wolves were fighting at her mouth. The old man also ate of the
calf, but the girl refused to touch the meat. After the meal was over
she took all the bones and put them in the hollow of a tree as she was
told.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the step-mother again put her to a trial. Going
with her husband and her own daughter to church, she left her at home
in her dirty clothes, and giving her a bag full of linseed and
poppy-seed mixed, she told her that she must sweep the room, get the
meal ready, wash the plates, clean the pots and separate the linseed
from the poppy seed.</p>
<p>Now the bones of the calf had turned into three white doves. These
came to her and did all the work, and told her at the same time to go
to the hollow tree; there she would find a carriage and pair and
beautiful clothes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span>waiting for her. She did so, went to church
in state, left before the others, and was at home to meet her people
coming back from church and found the house swept and clean, and the
linseed separated from the poppy seed. They spoke of the beautiful girl
who had come to church, and chided their poor daughter for staying at
home.</p>
<p>The second week the same thing happened. This time there were two
sacks of poppy seed and linseed which she had to separate. And again
the doves helped. And so on the third Sunday. The son of the squire,
who had seen her on the former two Sundays, tried to stop her on her
way out of church, and trod on her slipper, which was knocked off her
foot. She did not wait to recover it, but returned home as fast as she
could. The young man went round with the slipper to find the person
whom it would fit. When he came near the house, the step-mother,
fearing lest he see her step-daughter, hid her under a big trough
behind the door. When the young man, after having tried the slipper on
her daughter, whom it did not fit, asked whether there was another girl
in the house, and she replied, &ldquo;None,&rdquo; but a cock who was
standing by began to sing: &ldquo;O that old crone is telling lies;
there is another girl hidden under the trough behind the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, hearing the words of the cock, which the old woman
tried in vain to drive away, sent his servant into the house to find
out whether it was so. He lifted the trough and found there the other
girl, clothed in dirty rags and huddled up. The woman, seeing that the
girl had been discovered, said to the man, &ldquo;Do not take any
notice of her; she is a dirty slut and an idiot.&rdquo; But the cock
again sang out, &ldquo;O that old crone is telling lies; it is the
daughter of the old man, and she is very wise.&rdquo; The young man,
who was waiting outside, became impatient, and calling for the servant,
he told him to bring the girl out. He tried the slipper, which fitted
like a glove, and there and then he married her.</p>
<p>And this is the origin of the dove. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE RAVEN FEED ON CARRION?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of Noah and the
Raven.</span></p>
<p>The Rumanian story about the raven is more or less the well-known
story of the raven in Noah&rsquo;s ark as told in the Bible. But it has
not reached the people in that simple ungarnished form. It has been
embellished with legends. Those found among the Rumanian peasants agree
in the main with those told by oriental writers and found in
&ldquo;historiated&rdquo; Bible&rsquo;s&mdash;that great treasure-house
of legendary Biblical lore and the depository of many of the legends of
the past.</p>
<p>It is important to see how stories, the literary origin of which
cannot be doubted, have penetrated among the people and have become
actual popular legends. We can almost trace the way which they have
come. And this lends a special value to such popular Biblical
legends.</p>
<p>The story runs as follows:</p>
<p>The raven was originally a bird with white feathers. When Noah sent
out the raven to find out how things were in the world, the raven
espied the carcase of a horse floating on the waters which had begun to
subside. Forgetting his errand, the raven settled on the carcase and
started eating, and he continued eating for three days and three
nights. He could not get satisfied; only at the dawn of the fourth
morning did he remember the errand on which he had been sent, and
started on his return. When Noah saw him at some distance, he cried,
&ldquo;Why hast thou tarried so long, and what is thy message, and how
does the world without look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raven, unabashed, replied, &ldquo;I do not know anything
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>about the world and how things are going; I only
know that I was very hungry, and finding the dead body of a horse, I
sat down and ate, and now that I have had my fill, I have come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Noah heard this answer from the raven, he grew very angry, and
said, &ldquo;Mayest thou turn as black as my heart is within me,&rdquo;
for his heart had turned black from anger and fury. And from that
minute the raven&rsquo;s feathers turned as black as coal. And Noah
went on saying, &ldquo;As thou hast fed on carrion, so shalt thou feed
henceforth only on the dead bodies of animals and beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in order that the ravens should not multiply too quickly, it was
ordained that they should lay their eggs in December and not hatch them
until February, for only then, when the frost is so strong that even
the stones burst, does the shell of the raven&rsquo;s eggs split, and
the young are able to come out and be fed by their parents, for they
are unable to hatch them unless they are aided also by a hard frost,
which causes the shells to break. Otherwise, if they had laid their
eggs in the summer and hatched them in the summer, like other birds,
they would grow so numerous that people would not have been able to
defend themselves from the raven.</p>
<p>Moreover, the raven, when sent by Noah, saw only the peaks of the
mountains, and those have remained to this very day the real haunt of
the bird. They only nest in very high crags and peaks of mountains, and
never in villages.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Thus far the legend, which occurs in many variants. The raven, whose
peculiar appearance is well known, has become the bird of oracle
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. There are a large number of treatises
on the augury of the raven, notably in the Arabic literature, some of
which are traced back to Indian originals. As for the part which the
raven has played in Northern mythology, it is sufficient to mention the
ravens of Odin, not to speak of the Biblical legend according to which
the raven fed the prophet Elijah. (Another interpretation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>of
the word in the Bible changes the raven into Arabians, who fed the
prophet in his hiding-place.) There are some Rumanian popular beliefs
connected with the raven which I will mention here.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>If two or three ravens fly over a village and croak, it is a sure
sign that there will be death in the village.</p>
<p>If two ravens, one coming from the north and one coming from the
south, meet over the roof of a house, it is a sure sign of the death of
one of the inmates of the house.</p>
<p>It is an old saying that if ravens are seen flying in a great number
in one direction, it is a sure sign of plague or some death among
beasts and men.</p>
<p>If ravens croak over a flock of sheep, the shepherds keep a double
watch, for they believe the ravens foretell an inroad by wolves or
other wild beasts.</p>
<p>If a raven, meeting a herd of cattle, croaks, the Rumanian responds,
&ldquo;May it be on thy head, thy feathers and thy bones,&rdquo; for he
believes that one of his animals will die and become food for the
raven.</p>
<p>And, if one raven is seen flying over the head of a man and
continues to do so for a while, it is a sign of the death of that
man.</p>
<p>It is generally assumed that the ravens fly in pairs, and the
appearance of one alone is therefore ominous.</p>
<p>These few examples will suffice. They stamp the raven as the bird of
ill-omen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Young Maiden and her
Step-mother the Demon.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a widow who had only one child, a girl,
and all her possessions (goods and chattels) consisted of a flock of
sheep.</p>
<p>When the girl grew up, the mother sent her with the flock, and told
her at the same time to put on a man&rsquo;s clothes and not to speak
to anyone in the manner of women.</p>
<p>The girl did as she was told, and fed the flock for a long time. One
day, however, she was in the forest, where a young boy also fed his
flock. But he was not the son of man; he was the son cf the serpent
(dragon). How was she to know it? And even if she had known it, what
good would it be to her, seeing that she did not know what a dragon or
a she-dragon was?</p>
<p>Regarding him as a shepherd like herself, she began talking to him,
and the whole day they went together with their flocks. When the young
dragon came home in the evening, he told his mother, &ldquo;I think
that he with whom I spent the day is not a man in spite of the clothes
but a woman, but he does not seem to have a woman&rsquo;s voice. Would
it not be better if I brought him here, and you might then tell me
whether it is a man or a woman, for if she be a woman, I should like to
have her as my wife. I have not yet seen in the whole world one more
beautiful.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;bring him.
If he be a man, he will return safely from us, but if she be a woman,
then thine shall she be.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the next day, meeting the daughter of the widow, they fed their
flocks together, and in the evening, when they were to separate, he
asked the girl to spend the night at his house. The girl, not thinking
aught evil, and being somewhat far away from her own house, accepted
his invitation and went with him. What did the she-dragon do when she
saw her coming? She went out to meet her and engaged her in
conversation. Then she turned to her son and spoke to him, but in a
foreign tongue. She told him to put a flower under the pillow of his
companion, and if in the morning the flower will be faded, for sure
then she is a girl; otherwise the flower would remain fresh. So he did.
The girl, seeing that they talked in a foreign tongue, understood that
they were talking about her, and determined to watch and see. No sooner
had she gone to bed than she began to snore, as if she had fallen fast
asleep, but she did not sleep. Her hosts, thinking her fast asleep, got
up, went on tip-toe into the garden, and, taking a carnation in full
flower, put it under her pillow and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The girl, feeling that something had been put under her pillow,
understood that something was wrong. So she got up and took out of her
bag a charmed mirror by which to undo the sorcery of her hosts. No
sooner had she taken out her mirror, than the dragon-mother woke up,
and, running quickly to the bed, found the flower faded, to her own
great joy and that of her son. What was the girl to do now? She could
not deny that she was a girl. So she began to speak with a
woman&rsquo;s voice. The young dragon then insisted on her marrying
him, but she said, if he insisted on taking her she would neither speak
to him nor kiss him. The young dragon, more in a joke, took her in his
arms and squeezed her so tight that her face got swollen and her eyes
almost started out of her head. She then changed herself into an insect
and ran to the door to get out from under the threshold. But the old
dragon took a knife and slashed her across the body when she had crept
half-way out of the house, so that she nearly cut her in twain. Her
luck was that just a little flesh remained by which the other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>part of the body was kept hanging on, and thus
she has remained to this very day, for she became the ant.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The first part of this story agrees in the main with the first part
of the swallow story, No. 87. It is another example of the transfer of
a story from one object to another, like the story of the woodpecker
and the pelican. (Cf. also the slashing of the bee in the stories, No.
1 ff.)</p>
<p>Popular belief is that the ant is the grandchild (niece nepoata) of
God, and the handmaid of the Virgin, although I have not yet been able
to find the legend upon which this belief rests. The ant must not be
molested, for the Virgin sighs as often as an ant is killed.</p>
<p>The red ant comes from the tears shed by St. Mary over the grave of
Christ.</p>
<p>The ant is used as a remedy against toothache by boiling it together
with the earth of its nest and rinsing the mouth with the water (which
thus contains the well-known arnica of the pharmacopoeia). <span class=

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE CUCKOO CALL &ldquo;CUCKOO&rdquo;?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the two Brothers and
King Alexander.</span></p>
<p>In the time of Alexander the Great, King of Macedon, there lived a
very wealthy man who had two sons, each one more beautiful than the
other, and both more beautiful than any other living being. When they
grew up to be twelve years old, the fame of their beauty had reached
the Court of King Alexander. He was told that no young men so beautiful
as they were could be found over nine seas and nine countries.
Alexander went himself to see them, and no sooner had he seen them than
he appointed them captains in his army, for he was a high and mighty
king, and he liked to have in his army valiant knights like
himself.</p>
<p>At that time there lived the dog-headed people, who were human from
the waist down and dogs from their waist upward. Their kingdom
stretched far away to the north of Alexander&rsquo;s realms. Every year
the king of the dog-men and his people made incursions into the
countries, and, capturing many women, carried them away. The men they
fattened, and, after killing them, used to eat them, but the beautiful
women they brought to their king to become his wives. They treated the
men just as we treat our animals, which we fatten to kill and eat.</p>
<p>When Alexander saw that these wild dog men would not give him peace,
he decided to make war upon them, and to free the world of such wild
creatures. But to fight with these dog-men was not an easy task, and he
therefore selected the best men among his host, all seasoned warriors,
and he put the best captains over them. Among these were also the two
brothers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>one of whom was called Cuckoo and the other
Mugur. Wherever they went they did wonders. The heads of the dog-men
fell before the strokes of their swords like the grass cut by the
scythe. The battle lasted for three days and three nights. On the
fourth, the two brothers captured the king of the dog-men and brought
him to Alexander. There they killed him. Then they set fire to the land
of the dog-men, and the fire burnt for over a month. It was so wide a
country that no one has ever known the end of it, and so these dog-men
were routed utterly and none were left; only their name has remained
behind. When Alexander saw the valiant deeds of these two brothers, he
appointed them leaders of his army. They had to be always near him, and
wherever they went and drew their swords, the blood of the heathen ran
like water.</p>
<p>Alexander had many wars with kings and emperors, and he conquered
them all. No one dared to stand up against him, for God had given him
strength, and he marched on to the ends of the earth; he was to become
king over the whole world and then die.</p>
<p>He went to the south with his army, passing through many desolate
countries, filled with wild animals and monsters, dragons and serpents:
wherever he went he burned them with fire so as to cleanse the world.
For months Alexander went on with his march, accompanied by the two
brothers and his army, for he had set his heart upon going to the very
ends of the earth. One day on their march they met a company of women
riding on white horses, one more beautiful than other, and there was
one who by her beauty outshone them all. She was dressed, moreover, so
radiantly that she shone like the sun. Alexander drew near, and he
asked them how it came about that they were riding such beautiful
horses, and where were the men?</p>
<p>To this the women replied: &ldquo;Ours is the country where the
women rule, the women take the place of the men and the men that of the
women.&rdquo; Alexander rested there for a while with his two
companions and his army, and they were well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>entertained by the women, who were more
beautiful than any known among men of this part of the world.</p>
<p>Among these there was one who was like the moon among the stars.
Cuckoo fell in love with her, and they became inseparable. Cuckoo
thought he could not live without her. Mugur, who was of a more
retiring nature, restrained his love and kept aloof from the women.</p>
<p>When the two weeks had elapsed which Alexander had appointed for him
to stay there, he broke up his camp and journeyed onward until the army
reached the gates of Paradise. These were guarded by angels with
flaming swords, who would allow access only to those who were pure and
sinless. When the soldiers beheld the beauty of Paradise they wondered
greatly at it, and some of them were desirous of entering it, and went
to the angel to ask his permission. Amongst these were Mugur and his
brother Cuckoo. Mugur went in front, Cuckoo followed with his beautiful
wife at his side. When Mugur drew near, the gate of Paradise was flung
open and he entered without hindrance. Cuckoo wanted to follow him, but
the door was shut in his face, and for his audacity he and his fair
companion were turned into birds, for no man is allowed to enter
Paradise with a companion.</p>
<p>Since then Cuckoo is continually calling aloud his name in the hope
that his brother may look for him and thus find him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This story is remarkable for its origin. We have here the popular
reflex of the famous Romance of Alexander, which had reached Rumania,
as all the other countries of Europe, in a literary form. The book has
been read for at least three hundred years, and it is extremely
interesting to see how deeply it has influenced the popular
imagination. What we have here is not one incident only from the
&ldquo;Romance,&rdquo; but practically an abridged recital of the
famous &ldquo;Journey to Paradise,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s
Letter to Aristotle.&rdquo; We have here his wars with the
Kynokephaloi, or the people who were believed to be human beings with
dog&rsquo;s heads. The Eastern Church, and no less the Rumanian, even
venerates a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>saint with a dog&rsquo;s head, Christophorus. In
the Rumanian monastery of Neamtz there appeared a &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of
that saint, in which the woodcut picture of the saint represented him
as having a dog&rsquo;s head. We have, further, Alexander&rsquo;s war
with the Amazons, and even the fact that he reached the gates of
Paradise. But what gives to this tale importance is that the
&ldquo;Romance of Alexander&rdquo; has become the tale accounting for
the origin of a bird. No doubt there must be some more detailed account
of this immediate fact, explaining a little more clearly the sudden
transformation of the cuckoo and his mate into particular birds. Here
it is described as a punishment for Cuckoo&rsquo;s audacity in
attempting to bring his female companion into Paradise.</p>
<p>The only point of resemblance between this and the Albanian tale of
Hahn (No. 105), is that Cuckoo was originally a man by that name, and
he was the brother of Gion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Armenian, the Cuckoo
and the Hoopoe.</span></p>
<p>A funny story about the hoopoe and the cuckoo is told by the
Rumanians at the expense of the Armenians. It is said that in olden
times the forefather of the Armenians had to flee for his life. So,
taking all his belongings with him, and mounting on a horse, he rode
away as fast as he could. He feared lest his enemies would overtake
him. Riding on, he came to a forest and, not being able to find the
way, he got into a bog. In vain did he try to get his horse up again.
The more he tried the further it sank; so, taking all his belongings,
he dismounted, and wading through the mud, he sat down at the edge of
the bog and thought all the time what was he to do to get his horse
out. He could not carry all his belongings, and, if he tarried much
longer where he was, his enemies were sure to overtake him. Where he
sat, there was a cuckoo, resting on the tree, and singing all the time,
but the more he sang the deeper the horse seemed to sink into the mire.
He took some food out of his bags, and, showing it to the horse, he
tried to tempt it, but the horse paid no attention to him. Whilst he
was now in great despair, there came a hoopoe and sat on another tree
and began to cry &ldquo;Hoop, Hoop.&rdquo; No sooner did the horse hear
the bird shouting &ldquo;hoop, hoop,&rdquo; than up it jumped as if
stung by wasps. Overjoyed, the Armenian got hold of it, and putting his
food into his sack he mounted again and went on his way. And out of
gratitude the Armenians call the hoopoe to this very day by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>the name of cuckoo, for he saved their ancestor
by his cry &ldquo;up, up.&rdquo; The cuckoo had made it lie down by
singing &ldquo;coo, coo,&rdquo; but the hoopoe made it jump up by
singing &ldquo;up, up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some beliefs attached to the cry of the hoopoe forming
part of that great section of prognostications by the cry of the birds.
It is not, however, considered as an ominous bird. It merely foretells
the fruitfulness or the barrenness of the coming year. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE PARTRIDGE, THE FOX AND THE
HOUND.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a partridge, and that
partridge was sorely troubled, for no one in this world is safe from
trouble and worry. Her trouble was that for some time back she was not
able to rear her young, because of AUNTIE FOX, who made a royal feast
of the young brood. No sooner did the fox find out that the partridge
had hatched her young, than she tied some brambles to her tail, and,
dragging it along the ground, pretended to plough the land, close to
the place where the partridge had her nest. Turning to the partridge,
the fox would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you trespass on my land. Off you go, lest I eat you
up.&rdquo; The partridge, frightened, would run away, and the fox would
eat the young. This had gone on for three years. On the fourth year it
so happened that, while the partridge was weeping, just as a man will
do out of worry and grief, she met a hound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with thee, friend; why dost thou weep so,
what ails thee, why art thou so inconsolable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; said the poor bird, &ldquo;I am full of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the hound said sympathetically, &ldquo;What has happened unto
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened unto me? O! dear friend, so many years have
I tried to rear my young, and no sooner do I see God&rsquo;s blessing
when auntie fox, with the brambles and thorns trailing behind her tail,
comes and claims the land, and says, &lsquo;Hast thou again hatched
young on my land? Get thee off lest I eat thee.&rsquo; And I am so
frightened that I run away, and the fox then takes the family and
leaves me childless.&rdquo; The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>bird stopped here and looked
despairingly at the hound. She wondered what he could do for her. But
no one knows whence help may come, and just when it is least expected
it comes. And so it happened to the bird. The dog who had been sitting
all the time, listening as it were with half-closed ears, suddenly
shook himself and said, &ldquo;Is that the trouble which ails
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is my trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that be so, let me come with thee, and may be that I
shall be of some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they both went to the nest of the partridge. There the dog
crouched behind the bushes and waited for the fox to come. He had not
to wait very long until the fox came with the brambles tied to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6886" title="Source: his">her</span> tail,
and, pulling it along, made pretence of ploughing the land. &ldquo;Now
then you partridge, are you trespassing again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fox was not allowed to finish the sentence, for out of the
bushes sprang the dog. The fox took to her legs, running as fast as
they would carry her. Now, whether the hound ran or did not run I do
not know, but I certainly can say that the fox ran for all she was
worth and raised a cloud of dust behind her. And so she ran and ran
until she reached her lair, and she buried herself deep in the ground,
very thankful to have saved her skin from the jaws of death. The hound,
wearied, tired, and vexed that the fox had escaped, settled down at the
mouth of the lair waiting for the chance that the fox would come out
again, that he might set his eyes upon her, but it was all in vain, for
the fox, once safe, never dreamt of coming out again. But then the fox,
having nothing else to do, started talking to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever fox, clever fox, I know that thou takest care of thy
skin. Well, thou didst well to save thyself, and to get safely away
from that hound. Now let me ask my eyes, &lsquo;What did you do when
the hound was after me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we, turning right and left, looked out to see which way
we could save thee and hide thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear eyes,&rdquo; said the fox, and full of satisfaction, she
stroked them with her paws. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will ask my forelegs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye, my forelegs, what did you do when the hound was
chasing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did we do? We ran as fast as we could to carry thee safe
to the lair and to save thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, then, my darlings,&rdquo; and she kissed them and
stroked them lovingly.</p>
<p>Then she asked the hind legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do when the hound was chasing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did we do? We raised the dust and threw it into his eyes
to save thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darlings,&rdquo; again the fox said, and licked them and
caressed them, &ldquo;so must you always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox, having nothing else to do, said, &ldquo;I must now ask
thee, tail, &lsquo;What didst thou do, O my tail?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, what was I to do? I waddled to the right and left and yet
he never caught me. If it were not for the legs, I am afraid I should
not see the sun any more, and neither wouldst thou, O fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As thou sayest, then, thou art the only one who did not help
me, thou art mine enemy, for if it were not for the blessed legs, none
of us would have seen the sun any more. All right, out thou goest, thou
fool. Thou must no longer be with me or with my darling eyes.&rdquo;
And, turning round, <span class="corr" id="xd21e6922" title=
"Source: he">she</span> crawled backwards and pushed it out of the
lair. The hound, who was sitting outside, was just waiting for this,
and no sooner did he see the bush of the tail coming out than he
pounced on it and, getting hold of it, he pulled with all his might and
dragged out tail and fox together. And that was the end of the fox. The
fox may have been very clever, but the old proverb is true. &ldquo;Each
animal dies through his own tongue.&rdquo; And since that time the
partridge hatches her young unmolested, and the land of the fox has
remained unploughed.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This Rumanian tale belongs to a large cycle of similar tales, of
which the Rumanian seems to have preserved only the first part, unless
the second part has afterwards been tacked on to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>it.
In the extended tale the dog asks for the payment of the food, drink,
and merriment which the bird had promised.</p>
<p>An almost identical story is found among the <i>Slavonic Tales</i>,
Krauss, No. 9. In this no mention is made of the fox claiming to be the
landowner. It is only out of pity for the partridge that the dog
attacks the fox, which runs away, and then the story continues exactly
like the Rumanian. The first part of No. 6 is another parallel to the
Rumanian tale, but it is greatly reduced and is only the first part of
a much longer tale of &ldquo;The Starling, the Fox, and the
Dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starling promises the dog food, drink, and merriment, if he
would avenge it against the fox, who, in spite of sworn friendship, had
taken advantage of the absent starling to eat the young birds. The tale
contains also the episode of the fox&rsquo;s undoing. But then the
Slavonic story goes on to detail the manner in which the starling
outwitted a boy who carried food to his people on the field, a man who
carried a wine cask, and a hewer of wood, all to provide for the
promised food, drink, and merriment of, the dog.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE PARTRIDGE AND HER YOUNG.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A partridge once built her nest in the furrows of a
newly ploughed cornfield, and hatched her young when the stalks of the
corn had grown tall and the corn began to ripen. There was food in
plenty and safety enough for them to play and to frolic about without
fear of any danger. But the good things in this world never stay long
with us, and this the partridge was soon to find out. The time came
when the corn was cut and hunters appeared followed by their dogs,
whose barking they could hear drawing nearer and nearer. The partridge
now began to be frightened for her young. She tried to cover them with
her wings, but they could not help hearing the reports of the guns and
the barking of the dogs. One day, not being able to stand the strain
any longer, she remembered a place of safety which she had known, in
the cleft of a mountain beyond the seas. Tucking her eldest under her
wing, she started one morning on her flight, intent on carrying it to
the mountain beyond the sea. When she reached the border of the sea
there stood a huge tree. Tired from her long flight, she settled on one
of the branches of the tree overhanging the water. And she said to her
young, &ldquo;Little darling, see how great is the love of a mother and
what trouble I am taking. Nay, I am putting my life in danger in order
to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, mother,&rdquo; replied the little one,
&ldquo;Wait till we grow up and then we will take care of you when you
grow old and weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the partridge heard these words she tilted her wing and let the
young bird fall into the water of the sea, where it was drowned.
Distressed, weary, and lost in thought, she returned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>to
her nest and took the middle one of her three young, and, putting it on
the wing, she started again on her flight to the mountain beyond the
sea. On the way she again alighted on the tree with the branches
overhanging the sea. And she spoke to this one in the same manner as
she had spoken to the first. And he replied, &ldquo;Do not worry,
mother, when you get old we shall take care of you and show you our
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partridge, grieving at the words of this one, again dipped her
wing and the young bird slid down into the bottom of the sea, where it
was drowned. Almost broken hearted, not knowing any more what to do
with herself, and heavy with sorrow and anxiety, her only hope being
the youngest one, she returned to her nest, and, taking the
youngest&mdash;the mother&rsquo;s pet&mdash;she tucked it under her
wing and flew again to the mountain beyond the sea.</p>
<p>Tired from her continual flight hither and thither, she again
alighted on the tree with the branches overhanging the sea, and with
her heart trembling within her for fear and love, she said to the
youngest, &ldquo;See, my beloved little pet, how much trouble mother is
taking to save her dear little ones, how willingly I am suffering pain
and fatigue; see how exhausted I am and wearied, but nothing is too
much for a mother if only she knows that her young will be
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not worry, mother dear, for we when we grow up will also
take care of our young children with the same love and
devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the mother pressed the little one nearer to her
heart, and, full of joy, carried him across the sea to a place of
safety, for of all her children this alone had spoken the truth. And is
it not so in the world?</p>
<p>This is the story of the partridge and her young. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE LARK AND THE TAMING OF WOMEN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man was once ploughing his field. In the midst of it
a lark had made her nest and was hatching her young. When the cock lark
saw what the man was doing, and that he was coming nearer and nearer
with the plough, he feared that the nest would be destroyed. So he
turned to the man and said, &ldquo;Prithee, spare my nest; go round it
with your plough and do not touch it, for I might also do you some
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, surprised at hearing the lark speak to him, said,
&ldquo;What good can you do to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the lark, &ldquo;you never know what I can
do. Just bide your time, there might be a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I do not mind going with my
plough round that piece of ground, it will not make much difference,
but you see I have a very bad-tempered wife, and should she come out
and see what I have done, and that I have left a part of the field
without ploughing it, I shall come in for a good hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the lark, &ldquo;you a man, and your wife,
a woman, beating you, how can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;you do not know her; from
morning till evening she does nothing but strike and beat me, I have
not a minute&rsquo;s rest and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; replied the lark, &ldquo;if only you
will do what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will help me I shall be for ever grateful to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, this is what you have to do. You get yourself a
stout stick, and should she come and start chiding you, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>you
just lay out and go for her without mercy. You will see it will be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst they were thus speaking, the woman came out, with one jaw on
earth and the other in heaven, spitting fire and fury; and when she saw
that the man had left a part of the field not ploughed she started to
go for him with her fists and to give him a good beating. But before
she had time to get to him, remembering the advice which the lark had
given him, he got hold of the stick, and there was a great change. The
woman did not know what it was that happened to her; the blows fell
upon her fast and thick over her head, face, shoulders, hands. At last
she got frightened, and ran away vowing vengeance. After she had gone,
the lark said to the man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, I know she awaits you at home with a
long stick, but you get yourself a short, stout stick, and just slip
into the house before she has time to use her long rod, and then you go
for her, hitting as fast as you can and as hard as you can, for, being
in the house, the woman will not be able to use the long rod to any
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man did as the lark had taught him, and the woman came in for a
drubbing she never expected. The tables were now turned, and instead of
beating the husband the woman got it now, and twice over.</p>
<p>That was the first case of the men beating their women, instead of
the men being beaten by the women, for the neighbours, seeing how
things had changed with this man, soon followed his example, and there
was yelling and shouting and cursing as never before, the women getting
the worst.</p>
<p>When the women saw that the men got the upper hand, they all
gathered together in the market-place and held a conference under the
leadership of the head woman of the town. After a long consultation and
discussion, they all decided to leave their husbands alone and to get
across the Danube to the other side.</p>
<p>So they did; they gathered themselves together and, led by the head
woman, left the town to go across the Danube. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>When
the men saw what the women were doing, and that they were in earnest,
they turned on the first man who had set the example and threatened to
kill him, for he had brought all that trouble upon them. And the man
got frightened and ran out into the field, and going to the lark told
all that was going on and that he was in danger of his life.</p>
<p>The lark laughed and said, &ldquo;Oh, you are worse than a set of
old women. Do not be afraid, nothing will happen to you; you just wait
and see, I am going to bring the women home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the lark rose up in the air, and flying over the heads of
the women who were standing by the banks of the Danube waiting to
cross, it sang out, &ldquo;Tsirli, tsirli, on the other side of the
Danube there are no men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the women, hearing the bird&rsquo;s song, said to her
neighbour, &ldquo;Did you hear what that bird was singing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we can all hear it saying that across the Danube
there are no men, and if that be true I think we had better return to
our own husbands, never mind whether they beat us or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they all returned home quite meekly to their houses, and ever
since then the men beat their wives, but the women never beat their
husbands. And you should know that if a woman does beat her husband, he
is not a man, but a donkey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=

<p class="first">Of the turtle-dove the Rumanian popular poetry relates
that when she loses her mate she never associates with any bird, but
sits solitary on the branches of trees, not on the green or the high
bough, but on the low, and on the withered branches of the tree. She no
longer goes to clear water, but she first stirs the mud and then drinks
the troubled water, and when she sees the hunter she goes to meet him
cheerfully, hoping that he will kill her. The tears of the turtle-dove
are the most powerful antidote against every spell and sorcery.</p>
<p>An incident in one of the Rumanian Fairy Tales reminds us of the
story of the Shirt of Nessus given to Hercules.</p>
<p>It is of a step-mother who tries to kill her daughter-in-law by
inducing her to buy such a poisoned shirt. As soon as she has put one
on she becomes very ill, and her illness grows with every day that
passes.</p>
<p>Her father, who has been absent, comes home and sees what is the
cause of her illness, so he washes her in tears of the turtle-dove. The
spell is broken, the fire is driven out, and the young woman recovers

<h2 class="main">WHY DOES THE WREN HIDE HIMSELF?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Story of the Wren, the Eagle, and
the Owl.</span></p>
<p>The wren is called by the Rumanians the little king. The reason for
it is that the birds once came together to elect a ruler. They were all
there, big and small, and after much wrangling and discussion they
agreed that he who flew highest of all should be king. It was the eagle
who suggested it, for he knew that no bird could fly so high as he
could, and he told them that the highest place they could reach would
be the region of the wild winds. They arranged that he who would reach
so high, should give them a sign and then they should descend. They all
started for the race. There was much fluttering of wings and shrieking
and boasting, for every bird believed that he would be the winner. But
they had not measured their strength, for after a while the weakest
stopped in their flight and began to descend slowly. The stronger ones
flew a little higher but they too got tired and came down to the
ground, until at last almost every bird that had entered the race had
given it up. Only one bird was continuing the flight. It was the eagle,
who was soaring higher and higher. At a certain moment, the eagle
signalled to them that he had reached the wild wind, that is the wind
which blows very high up in the sky and is bitterly cold, much colder
than ice and frost. But the eagle was not to win the race. The little
wren, a midget among the birds, had crept stealthily under one of the
outer feathers of his wings; the eagle did not feel it, and so it was
borne aloft to the very high heavens. Now when the eagle stopped in his
flight, and began to descend, the little bird, not at all tired, came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>out from under the wing, and he, flying higher,
far above the eagle, shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! you thought you would be the king, that no one could
fly as high as you do! You see I have flown much higher, no one can
deny it, you can all see me, and though I am very small and light, I am
your king.&rdquo; The birds, hearing the little wren and seeing that it
had been flying far above the eagle, wondered greatly, but they could
not help themselves, they had to stand by their agreement, and so the
wren was proclaimed king.</p>
<p>But the birds soon learnt the trick by which the wren had outwitted
them, and furious at the way in which they had been played, they wanted
to tear him to pieces. The little wren, knowing what was in store for
him from the enraged birds, ran away quickly, and hid himself inside
the hollow of a tree, slipping in by so narrow an opening that no other
bird could follow him. When the birds found out the hiding-place of the
wren, and that they could not get at it, they decided to starve him
out, and put some to watch over the opening to prevent the wren
escaping. The wren thought it better to starve than to come out and be
torn in pieces. &ldquo;I will wait my chance,&rdquo; he said to
himself, and the chance came when they appointed the owl to watch over
the tree. The owl is a lazy bird, and sitting down quietly soon fell
asleep. That was just what the wren was waiting for, and before the owl
could have turned round, it was out and away in the bushes and under
the roots of the trees. When the owl awoke it found that the prisoner
had gone: catch him if you can! The birds, full of wrath, turned on the
owl for letting the wren escape and the owl had to run for its life. It
is for that reason that the owl never shows itself in day-time. It is
frightened of the birds, for they bear it a grudge for not keeping
careful watch over the wren, and as the wren knows what the birds have
in store for him, he hides himself under the bushes and trees and has
become a very furtive bird.</p>

Election of the King.</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time the birds came together to decide which was to rule
over them all, and in what order authority should be distributed among
them, who was to be the superior and who was to be inferior among them.
After a long discussion it was agreed that the eagle should be the
highest of all. The second in command should be the falcon, the third
in command the black vulture, under him the white vulture, under him
the vulture with the striped tail, under him the lamb&rsquo;s vulture
and under him the kite, under him the hen-harrier, under him the blue
heron, and under him the sparrow-hawk. All the birds consented and
accepted this arrangement without much demur or contradiction. Only the
sparrow-hawk, who though the smallest and the weakest, yet knew himself
to be quicker and cleverer than many of them, objected to the
arrangement, and said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect that I should submit to you? or be frightened
of you, as if you were the strongest and mightiest creatures in the
world? You are greatly mistaken. There are other beings stronger and
mightier and greater than you. Of these I am frightened, but not of
you. I do not care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what creatures are stronger and more powerful than
we?&rdquo; asked the other birds greatly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you do not know who is greater
and stronger than you are? You all think yourselves to be the cleverest
of created beings, and you expect me, the smallest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>of
you, to tell you that? Very well, then, since you do not know even as
much as this, hear it from me. Stronger than all of you are the archers
and the sportsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the birds, &ldquo;how can that
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if they meet you they can make
an end of you, and that, before you know where you are; you, who are so
clever, that you wanted to put me at the tip of your tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do to save ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sparrow-hawk replied, &ldquo;You must never gather together and
fly in large numbers, for thus we are sure to fall a prey to them. Our
only safety lies in our dispersion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the birds heard that, they dispersed quickly, and since
that time hawks are never found together in large numbers, except when
they see carrion. In such wise did the little sparrow-hawk free himself
from the domination of the other birds of his clan. <span class=

<p>This is the well-known story of King Log and King Stork.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time the frogs assembled and decided to ask God to
appoint a king who would guide them and rule over them, for they were
like a people scattered all over the waters and seas with no one to
look after them. God gratified their request, and taking a log of wood
cast it into the water and said to the frogs, &ldquo;This is to be your
king.&rdquo; When the log fell into the water it made such a splash and
such a noise, that the poor frogs did not know where to hide themselves
in their fright. After a while the noise subsided, and the log lay
still in the place where it had fallen. Gaining a little courage, the
frogs came out of their hiding places and crept slowly on to the log of
wood, which they found lying quite still and motionless. They waited
for a time to see it move, but in vain. So they went again to God and
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good of a king who can neither guide us, nor rule
over us, and cannot even move about to look after us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God said, &ldquo;You shall have one who will move about, and he
will guide you and rule you after the manner of kings.&rdquo; And he
called the stork and appointed him king over the frogs. He moves about
amongst them very fast indeed, and guides them and rules them in the
proper manner of kings, for he gobbles them up as soon as he sets eyes
on them in the proper manner of kings, who always go about and eat up
their subjects as fast as they can.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a stork who could not rear
any young. His wife&rsquo;s eggs had become addled, or something else
had happened to them, and the long and short of it was that there were
no young birds. Very distressed, he was walking about in the forest
when he noticed a little tomtit on the ground. Seeing he was so small,
he thought it was a young bird, a chick that had fallen out from a
stork&rsquo;s nest somewhere. So he picked him up gently and carried
him to his own nest, and there he kept him and fed him most tenderly.
He would fly about for miles to get worms to feed the little bird. The
days passed, and the stork could not help wondering why that little
bird of his did not grow: it remained so small. One day there came a
down-pour of cold rain mixed with hailstones. In order to protect his
little young, he put the tomtit under his wing, and going into the
forest placed himself under the branches of a thick-leaved tree to
shelter himself from the rain and hail. In the trunk of that tree there
was a little hollow. As soon as tomtit espied it he glided into it, and
from there he kept up a conversation with the stork. Among other
things, the stork said, &ldquo;What terrible weather that is, I cannot
remember anything like it all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; piped little tomtit, &ldquo;you call this bad
weather. You should have seen what bad weather means, when the red snow
fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, you little thing,&rdquo; said the stork, &ldquo;how do
you come to speak of red snow, you have never seen such a
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied tomtit, &ldquo;I remember it quite well,
although it was so many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember it, you little cunning beast, who made yourself
out to be quite a little chicken!&rdquo; and the sharp beak of the
stork pierced the hollow of the tree and spiked the insolent little
tomtit, who had made a fool of the stork. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The fable of the gnat and the lion is told in order to
explain the proverb, &ldquo;The gnat, small as it is, proved stronger
than the lion.&rdquo; Once upon a time a lion sat himself down to rest
under a tree. Suddenly a gnat appeared and settled upon his nose. The
lion, feeling the tickle, struck out with his paw, but missed her. The
gnat then settled in his ear, and again the lion tried to strike her,
but failed. So he said to the gnat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? and why do you come here and worry me? Who are
you that although so small can worry so much and give so much trouble,
and yet are one whom it is impossible to catch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the gnat, and I drink the blood of anyone I choose, and
no one can hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may drink blood from whomever else you choose, but my
blood you shall not drink, for I am the stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you believe that I cannot drink your blood, very well
then, let us wait and see who is the stronger,&rdquo; said the
gnat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite satisfied,&rdquo; said the lion, and they made the
bet. Without saying a single word, the gnat jumped on to the nose of
the lion, and digging its point into the flesh of the lion sucked the
blood until it was full, but the lion could not do anything to her.
When she had finished, she asked the lion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say now? have I not beaten you? Now it is your
turn to show me your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so strong that if a man should happen to pass here I
could eat him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when a boy happened to pass. The
lion, as soon as he saw him, wanted to catch him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>and
eat him. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the gnat, &ldquo;this is not yet a
man, wait until he grows to be a man.&rdquo; The lion felt ashamed and
let the boy pass.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards a very old man happened to pass. Again the lion,
saying, &ldquo;Now, a man is passing,&rdquo; wanted to get hold of him.
And again the gnat stopped him, saying, &ldquo;This is no longer a man,
he has been so some long time ago. It is a pity to break your teeth on
him.&rdquo; And the lion left him also alone.</p>
<p>Now there came riding along a hussar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a man,&rdquo; said the gnat, &ldquo;go for him and
show your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion went for him, but when the hussar saw him he drew his sword
and smote him two or three times over his head. The lion, seeing that
this was not a joke, turned tail and ran away; there was his road to
safety. The gnat, following him, settled on his ear and asked him how
he felt. The lion, half-stunned, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That foolish man drew a rib from his side and hacked lustily
away and had I not run away only bits of me would have been
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence the proverb, &ldquo;However small, the gnat proved more
powerful than the lion.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This is a parallel to the story of the &ldquo;Gnat and the
Lion.&rdquo; Among the South Slavonic Tales, (Krauss, No. 12) we find
another parallel to it, though differing in some details. A lion was
continually boasting of its strength. One day a tiger, tired of his
boasting, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait until you meet a man and see what strength
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, as they were walking, a young boy passed along, and the
lion asked whether that was a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the tiger, &ldquo;that is a man that is to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards an old woman passed, and the lion asked whether
that was a man. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the tiger, &ldquo;that is one
who has made men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last a hussar passed. The tiger said, &ldquo;This is a
man.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>The hussar drew near, shot at the lion, and, quite dazed, it ran
away.</p>
<p>The hussar overtook him, and drawing his sword wounded him in many
places. The lion escaped and said afterwards, &ldquo;When he blew at me
it was bad enough, but how much worse was it, when he pricked
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another version from the inhabitants of Transylvania is found in
Haltrich D. <span lang="de">Volksm&auml;rchen a. d. Sachsenlande i.
Siebbrgn, Wien 1877</span> (No. 86). Here it is the wolf who boasts,
and the fox tells him that there is something much more powerful than
he is and that is man. The wolf asks the fox to show him man. An old
man passes, the fox says, &ldquo;This was a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boy passes and the fox says, &ldquo;This is not yet a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hunter comes, and from behind the bush the fox whispers,
&ldquo;That is man.&rdquo; The hunter shoots at the wolf, then draws
his knife and slashes him. The wolf runs away and owns himself beaten
by the man, who makes thunder and lightning, throws stones in his face,
and then draws a shining rib and cuts away at him.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man was driving his buffalo to market. On the way
they passed a marsh. The buffalo, in accordance with its habit, went
into it and started wallowing. The man tried to get him out of it and
threatened him with his stick, but the buffalo took no notice.</p>
<p>There came a gnat buzzing by the man and saying to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wilt thou say if I drive him out of the
swamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied the man contemptuously, &ldquo;what can a
little midget like you do, when the buffalo does not care even for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the gnat, &ldquo;I will show you that I
can do what you cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, then, if you can.&rdquo; So the gnat went and placed
itself under the fold of the buffalo&rsquo;s belly, and stung him just
between the creases of the skin where the flesh was softest.</p>
<p>Up jumped the buffalo, and in a wink he had got out of the mire, and
was brought to the market by the man who owned shamefacedly that of the
two the gnat was the stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; hissed the gnat, &ldquo;didst thou see that I
could do with my little tongue, what thou with thy mighty cudgel
couldst not do?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE FIELD MOUSE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A mouse living in the town one day met a mouse which
lived in the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence do you come?&rdquo; asked the latter when she saw the
town-mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from yonder town,&rdquo; replied the first mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is life going there with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, indeed. I am living in the lap of luxury. Whatever
I want of sweets or any other good things is to be found in abundance
in my master&rsquo;s house. But how are you living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to complain of. You just come and see my
stores. I have grain and nuts, and all the fruits of the tree and field
in my storehouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The town-mouse did not quite believe the story of her new friend,
and, driven by curiosity, went with her to the latter&rsquo;s house.
How great was her surprise when she found that the field-mouse had
spoken the truth; her garner was full of nuts and grain and other
stores, and her mouth watered when she saw all the riches which were
stored up there.</p>
<p>Then she turned to the field-mouse and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, you
have here a nice snug place and something to live upon, but you should
come to my house and see what I have there. Your stock is as nothing
compared with the riches which are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The field mouse, who was rather simple by nature and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>trusted her new friend, went with her into the
town to see what better things the other could have. She had never been
into the town and did not know what her friend could mean when she
boasted of her greater riches. So they went together, and the
town-mouse took her friend to her master&rsquo;s house. He was a
grocer, and there were boxes and sacks full of every good thing the
heart of a mouse could desire. When she saw all these riches, the field
mouse said she could never have believed it, had she not seen it with
her own eyes.</p>
<p>Whilst they were talking together, who should come in but the cat.
As soon as the town-mouse saw the cat, she slipped quietly behind a box
and hid herself. Her friend, who had never yet seen a cat, turned to
her and asked her who that gentleman was who had come in so
quietly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know who he is? Why, he is our priest (<i lang=
"ro">popa</i>), and he has come to see me. You must go and pay your
respects to him and kiss his hand. See what a beautiful, glossy coat he
has on, and how his eyes sparkle, and how demurely he keeps his hands
in the sleeves of his coat.&rdquo; Not suspecting anything, the
field-mouse did as she was told and went up to the cat. He gave her at
once his blessing, and the mouse had no need of another after that: the
cat gave her extreme unction there and then. That was just what the
town-mouse had intended. When she saw how well stored the home of the
field-mouse was, she made up her mind to trap her and to kill her, so
that she might take possession of all that the field-mouse had gathered
up. She had learned the ways of the townspeople and had acted up to
them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This story reminds one of the story of La Fontaine, yet the
conclusion here is quite different. The popular tale undoubtedly
underwent a definite change in the hands of La Fontaine, who used the
fable for driving home a totally different moral lesson, just in the
style of all the fables so used since Aesop downwards. The popular tale
as told here <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>is perhaps more crude, but still much more true
to nature&mdash;a picture of life.</p>
<p>Hahn (No. 90) tells an Albanian tale where the fox goes on a
pilgrimage and becomes a monk, just as the cat in the Rumanian story is
a priest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=

decided to put an end to it. &ldquo;What is my life worth to me?&rdquo;
he said to himself, sighing heavily. &ldquo;The dogs tear me, the
wolves cat me, the eagles claw me, the man hunts me. I have no peace,
no rest, everybody is against me and wishes to take my life. I had
better go and drown myself, and then there will be an end to my
miseries.&rdquo; So speaking, he got up and went to the neighbouring
lake to drown himself in the water.</p>
<p>As he drew near he saw a number of frogs sitting by the water. When
they saw the hare coming up, they got frightened and jumped into the
water, some of them getting drowned in it. When the hare saw that he
had frightened the frogs to such an extent that he caused a number of
them to jump into the water and to get drowned, he stopped short and
said, &ldquo;If there are creatures whom I can frighten, then surely
even I am not the weakest of all, as I had hitherto thought.&rdquo;

GENTLY?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Race of the Buffalo and the
Hare.</span></p>
<p>In olden times, so we are told by those who know best, there was
constant strife between the hares and the buffaloes. Each of them
contended for the honour of being the most swift-footed.</p>
<p>Both did run very fast and neither would give in to the other. So it
went on year after year, and there seemed to be no end to the strife.
Tired of this constant fight, one day the hare said to the buffalo,
&ldquo;Let us try a race together and settle this quarrel once for
all.&rdquo; The buffalo was well contented with the proposal, and they
agreed to race one another. When the day came the hare, putting his
ears back, started the race. He ran so fast that you might have said he
was flying upon the ground.</p>
<p>But the buffalo was a match for him. He went thundering away, his
hoofs splashing the mud and raising seas of mire. The earth shook at
his furious tread. He soon overtook the breathless hare which was
running panting as fast as its little legs could carry it.</p>
<p>Then a thought struck the hare, and he cried to the buffalo,
&ldquo;Ho, friend! Take heed how thou art thundering along. The earth
is shaking, and if thou art not careful, the earth will give way under
thee. See how it is rocking under thy feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the buffalo heard the hare&rsquo;s story, he stopped still for
a while bewildered, and then, being frightened, lest the earth should
give way under him and he sink beneath, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>checked his pace and began to walk slowly and
tread gently.</p>
<p>That was just what the hare had wanted, and pulling a long nose at
the buffalo, he ran swiftly by, leaving the buffalo a long way behind.
Thus he won the race, and there was no longer any strife between the
hares and the buffaloes. But ever since the buffalo walks slowly and
treads lightly upon the ground. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"

pointer and setter could stand it no longer, and they went and lodged
their complaint before God. And God said, &ldquo;As they have treated
you so badly, you are free to go for them whenever you see them. You
must try and catch them and make them pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that is the reason why these dogs will go for the wolf as soon

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a mill a rat once lived and prospered. It took
after the miller, and from day to day its paunch grew bigger. It became
as round as cucumber and as fat as a candle.</p>
<p>One day, looking at his round, sleek figure, the rat said to itself,
&ldquo;Behold I am so beautiful and strong. Why should I not go and pay
a visit to God? He is sure to receive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. Leaving the mill, he started on his
journey to God. After travelling a few days and not coming nearer to
God, he stopped and said, &ldquo;Methinks that either God lives much
farther away than I believed, or I have lost my way. I will go to the
sun and ask where God is.&rdquo; Coming to the sun, the rat asked,
&ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; &ldquo;Off with thee,&rdquo; shouted the
sun, &ldquo;I have no time for idle talkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rat went to the clouds and asked them, &ldquo;Where is
God?&rdquo; The clouds stared at him and said, &ldquo;We cannot stop to
bandy words with the like of you.&rdquo; Away the rat went and came to
the wind. &ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; asked the rat.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; replied the wind, whistling, and getting hold of
the rat hurled him down into an ant-heap, and there he found his
level.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This story is a curious parallel to another series of rat or mouse
tales. In these a rat wishes to marry the daughter of the mightiest
thing, and asked for the daughter of the sun. But he is not great
enough. The sun is covered by the clouds. The clouds are carried by the
wind, the wind is stopped by the mountain, the mountain is sapped by
the rat, thus he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319"
name="pb319">319</a>]</span>comes back to his own and finds his proper
level. So in the Rumanian Tale (<i lang="ro">Sevastos</i>, Basme,
Moldov. p. 236). (Cf. Benfey, <i>Pantschatantra</i>, i. 375 ff.)</p>
<p>In an ancient Biblical legend Abraham discusses with Nimrod, Who
might be God? The sun cannot be worshipped as God, for the sun sets and
is followed by darkness, the moon is eclipsed by the sun, the fire is
quenched by water, the clouds of rain are carried by the wind, the wind
is stopped by the mountains, and so on. (Cf. Gaster, <i>Chronicles of
Jerahmeel</i>, London 1899, chap. xxxiv. p. 72 ff.)</p>
<p>The biblical setting of the legend is about two thousand years old.
In the Rumanian tale the comparison has disappeared, but the principal
elements have been preserved whilst invested with a different

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day the owl met a fox, and the latter bragged
about his intelligence and cleverness, and said that he was very
cunning and slim. The owl asked him, &ldquo;Brother mine, how many
minds (wits) have you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; he said, boastingly.
&ldquo;No wonder you are so clever, I have only one,&rdquo; said the
owl.</p>
<p>A short time afterwards the owl again met the fox, but this time he
was running for his life. The hunters were after him, and the hounds
were trying to catch him.</p>
<p>Running as fast as his legs could carry him, he at last managed to
slip into a hole. The owl followed him, and seeing him there,
exhausted, asked him, &ldquo;How many minds (wits) have you?&rdquo; And
he replied, &ldquo;Six, I have lost one by the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the hunters and dogs came nearer and nearer, so they could
hear the baying of the dogs. The fox did not know what to do. The owl
asked him, &ldquo;How many minds (wits) have you now, old
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have lost all my minds (wits). I have none
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your cunning of which you bragged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not kind of you, now, to go for a poor fellow when the
dogs are at his heels and there is no escape for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the owl, &ldquo;I have but one mind (wit),
and I will see whether I cannot save you with my one wit. It is my
turn. I am going to lie down here at the entrance as though dead. When
the hunters come, they will see me and get hold of me and talk about
me. Meanwhile they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"

trouble you just dash out and run for your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened just as the owl had said.</p>
<p>No sooner did the hunters come up and find the owl than they said,
&ldquo;What is this ugly bird doing here? and a dead owl to
boot&rdquo;; and whilst they were busy with the owl trying to get hold
of it to throw it away, off went the fox through them and escaped.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the owl met him again and she said, &ldquo;How have
your seven minds (wits) helped you when in time of danger? It is like
that with people who have too much, they often have nothing when they
want it most, but you see I had only one mind (wit), but a strong one

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE FOX AND HIS BAGFUL OF WITS AND THE
ONE-WITTED HEDGEHOG.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I do not know how he managed it, but a fox one day got
into a poultry-yard and there he ate his fill. Some time afterwards,
going along to the poultry-yard, the hedgehog met him. &ldquo;Where are
you going, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to eat my fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you cannot get it just as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you just come with me and I will
show you. I know my way, and there is plenty for me and for you, and
some to leave behind for another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hedgehog, who was a wise old fellow, said to the fox:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, be careful; are you sure that the owners of the poultry
yard will let you in again so easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble,&rdquo; said the fox. &ldquo;I know
my business, you just come with me.&rdquo; And the hedgehog went with
him.</p>
<p>But the people of the poultry-yard were not such fools as the fox
had taken them for, and just where the fox had got in last time they
had dug a deep pit, and into that the fox and the hedgehog tumbled.
When they found themselves at the bottom of the pit, the hedgehog
turned to the fox and said, &ldquo;Well, you clever fellow, is that the
proper way to get into the poultry-yard? Did I not warn you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good of talking?&rdquo; replied the fox,
&ldquo;We are here now, and we must see how to get out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are so clever, and I am only a poor old
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you were always a wise one. Can you help
me?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot help you. This sudden
fall has upset me, and I feel queer and sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried the fox, &ldquo;you are not going to be
sick here; that is more than I can stand; out you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he got hold of the hedgehog by the snout, and the hedgehog coiled
himself up with his little paws into a little ball round the
fox&rsquo;s mouth, the fox lifted up his head with a jerk and threw the
little fellow out of the pit.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw himself safely out of the pit, the little
hedgehog, bending over the mouth of the pit, said, chuckling to the
fox:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your wisdom, you fool? You boast that you have a
bagful of wits, whilst it is I who get myself out of the pit though I
have only a little wit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the fox, whining, &ldquo;do have pity on me!
you are such a clever old fellow, help me out of it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the hedgehog, &ldquo;I will help you. Now,
you pretend to be dead, and when the people come and find you stiff and
stark, and a nasty smell about you, they will say, &lsquo;The fox has
died and his carcase is rotting; it is going to make all the poultry
yard offensive.&rsquo; They will take you and throw you out. And then
see whither your way lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox did as the hedgehog had advised him, and when the people
came and found him in that state, they hauled him out and threw him out
of the yard on to the road.</p>
<p>Quicker than you could clap your hands, the fox was on his legs, and
he ran as if the ground was burning under him.</p>
<p>Since then the fox and the hedgehog are good friends.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>South Slavonic Tales, Krauss, No. 13.</p>
<p>A fox meeting a hedgehog asked him, &ldquo;How many wits have
you?&rdquo; And he replied, &ldquo;Only three. But how many have
you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; boasted the fox, &ldquo;have
seventy-seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking and walking along, not noticing whither they
were going, they fell into a deep hole which the peasants had dug. The
fox asked the hedgehog to save him. The hedgehog said, &ldquo;I have
only three wits, perhaps you will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324"
href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>save me first, then I will
see about you afterwards&rdquo;; and he asked the fox to pitch him out
of the hole. The fox did so, and then asked the hedgehog whether he
could help him. The hedgehog said, &ldquo;I cannot help you with three
if you cannot help yourself with seventy-seven.&rdquo; And so the fox
was caught in the morning by the peasants and killed.</p>
<p>In the Rumanian version, the hedgehog saves the fox by one wit and
puts him to shame, which rounds off the story much better; in the
Slavonic tale there is scarcely any point.</p>
<p>But this probably goes back to a more ancient legend referred to in
a Greek epigram, <i>v.</i> Benfey, <i>Pantschatantra</i>, i. 316.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE PEASANT, THE SNAKE, AND KING
SOLOMON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, when King Solomon the wise ruled
over the people, some shepherds gathered under a tree and lit a fire,
not for any special reason, but just to pass their time, as they often
do. When they left, they did not take care to put the fire out; it was
left burning under the ashes. Spreading slowly, it caught the great
tree, which soon afterwards became a mass of living flames. A snake had
crept on to that tree before and found itself now in danger of
perishing in the flames. Creeping upwards to the very top of the tree,
the snake cried as loud as it could, for she felt her skin scorched by
the fire. At that moment a man passed by, and hearing the shrieking of
the snake, who begged him to save her from the flames, he took pity on
her, and cutting a long stick, he reached with it up to the top of the
tree for the snake to glide down on it. But he did not know the mind of
the cunning beast, which had aforetime deceived his forefather Adam,
for, instead of gliding down to the ground, no sooner did the snake
reach the neck of the good man than she coiled herself round and round
his neck. In vain did he remind her that he had saved her life, she
would not hear of anything, for she said, &ldquo;My skin is dearer to
me than to you, and I remain where I am, you cannot shake me
off.&rdquo; Finding that he could not get rid of the snake, the man
went from judge to judge, from king to king, to decide between them,
but no one could help him.</p>
<p>At last, hearing of the wisdom of King Solomon, he came to him and
laid his case before him. But King Solomon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;I am not going to judge between you
unless you both first promise to abide by my word.&rdquo; Both did so.
Turning to the snake, King Solomon then said, &ldquo;You must uncoil
yourself and get down on the earth, for I cannot judge fairly between
one who is standing on the ground and one who is riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cunning though the snake may be, she did not understand the wisdom
of King Solomon, and therefore uncoiling herself she glided down and
rested on the ground. Turning to the man, King Solomon said, &ldquo;Do
you not know that you must never trust a snake?&rdquo; The man at once
understood what the king meant, and taking up a stone he bruised the
snake&rsquo;s head. And thus justice was done.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Needless to point out, that we have here a variant of the widespread
tale of the man and the snake. At one time the judge is King Solomon,
who looms largely in the minds of the people as the very type of human
wisdom, at another time the judge is a child playing at justice, who
induces the snake to loosen her hold on the man and is then killed by
the man, who finds himself suddenly freed.</p>
<p>In other parallels animals are appointed as judges and this leads to
the undoing of the snake. (<i>v.</i> Benfey, <i>Pantschatantra</i>, i.

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE DOG AND THE SNAKE AND THE CURE OF
HEADACHE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, I do not know how it came about, the
dog had a frightful headache, such a headache as he had never had
before. It nearly drove him mad, and he ran furiously hither and
thither, not knowing what to do to get rid of it. As he was running
wildly over a field, he met a snake that was lying there coiled up in
the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter that you are running about like a madman,
brother?&rdquo; asked the snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, I cannot stop to speak to you. I am clean mad with a
splitting headache, and I do not know how to be rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a remedy<span class="corr" id="xd21e7510" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; said the snake, &ldquo;it is excellent
for the headache of a dog, but it is of no good to me who am also
suffering greatly from a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind you, what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go yonder and eat some of the grass, and you will be
cured of the headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog did as the snake had advised him. He went and ate the grass,
and soon felt relieved of his pain.</p>
<p>Now, do you think the dog was grateful? No such luck for the snake.
On the contrary, a dog is a dog, and a dog he remains. And why should
he be better than many people are? He did as they do, and returned evil
for good. Going to the snake, he said, &ldquo;Now that my headache is
gone, I feel much easier; I remember an excellent remedy for the
headache of snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what might it be?&rdquo; asked the snake eagerly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite simple. When you feel your head aching, go and
stretch full length across the high-road and lie still for a while, and
the pain is sure to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the simpleton of a snake, and she did
as the dog had advised her. She stretched herself full length across
the high-road and lay still, waiting for the headache to go.</p>
<p>The snake had been lying there for some time, when it so happened
that a man came along with a stout cudgel in his hands. To see the
snake and to bruise her head was the work of an instant. And the snake
had no longer any headache. The cure proved complete. And ever since
that time, when a snake has a headache it goes and stretches across the
high-road. If its head is crushed, then no other remedy is wanted, but
if the snake escapes unhurt, it loses its headache. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF THE HORSE, THE LION, AND THE WOLF.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once lived a Sultan who had a charger. It had
served him most faithfully for a good number of years, carrying him in
many battles and on numerous other occasions.</p>
<p>At last the horse grew old and was no longer fit to serve him as
before. The Sultan, remembering its faithful services, decided to free
it from every manner of work, and in token of recognition of its
faithfulness he set it free to roam about and to feed wherever it
liked.</p>
<p>In order that it should not be molested, he ordered that a special
coating should be made for it of red cloth adorned with many coloured
stripes and patches. He also had it shod with steel shoes, which last
for a very long time.</p>
<p>So, covered with the king&rsquo;s cloth, the horse went about from
field to field eating whatever and whenever it pleased. Being now at
ease, the horse got fat again and strong, and when it walked on the
road, it struck with its feet against the stones and pebbles, and made
the sparks fly from them.</p>
<p>In a forest near by there lived a lion. One day, coming out to the
edge of the wood, he saw the horse in the distance, and as he had never
yet seen such a peculiar animal, he got frightened and started running
back into the thickest part of the forest.</p>
<p>There he met a wolf, who, seeing the lion run, asked him why he was
running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your life is dear to you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;do not
stop here talking, for that terrible beast which I have seen yonder in
the field is sure to overtake us, and then good-bye to us.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What beast?&rdquo; asked the wolf. &ldquo;I know no beast
that could frighten a lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, thank God that you have never come across
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a huge beast with a head so big as I have never seen a
head before, and a mouth so large that it could devour us in one bite.
As to its skin, I have never yet seen any like it, all red with stripes
and patches of every colour. It stands on huge feet, and whenever it
walks it scatters fire right and left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may all be as you describe it,&rdquo; said the wolf,
&ldquo;but still it might also be otherwise. I should like to see it
myself, and I might perhaps know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, let us go higher up the hill, where we can
look down on the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather see it from here, if possible, near at
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please. I will squat down on my hind-legs and lift you
up with my fore-legs, so that you can see some distance from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion did as he said, and taking the wolf in his fore-paws he
lifted him up. But whilst doing so he pressed the wolf so hard that he
nearly lost his breath, and his eyes began starting out of his head.
When the lion saw it, he said, &ldquo;You cur, you talk bravely and
laugh at me who have been close to that terrible beast, and you, who
are so far away and scarcely able to get a glimpse of it, you are
already losing your breath, and your eyes are starting out of your
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he threw the wolf down, and away he ran as fast as
his legs would carry him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This story reminds us of the framework of the famous Indian
Panchatantra, which had so successful a run through the literature of
East and West, becoming one of the most popular books of the Middle
Ages, better known as the story of Kalila and Dimna, or even falsely,
Syntipas.</p>
<p>In Krauss (No. 2) the animal which frightens the lion, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>rather imposes on his credulity, is an ass. The
ass makes the lion believe that he, the ass, was the real king of
beasts. The wolf, to whom the lion says that he was not the real king
but that another animal claimed the right to rule, listens
incredulously. The lion ties their two tails together and takes the
wolf to the summit of a hill, from which they can see the ass. The
lion, misunderstanding the exclamation of the wolf and thinking that he
said &ldquo;there are six,&rdquo; runs away as fast as he can, dragging
the wolf behind him and killing him in his mad flight. It is obviously
the same tale but slightly varied in the details. In the Rumanian the
lion never gets so near the other animal as to be undeceived by his own
sight. He merely sees from a distance an animal the like of which he
had never seen before, and he works himself up into a great fright.
This seems to be the more primitive form. In the South Slavonic, the
lion is simply deceived by an animal with which he ought to be familiar
enough.</p>
<p>A curious and corrupted version is found in Grimm (No. 132), where
only the tying of the tails has been retained. In this version the
horse is tied to the lion, and he drags the lion to his master&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>Similar is the story of the <i>dib-dib</i> (the name used by the
woman for the dropping rain), whom the leopard, who listens at the
door, takes to be a great monster. A man jumps on the back of the
frightened leopard, thinking it was an ass. The leopard carries him to
the <i>dib-dib</i>, and he runs away. He meets a fox, who laughs at his
fear, and they tie their tails together. The man, who had sought safety
in the branches of the trees, says that the fox had brought the leopard
to be killed. The leopard, who had distrusted the fox, runs away with
him, and as their tails are knotted together, both get killed.

<h2 class="main">THE MARRIAGE OF TOM AND THE VIXEN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived a very poor man who had a
wife and family, and there was also a tomcat prowling about the house.
One day a neighbour took pity on them and gave the man a handful of
flour of maize. Overjoyed he went home, and mixing it with water made a
nice dish. Pouring it out on to the plates, he and his wife and the
children sat round eating as much as they could.</p>
<p>Tom, smelling the dish, began to mew, and the father, taking pity on
Tom, said to the children:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Tom is starving too, give him some of the
<i>mameliga</i>&rdquo; (maize pudding). But they said, &ldquo;He must
have it in a better style. We will gird him with a sword round his
loins, and he will draw it and cut for himself as big a slice as he
likes.&rdquo; And so they did. But when Tom saw himself girded with a
sword, which clanked as he moved about, he said, &ldquo;I am much too
good for this family,&rdquo; and off he went into the world.</p>
<p>On his way he met a vixen, and she asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Sir Knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I am going to get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom replied, &ldquo;Yes, you are just as good as any other
bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went together to the vixen&rsquo;s lair, and a happy life
began for our friend. For the vixen went catching birds, rabbits, and
other animals, and bringing them home to feed her husband.</p>
<p>One day the vixen met the wolf. &ldquo;Hallo, sister,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;have you got a meal ready?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have and I have not. I am married now, and I have a soldier
for a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him,&rdquo; said the wolf; &ldquo;show
him to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I will show him to you,&rdquo; said the vixen, and
going to her lair called Tom, who came out and met the wolf. Tom came
out with his sword clanking behind him, and when he saw that huge beast
with his huge head, his hair stood on end and he began to spit and to
snarl for very fear. The wolf, thinking that Tom was getting angry and
ready to draw his sword and cut him up, turned tail and ran away.</p>
<p>Running very fast he met the bear, who asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you that you run so fast? Who is
running after you?&rdquo; The wolf told him all that had happened, and
how the vixen had got a mighty soldier for a husband, who killed
anybody who came near him.</p>
<p>The bear began to get curious and ran to the vixen&rsquo;s lair, and
the same thing happened to him, for Tom came out with his hair standing
on end, and growled, and snarled, and spat, shaking all the time with
fear. The bear ran away as fast as he could and came to the wolf, and
they discussed between themselves how best to get rid of that terrible
Tom, as their lives were no longer safe. So they called the hare and
the lion into counsel. These decided to invite the vixen and her Tom to
a banquet at which they would all fall upon him and end his career. So
they spread a table-cloth under a huge tree, but none had the courage
to go and call the guests. The bear said, &ldquo;Send the wolf,&rdquo;
but he replied he was too weak and they would catch him. The bear said
he was rather stout and heavy and they would catch him. So the trouble
fell upon the hare. He, poor fellow, could not help himself, so he went
with the message to invite them. But he did not venture too near. From
a distance he called out to them that they were invited to a banquet,
and off he went after he had delivered the message.</p>
<p>When the vixen heard the message she told Tom, and together they
went to the banquet. On the way Tom saw a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>crow on the top of a
tree, and, as is the way with cats, before one could turn round Tom had
climbed to the top of the tree and had caught the crow. He then killed
it, and threw it down on the ground.</p>
<p>The hosts, who were sitting at the table, saw what had happened, and
said to one another, &ldquo;Just see what that knight is doing. Even
the people on the very top of the tree are not safe from him. He
catches them and kills them. How then can we fight him on the
earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lion crawled under the table, the bear climbed up the tree,
and the wolf and the hare hid themselves in a bush.</p>
<p>When the vixen and Tom came to the place, no one was there, and they
wondered where their hosts could be. Whilst they were looking round,
Tom saw the tip of the lion&rsquo;s tail, and, thinking it to be a rat,
he attacked it. When the lion felt someone tugging at his tail he did
not wait any longer, but ran away as fast as his legs could carry
him.</p>
<p>When Tom saw that huge lion he got frightened and ran up the tree.
Now the bear saw Tom running up the tree, and he got frightened and
tumbled head over heels down the tree on to the table with Tom after
him, who, being frightened, ran into the bush. There the wolf and the
hare were crouching, hidden away. No sooner did they see Tom than off
they dashed in a fright. Tom ran back to the vixen, who was sitting at
the table thinking with great satisfaction how they had all run away
out of fear of Tom.</p>
<p>She embraced him, and they sat down alone to the banquet and enjoyed
themselves, no one disturbing them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In Krauss, No. 3, there is a story parallel yet not identical with
it. In the South Slavonic, a cat, together with a dog, a duck and a
gander, defeats the wolf, fox, bear and wild pig arrayed against them
in battle. Tom contributes most to the victory by sudden attacks on the
ear of the hidden pig, and frightening the bear in the tree by climbing
up in fear, etc. In other respects the stories disagree. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>The setting is entirely different. The wolf challenged to combat the
dog, who had betrayed him on two occasions, and each one brought his
contingent to the appointed place of battle. The dog brought his
friends of the courtyard, and the wolf his of the forest, and the
battle ended in the discomfiture of the latter as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Another version is found in Haltrich (No. 82), in which a cat feeds
on the carcase of a horse. It is seen successively by the fox, the
wolf, the bear and the wild pig, who get frightened by the sight of a
small, wild beast, which had killed an animal many times their size and
was eating it.</p>
<p>The cat runs after them by mere chance, and manages to bite the
pig&rsquo;s ear and frighten the others to such an extent that they are
still running, all except the wolf, who has fallen on a pointed stick
and got impaled.</p>
<p>Among the Cossack Tales (W. Bain, London 1894, p. 130 ff.) there is
a story similar, not quite identical. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">CXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF MAN AND HIS YEARS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When God had created the world, he called all his
creatures together to grant them their span of life, and to tell them
how long they would live and what manner of life they would lead.</p>
<p>The first to appear before God was man. And God said to him,
&ldquo;Thou, man, shalt be king of the world, walking erect upon thy
feet and looking up to heaven. I give thee a noble countenance; the
power of thought and judgment shall be thine, and the capacity of
disclosing thy innermost thoughts by means of speech. All that lives
and moves and goes about the earth shall be under thy rule, the winged
birds and the creeping things shall obey thee, thine shall be all the
fruits of the tree and land, and thy life shall be thirty
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then man turned away dissatisfied and grumbling. &ldquo;What is the
good of living in pleasure and in might, if all the years of my life
are to be thirty only?&rdquo; So did man speak and grumble, especially
when he heard of the years granted to other animals.</p>
<p>The turn came to the ass. He stepped forward to hear what God had
decreed for him. The Creator said, &ldquo;Thou shalt work hard; thou
shalt carry heavy burdens and be constantly beaten. Thou shalt always
be scolded and have very little rest, thy food shall be a poor one of
thistles and thorns, and thy life shall be fifty years.&rdquo; When the
ass heard what God had decreed for him he fell upon his knees and
cried, &ldquo;All merciful Creator, am I indeed to lead such a
miserable life, and am I to have such poor food as thistles and thorns.
Am I to work so hard and carry such heavy burdens and then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>live
on for fifty years in such misery? Have pity on me and take off twenty
years.&rdquo; Then man, greedy of long life, stepped forward and begged
for himself these twenty years which the ass had rejected. And the Lord
granted them to him.</p>
<p>Then came the dog. To him the Creator said, &ldquo;Thou shalt guard
the house and the property of thy master; thou shalt cling to them as
if thou wast afraid of losing them; thou shalt bark even at the shadow
of the moon, and for all thy trouble thou shalt gnaw bones and eat raw
meat, and thy life shall be forty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All merciful Creator,&rdquo; cried the dog, &ldquo;if my life
is to be of worry and trouble, and if I am to live on bones and raw
stuff, take off, I pray thee, twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again man, greedy of life, stepped forward and begged the Creator to
give him the twenty years rejected by the dog. And the Creator again
granted his request.</p>
<p>Now, it was the turn of the monkey. The Creator said, &ldquo;Thou
shalt only have the likeness of man, but not be man; thou shalt be
stupid and childish. Thy back shall be bent; thou shalt be an object of
mockery to the children and a laughing-stock of fools, and thy life
shall be sixty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the monkey heard what was decreed for him, he fell upon his
knees and said, &ldquo;All merciful God, in thy wisdom thou hast
decided that I should be a man and not a man, that my back shall be
bent, that I shall be a laughing-stock for young and fools and I shall
be stupid. Take, in mercy, thirty years off my life.&rdquo; And God,
the all merciful, granted his request.</p>
<p>And again, man, whose greed can never be satisfied, stepped forward
and asked also for these thirty years which the monkey had rejected.
And again God gave them to him.</p>
<p>Then God dismissed all the animals and all his creatures, and each
one went to his appointed station and to the life that has been granted
to him.</p>
<p>And as man has asked, so has it come to pass.</p>
<p>Man lives as a king and ruler over all creatures for the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>thirty years which the Lord had given to him, in
joy and in happiness, without care and without trouble.</p>
<p>Then come the years from thirty to fifty, which are the years of the
ass; they are full of hard work, heavy burdens, and little food, for
man is anxious to gather and to lay up something for the years to come.
It could not be otherwise, for were not these the years which he had
taken over from the ass? Then come the years from fifty to seventy,
when man sits at home and guards with great trembling and fear the
little that he possesses, fearful of every shadow, eating little,
always keeping others away lest they rob him of that which he has
gathered, and barking at every one whom he suspects of wanting to take
away what belongs to him. And no wonder that he behaves like that, for
these are the dog&rsquo;s years, which man had asked for himself. And
if a man lives beyond seventy, then his back gets bent, his face
changes, his mind gets clouded, he becomes childish, a laughing-stock
for children, an amusement for the fool, and these are the years which
man had taken over from the monkey.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Thus far the story which I found in some old Rumanian MSS., and
which may, therefore, not be quite of a popular origin. I have retold
it here because we have in it the animal in the man. It may be a
caricature, but it does not show up man to advantage in comparison with
the animal world. And yet, he is endeavouring to conquer the animal, to
shake off the fateful inheritance of greed, and to return to that rule
and kingdom which are his own by the grace of God to his thirtieth
year, and which he endeavours to carry even beyond that limited span of
time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=

BY BEAST AND BIRDS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a man dies two angels appear, the good one and
the evil one. The good one walking on his right, and the evil on his
left, each one holds a book in his hand in which man&rsquo;s deeds are
written. When the soul appears before the divine judge, there comes
first the cat accusing the man, and the cat says, &ldquo;He gave me no
peace all my life through; he put me to catch mice and I often remained
hungry. Then man drives me out of the house, and during daytime he
never lets me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking of? you should be ashamed of
yourself,&rdquo; is the rejoinder of the dog, &ldquo;you live in a warm
house, you have food in plenty, you have nothing to complain of. What
am I to say, who am kept out in the cold and rain, and have to watch
day and night, and if ever I get a bone thrown at me I think myself
happy.&rdquo; The judge replies: &ldquo;That is your work; to that you
have been appointed: off with you.&rdquo; The evil angel writes it all
down and puts the weight of guilt on the one scale, and the good angel
writes it in his book and he puts a counter-weight in the other
scale.</p>
<p>Then come the birds. First the wild duck. He says, &ldquo;O
unfailing judge, see how this man has ill-treated us, he comes to our
resting-place and shoots us down mercilessly.&rdquo; &ldquo;It serves
you right,&rdquo; is the reply of the judge, &ldquo;if you live as a
wild bird, you must be treated like a wild bird. You ought to be
domesticated and no hurt will befall you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the sparrow comes, and he says, &ldquo;O mighty Lord, this man
here snared us and killed us.&rdquo; And the judge replies,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>&ldquo;You have stolen his corn and destroyed
his crop.&rdquo; And other birds, like the finch and the thrush and the
heron, come, and all bring accusations against the man, and the evil
angel enters them in his book.</p>
<p>Then come the good witnesses. First the swallow, and she says,
&ldquo;O Lord, this man has been kind to us. We built our nest in his
house and under his roof, and he never as much as molested us, and even
when my young spoil the food, which he is preparing under their nest,
he <span class="corr" id="xd21e7725" title="Source: uever">never</span>
hurts them.&rdquo; Then the stork comes, he says, &ldquo;I build my
nest on the very roof of his house, and on his storehouses, and he
never interferes with us, and we hatch our young and feel no hurt. All
merciful father, have mercy on him, as he was full of pity for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the cuckoo comes, and he said, &ldquo;I who have been thy
servant pray thee to forgive his sins, for even to me he does no hurt,
and though I often announce death to him, he none the less listens with
pleasure to my call. Have mercy on him and forgive his sins.&rdquo; And
so the other birds come and ask the forgiveness of sin. And the good
angel writes it all down in his book and puts it as counter-weights in
his balance, and often the pleading of the birds opens the gates of
heaven to the human soul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conception which is here revealed is totally
unlike popular apocryphal Christian tales like the Visions of St.
Peter, Paul, and the Lady Mary, all well known in Rumanian literature.
Nor are there traces of the other set of ideas, originating probably in
Egypt, according to which the soul has to pass through many toll-houses
where angels and devils are waiting for it, and through which it can
only pass with extreme difficulty, if and when the good deeds outweigh
the evil deeds. The poem of the &ldquo;Pilgrimage of the Soul&rdquo;
has almost an heathen aspect. Noteworthy are the huge trees, at the
shore of the boundless sea, which must bend across it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>so
as to form a bridge for the soul to pass, and the three animals living
in it which threaten the soul with destruction. It reminds one strongly
of the Northern Ygdrasil, and almost the same beasts which inhabit it.
This is not the place to discuss at any length this tree upon which the
world rests, which no doubt goes back to, or is somehow connected with,
the tree of life in Paradise and the legends which have clustered round
that tree. This conception of the &ldquo;Pilgrimage of the Soul,&rdquo;
with its allegorical and mystical meaning, is certainly not a product
of the Orthodox Church. It reminds one forcibly of the fantastical and
poetical conceptions of the heterodox sects. <span class=

<h2 class="label">APPENDIX I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">RUMANIAN INCANTATIONS AGAINST THE ILLNESSES OF
ANIMALS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am adding here a number of incantations or charms,
which are used by the Rumanians to ward off evil from animals and to
save from hurt and disease such victims of witchcraft. In the mind of
the people, the old conception is still strong that every sickness is
caused by some malignant spirit, and that the most potent remedy is the
magical word of incantation or conjuration. And what holds good for the
cure of the Evil Eye holds good similarly in the case of a snake bite
or any other apparently incurable disease.</p>
<p>The Rumanians resort to magical performances of a peculiarly
symbolical and sympathetic nature. Those practices are accompanied by
&ldquo;incantations&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;disenchantments,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> chants used for the purpose of destroying the spell. This
is not the place to discuss at any length the history and origin of
these charms and the mechanism of their composition. I have dealt with
them largely in my history of Rumanian Folk-Lore (<i lang="ro">Lit.
pop. Rom&acirc;n&#259;</i>, 1883, p. 406 ff.). I have shown there the
similarity between some of these &ldquo;incantations&rdquo; or
&ldquo;conjurations&rdquo; with some Byzantine and medi&aelig;val Latin
charms, and not a few ancient oriental incantations of Babylon and
Palestine. In connection with the foregoing Tales and Legends, it is of
no small importance now to find that similar conjurations are used for
the protection of animals. The same procedure is followed as in the
case of human beings, and practically the same words and images are
used to free the cattle from sickness. In one or two instances (Nos. 2,
3) the cow is being bewitched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>and loses her milk, or the
calf does not suck. The &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; (Rum. <i lang=
"ro">mana</i>), the &ldquo;abundance&rdquo; or &ldquo;blessing,&rdquo;
is being taken by some witch, or is waning on account of the Evil Eye.
Even in these cases the formula is almost identical with that used in a
stereotyped form in human &ldquo;incantations.&rdquo; Each of these
given here could be made the starting-point of discursive explanations.
But this must be reserved for a special study of the Rumanian charms
and incantations. For our purpose here the translation accompanied only
by a few explanatory foot-notes, is quite sufficient. It proves that to
the Rumanian peasant, there is no essential difference between man and
beast. They are both treated alike, and even the Lady Mary knows no
difference between them. She helps the beast in the same manner as she
descends the &ldquo;silver ladder&rdquo; to help the man. And the evil
spirits, who attack man and beast with the same virulence, are driven
out by precisely the same method: charms and incantations.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Q.</i> Why did God create wasps and spiders which
are of no use? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>R.</i> Once upon a time David was sitting in his garden and he
saw a wasp eating a spider, and there came a fool with a stick in his
hand, and he drove them away. Then David said, &ldquo;O Lord of the
Universe, what benefit is there in these creatures? The wasp eats up
the honey and is destructive; the spider weaves the whole year and
there is nothing with which to clothe oneself; the fool only hurts
people, and he does not know thy unity and thy greatness, the world has
no benefit from him.&rdquo; The Lord replied and said, &ldquo;David,
thou dost scoff at these creatures now, but a time is sure to come when
they will be of use to thee, and then thou wilt recognise the reason of
their creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened thereafter, when he hid in the cave, being pursued by
Saul, a spider came and made his web across the mouth of the cavern.
Saul coming up, saw the web and said, &ldquo;Certainly no man has
entered this cave, as otherwise that web would have been torn to
pieces.&rdquo; So he went away without searching the cave. When David
came out, and beheld the spider, he kissed it and blessed it and said,
&ldquo;Lord of the Universe, who can accomplish works like any of thy
works? For all thy deeds are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came to Achish, David simulated the fool before him and his
men. The daughter of Achish also was foolish and mad. When they brought
David before him, he said to his men, &ldquo;Are ye mocking at me,
considering that my daughter is a fool, or am I in want of
lunatics?&rdquo; So they left him and he fled. When he found himself in
safety he thanked God for all that he had made, for it was all

<p>When David (had entered the cave) he found Saul sleeping his
noon-day sleep. Abner slept across the opening with his legs bent.
David tried, slipped through the legs, and went in and took the jug of
water. When he returned Abner suddenly stretched out and kept David as
in a hedge, as if two heavy pillars had come down upon him. Then David
prayed for God&rsquo;s mercy and said, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?&rdquo; In that hour a miracle was performed for him,
for a wasp came and stung Abner in his leg. He lifted <span class=

<p><i>R.</i> When the Israelites were going round Jericho with Joshua
in order to destroy it, they brought him successively a horse, an ass,
and a mule to ride upon, but they all died, for Joshua was a very heavy
man. Then they brought an ox and he carried him on his back. When he
saw this Joshua kissed the ox on his nose, and for this reason the ox
has no hair on that spot (f. 25a).</p>

<p class="first"><i>Q.</i> Why does the cat eat mice more than any
other creeping thing?</p>
<p><i>R.</i> In the beginning the cat and the mouse were friends. At
one time the mouse went and accused the cat falsely before God, and
said, &ldquo;Lord of the Universe, the cat and I are companions and we
have now nothing to eat.&rdquo; God replied, &ldquo;Thou hast brought a
false accusation against thy friend in order to be able to eat him. Now
the reverse is to happen, the cat will eat thee and thou shalt serve
her as food.&rdquo; The mouse replied, &ldquo;Lord of the Universe,
what have I done?&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;O thou unclean creature!
Hast thou not heard what happened to the sun and moon which originally
were of equal size, but because the moon brought a false accusation
against (slandered) the sun, I have reduced its size and made it
smaller than the sun? So also hast thou slandered thy companion in
order to eat him, and he therefore will eat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; the
mouse replied, &ldquo;then the cat will surely utterly destroy
me.&rdquo; And God replied, &ldquo;I will leave thee a remnant as I
have done to the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the mouse went, and springing on the head of the cat began to
bite it. The cat then threw the mouse on the ground and killed it.</p>
<p>From that time on, the fear of the cat fell upon the mice, and for
this reason does the cat eat the mouse (f. 25b).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Q.</i> Why is there enmity between the cat and the
dog?</p>
<p><i>R.</i> When the cat (weasel) was created it became the companion
of the dog. Both hunted together and ate together of the prey. It so
happened at one time that two or three days had passed and they had not
got anything to eat. Then the dog said to the cat, &ldquo;Why are we
sitting here a hungered? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>Go to Adam and sit in his house
and be fed there, and we will go after the creeping things and reptiles
and will feed upon them, and we shall both be kept alive.&rdquo; The
cat then replied to the dog, &ldquo;Let it be so, but we must take an
oath that we will not go both together to one master.&rdquo; He
replied, &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well.&rdquo; There and then they both
took an oath, and the cat went to the house of Adam, where she found
mice, which she caught and ate: the rest ran away from her. When Adam
saw what had happened, he said, &ldquo;A great salvation
(&ldquo;cure&rdquo;) has God sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took the cat into his house and fed it and gave it to
drink.</p>
<p>The dog went to the wolf and said unto him, &ldquo;Let me come and
spend the night with thee.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
Both went to a cave to sleep there. In the night the dog heard the
footsteps of the various animals, so he woke the wolf and told him,
&ldquo;I heard the steps of thieves.&rdquo; The wolf replied, &ldquo;Go
out to them and drive them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beasts turned upon him to kill him. The dog fled away and went
to the ape, but the ape drove him away. Then he went to the sheep. The
sheep received him and allowed him to sleep there. He heard the noise
of feet and he said to the sheep, &ldquo;I hear the footsteps of
robbers.&rdquo; The sheep replied, &ldquo;Go out.&rdquo; The dog went
out, and began to bark. The wolves said, &ldquo;Surely sheep are
there.&rdquo; So they went thither and ate the sheep.</p>
<p>The dog fled away and went from place to place trying to find some
shelter, but could not find any. At last he came to Adam, who took him
in and allowed him to sleep there. In the middle of the night the dog
said to Adam, &ldquo;I hear the noise of footsteps.&rdquo; Adam rose at
once, took his spear, and going out with the dog drove the wild beasts
away and returned home with the dog. Then Adam said to the dog,
&ldquo;Come into my house, dwell with me, eat of my food and drink of
my water.&rdquo; And the dog went with him. When the cat heard the
voice of the dog she came out to him and said, &ldquo;Why dost thou
come thither to my place?&rdquo; And he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>replied, &ldquo;Adam
has brought me hither.&rdquo; Adam said to the cat, &ldquo;Why dost
thou quarrel with him? I have brought him in, for I found him clever
and full of courage. Thou needst not grieve, thou shalt be kept also as
before.&rdquo; The cat replied, &ldquo;My Lord, he is a thief, is it
right to dwell in one place with a thief?&rdquo; And the cat went on to
say to the dog, &ldquo;Why hast thou broken (transgressed) thy
oath?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I will not enter thy dwelling place, I
will not eat of anything that belongs to thee, I will not cause thee
the least harm.&rdquo; But the cat did not listen and began to
quarrel.</p>
<p>When the dog saw this, he went away from the house of Adam, and
going to that of Seth, dwelt there. And the dog tried all the time to
make peace with the cat, but it was all in vain. In that state they
have remained to this very day, in constant enmity, for the children
follow the example of their forebears: as the proverb has it: sheep
follow sheep (f. 25b, 26a).</p>

used to eat yours, and what they did then I might as well do
now.&rdquo; With these words the cat sprang at the mouse wishing to eat
it. The mouse fled and sought for a hole to hide itself, but could not
find any. A miracle happened, and a hole appeared which the mouse
entered and hid itself. The cat came to the hole and tried to follow
the mouse, but could not, as the hole was very narrow. So she put her
paw into it with the intention of dragging it out. The mouse opened its
mouth. So the cat cut its lower chin open with its nail about half the
length of a span. When the cat had gone away the mouse crept out of the
hole and running to Noah said to him, &ldquo;O thou righteous man, do
me an act of charity and sew up the chin, which my enemy the cat has
torn open.&rdquo; Noah replied, &ldquo;Go to the pig and bring me one
of the bristles of its tail.&rdquo; He went and brought it to Noah, who
sewed up the chin. To this very day the seam can be seen (f. 26b).</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Once upon a time the raven saw how beautiful was the
stepping (walk) of the dove, more beautiful than that of all the other
birds. He liked the walk of the doves very much, and he said to
himself, &ldquo;I will also put my feet in the same step.&rdquo; And he
nearly broke his bones in the attempt to imitate the dove. The other
birds laughed and mocked at him. The raven felt ashamed and he said,
&ldquo;Let me return to my former walk.&rdquo; So he tried to walk as
before, but he could not, for he had forgotten it. Thus he remained
with a halting step, like one who is jumping, neither walking as
before, nor being able to walk as the dove (f. 26b). <span class=

BIRD?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Q.</i> Why does the raven mate differently from any
other bird?</p>
<p><i>R.</i> There are various explanations. One is that he has been
punished for his lewdness in the Ark, and for the same reason also the
dog has been punished.</p>
<p>Others say, because he is wicked, a thief, and froward. There is one
answer which combines and explains it more satisfactorily. When Noah
wanted to send the raven to see whether the waters were falling, the
raven fled and hid himself under the eagle&rsquo;s wing. Noah searched
after him and found him there under the wing of the eagle. He said to
him, &ldquo;Go, thou wicked one, and see whether the waters are
falling.&rdquo; The raven replied, &ldquo;Hast thou not found any other
bird but me.&rdquo; Noah replied, &ldquo;I can only send one of the two
birds whose first letter is either Ain or Yod.&rdquo; The raven
replied, &ldquo;Why not the eagle and dove&rdquo;? (Nun, Yod). Noah
said, &ldquo;Because there will be a town in existence called Ai
(<span lang="he">&#1506;&#1497;</span>) whose inhabitants will kill
Yair, who will forbid the raven (<span lang=
"he">&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1489;</span>) and permit the dove
(<span lang="he">&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;</span>) (to eat).&rdquo;
Then the raven replied impudently to Noah, &ldquo;The reason why thou
hast chosen to send me out is that thou wishest to kill me in order to
marry my mate, as I belong to those birds of which thou hast introduced
into the Ark only one pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Noah heard these words, he cursed the raven that he should mate
differently from any other bird, and all the birds in the Ark replied
Amen. Then the raven replied, &ldquo;Why hast thou cursed me? I have a
legal complaint against thee.&rdquo; Noah replied, &ldquo;Because thou
art lewd and foolish and dost suspect innocent people. If I do not
approach my own wife, who is like unto me, whilst we are in the Ark,
how can I approach thy wife, who is so different from a human being,
and moreover is forbidden unto me as a married female?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>The raven said, &ldquo;Why dost thou call me lewd
(fornicator)?&rdquo; Noah replied, &ldquo;Thine own words prove thine
immorality, I have not made thee an evil name.&rdquo; And thus it has
remained according to Noah&rsquo;s curse (f. 26b&ndash;27a).</p>

AMONG THE CREATURES OF THE SEA? AND THE STORY OF THE FOX&rsquo;S HEART

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Q.</i> Why are there no counterpart to the fox and
weasel (<span lang="he">&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1492;</span>) in
the sea? The story of the fox&rsquo;s heart and the fishes.</p>
<p><i>R.</i> Because they were cunning. When God had created the angel
of death, he saw the creatures, and he said to God, &ldquo;Lord of the
Universe, grant me permission to kill them.&rdquo; God replied,
&ldquo;Thou shalt have power over all the creatures of the earth except
the descendants of the bird Milham, who are not to taste the taste of
death.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;O Lord, separate them from the rest if
they are so pious, so that they do not learn the evil ways of the
others and come to sin.&rdquo; God at once granted him his request. He
built for them a great town and he placed them therein, and he sealed
up the gate of that town, and he said, &ldquo;It has been decreed (by
God) that neither my sword, nor that of anyone else should have power
over you unto the end of all generations.&rdquo; The angel of death
returned then to God, who said to him, &ldquo;Throw the pair of each
created being into the sea and over the rest thou shalt have
power.&rdquo; The angel did as he was told, and he threw into the sea a
pair of each created <span class="corr" id="xd21e9183" title=
"Source: beings">being</span>. When the fox saw what he was doing, he
began crying and weeping. The angel asked him, &ldquo;Why art thou
weeping?&rdquo; The fox replied, &ldquo;I cry for my friend whom thou
hast thrown into the sea.&rdquo; The angel asked him, &ldquo;Where is
thy friend?&rdquo; The fox then went and stood close to the edge of the
water and the angel saw his shadow in the water, and he believed that
he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>indeed thrown a pair of his friends into the
sea, and he said to the fox, &ldquo;Get thee hence.&rdquo; The fox ran
quickly away and was thus saved.</p>
<p>On his way he met the weasel, and he told her all that had happened
and what he had done. The weasel did likewise and escaped also from
being thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>After the lapse of one year since these things had happened, did
Leviathan gather together before him all the creatures of the sea, and
it was found that neither fox nor weasel was among them. So he sent for
them, but he was told what the fox had done to escape from being thrown
into the sea. Moreover, they told Leviathan that the fox was very
cunning. When Leviathan heard of his great intelligence, he became
jealous of him. He sent large fishes to go and fetch him, by deceiving
him and luring him away, and then to bring the fox to him. They went
and found him walking leisurely along the seashore. When the fox saw
the fishes approach and play about close to him, he entered into
conversation with them. When they saw him, they asked him, &ldquo;Who
art thou?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I am the fox.&rdquo; They said to
him, &ldquo;Dost thou not know that great honour is awaiting thee and
it is for this purpose that we have come hither. He said, &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Leviathan is sick unto death, and
has left the command that no one else is to rule after him as king but
the fox, for he is the most cunning of all the beasts. Thereafter, you
now come with us, for we have been sent to offer thee this
honour.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;How can I go into the sea and
not be drowned?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Ride on the back of one of
us and we will carry thee safely over the waters of the sea, so that
not even a drop of water shall touch the tip of thy nose until thou
reachest the kingly palace. Then we will lower thee down into it and
there thou wilt rule over all of us, and thou wilt rejoice all the days
of thy life, and thou wilt no longer have to search for food, and be
exposed to be hunted by mighty beasts and to be eaten by
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the fox heard these words, he believed them, and mounting on
the back of a mighty fish started with them on a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>journey on the sea. When the waves began to play
round him he began to be anxious. His wit had forsaken him. Then he
recovered himself and said, &ldquo;Woe unto me, what have I done? The
fishes have tricked me worse than I have ever tricked all the other
beasts. Now that I have fallen into their hands how can I
escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then said to them, &ldquo;I have come with you and I am now at
your mercy. You may tell me what is it that you really want of
me.&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;We will tell thee the truth. Leviathan
had heard of thy reputation, that thou art very cunning, so he said to
himself, I will cut his belly open and will eat his heart, and thus
shall I become also very wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox said to them, &ldquo;Why did you not tell me the truth, for
I would then have brought my heart with me. I would have given it to
the king Leviathan and he would have shown me honour. You are now going
to your own destruction.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Hast thou not
thy heart with thee?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No, for such is our
habit that we leave our heart behind and we walk about without it;
whenever we want it we fetch it, and if there is no necessity for it we
leave it where it is.&rdquo; So they said to him, &ldquo;What shall we
do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;My place and my dwelling is close to the
seashore, if you are willing to do it, bring me back to the place
whence you have taken me. I will go and fetch my heart and return with
you to Leviathan, who is sure to honour me greatly. If you, however,
will bring me to him without my heart, he will be very angry with you
and eat you up. For I will tell him that you had not told me anything
before you took me away, and that when I heard from you the reason of
your errand, I told you to carry me back and that you refused to do
so.&rdquo; The fishes then said at once, &ldquo;Thou speakest
well,&rdquo; and they returned to the place at the seashore whence they
had taken him. He went down from the back of the fishes, and jumping
and frolicking about he rolled over and over in the sand. The fishes
said to him, &ldquo;Haste thee, do not tarry, for we must depart
quickly.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Ye fools, get yourselves away. If I
had not had my heart I could not have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>gone with you into
the sea. Is there any creature in existence moving about and not having
a heart within?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Thou hast mocked at
us.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;If I got the best of the angel of death,
how much more likely am I to get it of you?&rdquo; They returned full
of shame to the Leviathan and told him all that had happened. He
replied, &ldquo;He is truly cunning, and ye have proved to be fools.
About such as you it is said, &lsquo;The stupidity of the fools is the
cause of their death,&rsquo;&rdquo; and so he ate them up.</p>
<p>Thus it has remained that although there are creatures in the sea
corresponding to those on land, there are none like unto the fox and
the weasel.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
