    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      It must have been on Synge's second visit to the Aran Islands that he had
      the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his
      greatest play. The scene of "Riders to the Sea" is laid in a cottage on
      Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group. While
      Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body had been
      washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason of certain
      peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island. In due
      course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly the manner
      described in the play, and perhaps one of the most poignantly vivid
      passages in Synge's book on "The Aran Islands" relates the incident of his
      burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other element in the story which Synge introduces into the play is
      equally true. Many tales of "second sight" are to be heard among Celtic
      races. In fact, they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in the
      minds of the people. It is just such a tale, which there seems no valid
      reason for doubting, that Synge heard, and that gave the title, "Riders to
      the Sea", to his play.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the dramatist's high distinction that he has simply taken the
      materials which lay ready to his hand, and by the power of sympathy woven
      them, with little modification, into a tragedy which, for dramatic irony
      and noble pity, has no equal among its contemporaries. Great tragedy, it
      is frequently claimed with some show of justice, has perforce departed
      with the advance of modern life and its complicated tangle of interests
      and creature comforts. A highly developed civilisation, with its attendant
      specialisation of culture, tends ever to lose sight of those elemental
      forces, those primal emotions, naked to wind and sky, which are the stuff
      from which great drama is wrought by the artist, but which, as it would
      seem, are rapidly departing from us. It is only in the far places, where
      solitary communion may be had with the elements, that this dynamic life is
      still to be found continuously, and it is accordingly thither that the
      dramatist, who would deal with spiritual life disengaged from the
      environment of an intellectual maze, must go for that experience which
      will beget in him inspiration for his art. The Aran Islands from which
      Synge gained his inspiration are rapidly losing that sense of isolation
      and self-dependence, which has hitherto been their rare distinction, and
      which furnished the motivation for Synge's masterpiece. Whether or not
      Synge finds a successor, it is none the less true that in English dramatic
      literature "Riders to the Sea" has an historic value which it would be
      difficult to over-estimate in its accomplishment and its possibilities. A
      writer in The Manchester Guardian shortly after Synge's death phrased it
      rightly when he wrote that it is "the tragic masterpiece of our language
      in our time; wherever it has been played in Europe from Galway to Prague,
      it has made the word tragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and
      cleansing to the spirit than it did."
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret of the play's power is its capacity for standing afar off, and
      mingling, if we may say so, sympathy with relentlessness. There is a
      wonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character, wherein the
      latent power of suggestion is almost unlimited. "In the big world the old
      people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in
      this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that
      do be old." In the quavering rhythm of these words, there is poignantly
      present that quality of strangeness and remoteness in beauty which, as we
      are coming to realise, is the touchstone of Celtic literary art. However,
      the very asceticism of the play has begotten a corresponding power which
      lifts Synge's work far out of the current of the Irish literary revival,
      and sets it high in a timeless atmosphere of universal action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its characters live and die. It is their virtue in life to be lonely, and
      none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great. He dies, and then it is
      the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to be great
      in their loneliness, great as Maurya, the stricken mother, is great in her
      final word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the Almighty
      God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep
      grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all can be living
      for ever, and we must be satisfied." The pity and the terror of it all
      have brought a great peace, the peace that passeth understanding, and it
      is because the play holds this timeless peace after the storm which has
      bowed down every character, that "Riders to the Sea" may rightly take its
      place as the greatest modern tragedy in the English tongue.

      SCENE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &mdash;An Island off the West of Ireland. (Cottage kitchen, with nets,
      oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing by the wall, etc.
      Cathleen, a girl of about twenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it down
      in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to spin at
      the wheel. NORA, a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [In a low voice.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN She's lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she's
      able.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Spinning the wheel rapidly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it you have?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt and a plain
      stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to
      listen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA We're to find out if it's Michael's they are, some time herself will
      be down looking by the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN How would they be Michael's, Nora. How would he go the length of
      that way to the far north?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA The young priest says he's known the like of it. "If it's Michael's
      they are," says he, "you can tell herself he's got a clean burial by the
      grace of God, and if they're not his, let no one say a word about them,
      for she'll be getting her death," says he, "with crying and lamenting."
    </p>
    <p>
      [The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Looking out anxiously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to
      the Galway fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA "I won't stop him," says he, "but let you not be afraid. Herself does
      be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God won't leave
      her destitute," says he, "with no son living."
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring in the west, and
      it's worse it'll be getting when the tide's turned to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She goes over to the table with the bundle.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I open it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before we'd done.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Coming to the table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a long time we'll be, and the two of us crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Goes to the inner door and listens.]
    </p>
    <p>
      She's moving about on the bed. She'll be coming in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in the turf-loft, the
      way she won't know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she'll be
      going down to see would he be floating from the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up a
      few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the
      inner room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn't it turf enough you have for this day and evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN There's a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [Throwing
      down the turf] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes to
      Connemara.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Sitting down on a stool at the fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      He won't go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He
      won't go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen
      Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA Where is he itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week,
      and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's here now, for the tide's
      turning at the green head, and the hooker' tacking from the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN I hear some one passing the big stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Looking out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      He's coming now, and he's in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Coming down.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Give it to him, Nora; it's on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up
      this morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Giving him a rope.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Is that it, Bartley?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards
      [Bartley takes the rope]. It will be wanting in this place, I'm telling
      you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning, or
      any morning in the week, for it's a deep grave we'll make him by the grace
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [Beginning to work with the rope.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I've no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now
      quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the
      fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA It's a hard thing they'll be saying below if the body is washed up
      and there's no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big
      price for the finest white boards you'd find in Connemara.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She looks round at the boards.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine
      days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and south?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there
      was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a
      hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of
      a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [Working at the halter, to Cathleen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the rye,
      and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there
      is a good price going.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [To Cathleen]
    </p>
    <p>
      If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get
      up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It's hard set we'll be from
      this day with no one in it but one man to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drownd'd with the
      rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman
      looking for the grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a newer
      one of the same flannel.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [To Nora.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Is she coming to the pier?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Looking out.] She's passing the green head and letting fall her
      sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [Getting his purse and tobacco.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll have half an hour to go down, and you'll see me coming again in two
      days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a word from an old woman, and she
      holding him from the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN It's the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who
      would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTLEY [Taking the halter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I must go now quickly. I'll ride down on the red mare, and the gray
      pony'll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Crying out as he is in the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      He's gone now, God spare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone now,
      and when the black night is falling I'll have no son left me in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and he looking round in
      the door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without
      your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in
      his ear?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without
      looking round.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Turning towards her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You're taking away the turf from the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Crying out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we're after forgetting his bit of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She comes over to the fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night, and he after
      eating nothing since the sun went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Turning the cake out of the oven.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's destroyed he'll be, surely. There's no sense left on any person in a
      house where an old woman will be talking for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya sways herself on her stool.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to
      Maurya.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing.
      You'll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say "God
      speed you," the way he'll be easy in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Taking the bread.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Will I be in it as soon as himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN If you go now quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Standing up unsteadily.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard set I am to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Looking at her anxiously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she'll slip on the big stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA What stick?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN The stick Michael brought from Connemara.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Taking a stick Nora gives her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their
      sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving
      things behind for them that do be old.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly. She's that sorry, God
      help her, you wouldn't know the thing she'd do.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA Is she gone round by the bush?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Looking out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      She's gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she'll be
      out of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Getting the bundle from the loft.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest said he'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and
      speak to him below if it's Michael's they are surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Taking the bundle.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he say what way they were found?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Coming down.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were two men," says he, "and they rowing round with poteen before
      the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they
      passing the black cliffs of the north."
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Trying to open the bundle.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me a knife, Nora, the string's perished with the salt water, and
      there's a black knot on it you wouldn't loosen in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Giving her a knife.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I've heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Cutting the string.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago&mdash;the man sold us
      that knife&mdash;and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond,
      it would be seven days you'd be in Donegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA And what time would a man take, and he floating?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look at
      them eagerly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [In a low voice.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord spare us, Nora! isn't it a queer hard thing to say if it's his
      they are surely?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on
      the other [she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner.] It's not
      with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own
      shirt was heavy with the salt in it [pointing to the corner]. There's a
      bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren't there great
      rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't it many another man may have
      a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael; God spare his soul, and what will
      herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Taking the stocking.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a plain stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three
      score stitches, and I dropped four of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Counts the stitches.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's that number is in it [crying out.] Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter thing
      to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him
      but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      And isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a
      great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [After an instant.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Looking out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      She is, Cathleen. She's coming up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Put these things away before she'll come in. Maybe it's easier
      she'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won't let on we've
      heard anything the time he's on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [Helping Cathleen to close the bundle.]
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll put them here in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to
      the spinning-wheel.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA Will she see it was crying I was?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Keep your back to the door the way the light'll not be on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya
      comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her
      stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still in
      her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle of
      bread.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [After spinning for a moment.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You didn't give him his bit of bread?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Did you see him riding down?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya goes on keening.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [A little impatiently.]
    </p>
    <p>
      God forgive you; isn't it a better thing to raise your voice and tell what
      you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that's done? Did you
      see Bartley, I'm saying to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [With a weak voice.]
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart's broken from this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [As before.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you see Bartley?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA I seen the fearfulest thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Leaves her wheel and looks out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      God forgive you; he's riding the mare now over the green head, and the
      gray pony behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her
      white tossed hair. With a frightened voice.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray pony behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Coming to the fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it ails you, at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Speaking very slowly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I've seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride
      Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN AND NORA UAH.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA Tell us what it is you seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer
      to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with the
      gray pony behind him [she puts up her hands, as if to hide something from
      her eyes.] The Son of God spare us, Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN What is it you seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA I seen Michael himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Speaking softly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You did not, mother; it wasn't Michael you seen, for his body is after
      being found in the far north, and he's got a clean burial by the grace of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [A little defiantly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm after seeing him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came
      first on the red mare; and I tried to say "God speed you," but something
      choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and "the blessing of
      God on you," says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and I
      crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it&mdash;with fine
      clothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Begins to keen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's destroyed we are from this day. It's destroyed, surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn't leave her
      destitute with no son living?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [In a low voice, but clearly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It's little the like of him knows of the sea. . . . Bartley will be lost
      now, and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of the white
      boards, for I won't live after them. I've had a husband, and a husband's
      father, and six sons in this house&mdash;six fine men, though it was a
      hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the world&mdash;and
      some of them were found and some of them were not found, but they're gone
      now the lot of them. . . There were Stephen, and Shawn, were lost in the
      great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth, and
      carried up the two of them on the one plank, and in by that door.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something
      through the door that is half open behind them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [In a whisper.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in the north-east?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [In a whisper.]
    </p>
    <p>
      There's some one after crying out by the seashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Continues without hearing anything.]
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in a
      dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went up.
      There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over. I was
      sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees, and I
      seen two women, and three women, and four women coming in, and they
      crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and there
      were men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half of a red
      sail, and water dripping out of it&mdash;it was a dry day, Nora&mdash;and
      leaving a track to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It opens
      softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the
      threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats
      over their heads.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Half in a dream, to Cathleen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it Patch, or Michael, or what is it at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is
      found there how could he be here in this place?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and
      what way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like
      him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it's
      hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after sending us a bit
      of his clothes from the far north.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to Michael.
      Maurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. NORA looks out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA They're carrying a thing among them and there's water dripping out of
      it and leaving a track by the big stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [In a whisper to the women who have come in.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it Bartley it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE WOMEN It is surely, God rest his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in the
      body of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and lay it
      on the table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [To the women, as they are doing so.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What way was he drowned?
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE WOMEN The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was washed
      out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The women
      are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement. Cathleen
      and Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the
      door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people
      around her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      They're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea can do to
      me.... I'll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind
      breaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and the
      surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises, and they
      hitting one on the other. I'll have no call now to be going down and
      getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won't care what
      way the sea is when the other women will be keening. [To Nora]. Give me
      the Holy Water, Nora, there's a small sup still on the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nora gives it to her.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Drops Michael's clothes across Bartley's feet, and sprinkles the
      Holy Water over him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't that I haven't prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God. It
      isn't that I haven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't know
      what I'ld be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's time
      surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great sleeping in the long
      nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of wet flour we do have to eat,
      and maybe a fish that would be stinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her
      breath.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [To an old man.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have
      fine white boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would be
      found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you'll be working.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OLD MAN [Looking at the boards.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Are there nails with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER MAN It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of the nails, and all
      the coffins she's seen made already.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN It's getting old she is, and broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of
      Michael's clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the
      Holy Water.]
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA [In a whisper to Cathleen.]
    </p>
    <p>
      She's quiet now and easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could hear
      her crying out from this to the spring well. It's fonder she was of
      Michael, and would any one have thought that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN [Slowly and clearly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do, and isn't it
      nine days herself is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow in
      the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her
      hands together on Bartley's feet.]
    </p>
    <p>
      They're all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty God
      have mercy on Bartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and on the souls of
      Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn (bending her head]); and may He
      have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of every one is left living
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women, then
      sinks away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MAURYA [Continuing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the Almighty
      God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep
      grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all can be living
      for ever, and we must be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly.]
    </p>
    <p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
