<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Melody, My Dear Child:</span></p>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;SIT down to write my story for you, the life-story
of old Rosin the Beau, your friend and true lover.
Some day, not far distant now, my fiddle and I shall
be laid away, in the quiet spot you know and love;
and then (for you will miss me, Melody, well I know
that!) this writing will be read to you, and you will
hear my voice still, and will learn to know me better
even than you do now; though that is better
than any one else living knows me.</div>

<p>When people ask me where I hail from, our good,
neighbourly, down-east way, I answer "From the
Androscoggin;" and that is true enough as far as
it goes, for I have spent many years on and about
the banks of that fine river; but I have told you
more than that. You know something of the little
village where I was born and brought up, far to the
northeast of your own home village. You know something,
too, of my second mother, as I call her,&mdash;Abby
Rock; but of my own sweet mother I have spoken
little. Now you shall hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing I can remember is my mother's
playing. She was a Frenchwoman, of remarkable
beauty and sweetness. Her given name was Marie,
but I have never known her maiden surname: I
doubt if she knew it herself. She came, quite by accident,
being at the time little more than a child, to
the village where my father, Jacques De Arthenay,
lived; he saw her, and loved her at the sight. She
consented to marry him, and I was their only child.
My father was a stern, silent man, with but one
bright thing in his life,&mdash;his love for my mother.
Whenever she came before his eyes, the sun rose in
his face, but for me he had no great affection; he
was incapable of dividing his heart. I have now and
then seen a man with this defect; never a woman.</p>

<p>My first recollection, I said, is of my mother's
playing. I see myself, sitting on a great black book,
the family Bible. I must have been very small, and
it was a large Bible, and lay on a table in the sitting-room.
I see my mother standing before me, with her
violin on her arm. She is light, young, and very
graceful; beauty seems to flow from her face in a
kind of dark brightness, if I may use such an expression;
her eyes are soft and deep. I have seen no
other eyes like my mother Marie's. She taps the violin
with the bow; then she taps me under the chin.</p>

<p>"<i>Dis 'Bon jour!' petit Jacques!</i>" and I say "Bo'
zour!" as well as I can, and duck my head, for a
bow is expected of me. No bow, no music, and I am
quivering with eagerness for the music. Now she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
draws the bow across the strings, softly, smoothly,&mdash;ah,
my dear, you have heard only me play, all your
life; if you could have heard my mother! As I see
her and hear her, this day of my babyhood, the song
she plays is the little French song that you love. If
you could have heard her sing!</p>

</table></div>

<div class='unindent'>It is the song of my life, Melody; I never told you
that before, but it has always pleased me well that
you cared for it.</div>

<p>As my mother sings the last words, she bends
and kisses the violin, which was always a living personage
to her. Her head moves like a bird's head,
quickly and softly. I see her face all brightness, as
I have told you; then suddenly a shadow falls on it.
My back is towards the door, but she stands facing
it. I feel myself snatched up by hands like quivering
steel; I am set down&mdash;not roughly&mdash;on the floor.
My father turns a terrible face on my mother.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he cried. "He was on the Bible!
You&mdash;you set the child on the Holy Bible!"</p>

<p>I am too frightened to cry out or move, but my
mother Marie lays down her violin in its box&mdash;as
tenderly as she would lay me in my cradle&mdash;and
goes to my father, and puts her arm round his neck,
and speaks to him low and gently, stroking back his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
short, fair hair. Presently the frightful look goes out
of his face; it softens into love and sadness; they
go hand-in-hand into the inner room, and I hear their
voices together speaking gravely, slowly. I do not
know that they are praying,&mdash;I have known it since.
I watch the flies on the window, and wish my father
had not come.</p>

<p>That, Melody, is the first thing I remember. It
must have been after that, that my father made me
a little chair, and my mother made a gay cushion
for it, with scarlet frills, and I sat always in that.
Our kitchen was a sunny room, full of bright things;
Mother Marie kept everything shining. The floor
was painted yellow, and the rugs were scarlet and
blue; she dyed the cloth herself, and made them
beautifully. There was always a fire&mdash;or so it
seems now&mdash;in the great black gulf of a fireplace,
and the crane hung over it, with pots and kettles.
The firelight was thrown back from bright pewter
and glass and copper all about the walls; I have
never seen so gay a room. And always flowers in
the window, and always a yellow cat on a red
cushion. No canary bird; my mother Marie never
would have a bird. "No prisoners!" she would say.
Once a neighbour brought her a wounded sparrow;
she nursed and tended it till spring, then set it loose
and watched it fly away.</p>

<p>This neighbour was a boy, some years older than
myself; he is one of the people I remember best.
Petie we called him; Peter Brand; he died long ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
He had been a comfort to my mother Marie, in days
of sadness,&mdash;before my birth, for she was never sad
after I came,&mdash;and she loved him, and he clung to
her. He was a round-faced boy, with hair almost
white; awkward and shy, but very good to me.</p>

<p>As I grew older my mother taught me many
French songs and games, and Petie often made a
third with us. He made strange work of the French
speech; to me it came like running water, but to
Petie it was like pouring wine from a corked bottle.
Mother Marie could not understand this, and tried
always to teach him. I can hear her cry out, "Not
thus, Petie! not! you break me the ears! Listen
only!</p>

<div class='center'>
"'<i>Sur le pont d'Avignon</i>,'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><i>Encore!</i> again, Petie! sing wiz p'tit Jacques!"</div>

<p>And Petie would drone out, all on one note (for
the poor boy had no music either),</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>Sooly pong d'Avinnong</i>,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And Mother Marie would put her hands to her ears
and cry out, "Ah, <i>que non!</i> ah, <i>que non!</i> you keell
me in my heart!" and poor Petie would be so
ashamed! Then Mother Marie would be grieved for
him, and would beat herself, and say that she was a
demon, a monster of cruelty; and she would run to
the cupboard and bring cakes and doughnuts (she
always called them "dont's," I remember that), and
make Petie eat till his eyes stood out. And it always
ended in her taking out the violin, and playing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
singing our hearts to heaven. Petie loved music,
when Mother Marie made it.</div>

<p>I speak of cakes. There was no one in the village
who could cook like my mother; every one acknowledged
that. Whatever she put her hand to was done
to perfection. And the prettiness of it all! A flower,
a green leaf, a bunch of parsley,&mdash;there was some
delicate, pretty touch to everything she did. I must
have been still small when I began to notice how
she arranged the dishes on our table. These matters
can mean but little to you, my dear child; but the
eyes of your mind are so quick, I know it is one of
your delights to fancy the colours and lights that you
cannot see. Some bright-coloured food, then,&mdash;fried
fish, it might be, which should be of a golden brown
shade,&mdash;would be always on a dark blue platter,
while a dark dish, say beefsteak, would be on the
creamy yellow crockery that had belonged to my
father's mother; and with it a wreath of parsley or
carrot, setting off the yellow still more. And always,
winter and summer, some flower, if only a single
geranium-bloom, on the table. So that our table
was always like a festival. I think this troubled my
father, when his dark moods were on him. He
thought it a snare of the flesh. Sometimes, if the
meal were specially dainty, he would eat nothing but
dry bread, and this grieved Mother Marie almost more
than anything else. I remember one day,&mdash;it was
my birthday, and I must have been quite a big boy
by that time,&mdash;Mother Marie had made a pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
rose-feast for me. The table was strewn with rose-leaves,
and there was a garland of roses round my
plate, and they stood everywhere, in cups and bowls.
There was a round cake, too, with rose-coloured
frosting; I thought the angels might have such feasts
on their birthdays, but was sure no one else could.</p>

<p>But when my father came in,&mdash;I can see now his
look of pain and terror.</p>

<p>"You are tempting the Lord, Mary!" he cried.
"You are teaching our child to love the lust of the
flesh and the pride of the eye. It is sin, it is sin,
my wife!"</p>

<p>I trembled, for I feared he would throw my beautiful
cake into the fire, as I had once seen him throw
a pretty salad. But my mother Marie took his arm.
The door stood open, and the warm June was shining
through. She led him to the doorway, and pointed
to the sky.</p>

<p>"Look, <i>mon ami!</i>" she said, in her clear, soft voice.
"See the day of gold that the good God has made for
our little Jacques! He fills the garden wiz roses,&mdash;I
bring His roses in ze house. It is that He love ze
roses, and ze little child, and thee and me, my poor
Jacques; for He make us all, is it not?"</p>

<p>And presently, with her soft hand on his arm, the
pain went from my poor father, and he came in and
sat down with us, and even patted my head and
tasted the cake. I recall many such scenes as this,
my dear child. And perhaps I should say that my
mind was, and has always remained, with my mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
on such matters. If God gives food for the use of
His creatures, it is to His honour and glory to serve it
handsomely, so far as may be; and I see little religion
in a slovenly piece of meat, or a shapeless hunch
of butter on a dingy plate.</p>

<p>My mother having this gift of grace, it was not
strange that the neighbours often called on her for
some service of making beautiful. At a wedding or a
merrymaking of any kind she would be sent for, and
the neighbours, who were plain people, thought her
gift more than natural. People still speak of her in
all that part of the country, though she has been
dead sixty odd years, little Mother Marie. She would
have liked to make the meeting-house beautiful each
Sabbath with flowers, but this my father could not
hear of, and she never urged it after the first time.
At a funeral, too, she must arrange the white blossoms,
and lay the pale hands together. Abby Rock
has told me many stories of the comfort she brought
to sorrowing homes, with her sweet, light, quiet ways.
Abby loved her as her own child.</p>

<p>As I grew older, my mother taught me the violin.
I learned eagerly. I need not say much about that,
Melody; my best playing has been for you, and you
know all I could tell you; I learned, and it became
the breath of life to me. My lessons were in the
morning always, so that my father might not hear
the sound; but this was not because he did not love
the violin. Far otherwise! In the long winter evenings
my mother Marie would play for him, after I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was tucked up in my trundle-bed; music of religious
quality, which stirred his deep, silent nature strongly.
She had learned all the psalm-tunes that he loved,
stern old Huguenot melodies, many of them, that had
come over from France with his ancestor, and been
sung down through the generations since. And with
these she played soft, tender airs,&mdash;I never knew
what they were, but they could wile the heart out of
one's breast. I sometimes would lift my head from
my pillow, and look through the open door at the
warm, light kitchen beyond (for my mother Marie
could not bear to shut me into the cold, dark little
bedroom; my door stood open all night, and if I
woke in the night, the coals would always wink me a
friendly greeting, and I could hear the cat purring on
her cushion). I would look, I say, through the open
door. There would my mother stand, with the light,
swaying way she had, like a flower or a young white
birch in the wind; her cheek resting on the violin,
her eyelids dropped, as they mostly were when she
played, and the long lashes black against her soft,
clear paleness. And my father Jacques sitting by
the fire, his chin in his hand, still as a carved image,
looking at her with his heart in his eyes. That is the
way I think of them oftenest, Melody, my dear, as I
look back to the days long ago; this is the way
I mostly see my father and mother, Jacques and
Marie De Arthenay, a faithful husband and wife.</p>

mother often took me down to the beach. It
was a curving beach of fine sand, bright and warm,
and the rocks that shut it in were warm, too, brown
and yellow; it was a sunny, heartsome place as ever
I saw. I remember one day,&mdash;many days, and this
one of them,&mdash;when the three of us went down to the
beach, Mother Marie and Petie Brand and I. The
Lady, the violin, went too, of course, and we had our
music, and it left us heartened through and through,
and friends with all the world. Then we began to
skip stones, three children together. Petie and I
were only learning, and Mother Marie laughed at our
stones, which would go flopping and tumbling a little
way, then sink with a splash.</div>

<p>"They are ducks!" she said. (She called it
"docks," Melody; you cannot think how soft her
speech was.) "Poor leetle docks, that go flap, flap;
not yet zey have learned to swim, no! But here now,
see a bird of ze water, a sea-bird what you call." She
turned her wrist and sent the flat pebble flying; it
skimmed along like a live thing, flipping the little
crests of the ripples, going miles, it seemed to Petie
and me, till at length we lost sight of it altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did it go?" I asked. "I didn't hear it
splash."</p>

<p>"It went&mdash;to France!" said Mother Marie. "It
make a voyage, it goes, goes,&mdash;at last it arrives.
'<i>Voil&agrave; la France!</i>' it say. 'That I go ashore, to ask
of things for Marie, and for <i>petit Jacques</i>, and for
Petie too, good Petie, who bring the apples.'"</p>

<p>There were red apples in a basket, and I can see
now the bright whiteness of her teeth as she set them
into one.</p>

<p>"What will the stone see?" I asked again; for I
loved to make my mother tell me of the things she
remembered in France, the country she always loved.
She loved to tell, too; and a dreamy look would come
into her eyes at such times, as if she did not see us
near at hand, but only things far off and dim. We
listened, Petie and I, as if for a fairy tale.</p>

<p>"He come, zat leetle&mdash;non! <i>that lit</i>-tel stone."
(Mother Marie could often pronounce our English
"th" quite well; it was only when she forgot that
she slipped back to the soft "z" which I liked much
better.) "He come to the shore! It is not as this
shore, no! White is the sand, the rocks black, black.
All about are nets, very great, and boats. The men
are great and brown; and their beards&mdash;Holy Cric!
their beards are a bush for owls; and striped their
shirt, jersey, what you call, and blue trousers. Zey
come in from sea, their sails are brown and red; the
boats are full wiz fish, that shine like silver; they are
the herring, <i>petit Jacques</i>, it is of those that we live a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
great deal. Down zen come ze women to ze shore
and zey&mdash;<i>they</i>&mdash;are dressed beautiful, ah! so beautiful!
A red petticoat,&mdash;sometimes a blue, but I love
best the red, striped wiz white, and over this the dress
turned up, <i>&agrave; la blanchisseuse</i>. A handkerchief round
their neck, and gold earrings,&mdash;ah! long ones, to
touch their neck; and gold beads, most beautiful!
and then the cap! <i>P'tit Jacques</i>, thou hast not seen
caps, because here they have not the understanding.
But! white, like snow in ze sun; the muslin clear,
you understand, and stiff that it cracks,&mdash;ah! of
a beauty! and standing out like wings here, and
here&mdash;you do not listen! you make not attention,
bad children that you are! Go! I tell you no
more!"</p>

<p>It was true, Melody, my dear, that Petie and I did
not care so much about the descriptions of dress as if
we had been little girls; my mother was never weary
of telling about the caps and earrings; I think she
often longed for them, poor little Mother Marie! But
now Petie and I clung about her, and begged her to
go on, and she never could keep her vexation for two
minutes.</p>

<p>"Tell how they go up the street!" said Petie.</p>

<p>"Play we went, too!" cried I. "Play the stone
was a boat, M&egrave;re Marie." (I said it as one word,
Melody; it makes a pretty name, "M&egrave;re-Marie,"
when the pronunciation is good. To hear our people
say "M'ree" or "Marry," breaks the heart, as my
mother used to say.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded, pleased enough to play,&mdash;for she was
a child, as I have told you, in many, many ways,
though with a woman's heart and understanding,&mdash;and
clapped our hands softly together, as she held
them in hers.</p>

<p>"We, then, yes! we three, M&egrave;re-Marie, <i>p'tit Jacques</i>,
and Petie, we go up from the beach, up the street
that goes tic tac, zic zac, here and there, up the hill;
very steep in zose parts. We come to one place, it is
steps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steps in the street?"</p>

<p>"Steps that make the street, but yes! and on them
(white steps, clean! ah! of a cleanness!), in the
sun, sit the old women, and spin, and sing, and tell
stories. Ah! the fine steps. They, too, have caps,
but they are brown in the faces, and striped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Striped, M&egrave;re-Marie? painted, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She said the steps had caps!" whispered Petie,
incredulous, but too eager for the story to interrupt
the teller.</p>

<p>"Painted? wat you mean of foolishness, <i>p'tit
Jacques?</i> Ah! I was wrong! not striped; wreenkled,
you say? all up togezzer like a brown apple when he
is dry up,&mdash;like zis way!" and Mother Marie drew
her pretty face all together in a knot, and looked so
comical that we went into fits of laughter.</p>

<p>"So! zey sit, ze old women, and talk, talk, wiz ze
heads together; but one sit alone, away from those
others, and she sing. Her voice go up, thin, thin,
like a little cold wind in ze boat-ropes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I make learn you that song, <i>petit Jacques</i>, one

and all the old women point the nose, and say,
'Who is it comes there?' But that one old&mdash;but
M&egrave;re Jeanne, she cry out loud, loud. 'Marie! <i>petite

not let the motherless boy feel left out, even from a
world in which he had no part.</p>

<p>"My good friend Petie, whose mother is with the
saints. Then M&egrave;re Jeanne, she take all our hands, after
she has her weep; she say 'Come!' and we go up ze
street, up, up, till we come to M&egrave;re Jeanne's house."</p>

<p>"Tell about the house!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Holy Cric! what a house!" cried M&egrave;re-Marie,
clapping <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'our'">her</ins> hands together. "It is stone, painted
white, clean, like new cheese; the roof beautiful, straw,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

and warm, and full wiz good smells. Now it is the

mixed ze batter in a great bowl&mdash;it is yellow, that
bowl, and the spoon, it is horn. She show it to me,
she say, 'Wat leetle child was eat wiz this spoon,
Marie? hein?' and I&mdash;I kiss the spoon; I say, '<i>'Tite

<p>"Zen she laugh, and nod her head, and she stir,

<p>"The way they do when you make griddle-cakes,
M&egrave;re-Marie?"</p>


<p>"Ah! no! much, much, thousand time better,
M&egrave;re Jeanne make zem! She toss them&mdash;so! wiz ze

down&mdash;hop!&mdash;they say 'Sssssssssss!' that they like
to fry for M&egrave;re Jeanne, and for Marie, and <i>p'tit Jacques</i>,
and good Petie. Then I bring out the black table,
and I know where the bread live, and the cheese, and
while the cakes fry, I go to milk the cow&mdash;ah! the
pearl of cows, children, white like her own cream, fat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
like a boiled chestnut, good like an angel! She has
not forgotten Marie, she rub her nose in my heart,
she sing to me. I take her wiz both my arms, I weep&mdash;ah!
but it is joy, <i>p'tit Jacques!</i> it is wiz joy I
weep! Zen, again in ze house, and round ze table, we
all sit, and we eat, and eat, that we can eat no more.
And M&egrave;re Jeanne say:</p>

<p>"'Tell me of thy home, Marie!' and I tell all, all;
of thy father Jacques, how he good, and great, and
handsome as Saint Michael; and how my house is
fine, fine, and how Abiroc is good. And M&egrave;re Jeanne,
she make the great eyes; she cry, 'Ah! the good
fortune! Ah, Marie, that thou art fortunate, that
thou art happy!'</p>

<p>"Then she tell thee, <i>p'tit Jacques</i>, how I was little,
little, in a blue frock, wiz the cap tie under my chin;
and how I dance and sing in the street, and how
<i>Madame la Comtesse</i> see me, and take me to ze castle,
and make teach me the violin, and give me Madame
for my friend. I have told thee all, many, many
times. Then she tell, M&egrave;re Jeanne,&mdash;oh! she is
good, good, and all ze time she fill thee wiz chestnuts
that I cry out lest thou die,&mdash;she tell how one day
she come home from market, and I am gone. No
Marie! She look, she run here and there, she cry,
''Tite Marie, where art thou?' No Marie come.
She run to the neighbours, she search, she tear her
cap; they tell her, 'Demand of thy son's wife!
The strange ship sailed this morning; we heard
child cry; what do we know?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the wife of M&egrave;re Jeanne's Jeannot, she was
a devil, as I have told thee, a devil with both the
eyes evil; and none dare say what she had done,
for fear of their children and their cows to die. And
then, M&egrave;re Jeanne she tell how she run to Jeannot's
house,&mdash;she fear nossing, M&egrave;re Jeanne! the good God
protect her always. She cry, 'Where is Marie?
where is my child?' And Jeannot's Manon, she
laugh, she say, 'Cross the sea after her, old witch!
Who keeps thee?' Then&mdash;see, <i>p'tit Jacques!</i> see,
Petie! I have not seen this wiz my eyes, no! but
in my heart I have seen, I know! Then M&egrave;re
Jeanne run at that woman, that devil; and she pull
off her cap and tread it wiz her foot; and she pull
out her hair,&mdash;never she had much, but since this
day none!&mdash;and she scratch her face and tear the
clothes&mdash;ah! M&egrave;re Jeanne is mild like a cherub
till she is angry, but then&mdash; And that devil scream,
scream, but no one come, no one care; they are all
glad, they laugh to hear. Till Jeannot run in, and
catch his mother and hold her hands, and take her
home to her house. She tell me all this, M&egrave;re
Jeanne, and it is true, and I know it in my heart.
But now she is dead, that witch, and the great devil
has her, and that is well." (I think my father would
have lost his wits, Melody, if he had heard the way my
mother talked to me sometimes; but it was a child's
talk, my dear, and there was no harm. A child who
had been brought up among ignorant peasants; how
should she know better, poor little Mother Marie?)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"But now, see, <i>mes enfants!</i> We must come back
across the sea, for ze sun, he begin to go away down.
So I tell zis, and M&egrave;re Jeanne she cry, she take us
wiz her arms, she cannot let us go. But I take
Madame on my arm, I go out in ze street, I begin
to play wiz my hand. Then all come, all run, all cry,
'Marie! Marie is here wiz her <i>violon!</i>' And I play,

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;WAS twelve years old when my mother died. She
had no illness, or none that we had known of;
the sweet soul of her slipped away in the night like
a bird, and left the body smiling asleep. We never
knew what ailed her; people did not torment themselves
in those days with the "how" of a thing.
There may have been talk behind the village doors,
but my father never asked. She was gone, and his
heart was gone with her, my poor father. She was
all the joy of his life, and he never had any more;
I never remember seeing him smile after that time.
What gave him the best comfort was trying to keep
things pretty and bright, as she liked to see them.
He was neat as a woman, and he never allowed
a speck of dust on the chairs, or a withered leaf
on the geraniums. He never would let me touch
her flowers, but I was set to polish the pewter
and copper,&mdash;indeed, my mother had taught me
that,&mdash;and he watched jealously lest any dimness
come on them. I sometimes wondered at all this,
as he had so lately counted these matters of adornment
and prettiness and such as less than nothing,
and vanity, as the preacher has it. But I think
his great grief put a sacredness, as it were, over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
everything that had been hers, and all her ways
seemed heavenly to him now, even though he had
frowned at them (never at her, Melody, my dear!
never at her!) when she was still with him.</div>

<p>My father wished me to help him in the farm work,
but I had no turn for that. I was growing up tall
and weedy, and most like my strength went into that.
However it was, there was little of it for farming, and
less liking. Father Jacques made up his mind that
I was no good for anything, but Abby Rock stood up
for me.</p>

<p>"The boy is not strong enough for farming,
Jacques!" she said. "He's near as tall as you,
now, and not fifteen yet. Put him to learn a trade,
and he'll be a credit to you."</p>

<p>So I was put to learn shoemaking, and a good
trade it has been to me all my life. The shoemaker
was a kind old man, who had known me from a baby,
and he contrived to make my work easy for me,&mdash;seeing
I took kindly to it,&mdash;and often let me have
the afternoon to myself. My lungs were weak, or
Abby thought they were, and the doctor had told her
I must not sit too long over my bench, but must be
out in the air as much as might be, though not at
hard labour. Then,&mdash;those afternoons, I am saying,&mdash;I
would be off like a flash with my fiddle,&mdash;off to
the yellow sand beach where the round pebbles lay.
I could never let my poor father hear me play; it
was a knife in his heart even to see the Lady; and
these hours on the beach were my comfort, and kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the spirit alive in me. Looking out to sea, I could
still feel my mother Marie beside me, still hear her
voice singing, so gay, so sad,&mdash;singing all ways, as
the wind blows. She had no voice like yours, Melody,
my dear, but it was small and sweet as a bird's;
sweet as a bird's! It was there, on the yellow sand
beach, that I first met Father L'Homme-Dieu, the
priest.</p>

<p>I have told you a great deal about this good man,
Melody. He came of old French stock, like ourselves,&mdash;like
most of the people in our village; only his
people had always been Catholics. His village, where
he had a little wooden church, was ten or twelve miles
from ours, but he was the only priest for twenty
miles round, and he rode or walked long distances,
visiting the scattered families that belonged to his following.
He chanced to come to the beach one day
when I was there, and stayed to hear me play. I
never knew he was there till I turned to go home;
but then he spoke to me, and asked about my music
and my home, and talked so kindly and wisely that
my heart went out to him that very hour. He took
to me, too; he was a lonely man, and there was none
in his own neighbourhood that he cared to make his
friend; and seldom a week passed that he did not
find his way to the beach, for an hour of music and
talk. Talk! How we did talk! There was always a
book in his pocket, too, and he would read some fine
passage aloud, and then we would discuss it, and turn
it over and over, and let it draw our own thoughts like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a magnet. It was a rare chance for a country boy,
Melody! Here was a scholar, and as fine a gentleman
as ever I met, and the heart of a child and a wise man
melted into one; and I like his own son for the kindness
he gave me. Sometimes I went to his house,
but not often, for I could not take so long a time away
from my work. He lived in a little house like a bird's
house, and the little brown woman who did for him
was like a bird, and of all curious things, her name
was Sparrow,&mdash;the widow Sparrow.</p>

<p>There was a little study, where he sat at a desk in
the middle, and could pull down any book, almost,
with no more than tilting his chair; and there was a
little dining-room, and a closet with a window in it,
where his bed stood. All these rooms were lined
with books, most of them works of theology and religion,
but plenty of others, too: poetry, and romances, and
plays,&mdash;he was a great reader, and his books were all
the friends he had, he used to say, till he found me. I
should have been his son, he would say; and then lay
his hand on my head and bid me be good, and say my
prayers, and keep my heart true and clean. He never
talked much to me of his own church (knowing my
father by name and reputation), only made plain to
me the love of God, and taught me to seek it through
loving man.</p>

<p>I used to wonder how he came to be there, in the
wilderness, as it must often have seemed to him, for
he had travelled much, and was city-bred, his people
having left the seacoast and settled inland in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
grandfather's time. One day, as I stood by his desk
waiting for him, I saw a box that always lay there, set
open; and in it was a portrait of a most beautiful lady
in a rich dress. The portrait was in a gold frame
set with red stones,&mdash;rubies, they may have been,&mdash;and
was a rich jewel indeed. While I stood looking
at it, Father L'Homme-Dieu came in; and at sight of
the open box, and me looking at it, his face, that was
like old ivory in its ordinary look, flushed dark red as
the stones themselves. I was sorely vexed at myself,
and frightened too, maybe; but the change passed
from him, and he spoke in his own quiet voice.
"That is the first half of my life, Jacques!" he said.
"It is set in heart's blood, my son." And told me
that this was his sweetheart who was drowned at sea,
and it was after her death that he became a priest,
and came to find some few sheep in the wilderness,
near the spot where his fathers had lived. Then he
bade me look well at the sweet face, and when my
time should come to love, seek out one, if not so fair
(as he thought there were none such), still one as
true, and pure, and tender, and loving once, let it last
till death; and so closed the box, and I never saw it
open again.</p>

<p>All this time I never let my father know about
Father L'Homme-Dieu. It would have seemed to him
a terrible thing that his son should be friends with a
priest of the Roman Church, which he held a thing
accursed. I thought it no sin to keep his mind at
peace, and clear of this thing, for a cloud was gathering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
over him, my poor father. I told Abby, however,
good Abby Rock; and though it shocked her at first,
she was soon convinced that I brought home good
instead of harm from my talks with Father L'Homme-Dieu.
She it was who begged me not to tell my
father, and she knew him better than any one else
did, now that my mother Marie was gone. She told
me, too, of the danger that hung over my poor father.
The dark moods, since my mother's death, came over
him more and more often; it seemed, when he was in
one of them, that his mind was not itself. He never
slighted his work,&mdash;that was like the breath he drew,&mdash;but
when it was done, he would sit for hours brooding
by the fireplace, looking at the little empty chair
where my mother used to sit and sing at her sewing.
And sitting so and brooding, now and again there
would come over him as it were a blindness, and a
forgetting of all about him, so that when he came out
of it he would cry out, asking where he was, and what
had been done to him. He would forget, too, that
my mother was gone, and would call her, "Mary!
Mary!" so that one's heart ached to hear him; and
then Abby or I must make it clear to him again, and
see the dumb suffering of him, like a creature that
had not the power of speech, and knew nothing but
pain and remembrance.</p>

<p>I might have been seventeen or eighteen at this
time; I do not recall the precise year. I was doing
well with my shoemaking, and when this trouble
grew on my poor father I brought my bench into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
kitchen, so that I might have him always in sight.
This was well enough for every day, but already I was
beginning to be sent for here and there, among the
neighbouring villages, to play the fiddle. The people of
my father's kind were passing away, those who thought
music a device of the devil, and believed that dancing
feet were treading the road to hell. He was still a
power in our own village; but in the country round
about the young folks were learning the use of their
feet, and none could hinder them, being the course of
nature, since young lambs first skipped in the meadows.
It was an old farmer, a good, jolly kind of
man, who first gave me the name of "Rosin." He
sent for me to play at his barn-raising, and a pretty
sight it was; a fine new barn, Melody, all smelling
sweet of fresh wood, and hung with lanterns, and a
vast quantity of fruits and vegetables and late flowers
set all about. Pretty, pretty! I have never seen a
prettier barn-raising than that, and I have fiddled at
a many since then. Well, this old gentleman calls
to me across the floor, "Come here, young Rosin!"
I remember his very words. "Come here, young
Rosin! I can't get my tongue round your outlandish
name, but Rosin'll do well enough for you." Well,
it stuck to me, the name did, and I was never sorry,
for I did not like to carry my father's name about
overmuch, he misliking the dancing as he did. The
young folks caught up an old song, and tagged that
name on too, and called me Rosin the Bow. So it
was first, Melody; but there are two songs, as you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
know, my dear, to the one tune (or one tune is all I
know, and fits both sets of words), and the second song
spells the word "Beau," and so some merry girls in a
house where I often went to play, they vowed I should
be Rosin the Beau. I suppose I may have been rather
a good-looking lad, from what they used to say; and
to make a long story short, it was by that name that
I came to be known through the country, and shall
be known till I die. An old beau enough now, my
little girl; eighty years old your Rosin will be, if he
lives till next September. I took to playing the air
whenever I entered a room; it made a little effect,
a little stir,&mdash;I was young and foolish, and it took
little to please me in those days. But I have always
thought, and think still, that a man, as well as a
woman, should make the best of the mortal part of
him; and I do not know why we should not be thankful
for a well-looking body as for a well-ordered mind.
I cannot abide to see a man shamble or slouch, or
throw his arms and legs about as if they were timber
logs. Many is the time I have said to my scholars,
when I was teaching dancing-school,&mdash;great lumbering
fellows, hulking through a quadrille as if they
were pacing a raft in log-running,&mdash;"Don't insult
your Creator by making a scarecrow of the body
He has seen fit to give you. With reverence, He
might have given it to one of better understanding;
but since you have it, for piety's sake hold up your
head, square your shoulders, and put your feet in the
first position!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>But I wander from the thread of my story, as
old folks will do. After all, it is only a small
story, of a small life; not every man is born to be
great, my dear. Yet, while I sat on my shoemaker's
bench, stitching away, I thought of greatness, as I
suppose most boys do. I thought of a scholar's life,
like that of Father L'Homme-Dieu before his sorrow
came to him; a life spent in cities, among libraries
and learned, brilliant people, men and women. I
thought of a musician's life, and dreamed of the concerts
and operas that I had never heard. The poet
Wordsworth, my dear, has written immortal words
about the dreams of a boy, and my dreams were fair
enough. It seemed as if all the world outside were
clouded in a golden glory, if I may put it so, and as if
I had only to run forth and put aside this shining
veil, to find myself famous, and happy, and blessed.
And when I came down from the clouds, and saw my
little black bench, and the tools and scraps of leather,
and my poor father sitting brooding over the fire, my
heart would sink down within me, and the longing
would come strong upon me to throw down hammer
and last, and run away, out into that great world that
was calling for me. And so the days went by, and
the months, and the years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;WAS twenty years old when the change came in
my life. I remember the day was cold and bleak,
an early spring day. My father had had an accident
a few days before. In one of his unconscious fits he
had fallen forward&mdash;I had left the room but for a
moment&mdash;and struck his head sharply against one of
the fire-irons. He came to himself quite wild, and
seeing the blood, thought he had killed some one, and
cried to us to take him to prison as a murderer. It
took Abby and me a long time to quiet him. The
shock and the pain of it all had shaken me more than
I knew, and I felt sick, and did not know what ailed
me; but Abby knew, and she sent me to see Father
L'Homme-Dieu, while she sat with my father. I was
glad enough to go, more glad than my duty allowed,
I fear; yet I knew that Abby was better than I at
caring for my father.</div>

<p>As I walked across the brown fields, where the
green was beginning to prick in little points here and
there, I began to feel the life strong in me once more.
The dull cloud of depression seemed to drop away, and
instead of seeing always that sad, set face of my poor
father's, I could look up and around, and whistle to
the squirrels, and note the woodpecker running round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the tree near me. It has remained a mystery to me
all my life, Melody, that this bird's brains are not constantly
addled in his head, from the violence of his
rapping. When I was a little boy, I tried, I remember,
to nod my head as fast as his went nodding: with
the effect that I grew dizzy and sick, and Mother
Marie thought I was going to die, and said the White
Paternoster over me five times.</p>

<p>I looked about me, I say, and felt my spirit waking
with the waking of the year. Yet, though I was glad
to feel alive and young once more, I never thought I
was going to anything new or wonderful. The wise,
kind friend would be there; we should talk, and I
should come away refreshed and strengthened, in
peace and courage; I thought of nothing more. But
when the widow Sparrow opened the door to me, I
heard voices from the room within; a strange voice
of a man, and the priest's answering. I stopped short
on the threshold.</p>

<p>"The Father is busy!" I said. "I will call again,
when he is alone."</p>

<p>"Now don't you!" said Mrs. Sparrow, who was
always fond of me, and thought it a terrible walk for
me to take, so young, and with the "growing weakness"
not out of me. "Don't ye go a step, Jacques!
I expect you can come in just as well as not. There
is a gentleman here, but he's so pleasant, I should
wish to have you see him, if <i>I</i> was the Father."</p>

<p>I was hesitating, all the shyness of a country-bred
boy coming over me; for I had a quick ear, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
this strange voice was not like the voices I was
used to hearing; it was like Father L'Homme-Dieu's,
fine and high-bred. But the next instant Father
L'Homme-Dieu had stepped to the door of the study,
and saw me.</p>

<p>"Come in, Jacques!" he cried. His eyes were
bright, and his air gay, as I had never seen it. "Come
in, my son! I have a friend here, and you are the
very person I want him to meet." I stepped over
the threshold awkwardly enough, and stood before
the stranger. He was a young man, a few years
older than myself; tall and slender,&mdash;we might have
been twins as far as height and build went, but there
the resemblance ceased. He was fair, with such delicate
colouring that he might have looked womanish but
for the dark fiery blue of his eyes, and his little curled
moustache. He looked the way you fancy a prince
looking, Melody, when Auntie Joy tells you a fairy
story, though he was simply dressed enough.</p>

<p>"Marquis," said Father L'Homme-Dieu, with a
shade of ceremony that I had never heard before in
his tone, "let me present to you M. Jacques D'Arthenay,
my friend! Jacques, this is the Marquis de
Ste. Valerie."</p>

<p>He gave my name the French pronunciation. It
was kindly meant; at my present age, I think it
was perhaps rightly done; but then, it filled me with
a kind of rage. The angry blood of a false pride, a
false humility, surged to my brain and sang in my
ears; and as the young man stepped forward with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
outstretched hand, crying, "A compatriot. Welcome,
monsieur!" I drew back, stammering with anger.
"My name is Jacques De Arthenay!"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I said. "I am
an American, a shoemaker, and the son of a farmer."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, in which I seemed
to live a year. I was conscious of everything, the
well-bred surprise of the young nobleman, the half-amused
vexation of the priest, my own clumsy, boyish
rage and confusion. In reality it was only a few
seconds before I felt my friend's hand on my shoulder,
with its kind, fatherly touch.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my child!" he said. "Does it matter
greatly how a name is pronounced? It is the same
name, and I pronounced it thus, not without a reason.
Sit down, and have peace!"</p>

<p>There was authority as well as kindness in his
voice. I sat down, still trembling and blushing.
Father L'Homme-Dieu went on quietly, as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>"It was for the marquis's sake that I gave your
name its former&mdash;and correct&mdash;pronunciation, my
son Jacques. If I mistake not, he is of the same part
of France from which your ancestors came. Huguenots
of Blanque, am I not right, marquis?"</p>

<p>I was conscious that the stranger, whom I was inwardly
accusing as a pretentious puppy, a slip of a
dead and worthless tree, was looking at me intently;
my eyes seemed drawn to his whether I would or no.
So meeting those blue eyes, there passed as it were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
flash from them into mine, a flash that warmed and
lightened, as a smile broke over his face.</p>

<p>"D'Arthenay!" he said, in a tone that seemed to
search for some remembrance. "<i>D'Arthenay, tenez
foi! n'est-ce pas, monsieur?</i>"</p>

<p>I started. The words were the motto of my
father's house. They were engraved on the stone
which marked the grave of my grandfather many
times back, Jacques, Sieur D'Arthenay. Seeing
my agitation, the marquis leaned forward eagerly.
He was full of quick, light gestures, that somehow
brought my mother back to me.</p>

<p>"But, we are neighbours!" he cried. "We must
be friends, M. D'Arthenay. Your tower&mdash;it is a
noble ruin&mdash;stands not a league from my ch&acirc;teau
in Blanque. The Ste. Valeries and the D'Arthenays
were always friends, since Adam was, and till
the Grand Monarque separated them with his accursed
Revocation. Monsieur, that I am enchanted
at this rencounter! <i>La bonne aventure, oh gai! n'est-ce
pas, mon p&egrave;re?</i>"</p>

<p>There was no resisting his eager gaiety. And
when he quoted the nursery song that my mother
used to sing, my stubborn resentment&mdash;at what?
who can say?&mdash;broke and melted away, and I was
smiling back into the bright, merry eyes. Once more
he held out his hand, and this time I took it gladly.
Father L'Homme-Dieu looked on in delight; it was
a good moment.</p>

<p>After that the talk flowed freely. I found that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the young marquis, having come on a pleasure tour
to the United States, had travelled thus far out
of the general route to look up the graves of
some of his mother's people, who had come out
with Baron Castine, but had left him, as my ancestor
had done, on account of his marriage with
the Indian princess. They were the Belleforts of
Blanque.</p>

<p>"Bellefort!" I cried. "That name is on several
stones in our old burying-ground. The Belforts of
our village are their descendants, Father L'Homme-Dieu."</p>

<p>"Not Ham?" cried the father, bursting into a
great laugh. "Not Ham Belfort, Jacques?"</p>

<p>I laughed back, nodding. "Just Ham, father!"</p>

<p>I never saw Father L'Homme-Dieu so amused.
He struck his hands together, and leaned back in
his chair, repeating over and over, "Ham Belfort!
Cousin of the Marquis de Ste. Valerie! Ham Belfort!
Is it possible?"</p>

<p>The young nobleman looked from one to the other
of us curiously.</p>

<p>"But what?" he asked. "Ham! <i>c'est-&agrave;-dire,
jambon, n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"It is also a Biblical name, marquis!" said Father
L'Homme-Dieu. "I must ask who taught you your
catechism!"</p>

<p>"True! true!" said the marquis, slightly confused.
"<i>Sem, Ham, et Japhet</i>, perfectly! and&mdash;I
have a cousin, it appears, named Jam&mdash;I should say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Ham? Will you lead me to him, M. D'Arthenay, that
I embrace him?"</p>

<p>"You shall see him!" I said. "I don't think
Ham is used to being embraced, but I will leave
that to you. I will take you to see him, and to see
the graves in the burying-ground, whenever you say."</p>

<p>"But now, at the present time, this instant!"
cried Ste. Valerie, springing from his chair. "Here
is Father L'Homme-Dieu dying of me, in despair at
his morning broken up, his studies destroyed by chatter.
Take me with you, D'Arthenay, and show me
all things; Ham, also his brothers, and No&euml; and the
Ark, if they find themselves also here. Amazing
country! astonishing people!"</p>

<p>So off we went together, he promising Mrs. Sparrow
to return in time for dinner, and informing her
that she was a sylphide, which caused her to say,
"Go along!" in high delight. He had brought a
letter to the priest, from an old friend, and was to
stay at the house.</p>

<p>Back across the brown fields we went. I was no
longer alone; the world was full of new light, new
interest. I felt that it was good to be alive; and
when my companion began to sing in very lightness
of heart, I joined in, and sang with right good will.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"La bonne aventure, oh gai!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">La bonne aventure!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>He told me that his mother always sang him this
song when he had been a good boy; I replied that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
mine had done the same. How many French
mothers have sung the merry little lilt, I wonder?
We sang one snatch and another, and I could not
see that the marquise had had the advantage of the
little peasant girl, if it came to songs.</div>

<p>The marquis&mdash;but why should I keep to the
empty title, which I was never to use after that first
hour? Nothing would do but that we should be
friends on the instant, and for life,&mdash;Jacques and
Yvon. "Thus it was two centuries ago," my companion
declared, "thus shall it be now!" and I, in my
dream of wonderment and delight, was only too glad
to have it so.</p>

<p>We talked of a thousand things; or, to be precise,
he talked, and I listened. What had I to say
that could interest him? But he was full of the
wonders of travel, the strangeness of the new world
and the new people. Niagara had shaken him to the
soul, he told me; on the wings of its thunder he had
soared to the empyrean. How his fanciful turns of
expression come back to me as I write of him! He
was proud of his English, which was in general
surprisingly good.</p>

<p>New York he did not like,&mdash;a savage in a Paris
gown, with painted face; but on Boston he looked
with the eyes of a lover. What dignity! what Puritan,
what maiden grace of withdrawal! An American
city, where one feels oneself not a figure of chess,
but a human being; where no street resembles the
one before it, and one can wander and be lost in delicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
windings! Ah! in Boston he could live, the
life of a poet, of a scholar.</p>

<p>"And then,&mdash;what, my friend? I come, I leave
those joys, I come away here, to&mdash;to the locality of
jump-off, as you say,&mdash;and what do I find? First, a
pearl, a saint; for nobleness, a prince, for holiness, an
anchorite of Arabia,&mdash;Le P&egrave;re L'Homme-Dieu! Next,
the ancient friend of my house, who becomes on the
instant mine also, the brother for whom I have
yearned. With these, the graves of my venerable
ancestors, heroes of constancy, who lived for war and
died for faith; graves where I go even now, where I
kneel to pay my duty of respect, to drop the filial
tear!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget your living relations!" I said, with
some malice. "Here is your cousin, coming to meet
us."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<div class='cap'>AN ox-team was lumbering along the road towards
us. The huge oxen lurched from side to side,
half-asleep, making nothing of their load of meal-sacks
piled high in air; their driver walked beside,
half-asleep, too. He was a giant in height (six foot
six, Melody, in his stockings! I have measured him
myself), and his white clothes made him look something
monstrous indeed. Yvon stared and gaped, as
this vision came slowly towards him.</div>

<p>"What&mdash;what is it?" he asked. "Is it a monster?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" I said. "It's only Ham Belfort. How
are you, Ham?"</p>

<p>"Smart!" said Ham. "How be you? Hoish, Star!
haw! Stand still there, will ye?"</p>

<p>The oxen came to a halt willingly enough, and man
and beasts stood regarding us with calm, friendly
eyes. Ham and his oxen looked so much alike, Melody
(the oxen were white, I ought to have said), that
I sometimes thought, if we dressed one of the beasts
up and did away with his horns, people would hardly
know which was which.</p>

<p>"Taking a load over to Cato?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>"</p>

<p>Cato was the nearest town, my dear. It was there
that the weekly boat touched, which was our one link
with the world of cities and railways.</p>

<p>Ham nodded; he was not given to unnecessary
speech.</p>

<p>"Is your wife better? I heard she was poorly."</p>

<p>"No, she ain't! I expect she'll turn up her toes
now most any day."</p>

<p>This seemed awkward. I muttered some expressions
of regret, and was about to move on, when
my companion, who had been gazing speechless
and motionless at the figure before him, caught my
arm.</p>

<p>"Present me!" he whispered. "Holy Blue! this is
my cousin, my own blood! Present me, Jacques!"</p>

<p>Now, I had never had occasion to make a formal
introduction in my life, Melody. I had not yet begun
to act as master of ceremonies at balls, only as fiddler
and call-man; and it is the living truth that the only
form of words I could bring to mind at the moment
was, "Gents, balance to partners!" I almost said it
aloud; but, fortunately, my wits came back, and I
stammered out, sorely embarrassed:</p>

<p>"Ham, this is&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;who&mdash;who is staying
with Father L'Homme-Dieu."</p>

<p>"That so? Pleased to meet you!" and Ham held
out a hand like a shoulder of mutton, and engulfed
the marquis's slender fingers.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to make the acquaintance of Mr.
Belfort," said Ste. Valerie, with winning grace. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
please myself to think that we are related by blood.
My mother was a Bellefort of Blanque; it is the
French form of your name, Mr. Belfort."</p>

<p>"I want to know!" said Ham. "<i>Darned</i> pleased
to meet you!" He laboured for a moment, casting a
glance of appeal at the oxen, who showed no disposition
to assist him; then added, "You're slim-appearin'
for a Belfort; they run consid'able large in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Truly, yes!" cried the marquis, laughing delightedly.
"You desire to show the world that there are
still giants. What pleasure, what rapture, to go
through the crowd of small persons, as myself, as
D'Arthenay here, and exhibit the person of Samson,
of Goliath!"</p>

<p>Ham eyed him gravely. "Meanin' shows?" he
asked, after a pause of reflection. "No, we've never
shew none, as I know of. We've been asked, father
'n' I, to allow guessin' on our weight at fairs and sech,
but we jedged it warn't jest what we cared about
doin'. Sim'lar with shows!"</p>

<p>This speech was rather beyond Ste. Valerie, and
seeing him look puzzled, I struck in, "Mr. Ste. Valerie
wants to see the old graves in the old burying-ground,
Ham. I told him there were plenty of Belforts there,
and spelling the name as he does, with two l's and
an e in the middle."</p>

<p>"I want to know if he spells it that way!" said
Ham, politely. "We jedged they didn't know much
spellin', in them times along back, but I presume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
there's different idees. Does your folks run slim as
a rule?"</p>

<p>"Very slim, my cousin!" said Yvon. "Of my
generation, there is none so great as myself."</p>

<p>"I <i>want</i> to know!" said Ham; and the grave
compassion in his voice was almost too much for
my composure. He seemed to fear that the subject
might be a painful one, and changed it with a visible
effort.</p>

<p>"Well, there's plenty in the old berr'in-ground
spelt both ways. Likely it don't matter to 'em now."</p>

<p>He pondered again, evidently composing a speech;
again he demanded help of the oxen, and went so far
as to examine an ear of the nigh ox with anxious
attention.</p>

<p>"'Pears as if what Belforts is above the sod ought
to see something of ye!" he said at last. "My
woman is sick, and liable to turn&mdash;I should say,
liable to pass away most any time; but if she should
get better, or&mdash;anything&mdash;I should be pleased to
have ye come and stop a spell with us at the grist-mill.
Any of your folks in the grist business?"</p>

<p>"Grisst?" Ste. Valerie looked helplessly at me. I
explained briefly the nature of a grist-mill, and said
truly that Ham's mill was one of the pleasantest
places in the neighbourhood. Yvon was enchanted.
He would come with the most lively pleasure, he
assured Ham, so soon as Madame Belfort's health
should be sufficiently rehabilitated. I remember,
Melody, the pride with which he rolled out that long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
word, and the delight with which he looked at me, to
see if I noticed it.</p>

<p>"Meantime," he added, "I shall haste at the earliest
moment to do myself the honour to call, to make
inquiries for the health of madame, to present my
respectful homages to monsieur your father. He will
permit me to embrace him as a son?"</p>

<p>Fortunately Ham only heard the first part of this
sentence; he responded heartily, begging the marquis
to call at any hour. Then, being at the end of his
talk, he shook hands once more with ponderous good
will, and passed on, he and the oxen rolling along
with equal steps.</p>

<p>Ste. Valerie was silent until Ham was out of earshot;
then he broke out.</p>

<p>"Holy Blue! what a prodigy! You suffer this to
burst upon me, Jacques, without notice, without preparation.
My nerves are permanently shattered. You
tell me, a man; I behold a tower, a mountain, Atlas
crowned with clouds! Thousand thunders! what
bulk! what sinews! and of my race! Amazing effect
of&mdash;what? Climate? occupation? In France, this
race shrinks, diminishes; a rapier, keen if you will,
but slender like a thread; here, it swells, expands,
towers aloft,&mdash;a club of Hercules. And with my
father, who could sit in my pocket, and my grandfather,
who could sit in his! Figure to yourself,
Jacques, that I am called <i>le grand Yvon!</i>" He was
silent for a moment, then broke out again. "But
the mind. D'Arthenay! the brain; how is it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that? Thought,&mdash;a lightning flash! is it not lost,
wandering through a head large like that of an ox?"</p>

<p>I cannot remember in what words I answered him,
Melody. I know I was troubled how to make it clear
to him, and he so different from the other. I seemed
to stand midway between the two, and to understand
both. Half of me seemed to spring up in joy at the
voice of the young foreigner; his lightness, his quickness,
the very way he moved his hands, seemed a part
of my own nature that I had not learned to use, and
now saw reflected in another. I am not sure if I
make myself clear, my child; it was a singular feeling.
But when I would spring forward with him,
and toss my head and wave my hands as he did,&mdash;as
my mother Marie did,&mdash;there was something held
me back; it was the other nature in me, slow and
silent, and&mdash;no! not cold, but loath to show its
warmth, if I may put it so. My father in me kept
me silent many a time when I might have spoken
foolishness. And it was this half, my father's half,
that loved Ham Belfort, and saw the solid sweetness
of nature that made that huge body a temple of good
will, so to speak. He had the kind of goodness that
gives peace and rest to those who lean against it.
His mill was one of the places&mdash;but we shall come
to that by and by!</p>

<p>Walking on as we talked, we soon came to the village,
and I begged my new friend to come in and see
my father and my home. We entered. My father
was standing by the fire, facing the door, with one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hand on the tall mantel-shelf. He was in one of his
waking dreams, and I was struck deeply, Melody, by
the beauty, and, if I may use the word about a plain
man, the majesty of his looks. My companion was
struck, too, for he stopped short, and murmured something
under his breath; I heard the word "Noblesse,"
and thought it not amiss. My father's eyes (they were
extraordinarily bright and blue) were wide open, and
looked through us and beyond us, yet saw nothing, or
nothing that other eyes could see; the tender look was
in them that meant the thought of my mother. But
Abby came quietly round from the corner where she
sat sewing, and laid her hand on his arm, and spoke
clearly, yet not sharply, telling him to look and see,
Jakey had brought a gentleman to see him. Then
the vision passed, and my father looked and saw us,
and came forward with a stately, beautiful way that
he could use, and bade the stranger welcome. Ste.
Valerie bowed low, as he might to a prince. Hearing
that he was a Frenchman, my father seemed pleased.
"My dear wife was a Frenchwoman!" he said. "She
was a musician, sir; I wish you could have heard her
play."</p>

<p>"He was himself also of French descent," Ste. Valerie
reminded him, with another bow; and told of the
ruined tower, and the old friendship between the two
houses. But my father cared nothing for descent.</p>

<p>"Long ago, sir!" he said. "Long ago! I have
nothing to do with the dead of two hundred years
back. I am a plain farmer; my son has learned the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
trade of shoemaking, though he also has some skill
with the fiddle, I am told. Nothing compared to his
mother, but still some skill."</p>

<p>Ste. Valerie looked from one of us to the other. "A
farmer,&mdash;a shoemaker!" he said, slowly. "Strange
country, this! And while your <i>vieille noblesse</i> make
shoes and till the soil, who are these, monsieur, who
live in some of the palaces that I have seen in your
cities? In many, truly, persons of real nobility also,
gentlemen, whether hunting of race or of Nature's
own. But these others? I have seen them; large
persons, both male and female, red as beef, their
grossness illuminated with diamonds of royalty, their
dwelling a magazine from the Rue de la Paix. These
things are shocking to a European, M. D'Arthenay!"
My father looked at him with something like reproof
in his quiet gaze.</p>

<p>"I have never been in cities," he said. "I consider
that a farmer's life may be used as well as
another for the glory of God."</p>

<p>Then, with a wave of his hand, he seemed to put all
this away from him, and with a livelier air asked the
stranger to take supper with us. Abby had been laying
the cloth quietly while we were talking, and my
father would have asked her to sit down with us, but
she slipped away while his face was turned in the
other direction, and though he looked once or twice,
he soon forgot. Poor Abby! I had seen her looking
at him as he talked, and was struck by her intent
expression, as if she would not lose a word he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
say. It seemed natural, though, that he should be her
first thought; he had always been, since my mother
died.</p>

<p>So presently we three sat about the little table, that
was gay with flowers and pretty dishes. I saw Ste.
Valerie's wondering glances; was it thus, he seemed
to ask, that a farmer lived, who had no woman to care
for him? My father saw, too, and was pleased as I
had rarely seen him. He did not smile, but his face
seemed to fill with light.</p>

<p>"My wife, sir," he said, "loved to see things bright
and adorned. I try&mdash;my son and I try&mdash;to keep the
table as she would like it. I formerly thought these
matters sinful, but I have been brought to a clearer
vision,&mdash;through affliction." (Strange human nature,
Melody, my child! he was moved to say these words
to a stranger, which he could not have said to me, his
son!) "She had the French taste and lightness, my
wife Mary. I should have been proud to have you see
her, sir; the Lord was mindful of His own, and took
her away from a world of sin and suffering."</p>

<p>The light died out; his eyes wandered for a moment,
and then set, in a way I knew; and I began to talk
fast of the first thing that came into my mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<div class='cap'>I COULD write a whole book about the summer
that followed this spring day, when I first met
Yvon de Ste. Valerie. Yes, and the book would be
so long that no mortal man would have time to read
it; but I must hurry on with my story; for truth to
tell, my eyes are beginning to be not quite what they
have been,&mdash;they'll serve my time, I hope, but my
writing was always small and crabbed,&mdash;and I must
say what I have to say, shorter than I have begun,
I perceive. After the first week, then, which he
spent with Father L'Homme-Dieu, Yvon came over
to our village and boarded with Abby Rock. The
Father was pleased to have him come; he knew it
would be a great thing for me, and he thought it
would not hurt the young gentleman to live for a
time with plain folks. But if he thought Yvon would
look down on our village people, or hold himself
better than they, he was mistaken. In a week the
young Frenchman was the son and brother of the
whole village. Our people were dear, good people,
Melody; but I sometimes thought them a little dull;
that was after my mother's death. I suppose I had
enough of another nature in me to be troubled by
this, but not enough to know how to help it; later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I learned a little more; but indeed, I should justly
say that my lessons were begun by Yvon de Ste.
Valerie. It was from him I learned, my dear, that
nothing in this world of God's is dull or common,
unless we bring dull hearts and dim eyes to look at
it. It is the vision, the vision, that makes the life;
that vision which you, my child, with your sightless
eyes, have more clearly than almost any one I have
known.</div>

<p>He was delighted with everything. He wanted to
know about everything. He declared that he should
write a book, when he returned to France, all about
our village, which he called Paradise. It is a pretty
place, or was as I remember it. He must see how
bread was made, how wool was spun, how rugs were
braided. Many's the time I have found him sitting
in some kitchen, winding the great balls of rags
neatly cut and stitched together, listening like a child
while the woman told him of how many rugs she had
made, and how many quilts she had pieced; and she
more pleased than he, and thinking him one wonder
and herself another.</p>

<p>He was in love with all the girls; so he said, and
they had nothing to say against it. But yet there
was no girl could carry a sore heart, for he treated
them all alike. In this I have thought that he
showed a sense and kindness beyond his years or
his seeming giddiness; for some of them might well
enough have had their heads turned by a gentleman,
and one so handsome, and with a tongue that liked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
better to say "Angel!" to a woman than anything
more suited to the average of the sex. But no girl
in the village could think herself for a moment the
favoured maiden; for if one had the loveliest eyes in
the world, the next had a cheek of roses and velvet,
and the third walked like a goddess, and the fourth
charmed his soul out of his body every time she
opened her lips. And so it went on, till all understood
it for play, and the pleasantest play they ever
saw. But he vowed from the first that he would
marry Abby Rock, and no other living woman.
Abby always said yes, she would marry him the
first Sunday that came in the middle of the week;
and then she would try to make him eat more,
though he took quite as much as was good for him,
not being used to our hearty ways, especially in the
mornings. Abby was as pleased with him as a child
with a kitten, and it was pretty to see them together.</p>

<p>"Light of my life!" Yvon would cry. "You are
exquisite this morning! Your eyes are like stars on
the sea. Come, then, angelic Rock, <i>Rocher des Anges</i>,
and waltz with your Ste. Valerie!" And he would
take Abby by the waist, and try to waltz with her,
till she reached for the broomstick. I have told you,
Melody, that Abby was the homeliest woman the
Lord ever made. Not that I ever noticed it, for
the kindness in her face was so bright I never saw
anything but that; but strangers would speak of it,
and Yvon himself, before he heard her speak, made
a little face, I remember, that only I could see, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
whispered, had I brought him to lodge with Medusa?
Medusa, indeed! I think Abby's smile would soften
any stone that had ever had a human heart beating in
it, instead of the other way.</p>

<p>But the place in the village that Yvon loved best
was Ham Belfort's grist-mill; and when he comes to
my mind, in these days, when sadder visions are
softened and partly dim to me, it is mostly there
that I seem to see my friend.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, one of the pleasantest places
in the world. To begin with, the colour and softness
of it all! The window-glass was powdered white,
and the light came through white and dim, and lay
about in long powdery shafts, and these were white,
too, instead of yellow. So was the very dust white;
or rather, it was good oatmeal and wheat flour that
lay thick and crumbling on the rafters above, and the
wheels and pulleys and other gear. As for Ham,
the first time Yvon saw him in the mill, he cried out
"Mont Blanc!" and would not call him anything
else for some time. For Ham was whiter than all
the rest, in his working-dress, cap and jacket and
breeches, white to begin with, and powdered soft and
furry, like his face and eyebrows, with the flying meal.
Down-stairs there was plenty of noise; oats and corn
and wheat pouring into the hoppers, and the great
stones going round and round, and wheels creaking
and buzzing, and belts droning overhead. Yvon
could not talk at all here, and I not too much; only
Ham's great voice and his father's (old Mr. Belfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was Ham over again, gray under the powder, instead
of pink and brown) could roar on quietly, if I may
so express it, rising high above the rattle and clack of
the machinery, and yet peaceful as the stream outside
that turned the great wheels and set the whole thing
flying. So, as he could not live long without talking,
Yvon loved best the loft above, where the corn was
stored, both in bags and unground, and where the big
blowers were, and the old green fire-engine, and many
other curious things. I had known them all my life,
but they were strange to him, and he never tired, any
more than if he had been a boy of ten. Sometimes I
wondered if he could be twenty-two, as he said;
sometimes when he would swing himself on to the
slide, where the bags of meal and flour were loaded
on to the wagons. Well, Melody, it was a thing to
charm a boy's heart; it makes mine beat a little
quicker to think of it, even now; perhaps I was not
much wiser than my friend, after all. This was a
slide some three feet wide, and say seven or eight
feet long, sloping just enough to make it pleasant,
and polished till it shone, from the bags that rubbed
along it day after day, loading the wagons as they
backed up under it. Nothing would do but we must
slide down this, as if, I say, we were children of ten
years old, coming down astride of the meal-sacks, and
sending a plump of flour into the air as we struck the
wagon. Father Belfort thought Yvon was touched
in the brain; but he was all the more gentle on this
account. Boys were not allowed on the slide, unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it were a holiday, or some boy had had a hard time
with sickness or what not; it was a treat rarely given,
and the more prized for that. But Yvon and I might
slide as much as we pleased. "Keep him cheerful,
Jakey!" the dear old man would say. "Let him kibobble
all he's a mind to! I had a brother once was
looney, and we kep' him happy all his life long, jest
lettin' him stay a child, as the Lord intended. Six foot
eight he stood, and weighed four hundred pounds."</p>

<p>And when the boy was tired of playing we would
sit down together, and call to Ham to come up and
talk; for even better than sliding, Yvon loved to hear
his cousin talk. You can take the picture into your
mind, Melody, my dear. The light dim and white,
as I have told you, and very soft, falling upon rows
and rows of full sacks, ranged like soldiers; the great
white miller sitting with his back against one of
these, and his legs reaching anywhere,&mdash;one would
not limit the distance; and running all about him,
without fear, or often indeed marking him in any way,
a multitude of little birds, sparrows they were, who
spent most of their life here among the meal-sacks.
Sometimes they hopped on his shoulder, or ran over
his head, but they never minded his talking, and he
sat still, not liking to disturb them. It was a pretty
sight of extremes in bulk, and in nature too; for
while Ham was afraid to move, for fear of troubling
them, they would bustle up to him and cock their
heads, and look him in the eye as if they said, "Come
on, and show me which is the biggest!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>There you see him, my dear; and opposite to him
you might see a great mound or heap of corn that
shone yellow as gold. "<i>Le Mont d'Or</i>," Yvon called
it; and nothing would do but he must sit on this,
lifted high above us, yet sliding down every now and
then, and climbing up again, with the yellow grains
slipping away under him, smooth and bright as pebbles
on the shore. And for myself, I was now here
and now there, as I found it more comfortable, being
at home in every part of the friendly place.</p>

<p>How we talked! Ham was mostly a silent fellow;
but he grew to love the lad so that the strings of his
tongue were loosened as they had never been before.
His woman, too (as we say in those parts, Melody;
wife is the more genteel expression, but I never heard
Ham use it. My father, on the other hand, never
said anything else; a difference in the fineness of ear,
my dear, I have always supposed),&mdash;his woman, I
say, or wife, had not "turned up her toes," but
recovered, and as he was a faithful and affectionate
man, his heart was enlarged by this also. However
it was, he talked more in those weeks, I suppose, than
in the rest of his life put together. Bits of his talk,
homely and yet wise, come back to me across the
sixty years. One day, I remember, we talked of life,
as young men love to talk. We said nothing that
had not been said by young men since Abel's time, I
do suppose, but it was all new to us; and indeed, my
two companions had fresh ways of putting things that
seemed to make them their own in a manner. Yvon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
maintained that gaiety was the best that life had to
give; that the butterfly being the type of the human
soul, the nearer man could come to his prototype, the
better for him and for all. Sorrow and suffering, he
cried, were a blot on the scheme, a mistake, a concession
to the devil; if all would but spread their
wings and fly away from it, houp! it would no longer
exist. "<i>Et voil&agrave;!</i>"</p>

<p>We laughed, but shook our heads. Ham meditated
awhile, and then began in his strong, quiet voice, a
little husky, which I always supposed was from his
swallowing so much raw meal and flour.</p>

<p>"That's one way of lookin' at it, Eavan; I expect
that's your French view, likely; looks different, you
see, to folks livin' where there's cold, and sim'lar
things, as butterflies couldn't find not to say comfortable.
Way I look at it, it always seemed to me
that grain come as near it as anything, go to compare
things. Livin' in a grist-mill, I presume, I git into a
grainy way of lookin' at the world. Now, take
wheat! It comes up pooty enough, don't it, in the
fields? Show me a field o' wheat, and I'll show you as
handsome a thing as is made this side of Jordan.
Wal, that might be a little child, we'll say; if there's
a thing handsomer than a field o' wheat, it's a
little child. But bimeby comes reapin' and all, and
then the trouble begins. First, it's all in the rough,
ain't it, chaff and all, mixed together; and has to go
through the thresher? Well, maybe that's the lickin's
a boy's father gives him. He don't like 'em,&mdash;I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
feel Father Belfort's lickin's yet,&mdash;but they git red of
a sight o' chaff, nonsense, airs, and what not, for him.
Then it comes here to the grist-mill. Well, I may be
gittin' a little mixed, boys, but you can foller if you
try, I expect. Say that's startin' out in life, leavin'
home, or bindin' to a trade, or whatever. Well, it
goes into the duster, and there it gets more chaff
blowed off'n it. And from the duster it goes into the
hopper, and down in betwixt the stones; and them
stones grind, grind, grind, till you'd think the life was
ground clear'n out of it. But 'tain't so; contrary!
That's affliction; the upper and nether millstone&mdash;Scriptur!
Maybe sickness, maybe losin' your folks,
maybe business troubles,&mdash;whichever comes is the
wust, and more than any mortal man ever had to bear
before. Well, now, see! That stuff goes in there,
grain; it comes out wheat flour! Then you take and
wet it down and put your 'east in,&mdash;that's thought, I
expect, or brains,&mdash;or might be a woman,&mdash;and you
bake it in the oven,&mdash;call that&mdash;well, 'git-up-and-git'
is all I can think of, but I should aim for a better
word, talkin' to a foreigner."</p>

<p>"Purpose," I suggested.</p>

<p>"That's it! purpose! bake it in that oven, and you
have a loaf of wheat bread, riz bread; and that's the
best eatin' that's ben invented yet. That's food for
the hungry,&mdash;which raw wheat ain't, except it's
cattle. But now you hear me, boys! To git wheat
bread, riz bread, you've got to have wheat to begin
with. You've got to have good stuff to start with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
You can't make good riz bread out o' field corn. But
take good stuff and grind it in the Lord's mill, and
you've got the best this world can give. That's my
philos'phy!"</p>

<p>He nodded his head to the last words, which fell
slowly and weightily; and as he did so, the sparrow
that had been perched on his head ran down his nose
and fluttered in his face, seeming to ask how he dared
make such a disturbance. "I beg your pardon, I'm
sure!" said Ham. "I'd no notion I was interferin'
with you. Why didn't you hit one of your size?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was in the grist-mill loft, too, that Yvon brought
forward his great plan, what he called the project
of his life,&mdash;that of taking me back to France with
him. I remember how I laughed when he spoke of
it; it seemed as easy for me to fly to the moon as to
cross the ocean, a thing which none of my father's
people had done since the first settlers came. My
mother, to be sure, had come from France, but that
was a different matter; nor had her talk of the sea
made me feel any longing for it. But Yvon had set
his heart on it; and his gay talk flowed round and
over my objections, as your brook runs over stones. I
must go; I should go! I should see my tower, the
castle of my fathers. It was out of repair, he could
not deny that; but what! a noble ch&acirc;teau might
still be made of it. Once restored, I would bring my
father over to end his days with me, under the roof
that alone could properly shelter a person of such
nobility. He had won my father's heart, too, Melody,
as he won all hearts; they understood each other in
some fine, far-off way, that was beyond me. I sometimes
felt a little pang that was not, I am glad to
believe, jealousy, only a wish that I might be more
like Yvon, more like my mother's people, since it was
that so charmed my poor father.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked Yvon how I was to live, how my <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ' ather'">father</ins> and
I should support ourselves in our restored castle, and
whose money would pay for the restoration. He
threw this aside, and said that money was base, and
he refused to consider it. It had nothing to do with
the feelings, less than nothing with true nobility.
Should I then take my cobbler's bench, I asked him,
and make shoes for him and his neighbours, while my
father tilled the ground? But then, for the first
and almost the last time, I saw my friend angry; he
became like a naughty, sulky child, and would hardly
speak to me for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>But he clung to his idea, none the less; and, to my
great surprise, my father took it up after awhile.
He thought well, he told me, of Yvon's plan; Yvon
had talked it over with him. He, himself, was much
stronger than he had been (this was true, Melody, or
nothing would have induced me to leave him even for
a week; Yvon had been like a cordial to him, and he
had not had one of his seizures for weeks); and I
could perfectly leave him under Abby's care. I had
not been strong myself, a voyage might be a good
thing for me; and no doubt, after seeing with my own
eyes the matters this young lad talked of, I would be
glad enough to come home and settle to my trade, and
would have much to think over as I sat at my bench.
It might be that a man was better for seeing something
of the world; he had never felt that the Lord
intended him to travel, having brought to his own
door all that the world held of what was best (he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
paused here, and said "Mary!" two or three times
under his breath, a way he had when anything moved
him), but it was not so with me, nor likely to be, and
it might be a good thing for me to go. He had money
laid by that would be mine, and I could take a portion
of that, and have my holiday.</p>

<p>These are not his very words, Melody, but the sense
of them. I was strangely surprised; and being young
and eager, the thought came upon me for the first
time that this thing was really possible; and with the
thought came the longing, and a sense which I had
only felt dimly before, and never let speak plain to
me, as it were. I suppose every young man feels the
desire to go somewhere else than the place where he
has always abided. The world may be small and
wretched, as some tell him, or great and golden,
according to the speech of others; he believes neither
one nor the other, he must see it with his own eyes.
So this grew upon me, and I brooded over it, till my
life was full of voices calling, and hands pointing
across the sea, to the place which is Somewhere Else.
I talked with Father L'Homme-Dieu, and he bade me
go, and gave me his blessing; he had no doubt it was
my pleasure, and might be my duty, in the way of
making all that might be made of my life. I talked
with Abby; she grew pale, and had but one word,
"Your father!" Something in her tone spoke loud
to my heart, and there came into my mind a thought
that I spoke out without waiting for it to cool.</p>

<p>"Won't you marry my father, Abby?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Abby's hands fell in her lap, and she turned so
white that I was frightened; still, I went on. "You
love him better than any one else, except me." (She
put her hand on her heart, I remember, Melody, and
kept it there while I talked; she made no other sign.)</p>

<p>"And you can care for him ten times better than
I could, you know that, Abby, dear; and&mdash;and&mdash;I
know M&egrave;re-Marie would be pleased."</p>

<p>I looked in her face, and, young and thoughtless as
I was, I saw that there which made me turn away
and look out of the window. She did not speak at
once; but presently said in her own voice, or only a
little changed, "Don't speak like that, Jakey dear!
You know I'll care for your father all I can, without
that;" and so put me quietly aside, and talked about
Yvon, and how good Father L'Homme-Dieu had been
to me.</p>

<p>But I, being a lad that liked my own way when
it did not seem a wrong one (and not only then,
perhaps, my dear; not only then!), could not let
my idea go so easily. It seemed to me a fine thing,
and one that would bring happiness to one, at least;
and I questioned whether the other would mind it
much, being used to Abby all his life, and a manner
of cousin to her, and she my mother's first
friend when she came to the village, and her best
friend always. I was very young, Melody, and I
spoke to my father about it; that same day it was,
while my mind was still warm. If I had waited over
night, I might have seen more clear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father," said I; we were sitting in the kitchen
after supper; it was a summer evening, soft and fair,
but a little fire burned low on the hearth, and he sat
near it, having grown chilly this last year.</p>

<p>"Father, would you think it possible to change
your condition?"</p>

<p>He turned his eyes on me, with an asking look.</p>

<p>"Would you think it possible to marry Abby
Rock?" I asked; and felt my heart sink, somehow,
even with saying the words. My father hardly seemed
to understand at first; he repeated, "Marry Abby
Rock!" as if he saw no sense in the words; then
it came to him, and I saw a great fire of anger grow
in his eyes, till they were like flame in the dusk.</p>

<p>"I am a married man!" he said, slowly. "Are
you a child, or lost to decency, that you speak of this
to a married man?"</p>

<p>He paused, but I found nothing to say. He went
on, his voice, that was even when he began, dropping
deeper, and sinking as I never heard it.</p>

<p>"The Lord in His providence saw fit to take away
my wife, your mother, before sickness, or age, or sorrow
could strike her. I was left, to suffer some small
part of what my sins merit, in the land of my sojourn.
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the Lord. But because my
wife Mary,&mdash;my wife Mary" (he lingered over the
words, loving them so), "is a glorified spirit in
another world, and I am a prisoner here, is she any
less my wife, and I her faithful husband? You are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
my son, and hers,&mdash;hers, Jakey; but if you ever
say such words to me again, one house will not hold
us both." He turned his head away, and I heard him
murmuring under his breath, "Mary! Mary!" as I
have said his way was; and I was silent and ashamed,
fearing to speak lest I make matters worse; and so
presently I slipped out and left him; and my fine
plan came to naught, save to make two sad hearts
sadder than they were.</p>

<p>But it was to be! Looking back, Melody, after
fifty years, I am confident that it was the will of
God, and was to be. In three weeks from that
night, I was in France.</p>

<p>I pass over the wonder of the voyage; the sorrowful
parting, too, that came before it, though I left all
well, and my father to all appearances fully himself.
I pass over these, straight to the night when Yvon
and I arrived at his home in the south of France.
We had been travelling several days since landing,
and had stopped for two days in Paris. My head
was still dizzy with the wonder and the brightness
of it all. There was something homelike, too, in it.
The very first people I met seemed to speak of my
mother to me, as they flung out their hands and
laughed and waved, so different from our ways at
home. I was to see more of this, and to feel the two
parts in me striving against each other; but it is
early to speak of that.</p>

<p>The evening was warm and bright, as we came near
Ch&acirc;teau Claire; that was the name of my friend's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
home. A carriage had met us at the station, and as
we drove along through a pretty country (though
nothing to New England, I must always think), Yvon
was deep in talk with the driver, who was an old servant,
and full of news. I listened but little, being
eager to see all my eyes could take in. Vines swung
along the sides of the road, in a way that I always
found extremely graceful, and wished we might have
our grapes so at home. I was marvelling at the
straw-roofed houses and the plots of land about them
no bigger than Abby Rock's best table-cloth, when
suddenly Yvon bade pull up, and struck me on the
shoulder. "<i>D'Arthenay, tenez foi!</i>" he cried in my
ear; and pointed across the road. I turned, and saw
in the dusk a stone tower, square and bold, covered
with ivy, the heavy growth of years. It was all dim
in the twilight, but I marked the arched door, with
carving on the stone work above it, and the great
round window that stared like a blind eye. I felt
a tugging at my heart, Melody; the place stood so
lonely and forlorn, yet with a stateliness that seemed
noble. I could not but think of my father, and that
he stood now like his own tower, that he would never
see.</p>

<p>"Shall we alight now?" asked Yvon. "Or will
you rather come by daylight, Jacques, to see the place
in beauty of sunshine?"</p>

<p>I chose the latter, knowing that his family would
be looking for him; and no one waited for me in La
Tour D'Arthenay, as it was called in the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Soon we were driving under a great gateway, and
into a courtyard, and I saw the long front of a great
stone house, with a light shining here and there.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Jacques!" cried Yvon, springing down
as the great door opened; "welcome to Ch&acirc;teau Claire!
Enter, then, my friend, as thy fathers entered in days
of old!"</p>

<p>The light was bright that streamed from the doorway;
I was dazzled, and stumbled a little as I went
up the steps; the next moment I was standing in a
wide hall, and a young lady was running forward to
throw her arms round Yvon's neck.</p>

<p>He embraced her tenderly, kissing her on both
cheeks in the French manner; then, still holding her
hand, he turned to me, and presented me to his sister.
"This is my friend," he said, "of whom I wrote you,
Valerie; M. D'Arthenay, of La Tour D'Arthenay,
Mademoiselle de Ste. Valerie!"</p>

<p>The young lady curtseyed low, and then, with a
look at Yvon, gave me her hand in a way that made
me feel I was welcome. A proper manner of shaking
hands, my dear child, is a thing I have always impressed
upon my pupils. There is nothing that so
helps or hinders the first impression, which is often
the last impression. When a person flaps a limp
hand at me, I have no desire for it, if it were the
finest hand in the world; nor do I allow any tricks of
fashion in this matter, as sometimes seen, with waggling
this way or that; it is a very offensive thing.
Neither must one pinch with the finger-tips, nor grind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the bones of one's friend, as a strong man will be apt
to do, mistaking violence for warmth; but give a firm,
strong, steady pressure with the hand itself, that
carries straight from the heart the message, "I am
glad to see you!"</p>

<p>This is a speech I have made many times; I have
kept the young lady waiting in the hall while I made
it to you, thereby failing in good manners.</p>

<p>At the first glance, Valerie de Ste. Valerie seemed
hardly more than a child, for she was slight and
small; my first thought was, how like she was to her
brother, with the same fair hair and dark, bright blue
eyes. She was dressed in a gown of white dimity,
very fine, with ruffles at the foot of the skirt, and a
fichu of the same crossed on her breast. I must say
to you, my dear Melody, that it was from this first
sight of her that I took the habit of observing a
woman's dress always. A woman of any age taking
pains to adorn herself, it has always seemed to me
boorish not to take careful note of the particulars of a
toilet. Mlle. de Ste. Valerie wore slippers of blue
kid, her feet being remarkably slender and well-shaped;
and a blue ribbon about her hair, in the
manner of a double fillet. After a few gracious
words, she went forward into a room at one side of
the hall, we following, and here I was presented to
her aunt, a lady who had lived with the brother and
sister since their parents' death, a few years before
this time. Of this lady, who was never my friend,
I will say little. Her first aspect reminded me of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
frozen vinegar, carved into human shape; yet she had
fine manners, and excused herself with dignity for
not rising to salute us, being lame, as her nephew
knew. For Yvon, though he kissed her hand (a
thing I had never seen before), I thought there was
little love in the greeting; nor did he seem oppressed
with grief when she excused herself also from coming
to sup with us.</p>

<p>At supper, we three together at a table that was
like a small island of warm pleasantness in the great
hollow dining-hall, Yvon was full of wild talk, we
two others mostly listening. He had everything to
tell, about the voyage, about his new friends, all of
whom were noble and beautiful and clever.</p>

<p>"Figure to yourself, Valerie!" he cried. "I found
our family there; the most noble, the most gigantic
persons in the world! Thy cousin Jambon, it is a
giant, eight feet high, at the least. He denies it, he
is the soul of modesty, but I have eyes, and I see.
This man has the soul greater than his vast body;
we have discussed life, death, in short, the Infinite,
we three, Jambon and Jacques and I. He has
a father&mdash;both have fathers! it is the course of
nature. The father of D'Arthenay here is a prince,
a diamond of the old rock; ah! if our father of
sainted memory could have known M. D'Arthenay
<i>p&egrave;re</i>, Valerie, he would have known the brother of
his soul, as their sons know each other. Not so,
Jacques? But <i>le p&egrave;re</i> Bellefort, Valerie, he is gigantesque,
like his son. These rocks, these towers, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have the hearts of children, the smiles of a crowing
infant. You laugh, D'Arthenay? I say something
incorrect? how then?"</p>

<p>He had said nothing incorrect, I told him; I only
thought it would be surprising to hear Father Belfort
crow, as he hardly spoke three times in the day.</p>

<p>"True! but what silence! the silence of fullness,
of benevolence. Magnificent persons, not to be approached
for goodness."</p>

<p>So he rattled on, while his sister's blue eyes grew
wider and wider. I did not in truth know what to
say. I hardly recognised our plain people in the
human wonders that Yvon was describing; I could
hardly keep my countenance when he told her about
Mlle. Roc, an angel of pious dignity. I fancied
Abby transported here, and set down at this table,
all flowers and perfumed fruits and crimson-shaded
lights; the idea seemed to me comical, though now
I know that Abby Rock would do grace to any table,
if it were the President's. I was young then, and
knew little. And so the lad talked on and on, and
his fair young lady sister listened and marvelled,
and I held my tongue and looked about me, and wondered
was I awake or asleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE pictures come back fast and thick upon my
mind. I suppose every life, even the quietest,
has its picture-book, its record of some one time that
seems filled with beauty or joy as a cup that brims
over. Every one, perhaps, could write his own fairy
story; this is mine.</div>

<p>The next day Yvon had a thousand things to show
me. The ladies sat in their own room in the morning,
and the rest of the castle was our own. It
amazed me, being a great building, and the first
of the kind I had seen. Terraces of stone ran about
the house, except on the side of the courtyard, and
these were set with flowering shrubs in great stone
pots, that would take two men to lift. Beyond the
terraces the ground fell away in soft banks and
hollows to where I heard a brook running through
a wood-piece. Inside, the rooms, very lofty and
spacious, were dark to my eyes, partly from the
smallness of the windows, partly from the dark
carved wood that was everywhere, on floor and walls
and ceilings. I could never be at home, I thought,
in such a place; though I never found elsewhere
such a fine quality of floor; smooth in the perfect
degree, yet not too slippery for firm treading, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
springing to the foot in a way that was next to dance
music for suggestion. I said as much to Yvon, and
he caught the idea flying, as was his way, and ran to
bring his sister, bidding me get my fiddle on the
instant. We were in a long hall, rather narrow, but
with excellent space for a few <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'couple'">couples</ins>, let alone one.
Mlle. de Ste. Valerie came running, her hand in her
brother's, a little out of breath from his suddenness,
and in the prettiest morning dress of blue muslin. I
played my best waltz, and the two waltzed. This is
one of the brightest pictures in my book, Melody.
The young lady had perfect grace of motion, and had
been well taught; I knew less about the matter than
I do now, but still enough to recognise fine dancing
when I saw it; her brother was a partner worthy of
her. I have seldom had more pure pleasure in playing
dance music, and I should have been willing it
had lasted all day; but it was not long before a
sour-faced maid came and said my Lady had sent her
to say mademoiselle should be at her studies; and
she ran away laughing, yet sorry to go, and dropped
a little running curtsey at the door, very graceful,
such as I have never seen another person make.</p>

<p>The room was darker when she was gone; but
Yvon cried to me I must see the armory, and the
chapel, and a hundred other sights. I followed him
like a child, my eyes very round, I doubt not, and
staring with all my might. The armory was another
of the long halls or corridors that ran along the sides of
the courtyard. Here were weapons of all kinds, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
chiefly swords; swords of every possible make and
size, some of great beauty, others clumsy enough,
that looked as if bears should handle them. I had
never held a sword in my hand,&mdash;how should I?&mdash;but
Yvon vowed I must learn to fence, and told some
story of an ancestor of mine who was the best swordsman
in the country, and kept all comers at bay in
some old fight long ago. I took the long bit of
springy steel, and found it extraordinary comfortable
to the hand. Practice with the fiddle-bow since early
childhood gave, I may suppose, strength and quickness
to the turn of my wrist; however it was, the
marquis cried out that I was born for the sword; and
in a few minutes again cried to know who had taught
me tricks of fence. Honesty knows, I had had no
teaching; only my eye caught his own motions, and
my hand and wrist answered instantly, being trained
to ready obedience. I felt a singular joy in this exercise,
Melody. In grace and dexterity it equals the
violin; with this difference, which keeps the two the
width of the world apart, that the one breeds trouble
and strife, while the other may, under Providence,
soothe human ills more than any other one thing,
save the kindly sound of the human voice.</p>

<p>Make the best defence I could, it was not long before
Yvon sent my foil flying from my hand; but still
he professed amazement at my ready mastering of the
art, and I felt truly that it was natural to me, and
that with a few trials I might do as well as he.</p>

<p>Next I must see the chapel, very ancient, but kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
smart with candles and crimson velvet cushions. I
could not warm to this, feeling the four plain walls of
a meeting-house the only thing that could enclose my
religious feelings with any comfort; and these not to
compare with a free hillside, or the trees of a wood
when the wind moves in them. And then we went to
the stables, and the gardens, laid out very stately, and
his sister's own rose garden, the pleasantest place in
the whole, or so I thought.</p>

<p>So with one thing and another, it was late afternoon
before Yvon remembered that I must not sleep again
without visiting my own tower, as he would call it;
and for this, the young lady had leave to go with us.
It was a short walk, not more than half a mile, and
in a few minutes we were looking up at the tower,
that seemed older and sadder by day than it had done
in the evening dimness. It stood alone. The body
of what had been behind and beside it was gone, but
we could trace the lines of a large building, the
foundations still remaining; and here and there were
piles of cut stone, the same stone as that in the tower.
Yvon told me that ever since the castle had begun
to fall into decay (being long deserted), the country
people around had been in the habit of mending their
houses, and building them indeed, often, from the
stone of the old ch&acirc;teau. He pointed to one cottage
and another, standing around at little distance. "They
are dogs," he cried, "that have each a bit of the lion's
skin. Ah, Jacques! but for my father of blessed
memory, thy tower would have gone in the same way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
He vowed, when he came of age, that this desecration
should go no further. He brought the priest, and
together they laid a fine curse upon whoever should
move another stone from the ruins, or lay hands on
La Tour D'Arthenay. Since then, no man touches
this stone. It remains, as you see. It has waited
till this day, for thee, its propriety."</p>

<p>He had not quite the right word, Melody, but I had
not the heart to correct him, being more moved by
the thing than I could show reason for. Inside the
tower there was a stone staircase, that went steeply
up one side, or rather the front it was, for from it we
could step across to a wide stone shelf that stood out
under the round window. It might have been part of
a great chimney-piece, such as there still were in
Ch&acirc;teau Claire. The ivy had reached in through the
empty round, and covered this stone with a thick mat,
more black than green. Though ready enough to
step on this myself, I could not think it fit for Mlle.
de Ste. Valerie, and took the liberty to say so; but
she laughed, and told me she had climbed to this
perch a hundred times. She was light as a leaf, and
when I saw her set her foot in her brother's hand and
spring across the empty space from the stair to the
shelf, it seemed no less than if a wind had blown her.
Soon we were all three crouching or kneeling on the
stone, with our elbows in the curve of the great window,
looking out on the prospect. A fair one it was,
of fields and vineyards, with streams winding about,
but very small. They spoke of rivers, but I saw none.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
It was the same with the hills, which Yvon bade me
see here and there; little risings, that would not
check the breath in a running man. For all that, the
country was a fine country, and I praised it honestly,
though knowing in my heart that it was but a poor
patch beside our own. I was thinking this, when the
young lady turned to me, and asked, in her gracious
way, would I be coming back, I and my people, to
rebuild Ch&acirc;teau D'Arthenay?</p>

<p>"It was the finest in the county, so the old books
say!" she told me. "There was a hall for dancing,
a hundred feet long, and once the Sieur D'Arthenay
gave a ball for the king, Henri Quatre it was, and the
hall was lighted with a thousand tapers of rose-coloured
wax, set in silver sconces. How that must
have been pretty, M. D'Arthenay!"</p>

<p>I thought of our kitchen at home, and the glass
lamps that M&egrave;re-Marie kept shining with such care;
but before I could speak, Yvon broke in. "He shall
come! I tell him he shall come, Valerie! All my
life I perish, thou knowest it, for a companion of my
sex, of my age. Thou art my angel, Valerie, but
thou art a woman, and soon, too, thou wilt leave me.
Alone, a hermit in my ch&acirc;teau, my heart desolate,
how to support life? It is for this that I cry to the
friend of my house to return to his country, the country
of his race; to bring here his respected father, to
plant a vineyard, a little corn, a little fruit,&mdash;briefly,
to live. Observe!" Instantly his hands fluttered
out, pointing here and there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jacques, observe, I implore you! This tower; it
is now uninhabited, is it not? you can answer me that,
though you have been here but a day."</p>

<p>As he waited for an answer, I replied that it certainly
was vacant, so far as I could see; except that
there must be bats and owls, I thought, in the thickness
of the ivy trees.</p>

<p>"Perfectly! Except for these animals, there is
none to dispute your entrance. The tower is solid,&mdash;of
a solidity! Cannon must be brought, to batter
down these walls. Instead of battering, we restore,
we construct. With these brave walls to keep out
the cold, you construct within&mdash;a dwelling! vast, I
do not say; palatial, I do not say; but ample for two
persons, who&mdash;who have lived together, <i>&agrave; deux</i>, not
requiring separate suites of apartments." He waved
his hand in such a manner that I saw long sets of
rooms opening one after another, till the eye was
lost in them.</p>

<p>"Here, where we now are posed, is your own room,
Jacques. For you this view of Paradise. Monsieur
your father will not so readily mount the stairs, becoming
in future years infirm, though now a tree, an
oak, massive and erect. We build for the future,
D'Arthenay! Below, then, the paternal apartments,
the salon, perhaps a small room for guns and dogs
and appliances." Another wave set off a square
space, where we could almost see the dogs leaping
and crouching.</p>

<p>"Behind again, the kitchens, offices, what you will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
A few of these stones transported, erected; glass,
carpets, a fireplace,&mdash;the place lives in my eyes,
Jacques! Let us return to the ch&acirc;teau, that I set all
on paper. You forget that I study architecture, that
I am a drawsman, hein? Ten minutes, a sheet of
drawing-paper,&mdash;pff! Ch&acirc;teau D'Arthenay lives before
you, ready for habitation on the instant."</p>

<p>I saw it all, Melody; I saw it all! Sometimes I
see it now, in an old man's dream. Now, of course,
it is wild and misty as a morning fog curling off the
hills; but then, it seemed hardly out of reach for the
moment. Listening to my friend's eager voice, and
watching his glowing face, there came to life in me
more and more strongly the part that answered to
him. I also was young; I also had the warm French
blood burning in me. In height, in strength, perhaps
even in looks, I was not his inferior; he was noble,
and my fathers had stood beside his in battle, hundreds
of times.</p>

<p>I felt in a kind of fire, and courted the heat even
while it burned me. I answered Yvon, laughing, and
said surely I would have no other architect for my
castle. Mlle. de Ste. Valerie joined in, and told me
where I should buy carpets, and what flowers I should
plant in my garden.</p>

<p>"Roses, M. D'Arthenay!" she cried. "Roses are
the best, for the masses. A few gillyflowers I advise,
they are so sweet; and plenty of lilies, the white and
yellow. Oh! I have a lily with brown stripes, the
most beautiful! you shall have a bulb of it; I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
start it for you myself, in a stone pot. You must
have a little conservatory, too, for winter plants; one
cannot live without flowers, even in winter. All winter,
when no longer many flowers bloom out-of-doors,
though always some, always my hardy roses, then I
live half my day in the conservatory. You shall have
some of my flowers; oh, yes, I can spare you plenty."</p>

<p>She was so like her brother! There was the same
pretty eagerness, the same fire of kindliness and good
will, hurrying both along to say they knew not what.
I could only thank her; and the very beauty and
sweetness of her struck all at once a sadness on my
merriment; and I saw for a moment that this was all
a fleeting wreath of fog, as I said; yet all the more
for that strove to grasp it and hold it fast.</p>

<p>The sun went down behind the low hills, and the
young lady cried that she must hasten home; her aunt
would be vexed at her for staying so long. Yvon said,
his faith, she might be vexed. If Mlle. de Ste. Valerie
might not go out with her brother, the head of her
house and her natural guardian, he knew not with
whom she might go; and muttered under his breath
something I did not hear. So we went back to the
ch&acirc;teau, and still I was in the bright dream, shutting
my eyes when it seemed like to break away from me.
The evening was bright and joyous, like the one before.
Again we three supped alone, and it seemed
this was the custom, the Countess Lalange (it was the
name of the aunt) seldom leaving her own salon, save
to pass to her private apartments beyond it. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
spent an hour there,&mdash;in her salon, that is,&mdash;after
supper, and I must bring my violin, but not for dance
music this time. I played all the sweetest and softest
things I knew; and now and then the young lady
would clap her hands, when I played one of my
mother's songs, and say that her nurse had sung it to
her, and how did I learn it, in America? They were
the peasant songs, she said, the sweetest in the world.
The lady aunt listened patiently, but I think she had
no music in her; only once she asked if I had no
sacred music; and when I played our psalm-tunes,
she thought them not the thing at all. But last of
all, when it was time for us to go away, I played
lightly, and as well as I knew how to play, my
mother's favourite song, that was my own also; and at
this, the young girl's head drooped, and her eyes filled
with tears. Her mother, too, had sung it! How
many other mothers, I ask myself sometimes, how
many hearts, sad and joyful, have answered to those
notes, the sweetest, the tenderest in the world?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THIS was one day of many, my dear. They came
and went, and I thought each one brighter
than the last. When I had been a month at Ch&acirc;teau
Claire, I could hardly believe it more than a week,
so quickly and lightly the time went. The mornings,
two children at play; the afternoons, three. I
suppose it was because the brother and sister were
so strangely like each other, that I grew so soon
to feel Mlle. Valerie as my friend; and she, sweet
soul, took me at Yvon's word, and thought me, perhaps,
a fine fellow, and like her own people. That she
never fully learned the difference is one of the many
things for which I have to thank a gracious God.</div>

<p>Abby Rock told me, Melody,&mdash;in after-times,
when we were much together,&mdash;how my poor father,
at sight of my mother Marie, was struck with love as
by a lightning-flash. It was a possession, she would
say, only by an angel instead of an evil spirit; at the
first look, she filled his life, and while she lived he
wanted nothing else, nor indeed after she died. It
was not so with me. And perhaps it might seem
strange to some, my dear child, that I write this
story of my heart for you, who are still a slip of a
growing girl, and far yet from womanhood and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
thoughts that come with it. But it may be some
years before the paper comes to you, for except my
poor father, we are a long-lived race; and I find
singular comfort, now that I cannot keep myself
exercised as much as formerly, by reason of growing
years, in this writing. And I trust to say nothing
that you may not with propriety hear, my dear.</p>

<p>When I had been a month at Ch&acirc;teau Claire, then,
a new thing began to come slowly upon me. From
the first I had felt that this young lady was the
fairest and the sweetest creature my eyes had seen;
like a drop of morning dew on a rose, nothing less.
I dwelt upon the grace of her motions, and the way
the colour melted in her cheek, as I would dwell upon
the fairest picture; and I listened to her voice because
it was sweeter than my violin, or even the note
of the hermit-thrush. But slowly I became aware of
a change; and instead of merely the pleasure of eye
and ear, and the warmth at the heart that comes
from true kindliness and friendship, there would fall
a trembling on me when she came or went, and a
sense of the room being empty when she was not in
it. When she was by, I wanted nothing more, or so
it seemed, but just the knowledge of it, and did not
even need to look at her to see how the light took her
hair where it waved above her ear. This I take to
have been partly because the feeling that was growing
up in me came not from her beauty, or in small
part only from that, but rather from my learning the
truth and purity and nobleness of her nature; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this knowledge did not require the pleasure of the
eyes. I thought no harm of all this; I took the joy
as part of all the new world that was so bright about
me; if voices spoke low within me, telling of the
other life overseas, which was my own, while this was
but a fairy dream,&mdash;I would not listen, or bade my
heart speak louder and drown them. My mind had
little, or say rather, my reason had little to do in
those days; till it woke with a start, if I may say so,
one night. It was a July night, hot and close. We
were all sitting on the stone terrace for coolness,
though there was little enough anywhere. I had
been playing, and we had all three sung, as we loved
to do. There was a song of a maiden who fell asleep
by the wayside, and three knights came riding by,&mdash;a
pretty song it was, and sung in three parts, the
treble carrying the air, the tenor high above it, and
the bass making the accompaniment.</p>

</table></div>


<div class='unindent'>I was thinking, I remember, how fine it would be to
be a knight on a horse of Hungary (though I am not
aware that the horses of that country are finer than
elsewhere, except in songs), and to stoop down beside
the road and catch up the sleeping maiden,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
I knew how she would be looking as she slept,&mdash;and
ride away with her no one could tell where,
into some land of gold and flowers.</div>

<p>I was thinking this in a cloudy sort of way, while
Yvon had run into the house to bring something,&mdash;some
piece of music that I must study, out of the
stores of ancient music they had. There was a small
table standing on the terrace, near where we were sitting,
and on it a silver candlestick, with candles lighted.</p>

<p>Mlle. Valerie was standing near this, and I
again near her, both admiring the moon, which was
extraordinary bright and clear in a light blue sky.
The light flooded the terrace so, I think we both
forgot the poor little candles, with their dull yellow
gleam. However it was, the young lady stepped
back a pace, and her muslin cape, very light, and
fluttering with ruffles and lace, was in the candle,
and ablaze in a moment. I heard her cry, and saw
the flame spring up around her; but it was only a
breath before I had the thing torn off, and was crushing
it together in my hands, and next trampling it
under foot, treading out the sparks, till it was naught
but black tinder. A pretty cape it was, and a sin to
see it so destroyed. But I was not thinking of the
cape then. I had only eyes for the young lady herself;
and when I saw her untouched, save for the
end of her curls singed, but pale and frightened, and
crying out that I was killed, there came a mist, it
seemed, before my face, and I dropped on the stone
rail, and laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not burned, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I? no, sir! I am not touched; but you&mdash;you?
oh, your hands! You took it in your hands, and
they are destroyed! What shall I do?" Before I
could move she had caught my two hands in hers,
and turned the palms up. Indeed, they were
only scorched, not burned deep, though they stung
smartly enough; but black they were, and the skin
beginning to puff into blisters. But now came the
tap of a stick on the stone, and Mme. de Lalange
came hobbling out. "What is this?" she cried,
seeing me standing so, pale, it may be, with the
young lady holding my blackened hands still in
hers.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this scene?"</p>

<p>"Its meaning?" cried Mlle. Valerie; and it was
Yvon's self that flashed upon her aunt.</p>

<p>"The meaning is that this gentleman has saved
my life. Yes, my aunt! Look as you please; if he
had not been here, and a hero,&mdash;a <i>hero</i>,&mdash;I should
be devoured by the flames. Look!" and she pointed
to the fragments of muslin, which were floating off
in black rags. "He caught it from me, when I
was in flames. He crushed it in his hands,&mdash;these
poor hands, which are destroyed, I tell you, with
pain. What shall we do,&mdash;what can we ever do, to
thank him?"</p>

<p>The old lady looked from one to the other; her
face was grim enough, but her words were courteous.</p>

<p>"We are grateful, indeed, to monsieur!" she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"The only thing we can do for him, my niece, is to
bind his hands with soothing ointment; I will attend
to this matter myself. You are agitated, Valerie,
and I advise you to go to your own room, and let
Felice bring you a potion. If M. D'Arthenay will
follow me into my salon, I will see to these injured
hands."</p>

<p>How a cold touch can take the colour out of life.
An instant before I was a hero, not in my own eyes,
but surely in those tender blue ones that now shone
through angry tears, and&mdash;I knew not what sweet
folly was springing up in me while she held my
hands in hers. Now, I was only a young man with
dirty and blackened fingers, standing in a constrained
position, and, I make no doubt, looking a great fool.
The young lady vanished, and I followed madame
into the little room. I am bound to say that she
treated my scorched hands with perfect skill.</p>

<p>When Yvon came rushing in a few minutes later,&mdash;he
had heard the story from his sister, and was for
falling on my neck, and calling me his brother, the
saviour of his cherished sister,&mdash;I know not what
wild nonsense,&mdash;Mme. de Lalange cut his expressions
short. "M. le Marquis," she said, and she
put a curious emphasis on the title, I thought; "M.
le Marquis, it will be well, believe me, for you
to leave this gentleman with me for a short time.
He has suffered a shock, more violent than he yet
realises. His hands are painfully burned, yet I hope
to relieve his sufferings in a few minutes. I suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that you retire to your own apartments, where M.
D'Arthenay will join you, say in half an hour."</p>

<p>Generally, Yvon paid little heed to his aunt, rather
taking pleasure in thwarting her, which was wrong,
no doubt, yet her aspect invited it; but on this occasion,
she daunted us both. There was a weight in
her words, a command in her voice, which I, for one,
was not inclined at that moment to dispute; and
Yvon, after an angry stare, and a few muttered
words of protest, went away, only charging me to
be with him within the half-hour.</p>

<p>Left alone with the ancient lady, there was silence
for a time. I could not think what she wanted with
me; she had shown no love for my society since
I had been in the house. I waited, thinking it the
part of courtesy to let her begin the conversation,
if she desired any.</p>

<p>Presently she began to talk, in a pleasanter strain
than I had yet heard her use. Was the pain less
severe? she asked; and now she changed the linen
cloths dipped in something cool and fragrant, infinitely
soothing to the irritated skin. I must have
been very quick, to prevent further mischief; in
truth, it was a great debt they owed me, and she,
I must believe her, shared the gratitude of her niece
and nephew, even though her feelings were less vivaciously
expressed.</p>

<p>I told her it was nothing, and less than nothing,
that I had done, and I thought there had been far too
much said about it already. I was deeply thankful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that no harm had come to Mlle. de Ste. Valerie, but
I could claim no merit, beyond that of having my eyes
open, and my wits about me.</p>

<p>She bowed in assent. "Your wits about you!"
she said. "But that in itself is no small matter,
M. D'Arthenay, I assure you. It is not every young
man who can say as much. Your eyes open, and
your wits about you? You are fortunate, believe
me."</p>

<p>Her tone was so strange, I knew not what reply to
make, if any; again I waited her lead.</p>

<p>"The young people with whom I have to do are
so widely different from this!" she said, presently.
"Hearts of gold, heads of feather! you must have
observed this, M. D'Arthenay."</p>

<p>I replied with some warmth that I had recognised
the gold, but not the other quality. She smiled, a
smile that had no more warmth in it than February
sunshine on an icicle.</p>

<p>"You are modest!" she said. "I give you credit
for more discernment than you admit. Confess that
you think our marquis needs a stronger head beside
him, to aid in his affairs."</p>

<p>I had thought this, but I conceived it no part of my
duty to say as much. I was silent, therefore, and
looked at her, wondering.</p>

<p>"Confess," she went on, "that you saw as much,
when he came to your estate&mdash;of which the title
escapes me&mdash;in North America; that you thought it
might be well for him to have a companion, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
adviser, with more definite ideas of life; well for
him, and possibly&mdash;incidentally, of course&mdash;for the
companion?"</p>

<p>"Madam!" I said. I could say no more, being
confounded past the point of speech.</p>

<p>"It is because of this friendly interest in my
nephew," the lady went on, taking no notice of my
exclamation. "In my <i>nephew</i>, that I think to give
you pleasure by announcing a visit that we are shortly
to receive. A guest is expected at Ch&acirc;teau Claire in
a few days; in fact, the day after to-morrow. My
nephew has doubtless spoken to you of the Vicomte de
Cre&ccedil;y?"</p>

<p>I said no, I had heard of no such person.</p>

<p>"Not heard of him? Unpardonable remissness in
Yvon! Not heard of the vicomte? Of the future
husband of Mlle. de Ste. Valerie?"</p>

<p>I took the blow full and fair, my dear. I think my
father in me kept me from flinching; but I may have
turned white as I saw myself an hour after; for after
one glance the woman turned her eyes away, and
looked at me no more as she spoke on. "It seems
hardly credible that even my nephew's featherpate
should have kept you a month in ignorance of what
so nearly concerns his sister and our whole family.
The vicomte is a charming man, of high polish
and noble descent. His estate adjoins ours on the
south. The match was made by my late brother,
the father of Yvon and Valerie, shortly before his
death. It had been his cherished plan for years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ever since Providence removed the vicomtesse to a
better world than this; but Valerie was very young.
The matter was arranged while she was still in the
convent, and since then the vicomte has been travelling,
in Russia, India, the world over, and is but just
returned. The betrothal will be solemnised, now, in a
few days."</p>

<p>I feared to speak at the moment. I snuffed the
candle, and, finding my hand steady, tried my voice,
which had a good strength, though the sound of it
was strange to me.</p>

<p>"Do they&mdash;does she know?" I asked.</p>

<p>The lady cleared her throat, and looked&mdash;or I
fancied it&mdash;a trifle confused. "I have not yet told
my niece and nephew. I&mdash;the letter came but this
evening. There was a letter also for you, M. D'Arthenay;
I ordered it sent to your room. I think your
hands will do well now, and I need no longer detain
you from your friend."</p>

<p>I stood up before her.</p>

<p>"Madam," I said, "permit me a word. I have to
thank you for your kindness, and for the hospitality
which I have received under this kindly roof, whether
it were with your will or not. For Mlle. de Ste.
Valerie, I wish her all joy that earthly life can know.
If her&mdash;if her husband be one half so noble as herself,
she cannot fail of happiness. It is only a princely
nature that should be matched with the purity of an
angel and the goodness of a saint. For myself"&mdash;I
paused a moment, finding myself short of breath;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
but my strength was come back to me. I sought her
eye and held it, forcing her to look at me against
her will. "For myself, I am no noble, though there
is good blood in my veins. I am a plain man, the son
of a peasant. But God, madam, who sees your heart
and mine, created, I make bold to remind you, both
noble and peasant; and as that God is above us,
you have done bitter wrong to an honest man. There
is no heart of a woman in you, or I would commend
to it that fair young creature, who will need, I think,
a woman's tenderness. I thank you again for your
assistance, and I take my leave. And I pray you to
remember that, whatever the D'Arthenays may have
been in France, in my country, in America, madam,
they pass for men of honour!"</p>

<p>I bowed, and left her; and now, methought, it was
she who was white, and I thought there was fear
in her eyes when she dropped them. But I turned
away, and, passing Yvon's door, went to my own
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE shock of my awakening was so violent, the
downfall of my air-castles so sudden and complete,
that I think for awhile I had little sense of
what was going on. Yvon came to my door and
knocked, and then called; but I made no answer,
and he went away, thinking, I suppose, that I had
forgotten him, and gone to bed. I sat on the side
of my bed, where I had thrown myself, great part of
that night; and there was no thought of sleep in
me. My folly loomed large before me; I sat and
looked it in the face. And sometimes, for a few
moments, it would not seem altogether folly. I felt
my youth and strength in every limb of me, and I
thought, what could not love do that was as strong as
mine? for now I knew that all these quiet weeks it
had been growing to full stature, and that neither
gratitude nor friendship had any considerable part in
my feeling, but here was the one woman in the world
for me. And would it be so hard, I asked, to take
her away from all this, and make a home for her in
my own good country, where she should be free and
happy as a bird, with no hateful watchers about her
path? And would she not love the newness, and
the greatness and beauty of it all, and the homely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
friends whom her brother so truly loved? Could I
not say to her, "Come!" and would she not come
with me?</div>

<p>Ah! would she not? And with that there fell
from my eyes as it were scales,&mdash;even like the
Apostle Paul, with reverence be it said,&mdash;and I
saw the thing in its true light. My heart said she
would come; had not her eyes answered mine last
night? Was there not for her, too, an awakening?
And if she came,&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>I saw her, the delicate lady, in my father's house;
not a guest, as Yvon had been, but a dweller, the wife
and daughter of the house, the wife of a poor man. I
remembered all the work that my mother Marie had
done so joyfully, so easily, because she was a working-woman,
and these were the things she had known all
her life. This form of grace that filled my eyes now
was no lighter nor more graceful than hers; but the
difference! My mother's little brown hands could do
any work that they had strength for, and make it
a woman's work in the doing, because she was pure
woman in herself; but these white fingers that had
caught mine last night,&mdash;what could they do? What
ought they to do, save work delicately with the needle,
and make cordials and sweets (for in this my young
lady excelled), and beyond these matters, to play the
harp and guitar, and tend her roses, and adorn her
own lovely person?</p>

<p>"But," cried the other voice in me, "I am young
and strong, and I can work! I can study the violin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I can become a musician, can earn my bread and hers,
so that there will be no need of the farm. It would
be a few years of study, a few years of waiting,&mdash;and
she is so young!"</p>

<p>Ah, yes! she was so young! and then that voice
died away, and knew that it had no more to say.
What&mdash;what was this, to think of urging a young
girl, still almost a child, to give up the station of life
in which she had lived happy and joyous, and go
away with a stranger, far from her own home and
her own people, to share a struggling life, with no
certain assurance of anything, save love alone?
What was this but a baseness, of which no honest
man could be capable? If,&mdash;if even I had read
her glance aright,&mdash;last night,&mdash;or was it a year
ago? Still, it was but a thing of a moment, the light
springing up of a tiny fire of good will, that would die
out in a few days after I was gone, for want of fuel;
even if it were not snatched out strongly by other
hands, as I had put out those climbing flames last
night. How her startled eyes sought mine! How
the colour flashed into her face when I spoke. No!
no! Of that I must not think, if my manhood was
to stay in me!</p>

<p>This other, then, who was coming,&mdash;this man
would turn her thoughts. She would yield, as is
the custom for young maidens in France, with no
thought that it might be otherwise. He was no
longer young,&mdash;he had already been once married,&mdash;I
looked up at this moment, I do not know by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
what chance, and my eyes fell on a long glass, what
they call a cheval-glass in France, my dear, showing
the whole figure. I think no harm, seeing this was
so long ago, in saying that I appeared to advantage
in such a view, being well-made, and perhaps not
without other good points. This will seem strangely
trifling to you, my child, who see nothing but the soul
of man or woman; but I have always loved a good
figure, and never felt shame to thank God for giving
me one. My clothes were good, having been bought
in Paris as we came through. I have never made
any claim to pass for a gentleman, Melody, but yet I
think I made a fair enough show of one, that night
at least. And being so constituted, I sat staring at
my image in the mirror, and wondering like a fool if
the other man were as good-looking. This would be
like a slight crust of contentment,&mdash;sad enough at
that,&mdash;forming for a moment over the black depth
of sorrow that was my heart; and next moment the
pain would stab through it again, till I could have
cried out but for the shame of it; and so the night
wore by, and the morning found me still there. I
had learned little, save the one thing that was
all the world,&mdash;that I could not commit a baseness.</p>

<p>It was strange to me, coming down to breakfast, to
find Yvon unchanged, his own gay self simply. I was
grown suddenly so old, he seemed no more than a
child to me, with his bits of song that yesterday I had
joined in with a light heart, and his plans for another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
day of pleasure, like yesterday and all the days.
Looking at him, I could have laughed, had there been
any laughter in me, at the thought of his aunt that I
had come over with a view to bettering myself at his
expense. It seemed a thing of so little moment; I
had half a mind to tell him, but held my peace, wishing
her really no evil, since what she had done had
been through love and care for her own. There
might be such men as she had thought me; I have
since found that there are indeed.</p>

<p>Yvon was full of plans; we were to ride this afternoon,
to such and such a place; it was the finest
view in the country, there was nothing to approach
it. Pierre should drive over and meet us there, with
peaches, and cream, and cakes, and we would sup,
we three together, and come home by moonlight. It
would be the very thing! if I really could hold the
bridle? it was the very thing to remove the recollection
of last night from his sister's mind, impressionable,
as youth always is. (He said this, Melody, with
an air of seventy years, and wisdom ineffable, that
was comical enough.) "From my own mind," he
cried, "never shall the impression be effaced. Thy
heroism, my Jacques, shall be inscribed in the annals
of our houses. To save the life of a Demoiselle de
Ste. Valerie is claim sufficient for undying remembrance;
to save the life of my sister, my Valerie,&mdash;and
you her saviour, the friend of my heart,&mdash;the
combination is perfect; it is ideal. I shall compose
a poem, Jacques; I have already begun it. '<i>Ciel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
d'argent</i>&mdash;' you shall hear it when it has progressed
a little farther; at present it is in embryo merely."</p>

<p>He sent for his sister, that they might arrange
their plans before she passed to her lessons, which
were strictly kept up. She came, and my heart spoke
loud, telling me that all my vigil had brought to me
was true, and that I must begone. There was a new
softness in her sweet eyes, a tone in her voice,&mdash;oh,
it was always kind,&mdash;but now a tenderness that
I must not hear. She would see my hands; could
not believe that I was not seriously wounded; vowed
that her aunt was a magician; "though I prayed
long, long, last night, monsieur, that the wounds
might heal quickly. They are really&mdash;no! look,
Yvon! look! these terrible blisters! but, they are
frightful, M. D'Arthenay. You&mdash;surely you should
not have left your room, in this condition?"</p>

<p>Not only this, I assured her, but I was so entirely
well that I hoped to ride with them this afternoon, if
the matter could be arranged. She listened with delight
while Yvon detailed his plan; presently her
face fell a little.</p>

<p>"Walk back!" she said. "Yes, Yvon, what could
be more delightful? but when I tell you that the sole
is sprung from my walking-shoe, and it must go to
the village to be mended! How can I get it back
in time?"</p>

<p>A thought came to me. "If mademoiselle would
let me see the shoe?" I said. "Perhaps I can arrange
it for her." Yvon frowned and pshawed; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
did not like any mention of my shoemaking; this
was from no unworthy feeling, but because he thought
the trade unsuited to me. I, however, repeated my
request, and, greatly wondering, the young lady sent
a servant for the shoe. I took it in my hand with
pleasure; it was not only beautiful, but well made.
"Here is an easy matter!" I said, smiling. "Will
mademoiselle see how they mend shoes in my country?"
A hammer was soon found, and sitting
down on a low bench, I tapped away, and soon had
the pretty thing in order again. Mademoiselle Valerie
cried out upon my cleverness. "But, you can
then do anything you choose, monsieur?" she said.
"To play the violin, to save a life, to mend a shoe,&mdash;do
they teach all these things in your country? and
to what wonderful school did you go?"</p>

<p>I said, to none more wonderful than a village
school; and that this I had indeed learned well, but
on the cobbler's bench. "Surely Yvon has told you,
mademoiselle, of our good shoemaker, and how he
taught me his trade, that I might practise it at times
when there is no fiddling needed?" I spoke cheerfully,
but let it be seen that I was not in jest. A
little pale, she looked from one of us to the other,
not understanding.</p>

<p>"All nonsense, Valerie!" cried Yvon, forcing a
laugh. "Jacques learned shoemaking, as he would
learn anything, for the sake of knowledge. He may
even have practised it here and there, among his
neighbours; why not? I have often wished I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
set a stitch, in time of need, as he has done to-day.
But to remain at this trade,&mdash;it is stuff that he
talks; he does not know his own nature, his own
descent, when he permits himself to think of such
a thing. Fie, M. D'Arthenay!"</p>

<p>"No more of that!" I said. "The play is over,
<i>mon cher!</i> M. D'Arthenay is a figure of your kind,
romantic heart, Yvon. Plain Jacques De Arthenay,
farmer's son, fiddler, and cobbler, stands from this
moment on his own feet, not those of his grandfather
four times back."</p>

<p>I did not look at my young lady, not daring to see
the trouble that I knew was in her sweet face; but I
looked full at Yvon, and was glad rather than sorry
at his black look. I could have quarrelled with him
or any man who had brought me to this pass. But
just then, before there could be any more speech,
came the sour-faced maid with an urgent message
from Mme. de Lalange, that both the young lady
and the marquis should attend her in her own room
without delay.</p>

<p>Left alone, I found myself considering the roses on
the terrace, and wondering could I take away a slip
of one, and keep it alive till I reached home. In the
back of my head I knew what was going on up-stairs
in the grim lady's room; but I had no mind to lose
hold on myself, and presently I went for my fiddle,
which was kept in the parlour hard by, and practised
scales, a thing I always did when out of Yvon's
company, being what he could not abear. To practise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
scales is a fine thing, Melody, to steady the mind and
give it balance; you never knew, my child, why I
made you sing your scales so often, that night when
your aunt Rejoice was like to die, and all the house
in such distress. Your aunt Vesta thought me mad,
but I was never in better wits.</p>

<p>So I was quiet, when after a long time Yvon came
down to me. When I saw that he knew all, I laid
my violin away, agitation being bad for the strings,&mdash;or
so I have always thought. He was in a flame of
anger, and fairly stammered in his speech. What
had his aunt said to me, he demanded, the night
before? How had she treated me, his friend? She
was&mdash;many things which you know nothing about,
Melody, my dear; the very least of them was cat,
and serpent, and traitress. But I took a cool tone.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Yvon," I asked, "about the gentleman
who comes to-morrow? You have already known
about it? It is true?"</p>

<p>"True!" cried Yvon, his passion breaking out.
"Yes, it is true! What, then? Because my sister is
to marry, some day,&mdash;she is but just out of her
pinafores, I tell you,&mdash;because some day she is to
marry, and the estates are to join, is that a reason
that my friend is to be insulted, my pleasure broken
up, my summer destroyed? I insist upon knowing
what that cat said to you, Jacques!"</p>

<p>"She told me what you acknowledge," I said.
"That I can be insulted I deny, unless there be
ground for what is said. Mme. de Lalange did what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
she considered to be her duty; and&mdash;and I have
spent a month of great happiness with you, marquis,
and it is a time that will always be the brightest of
my life."</p>

<p>But at this Yvon flung himself on my neck&mdash;it
is not a thing practised among men in this
country, but in him it seemed nowise strange, my
blood being partly like his own&mdash;and wept and
stormed. He loved me, I am glad to believe, truly;
yet after all the most part was to him, that his party
of pleasure was spoiled, and his plans broken up.
And then I remembered how we had talked together
that day in the old grist-mill, and how he had said
that when trouble came, we should spread our wings
and fly away from it. And Ham's words came back
to me, too, till I could almost hear him speak, and see
the grave, wise look of him. "Take good stuff, and
grind it in the Lord's mill, and you've got the best
this world can give." And I found that Ham's
philosophy was the one that held.</p>

<p>There was no more question of the gay party that
afternoon. Mlle. de Ste. Valerie did not dine with us,
word coming down that her head ached, and she
would not go out. Yvon and I went to walk, and
I led the way to my tower (so I may call it this
once), thinking I would like to see it once more. All
these three months and more (counting from the day
I first met Yvon de Ste. Valerie at the priest's house),
I had played a second in the duet, and that right
cheerfully. Though my own age, the marquis was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
older in many ways from his knowledge of society
and its ways, and his gay, masterful manner; and I,
the country lad, had been too happy only to follow
his lead, and go about open-eyed, seeing all he would
show, and loving him with honest admiration and
pride in him. But it was curious to see how from
this moment we changed; and now it was I who led,
and was the master. The master in my own house,
I thought for a moment, as we sat on the shelf under
the great round window, and looked out over the
lands that had once belonged to my people. Here
once more the dream came upon me, and I had a
wild vision of myself coming back after years, rich
and famous, and buying back the old tower, building
the castle, and holding that sweet princess by my
side. The poet Coleridge, my dear, in describing a
man whose wits are crazed, makes use of this remarkable
expression:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"How there looked him in the face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An angel beautiful and bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And how he knew it was a fiend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That miserable knight."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>This knowledge was also mercifully mine. And I
was helped, too, by a thing slight enough, and yet
curious. Being in distress of mind, I sought some
use of my hands, as is the case with most women and
some men. I fell to pulling off the dead leaves of
ivy from the wall; and so, running my hand along
the inside of the window, felt beneath it a carving on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the stone. I lifted the leaves, which here were not
so thick as in most places, and saw a shield carved
with arms, and on it the motto I knew well: "<i>D'Arthenay,
tenez foi!</i>"</div>

<p>I told my friend that I must be gone that night;
that I knew his aunt desired it, and was entirely in
her right, it being most unfitting that a stranger
should be present on such an occasion as this. Doubtless
other friends would be coming, too, and my room
would be wanted.</p>

<p>Here he broke out in a storm, and vowed no one
should have my room, and I should not stir a foot
for a hundred of them. And here had she kept him
in the dark, as if he were a babe, instead of the head
of the house. It was an affront never to be forgiven.
If the vicomte had not been the friend of his father,
he would break off the match, and forbid him the
house. As it was, he was powerless, tied hand and
foot.</p>

<p>I interrupted him, thinking such talk idle; and
begged to know what manner of man this was
who was coming. Was he&mdash;was he the man he
should be?</p>

<p>He was a gallant gentleman, Yvon confessed; there
was no fault to find with him, save that he was old
enough to be the girl's father. But that was all one!
If he were twenty viscounts, he should not turn out
his, Yvon's friend, the only man he ever cared to call
his brother,&mdash;and so on and so on, till I cut him
short. For now I saw no way, Melody, but to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
him how it was with me; and this I did in as few
words as might be, and begged him to let me go
quietly, and say no more. For once, I think, the
lad was put to such depth of sorrow as was in him.
He had never guessed, never thought of this; his
sister was a child to him, and must be so, he supposed,
to all. How could he tell? Why had he
brought me here, to suffer? He was a criminal!
What could he do? And then there struck him a
thought, and he glanced up sharply at me, and I saw
not the face of my friend, but one cold and questioning.
Had I spoken to his sister? Did she&mdash;</p>

<p>I cut him short at the word. Of that, I said, he
could judge better than I, having been in my company
daily for three months. He fell on my neck again,
and implored my pardon; and said, I think, that
twenty viscounts were less noble than I. I cared
little for my nobility; all I asked was to get away,
and hide my wound among my own friendly people.</p>

<p>And so it was arranged that I was to go that
night; and we walked back to the ch&acirc;teau, speaking
little, but our hearts full of true affection, and&mdash;save
for that one sting of a moment&mdash;trust in each other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE disturbance of my mind had been so great,
that all this while I had forgotten the letter of
which Mme. de Lalange had spoken the night before.
I had seen it when I first went to my room, but was
in no mood for village news then; I saw that it was in
the large round hand of Ham Belfort, and thought
it kind in him to write, seeing that it cost him some
effort; then I forgot it, as I said. But now, going
again to my room, and with nothing much to do save
wait the hour of my departure, I took the letter up,
idly enough, thinking I might as well do this as another
thing. This is what I read, Melody. No fear
of my forgetting the words.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Friend Jakey:</span>

<p>I am sorry to have bad news to send you this first time of
my writing. Father says to prepare your mind, but I never
found it work that way myself, always liking to know straight
out how things was, and I think you are the same. Your
father has been hearty, for him, till about a week ago. Then
he begun to act strange, and would go about looking for your
mother, as if she was about the place. Abby kep watch on
him, and I happened in once or twice a day, just to pass the
word, and he was always just as polite, and would read me
your letters. He thought a sight of your letters, Jakey, and
they gave him more pleasure than likely he'd have had if
you'd have ben here, being new and strange to him, so to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
speak. He was a perfect gentleman; he like to read them
letters, and they done credit to him and you. Last night
Abby said to me, she guessed she would take her things over
and stay a spell at the house, till your father was some better,
he was not himself, and she owed it to you and your mother.
I said she was right, I'd gone myself, but things wasn't so I
could leave, and a woman is better in sickness, however it may
be when a man is well. She went over early this morning,
but your father was gone. There warn't no hide nor hair of
him round the house nor in the garding. She sent for me,
and I sarched the farm; but while I was at it, seems as if she
sensed where he was, and she went straight to the berrin-ground,
and he was layin on your mother's grave, peaceful as
if he'd just laid down a spell to rest him. He was dead and
cold, Jakes, and you may as well know it fust as last. He
hadn't had no pain, for when I see him his face was like he
was in heaven, and Abby says it come nearer smiling than
she'd seen it sence your mother was took. So this is what my
paneful duty is to tell you, and that the Lord will help you
threw it is my prayer and alls that is in the village. Abby is
real sick, or she would write herself. She thought a sight of
your father, as I presume likely you know. We shall have the
funeral to-morrow, and everything good and plain, knowing
how he would wish it from remembering your mother's. So
no more, Friend Jakey; only all that's in the village feels for
you, and this news coming to you far away; and would like
you to feel that you was coming home all the same, if he is
gone, for there aint no one but sets by you, and they all want
to see you back, and everybody says it aint the same place with
you away. So I remain your friend,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Ham Belfort.</span><br />
</div>

<p>P.S. I'd like you to give my regards to Eavan, if he remembers
the grist-mill, as I guess likely he doos. Remember the
upper and nether millstones, Jakey, and the Lord help you
threw.</p>

<p>It is sometimes the bitterest medicine, Melody, that
is the most strengthening. This was bitter indeed;
yet coming at this moment, it gave me the strength
I needed. The sharp sting of this pain dulled in some
measure that other that I suffered; and I had no fear
of any weakness now. I do not count it weakness,
that I wept over my poor father, lying down so quietly
to die on the grave of his dear love. In my distraction,
I even thought for a moment how well it was
with them both, to be together now, and wished that
death might take me and another to some place where
no foolish things of this world should keep us apart;
but that was a boy's selfish grief, and I was now grown
a man. I read Ham's letter over and over, as well as
I could for tears; and it seemed to me a pure fruit of
friendship, so that I gave thanks for him and Abby,
knowing her silent for want of strength, not want of
love. I should still go home, to the friendly place,
and the friendly people who had known my birth and
all that had fallen since. I had no place here; I was
in haste to be gone.</p>

<p>At first I thought not to tell Yvon of what had
come to me; but he coming in and finding me as I
have said, I would not have him mistake my feeling,
and so gave him the letter. And let me say that a
woman could not have been tenderer than my friend
was, in his sympathy and grieving for me. I have
told you that he and my poor father were drawn to
each other from the first. He spoke of him in terms
which were no more than just, but which soothed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pleased me, coming from one who knew nobility well,
both the European sense of it, and the other. Upon
this, Yvon pressed me to stay, declaring that he would
go away with me, and we would travel together, till
my hurt was somewhat healed, or at least I had grown
used to the sting of it; but this I could not hear of.
He helped me put my things together, for by this time
night was coming on. He had found his sister so suffering,
he told me, that she felt unable to leave her
bed; and so he had thought it best not to tell her of
my departure till the morrow. And this was perhaps
the bitterest drop I had to drink, my dear, to leave
the house like a thief, and no word to her who had
made it a palace of light to me. Indeed, when Yvon
left me, to order the horses, a thought came into my
mind which I found it hard to resist. There was a
little balcony outside my window, and I knew that my
dear love's window (I call her so this once, the pain
coming back sharp upon me of that parting hour)
opened near it. If I took my violin and stepped outside,
and if I played one air that she knew, then, I
thought, she would understand, at least in part. She
would not think that I had gone willingly without kissing
her sweet hand, which I had counted on doing, the
custom of the country permitting it. I took the violin,
and went out into the cool night air; and I laid my
bow across the strings, yet no sound came. For
honour, my dear, honour, which we bring into this
world with us, and which is the only thing, save those
heavenly ones, that we can take from this world with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
us, laid, as it were, her hand on the strings, and kept
them silent. A thing for which I have ever since
been humbly thankful, that I never willingly or knowingly
gave any touch of pain to that sweet lady's life.
But if I had played, Melody; if it had been permitted
to me as a man of honour as well as a true lover, it
was my mother's little song that I should have played;
and that, my child, is why you have always said that
you hear my heart beat in that song.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Il y a longtemps que je t'aime;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Jamais je ne t'oublierai!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Before we rode away, Mme. de Lalange came out
to the door, leaning on her crutched stick; the horses
being already there, and I about to mount. She
swept me a curtsey of surprising depth, considering
her infirmity.</p>

<p>"M. D'Arthenay," she said, "I think I have
done you an injustice. I cannot regret your departure,
but I desire to say that your conduct has been
that of a gentleman, and that I shall always think of
you as noble, and the worthy descendant of a great
race." With that she held out her hand, which I
took and kissed, conceiving this to be her intention;
that I did it with something the proper air her eyes
assured me. It is a graceful custom, but unsuited to
our own country and race.</p>

<p>I could only reply that I thanked her for her
present graciousness, and that it was upon that my
thought should dwell in recalling my stay here, and
not upon what was past and irrevocable; which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
brought the colour to her dry cheek, I thought, but
I could say nothing else. And so I bowed, and we
rode away; my few belongings having gone before
by carrier, all save my violin, which I carried on the
saddle before me.</p>

<p>Coming to the Tour D'Arthenay, we checked our
horses, with a common thought, and looked up at the
old tower. It was even as I had seen it on first
arriving, save that now a clear moonlight rested on
it, instead of the doubtful twilight. The ivy was
black against the white light, the empty doorway
yawned like a toothless mouth, and the round eye
above looked blindness on us. As I gazed, a white
owl came from within, and blinked at us over the
curve. Yvon started, thinking it a spirit, perhaps;
but I laughed, and taking off my hat, saluted the bird.</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur mon locataire</i>," I said, "I have the
honour to salute you!" and told him that he should
have the castle rent free, on condition that he spared
the little birds, and levied taxes on the rats alone.</p>

<p>Looking back when we had ridden a little further,
the tower had turned its back on me, and all I saw
was the heaps of cut stone, lying naked in the moonlight.
That was my last sight of the home of my
ancestors. I had kept faith.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<div class='cap'>HERE ends, my dear child, the romance of your
old friend's life; if by the word romance we
may rightly understand that which, even if not lasting
itself, throws a brightness over all that may come
after it. I never saw that fair country of France
again, and since then I have lived sixty years and
more; but what I brought away with me that sorrowful
night has sweetened all the years. I had the
honour of loving as sweet a lady as ever stepped from
heaven to earth; and I had the thought that, if right
had permitted, and the world been other than it was,
I could have won her. Such feelings as these, my
dear, keep a man's heart set on high things, however
lowly his lot may be.</div>

<p>I came back to my village. My own home was
empty, but every house was open to me; and not a
man or a woman there but offered me a home for as
long as I would take it. My good friend Ham Belfort
would have me come to be a son to him, he having
no children. But my duty, as he clearly saw when
I pointed it out, was to Abby Rock; and Abby and I
were not to part for many years. Her health was
never the same after my father's death; it was her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
son I was to be, and I am glad to think she found me
a good one.</p>

<p>Father L'Homme-Dieu made me kindly welcome,
too, and to him and to Abby I could open my heart,
and tell them all that had befallen me in these three
life-long months. But I found a strange difference in
their manner of receiving it; for whereas the Father
understood my every feeling, and would nod his head
(a kind hand on my shoulder all the while), and say
yes, yes, I could not have done otherwise, and thus
it was that a gentleman should feel and act,&mdash;which
was very soothing to me,&mdash;Abby, on the other hand,
though she must hear the story over and over again,
could never gain any patience in the hearing.</p>

<p>"What did they want?" she would cry, her good
homely face the colour of a red leaf. "An emperor
would be the least that could suit them, I'll warrant!"
And though she dared not, after the first word, breathe
anything against my sweet young lady, she felt no
such fear about the old one, and I verily believe that
if she had come upon Mme. de Lalange, she would
have torn her in pieces, being extraordinary strong in
her hands. Hag and witch were the kindest words
she could give her; so that at last I felt bound to
keep away from the subject, from mere courtesy to
the absent. But this, as I have since found by observation,
was the mother-nature in Abby, which will
fill the mildest woman with desire to kill any one that
hurts or grieves her child.</p>

<p>For some time I stuck close to my shoemaker's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
bench, seeking quiet, as any creature does that is
deeply wounded (for the wound was deep, my dear;
it was deep; but I would not have had it otherwise),
and seeing only those home friends, who had known
the shape of my cradle, as it were, and to whom I
could speak or not, as my mind was. I found solid
comfort in the society of Ham, and would spend many
hours in the old grist-mill; sometimes sitting in the
loft with him and the sparrows, sometimes hanging
over the stones, and watching the wheat pour down
between them, and hearing the roar and the grinding
of them. The upper and nether millstones! How
Ham's words would come back, over and over, as
I thought how my life was ground between pain and
longing! One day, I mind, Ham came and found me
so, and I suppose my face may have showed part of
what I felt; for he put his great hand on my shoulder,
and shouted in my ear, "Wheat flour, Jakey!
prime wheat flour, and good riz bread; I see it
rising, don't you be afeard!" But by and by the
neighbours in the country round heard of my being
home again; and thinking that I must have learned a
vast deal overseas, they were set on having me here
and there to fiddle for them. At first I thought no, I
could not; there seemed to be only one tune my fiddle
would ever play again, and that no dancing tune.
But with using common sense, and some talk with
Father L'Homme-Dieu, this foolishness passed away,
and it seemed the best thing I could do, being in sadness
myself, was to give what little cheer I could to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
others. So I went, and the first time was the worst,
and I saw at once here was a thing I could do, and
do, it might be, better than another. For being
with the marquis, Melody, and seeing how high folks
moved, and spoke, and held themselves, it was borne
in upon me that I had special fitness for a task that
might well be connected with the pleasure of youth
in dancing. Dancing, as I have pointed out to you
many times, may be considered in two ways: first,
as the mere fling of high spirits, young animals skipping
and leaping, as kids in a meadow, and with no
thought save to leap the highest, and prance the furthest;
but second, and more truly, I must think, to
show to advantage the grace (if any) and perfection
of the human body, which we take to be the work of
a divine hand, and the beauty of motion in accord
with music. And whereas I have heard dancing
condemned as unmanly, and fit only for women and
young boys, I must still take the other hand, and
think there is no finer sight than a well-proportioned
man, with a sense of his powers, and a desire to do
justice to them, moving through the figures of a contra-dance.
But this is my hobby, my dear, and I
may have wearied you with it before now.</p>

<p>I undertook, then, as my trade allowed it,&mdash;and
indeed, in time the bench came to hold only the
second place in the arrangement of my days,&mdash;to
give instruction in dancing and deportment, to such
as desired to improve themselves in these respects.
The young people in the villages of that district were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
honest, and not lacking in wits; but they were uncouth
to a degree that seemed to me, coming as I did
from the home of all grace and charm, a thing horrible,
and not to be endured. They were my neighbours;
I was bound, or so it seemed to me, to help
them to a right understanding of the mercies of a
bountiful Providence, and to prevent the abuse of
these mercies by cowish gambols. I let it be understood
wherever I went that whoever would study
under me must be a gentleman; for a gentleman
is, I take it, first and last, a gentle man, or one who
out of strength brings sweetness, as in the case of
Samson's lion. To please, first the heart, by a sincere
and cordial kindness, and next the eye, by a
cheerful and (so far as may be) graceful demeanour;
this disposition will tend, if not to great deeds, at
least to the comfort and happiness of those around
us. I was thought severe, and may have been so;
but I lived to see a notable change wrought in that
country. I remember the day, Melody, when a young
man said to me with feeling, "I cannot bear to see
a man take off his hat to a woman. <i>It makes me
sick!</i>" To-day, if a man, young or old, should fail
in this common courtesy, it would be asked what cave
of the woods he came from. But let fine manners
come from the heart, I would always say, else they
are only as a gay suit covering a deformed and shapeless
body. I recall an occasion when one of my
pupils, who had made great progress by assiduous
study, and had attained a degree of elegance not often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
reached in his station, won the admiration of the
whole room by the depth and grace of his bow. I
praised him, as he deserved; but a few minutes after,
finding him in the act of mimicking, for the public
diversion, an awkward, ill-dressed poor lad, I dismissed
him on the instant, and bade him never come
to my classes again.</p>

<p>In these ways, my child, I tried, and with fair
measure of success, to ease the smart of my own pain
by furthering the pleasure of others; in these ways,
to which I added such skill as I had gained on the
violin, making it one of my chief occupations, when
work was slack, to play to such as loved music, and
more especially any who were infirm in health, or in
sorrow by one reason or another. It was a humble
path I chose, my dear; but I never clearly saw my
way to a loftier one, and here I could do good, and
think I did it, under Providence. As an instance,&mdash;I
was sent for, it may have been a year or two after
my trouble, to go some distance. A young lady
was ill, and being fanciful, and her parents well-to-do,
she would have me come and play to her, having
heard of me from one or another. I went, and found
a poor shadow of a young woman, far gone in a
decline, if I could judge, and her eyes full of a trouble
that came from no bodily ailment, my wits told me.
She sent her people away, saying she must have the
music alone. I have seldom found a better listener,
Melody, or one who spoke to me more plain in silence,
her spirit answering to the music till I almost could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hear the sound of it. Feeling this, I let myself slip
into the bow, as it were, more than I was aware of;
and presently forgot her, or next thing to it, and was
away in the rose-garden of Ch&acirc;teau Claire, and saw
the blue eyes that held all heaven in them, and heard
the voice that made my music harsh. And when at
last I brought it down to a whisper, seeing the young
woman's eyes shut, and thinking she might be asleep,
she looked up at me, bright and sharp, and said, "You,
too?"</p>

<p>I never saw her again, and indeed think she had
not long to live. But it is an instance, my dear, of
what a person can do, if the heart within him is
tender to the sorrows of others.</p>

<p>After Abby's death,&mdash;but that was years after all
this,&mdash;I found it wise to leave my native village. I
will not go into the cause of this, my child, since it
was a passing matter, or so I trusted. There was
some one there who had great good will to me, and,
not knowing my story, may have fancied that I was
one who could make her happy; I thought it right
to tell her how I had fared, and then, she being in
distress, I left my home, and from that time, I may
say, had many homes, yet none my own. I have
met with rare kindness; no man of my generation,
I would wager, has the number of friends I can boast,
and all kind, all hearty, all ready with a "welcome
to Rosin the Beau." And now here, at your aunts'
kind wish and your prayer, my dearest Melody, dear
as any child of my own could be, I am come to spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
my last days under your roof; and what more could
mortal man ask than this, I truly know not. My
violin and your voice, Melody; they were made for
each other; everybody says that, my dear, and neither
you nor I would deny it. And when the <i>obligato</i> is
silent, as shortly it must be in the good course of
nature, it is my prayer and hope that you will not
miss me too much, my dear, but will go on in joy
and in cheer, shedding light about you, and with your
own darkness yielding a clear glory of kindness and
happiness. Do not grieve for the old man, Melody,
when the day comes for him to lay down the fiddle
and the bow. I am old, and it is many years that
Valerie has been dead, and Yvon, too, and all of
them; and happy as I am, my dear, I am sometimes
tired, and ready for rest. And for more than rest,
I trust and believe; for new life, new strength, new
work, as God shall please to give it me.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
