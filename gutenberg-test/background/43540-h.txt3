LETTERS ON PALESTINE.




LETTER I.



Beyroot, June 18th, 1836.


After a stay of twenty-four hours at Cyprus, rendered
pleasant by the several interviews which we had with the
missionaries at that place, we sailed about three o'clock
P. M. with a fine wind, and before night, the isle, and
even the mountains of Cyprus, were sinking out of view in
the north-western waters. In the night our winds became
light. At a little past five in the morning I went on
deck, hoping to see the top of Mount Lebanon, which, from
our run, I thought must be within the reach of the eye;
but a dull heavy fog lay on our eastern horizon, and limited
our view. Just as I was finishing my breakfast, the captain
put his head down the hatchway, and let me know
that the mountains could be seen. I ran on deck, and
could see the faint outline of the top of Mount Lebanon,
peering above a long line of fog that spread like a wide
circle round the horizon. The upper part of the fog was
breaking into irregular masses and rolling off; at times the
mountain could at some points be seen very clearly; then,
again, the fog or clouds would close in upon it, and hide it
from our view. The highest parts of it were partially[2]
covered with snow. It lay, however, in parts and parcels;
and often in long irregular forms. This was owing, most
probably, to the form of the ground on which it lay; being
most abundant in hollows, and on the north sides of ridges.

Great is the power of association. From my childhood,
I have been taught to read the book of God, and prize its
precious truths; and I bless God, and thank my dear and
beloved parents, more for this, the religious instruction they
gave me, and their prayers, than for all other benefits
received through them; and they have not been few.
Mount Lebanon I found often, very often, referred to in
that best of all books; and, from the various ways in which
it is introduced, it associates itself in my mind with many
parts of Scripture history; with some of its most touching
incidents; with many of its most precious and consoling
truths. How often in my boyhood, and even in more
mature days, have I wished, like Moses, that I could see
that "goodly mountain and Lebanon!" Now, indeed and
in truth, I saw it rising into view, and hoped before long
to land at its foot, and in due time to traverse its ridges,
visit its cedars, and drink of its pure snow waters. I was
born and grew to manhood among mountains, and it is
natural for me to love mountain scenery. A landscape is
to my eye,       I was going to say, defective,       that does not
give, at least, a glimpse of a mountain.

I was often much struck with my feelings on this matter,
during the ten or fifteen years I have spent in situations
in which no mountains could be seen. When a journey of
business or pleasure led me to the neighbourhood of mountains,
they appeared to have a beauty and a charm in
them, that rose paramount to all that the wide and extended
plains could have.

But never did I feel such pulsations of delight from[3]
beholding a single mountain as now from looking at that
"goodly mountain and Lebanon"       that Lebanon so associated
with patriarchs and prophets, with the Land of
Promise, with the Temple of the Lord, and with those
thousand things which give such ever newness and freshness
to the oracles of God.

As the day passed away, we drew nearer and nearer,
but our winds were so light, that our approach was slow,
and a peculiar haziness of weather much impeded our
view of the changing aspect of the mountain. Beyroot
came in view towards night; but, owing to the lightness
of wind, and that against us, we did not reach it until about
sunrise next morning.

Beyroot lies at the south side of the river Beyroot,
which runs in from the mountains. The coast recedes at
this place, and forms a wide, open, halfmoon-like kind of
a bay. A small part of the town lying near the water
appears pretty closely built; but much of the town, or
very many houses, stand out over the gentle rise of the hill,
with gardens connected with them. Indeed, the whole
face of the plain and ridge, on which the town stands, is
quite covered with trees. The trees are not large, being
many of them mulberry, almond, (the pride of China I
think it is called), a few olive and apricot,      c. I have
seen no place in the East that struck me more pleasantly
than Beyroot.

The mountains behind it rise in succession. They have
a good many trees on them, but are not entirely covered.
They appear to be rather confined to spots as if planted by
man, and cultivated for special purposes. With the help
of a glass, I can see that, while a small growth is more
generally spread over the side of the mountain, there are
many places where a much larger growth may be seen.[4]
But I must omit farther notice of this until I have rambled
over them, and ascertained their true character.

We learned, on communicating with the shore, that there
had been several cases of plague, that the quarantine was
strict, and that we should have nearly two weeks' quarantine
to pass, before we would be allowed to have free intercourse
with the friends we hoped to find there.

In the course of the day our consul came off, and
informed us that he had procured for us a house in a
healthy and airy part of the suburbs, in which we must
pass our quarantine. Mr. B. also, who is connected with
the mission at this place, came off to see us. From him we
learned that the Rev. E. B. Smith and lady had, within
four or five days, left this for Smyrna, partly on account
of Mrs. S.'s health, which has lately failed much; and that
the other families were on the mountains, about three or
four hours' ride from town.




LETTER II.



Beyroot, June 27th, 1836.


We had hoped to get out of quarantine to-day, or at
least to-morrow, when to our discomfort we heard that
they had added four days to our time, owing to information
which they had received from Smyrna. There is no better
way to manage such matters than patiently to wait until
the time is out. But as they give me more of quarantine,
I see not why I may not tell you more about it.

Through the kind agency of our consul we were not
put in the Lazaretto, which is said to be a miserable place
at best, and worse now as the plague is there; but had a
very comfortable house assigned us, to the west of the[5]
town, on the side of the hill, nearly a quarter of a mile
from the walls. The whole side of the hill where we are
is cut up in plots, which form gardens planted with trees,
and here and there is a dwelling-house. We had all our
baggage landed and carried by the crew to our house,
except a few boxes, which being wood were not infectious,
and were carried by porters. Two guardians are assigned
us       one of them must be always at the house, to see that
no person touches us, or any of our articles; the other we
may send on errands, such as to do our marketing. They
are not to touch us, nor we them.

They bring us what we want, lay it down, and we take
it. They bring us water, wood, jugs, pitchers, dishes,
provisions, fruits: these are not infectious       but cloth,
paper,      c. are. They bring us notes, papers, books; but
we cannot send such articles without a special observance.
For instance, if we wish to send a letter to any one, or a
note not as big as your finger, with the name of any article
on it which we may need, the guardian may not touch it.
He takes a small box; you put it in; he takes it to the
health-office, where it is smoked with sulphur, and then
it may be received and read. Or, you may write on a
small board, or on a slate; the guardian may touch them.
While there is care to avoid touching you or anything
that conveys infection, there is, in other respects, a free
intercourse. We received many visits       our friends come,
and sit down, a few feet from us, and remain as long as
they please, conversing with us, and thus helping to while
away the time. They furnish us with any books that we
may need, and we at the end of our quarantine can restore
them. We are allowed to walk as much as we please,
taking one of our guardians with us, who sees that we
touch no one or anything that conveys infection; availing[6]
ourselves of this privilege, we have rambled about a good
deal, and made ourselves acquainted with the neighbourhood.

To the west and south-west, at a quarter of a mile from the
town, commences what may be called the sands, which gave
me a better idea of the sands of the desert than anything
I have before seen. The whole surface is a bed of fine
sand. It includes the highest part of the promontory,
and much, if not all the south-west side of it. There
is, at places, occasionally, a weed or bush, but much of
the surface is very fine sand, which is moved more or less
by the wind; and as the wind blows much from the south,
the sand has the appearance of approaching nearer and
nearer the town       at the place where it stops, and the gardens
begin, the sands are a good deal higher than the
gardens, ten, fifteen, or twenty feet; and the bank advances,
owing to the sand that is carried forward by the wind, and
rolls down towards the gardens. Some houses and fields
have been covered, and others are in danger, and must soon
be overwhelmed with it.

The side of the hill next the city, and west of it, is all
cut up into small plots; and much labour has been
expended in making these plots level. The side of the
hill is thus thrown into terraces one above another, but
without any order or regularity. The plots are of various
sizes and shapes. A stone wall is built up at the lower
side, and the earth drawn to a level. On the tops of the
wall is often planted the Indian fig, or prickly pear, which
abounds here. Few of these gardens have either flowers
or vegetables in them       have, in fact, little else beside mulberry-trees,
with a few fig, olive, apricot, pomegranate,
and other fruit-trees. From the appearance of the hill
side, I am disposed to think, that it was once covered more[7]
with houses than it now is       that the levelling of the ground
may, in part at least, have been made to fit it for houses,
which have now disappeared. There are some old cisterns,
pillars,      c., which indicate this.

I have met with several things which struck me with
some force, as illustrating Scripture. The roofs of the
houses are flat, and a way is made to ascend to the top,
which is a most pleasant place for a walk in the cool of the
evening. "Samuel called Saul to the top of the house."       1
Sam. ix. 2, 6.

A number of the houses have a kind of a tent on the top,
made of reeds,      c., in which they sit, and I believe sleep.
"They spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house."       2
Sam. xvi. 22.

There is usually a small railing, or elevation, round the
edge, to prevent any from falling over; and the law of
Moses required them to make a battlement for this purpose.       Deut.
xxii. 8.

While some have tents on the top of the house, others
have them out under the trees; and the fig-tree and the
vine, having large shady leaves, are very favourable for
this. Thus they sit "under their vine and fig-tree." And
where they do not use tents they are very fond of sitting
out under the trees. They usually take out a straw mat
or small carpet, which they spread down; sometimes on
this they lay their beds, and sit on them. They have not
feather beds, as we have, but a kind of wool mattress,
which is easily folded up and removed. Mr. and Mrs.               ,
who are of our party, are natives of this place, and hopefully
pious. They often take out their mat, and spread it
down under a tree, and spend much of the day there. In
our walks we see many thus under the vines and fig-trees,
whiling away their hours.

[8]

Almost every night we hear music and dancing at no
great distance from us. The music is hardly worth the
name       is a kind of beating, accompanied with some wind
instrument, and serves to keep the time. The dancing, as
it is called, is not much more than a slow walking, stooping,
changing of position. It has none of that active and
fatiguing action which dancing has in the western world.
The men and women do not join together in it. It is done
almost wholly by men; and often old men. The women
sit by and look on. The Sabbath night appears more
especially a favourite time for this amusement.

The promontory on which Beyroot stands is low at the
south-east side, where it joins the main land, and on that
low part, which once may have been covered with water
(making the promontory an island), there is much sand.
On a part of this there are many pines; a few of them are
large; and a large space is covered with small ones. There
is some care taken of them, and persons are not allowed to
pillage them. The larger ones are trimmed up very high,
and have a large, flat, bushy top, which gives them a rather
singular, but pretty appearance.

The sycamore here is a different tree from that which
bears the name with us. The wood is valuable, being
hard and very durable. It is a low tree, with a thick
body, many branches, shaped a little like the apple-tree,
the leaf large. It bears a fruit which is to some extent
valuable. One of the prophets said he was "a gatherer of
sycamore fruit." It would seem that much of it was used,
and gathering of it a business.

There are few, if any, springs here, as we should call
them       but wells; at least, in all my walks I have not seen
any. There is a low place a little out of the city gate,
where there are three or four wells. They are walled up,[9]
with a large flat area over them, in the middle of which is
a hole, large enough to let down a bucket. There is no
pump, or windlass, nor even a well-sweep; but a rope.
The vessel used almost constantly for bringing water, is a
large jug with two handles, and a small mouth. It may
hold from two to four gallons. They tie the rope to the
neck or to the handles, and let it down. It fills, and they
draw it up. In passing these wells, especially in the
evening or morning, you find a crowd of people drawing
water. Some have mules and donkeys on which they carry
it       usually having four of these water-pots, two swung in a
wooden frame on each side of the animal. The others
carry the jar on their shoulders, or rather on the back,
held over the shoulder; but one hand is raised to support
it. You see no one carrying anything in his arms, as is
the custom with us, but upon the head or shoulder when
not too large, otherwise upon the back       even children are
carried in this way       it is amusing to see the little things
riding upon their parents' shoulders. There is no vessel
attached to these wells; and thus we see the force of the
saying of the woman, "Thou hast nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep;" and thus Rebecca came "out with
her pitcher upon her shoulder." A large proportion of
those whom we saw drawing water were females.

The Turks are usually a grave and silent people. They
talk less than the Greeks, and indeed than almost any
other people that I have been among. It was therefore
rather a novelty to meet with one who was of a different
cast of temperament. Both our guardians are young
Turks, I should think about twenty; and very good-looking.
One of them is rather of a grave cast; a genuine
Turkish, but withal an unusually mild aspect. The other
is as full of life and glee and innocent mischief as he can[10]
hold. The first day or two he did not show it much,
except in occasionally playing off a little of his humour on
his companion. He then began upon Angelo, my Maltese
servant, whom I had engaged at Smyrna. The Maltese
language is a dialect of the Arabic, and they could therefore
converse with him. Our establishment having but
two rooms, one of which being occupied by the ladies, and
the other by the gentlemen, Angelo had to take up his
lodgings in the porch where some of the baggage was
placed. The guardians slept in the yard under the tree.
They pretended that they would do all sorts of bad things
to him at night, and excited his fears not a little. On
finding it out I interposed, and assured them, through an
interpreter, that if they did not desist from thus working
on his fears, I would report them to the police. They
assured me they were only in fun, and would not trouble
him. Angelo had more spunk than I expected; he got a
large knife to defend himself with       we took it from him.
I told him to sleep in our room       he would not. I told
him to sleep close to the door, which I left open; no, he
would sleep at his selected place       and he did.

When we walk out, one of our guardians always walks
with us, and generally the lively and talkative one chooses
that office. He amuses himself and us in various ways,
and usually contrives to put in a claim for a boksheesh (a
present) at the close of the walk. As he does not always
get it, it is amusing to observe in how many ways he contrives
to let us know that it would be very acceptable. At
times when he does not get it, he pretends to his companion
that he has; and thus has sport with him, in refusing
to let him have any part of it. They are very obliging       I
have seldom seen more perfect good-humour than they
manifest.

LETTER III.



Beyroot, July 4th, 1836.


I think I informed you that Beyroot is a walled town,
and has a strong garrison. It is held under Ibrahim
Pasha, and for his father or step-father Mahommed Ali of
Egypt. Ibrahim spends most of his time north of this at
Aleppo, Tripoli, Scanderoon, and Tarsoos. He is erecting
a palace not far from Aleppo, and may possibly purpose
making that his home. Beyroot is the most important
port on the coast, but still its trade is small. The walls
are of considerable height, appear strong, and have several
strong towers connected with them. The number of troops
at this place I have not been able to ascertain with certainty;
there must be several thousands, possibly from
3000 to 5000.

I have been equally unable to ascertain the population
of the town and suburbs; nearly one-third of the population,
I should think, live without the walls, in what is
called the Gardens. The houses without the walls are
much more pleasant, at least in summer, than those within
the town. They stand apart; have gardens and trees
about them, are higher and much more cool. The town
stands in a low spot, is much crowded with houses, has
narrow filthy streets, and during the hot weather the heat
is considerable, which causes sickness. The gates of the
town are guarded, and at an early hour in the night all but
one are closed. This one is kept open to a late hour.

At the quay, or public landing-place, there is an immense
number of old, broken pillars. The wall fronting
the bay is for thirty, possibly fifty yards, composed almost
wholly of them. Most of them are more or less broken.
Many of them have been connected, no doubt, with buildings[12]
of consequence, as their high finish seems to indicate;
a number of them are fine Egyptian marble. They are of
various sizes, but most of them of the largest kind. Broken
pieces of pillars and other work in marble are to be seen in
many places about the town, both without and within the
walls, all indicating that, at some period, this was the seat
of wealth and taste, of luxury and splendour.




Brumanah, Mount Lebanon, July 20th, 1836.


After getting out of quarantine, and spending ten or
twelve days in Beyroot to see the place, I came up to this
village, where the mission families are spending the summer
months. It lies about three hours' ride from Beyroot,
on the top of one of the ridges which runs down from the
main ridge of the Lebanon towards the sea. It may be
about one-third of the way to the top, and one-third of the
height of Jebal Sun-neen, the highest point of Mount Lebanon.
We have from Bru-ma-nah a fair view of the mountains,
as they rise above us, and run far to the north-east
and south-west: a long sea coast spreads out before us       the
town of Beyroot       the shipping that lies off the town
on the face of the smooth waters, all rise into view, and
give a rich and beautiful variety to the prospect.

Nearly one-half of the village is composed of Greeks,
and the other half about equally divided between the
Druses and Maronites. They all speak the Arabic, which
is indeed the vernacular language of this region. The
people appear friendly, and but for the influence of the
priests would, no doubt, give more proof of their friendship.
The missionaries have opened a school among them, which
promises to do good. The females wear what is called the
tantoor on their heads. It is very like those tin horns
which are often used by hunters to call their dogs;[13]
stage-drivers at times use them. The tantoor is a foot
long; the largest part is fixed to the forehead, and by
means of a small piece of wood, or some such thing, which
passes over the head, and is fastened to the hair, the whole
is made to stand upon the head like a horn. It usually
leans forward, and reminds one of the figure of the unicorn.
The horn is of silver, and has at times various ornamental
devices engraved on it. The chief use of it seems to be to
sustain the veil, which is universally worn by the women
here. It is thrown over the horn, and hangs down over
the shoulders. When men are present, they draw the veil
with one hand close over the mouth, so as to cover the lower
part of the face, leaving but one eye exposed. While they
are thus careful to cover the face, they often, I might say
usually, leave the breast most shamefully exposed. Indeed,
they seem to have pride in exposing that part of the body.

Sometime before I got out of quarantine, there was a
death in the Emeer family of this village; and, as is the
custom, the people are not allowed to wash their clothes
for forty days       as they are not much given to cleanliness
at any time, this was an order grievously out of place.
About the time I came up the people were most fearfully
dirty. The days of restriction are, however, past, and it
is thought the people have been using water. It is a rare
evil for people to get habituated to       a disregard of cleanliness       for
it is hard to correct the evil.

Most, if not all, of the houses here are of one story       a
few, indeed, that stand on the hill-side, have a small room
under the elevated side of the main floor. The floors are
uniformly, as far as I have seen, made of clay, as also is
the roof. They wet it and make it into a kind of mortar,
and have a heavy stone roller with which to make it
smooth. For the roof, pieces of timber are laid across,[14]
mostly a few strong beams, then across them smaller pieces
of boards, and flat stones; and on these the earth is laid,
in a wet state, and the roller made to pass over it, until
with that and their feet they make it hard and smooth.
All the roofs are flat, having some little channels to collect
the water, and a low place at one side to let it off. There
is a way of ascending to the top, which, in large houses,
is a fine place for walking and taking the air. These roofs
do very well in dry weather, but in the rainy season the
water, it is said, comes through, and gives much annoyance
to the inmates. The sides are usually made of stone,
very coarsely put together; very little mortar is used       often
none. They plaster the inside with clay, such as
they use for making the floors; and give it a slight coat
of whitewash. It is, to be sure, done in poor style; still
the houses do pretty well for a summer residence. Generally
they have but one room, but occasionally they have
two or three.

These flat roofs and their earthen materials illustrate
what was meant by the grass upon the house-tops       grass
does often spring up in the wet season, but the heat of
the sun withers it and it comes to nought.

"Shall men give into your bosom?"       The usual dress
here, is a long robe, not much unlike a woman's gown. It
is fastened about the waist with a girdle. This is a long,
large piece, often as large, and even much larger than a
sheet, but of a fine texture; usually of the shawl kind.
They wrap this round them four or five times, forming a
band from four inches to a foot wide, as the taste of each
may be,       then give such a fastening to the end as each
may choose. It is odd, and to us laughable to see them
putting them on. I have seen them fasten the end of their
long girdle to a door, post, or table       adjust its folds       regulate[15]
its width       put one end to their body, and turn
round and round until they have wrapped it all to their
liking. Yea, I have seen them do it on the road. On
my visit to Nice, not long after I left that plain, I passed
a man on the road who from some cause wished to adjust
his girdle. Possibly it was a preparation before he entered
that city of ancient name. He had stopped, taken off his
girdle, adjusted its width, arranged its folds, fastened one
end of it to a bush, drew it out to its full length, applied
the other end to his side, and holding it, turned round
and round carefully, attending to its width and the adjustment
of its folds. I felt strongly disposed to laugh,
and had there been any one to join me in it, I doubt not
should have laughed heartily, the danger of offending the
gravity of the Turk to the contrary notwithstanding. But
there is no fun in laughing alone; and my old Greek guide
looked as grave as if he saw nothing amusing, in seeing a
man winding himself in a shawl. But to the point I
meant to illustrate. The part of the dress above the
girdle having an opening, is used for stowing away all
sorts of things; handkerchiefs, when they have any; bread,
fruit,      c., nothing comes amiss; they put it into the bosom.
As the receptacle goes all round the body, it is equal to
three or four of those large pockets our great-grandmothers
used to wear.




LETTER IV.



Bru-ma-nah, July 23d, 1836.


I have just returned from a tour of four days among
the mountains. The ladies rode on donkeys, which are not
much larger than the largest kind of sheep; they have great
strength and a pleasant gait. They are also sure-footed,[16]
which in such rough roads is no small recommendation. I
hired a mule, the owner of which, as is usual in such cases,
went along to take care of his animal. The other two
gentlemen had their own horses. It is not here as in
Europe, where you can find taverns and beds. There are
no such things here. We, of course, had to take all things
needful for eating and sleeping. We carried two tents       one
for the ladies, the other for the gentlemen; our bedding,
provisions, utensils for cooking, a pot, a pan, plates,
knives, forks, spoons, coffee, tea-cups, sugar, salt, towels,
     c. We required, of course, two or three mules to carry
these, and a servant to take care of them and cook for us.
Although our plan was to take no more than was really
necessary, we made quite a cavalcade.

You have, no doubt, heard that coal has lately been
found in the mountains near Beyroot. The chief mine that
is worked lies near a village called Corneil, about three or
four hours' ride from Brumanah, and up near the main
ridge of the mountain. Our first object was to visit those
mines which lay south-east of Brumanah. We passed up
the ridge on which Brumanah stands, but gradually wound
along its south-east side, until we reached the bottom of
the ravine which separates it from the ridge which lies to
the south. Much of the higher part of the ridge on which
Brumanah stands is of the sandstone formation; it is, however,
singularly mixed with patches of limestone. We
found the ravine a most rugged and rocky one, and almost
wholly of limestone. We saw many loose masses of green
stone at the bottom, which must have been brought from
some distance, as there was no appearance of that rock in
sight.

In crossing the next ridge, we passed a village, in the
midst of a well-cultivated spot. There were more trees,[17]
and vines, and garden herbs, than I had seen at any of the
villages that I had passed. The prince of this village has
a pretty good-looking palace, of considerable size. We
passed close by it, and as the people within assembled to
see the party of Franks, it gave us an opportunity to see
them. After ascending about half way up this ridge, we
again passed into the sandstone formation, which occupies
the top, except some small locations of limestone, which
appears in some strange way to have got out of its proper
place. But of this hereafter. We passed over this ridge,
and at the foot, near the lower part of the sandstone formation,
we found the coal mines. Mr. Brattle, the English
superintendant, received us most kindly, and took us
through and showed us the mine. He has made four or
five openings, and finds ample stores of coal. It is from
three to four feet thick       dips a little into the mountain       has
several considerable falls in the strata, which will
require more labour in working it. There is another mine
south of the next ridge, which is also now worked. The
coal is not, however, as good as at the one we visited.
None of the coal yet found is as good as the English coal,
but most probably a further search may discover coal of a
better quality.

It is about ten or fifteen years since this coal was first
discovered. Several men were sent to examine it, but were
not skilful, and did not report favourably. There was an
attempt to work it a few years since, but no good resulted.
At length Mr. Brattle, who is acquainted with the business,
was induced to come out, and under his direction they
are becoming more and more important. He labours under
great disadvantages, from the absence of most of those
aids and facilities which are so needful in carrying on
such work. He has proved, or is proving, however, that[18]
they are valuable. This coal is carried on mules and
donkeys to Beyroot, over a most villanous road. Were a
good road made, and proper coal wagons used, it would
greatly facilitate the matter. But that day is not yet
come. There is no such thing as a wheeled conveyance
here, at least I have seen none, nor the track of one of any
description.

There is a great irregularity in the sandstone strata near
and above the coal, it is thrown about in all sorts of ways.
But I shall have occasion to notice this repeatedly in my
tour. After spending several hours at the mine, Mr.
Brattle took us to his house at Corneil (the old palace,
the best house in the village), and entertained and lodged
us with great kindness and hospitality. From the terrace
of the palace, which looks towards Beyroot, we had one of
the most splendid views I have ever seen. We saw the
sun set in the ocean behind Cyprus; could distinctly see the
island in the full blaze of the setting sun. It lies so far to
the west, that it is only in peculiar states of the air it can
be seen. Corneil stands on a rocky knoll on the top of a
ridge. At this place the limestone is thrown up, while
both above and below on the ridge the sandstone prevails.
It is surrounded with vines, mulberry, fig and other kinds
of trees. But they stop here. This is the highest point
on this part of the mountain where trees are seen. Almost
immediately after leaving Corneil we saw no more trees,
not even bushes, except occasionally a very low evergreen,
which appeared to be a kind of thorn. It grows in bunches,
spreads over the ground, but seldom rises above from six
inches to a foot. Occasionally we saw some heather and
fern in wet places, and more frequently furze and thistle;
a few low flowers appeared, and some other mountain
plants that were new to me. The whole face of the[19]
mountain was bare rocks, rocks, rocks. The ridge on
which Corneil stands leads up to a very high point of the
mountain called, if I recollect right, Jebal Knee-se. There
are now, it is said, the remains of a church and monastery
on the top. It was a place of some interest as an ecclesiastical
establishment. It really must have looked like literally
getting up, if not to at least towards heaven, to live upon
the top of a mountain which is supposed to be from nine
to ten thousand feet above the level of the sea. It was, no
doubt, a monastic establishment. Why it was deserted I
know not. I felt a wish to visit it, but the labour would
have been considerable, and as another point which lies
several hours' ride north-east is still higher, and is the one
that is usually ascended, and as we thought the ascent of
one would be quite enough for our invalids, we passed
round the foot of the high peak of Jebal Knee-se, and made
for the top of the ridge, at a low place between Jebal
Knee-se and Jebal Sun-neen.

The upper part of Jebal Knee-se is regularly stratified
limestone, and horizontal. It has many shells in it; we
stopped and collected some fine specimens of four or five
different kinds. About the middle of the day, we reached
the top of the ridge of Lebanon, at the low place between
the two points before named. This place is above the
limits of trees and cultivation. The mountain is barren
even of bushes. There are, however, some of the smaller
plants which I mentioned a few lines above.

We had from this place a fine view of the Bokar, or
plain of Celo-Syria, which lies between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.
It is a long and narrow plain       narrow compared
with its length. It may be from fifteen to twenty miles
wide, but must be several hundred miles long. It looked
like a dead level. We could see many villages in it, and[20]
groves of trees, and the green fields. It was a lovely sight.
We pitched our tents on the top, and made our dinner,
enjoying the delightful view which lay around us on all
sides. The cultivation on the side next the plain ascended
much higher up the mountain than it did on the north-western
side. There were fields of grain but a short
distance below us, so near indeed that one of our muleteers
took down his mule, and let it feed on the grain, and
even brought up a bundle of green wheat which he procured
there.

The place on which we pitched our tents was the upper
part of the sandstone formation. There was a good deal
of sandstone, breccia or puddingstone, but near us on all
sides the limestone formation was seen. After the heat of
the day was a little over, we set out north-east along the
top of the Mount for the Sun-neen, the high point which is
usually ascended, and on which the most snow is found.
There is a little flat, or nearly flat, space along the top, on
which we found a footpath, much beaten. All over these
high places the sheep and goats and cattle are driven for
the sake of pasture. We saw more flocks on these
upper parts of the mountain than we did on the lower
parts.

Not far from our encampment, we passed a place near
the upper part of the sandstone formation, where strata of
a peculiar character cropt out. It split easily into lamina
as fine as paper; was peculiarly elastic. You might roll
it up in rolls, and it would, when let loose, spring back to
its former state. It burnt freely. You might almost make
torches of it. It was, no doubt, bituminous shale. In
some places it had more of these properties than others.
The strata was of considerable thickness, as we could see
on the sides of the hollow on which we found it. It lay on[21]
the north-west side, a little below the top of the ridge.
Most likely, as the strata was horizontal, it cropt out also
on the south-east side next the plain of Celo-Syria.

Two or three hours brought us to the foot of Jebal Sun-neen,
and up near the foot of the snows. Here we selected
a good spot, and again pitched our tents; intending to
employ the next day in our ascent to the top and return to
the same place. We found it much colder than it was in
the lower parts of the mountain. We really needed fire;
but it was with difficulty that wood enough could be procured
to make our tea, much more to make a fire to warm
half-a-dozen people in the open air. We had, however,
expected this, and brought clothing accordingly, so that we
did not suffer much.

In the morning, we began the ascent; we rode nearly
an hour, and took a donkey still farther for the benefit of
the ladies; but then left all our animals, and betook
ourselves in good earnest to the matter of ascending the
Mount. On the side which we ascended, between where
we encamped and the top, are two or three offsets, then
the mountain falls off and leaves a kind of level. These
general levels have small ridges and round hills on them,
and many deep valleys and sink-holes, or holes of that
peculiar kind which abound in districts where a horizontal
limestone stratum lies on the surface. In these deep sink-hole
places, and in the valleys, and on the sides of the
ridges, the snow was accumulated in great quantities, but
it did not cover the whole surface of the mountain, as I
had supposed it might. But a small part of the mountain
had snow on it. It lay in patches, and possibly not over
one-twentieth part was covered with it. I saw no ice       all
was snow. From the action of the sun and wind, it
was just hard enough to walk on with safety. The foot[22]
would sink in it one, two, or three inches       seldom more.
I walked on it in my shoes without inconvenience.

We were three hours in reaching the top       we proceeded
slowly, and stopped frequently to allow the ladies
rest. We found the summit much like the offset, which
I have just described. There was what may be called a
general level, of a mile or two across, with many rises in
it, and full of deep holes of various shapes, some nearly
round, others long and narrow. These were full of snow.
It was usually much melted at one side, and the largest
masses were, as a general thing, found lying on the west
or south-west side of the hollow. What appeared most
singular, was the fact, that for the most part, the outsides
of this great cone appeared the highest       around it were
the highest knolls, while the inner parts were lower, and
its holes and sinks more deep. The rain and snow water
does not seem to flow over and down the outside of the
cone, but sinks in it, and finds its way out as it can.

The whole upper part of the Mount, from where we
pitched our tents, which was near the sandstone formation,
is limestone with its varieties. It lies horizontally, and is
stratified with unusual regularity. This can be seen with
great distinctness on the west side of the Mount, where
the deep hollow, in which a branch of the river Beyroot
heads, terminates against the cone, and makes a regular,
steep, sloping descent of, I should think, from four to six
thousand feet. Near the top, on the west side, I saw a
small spot of fine white marble       much of the rock, indeed,
approximates to marble. High up, at the north-east
corner, we found some limestone breccia, and saw, also, in
various places, much arragonite, which is a peculiar and
rare variety of crystallised limestone.

But what gave us most interest were the shells which[23]
we found at many places as we ascended, and also on the
top itself. We found some very fine specimens of them       four
or more varieties. I procured several, nearly as large
as a common conch shell; all of them were petrified. At
various places on the side, and also on the summit, we saw
rocks that appeared little else than a mass of shells. As to
when and how they got there, I have at present but little
to say. Of one thing, however, I am fully satisfied, that
they do not contradict the Mosaic account. It is possible
that they may, with other facts which are collecting, prove,
finally, that in some points we have put a wrong construction
on the Mosaic account. Thus it was when the
newly received system of astronomy was first brought
forward. It was assailed with more zeal than knowledge,
by a certain class of religionists, who insisted that it was
at variance with the Bible, which said the sun rose and
set; whereas, this new system made the sun stand still
and the earth turn round,       and not only the anathemas of
the church, but the fire and fagot were called into requisition,
to maintain the good old received opinion, that the
earth stood still for the quiet of man, and the sun, moon,
and stars, which had nothing else to do, went round and
round to give him light. It was, however, found out at
last, that the truth in astronomy was not at war with
truth in revelation       that the earth might turn round, and
move at the same time in its orbit, without infringing, in
the least, against the truths of the Bible. Thus, I doubt
not, it will be found with the geological fossils, which are
now accumulating, and some of them are truly singular.
They will be found to coincide with revelation.

I do fear, indeed, that some weak heads will be injured
by these facts, and that some minds wishing to find
occasion against religion, will eagerly seize these facts,[24]
and take it for granted that they are inconsistent with the
Bible account, and will throw off all regard for that most
precious book. Such persons ought to recollect that
geology is a science that is yet in its infancy. That on
some of the most important questions that bear on its
relation to the Mosaic account, there is not only a want
of agreement among geologists, but much contrariety of
opinion. Farther, this eastern world, where the main
examination ought to be made, has been but little examined;
and still, the Bible will admit of any explanation,
in agreement with these facts, on the same principles on
which explanations in common life are daily received.

The view from the top of Sun-neen was most splendid.
We had a most extensive view of the Bokar, as the Celo-Syria
plain is now called. The great range of the Anti-Lebanon
stretched along the farther side, running parallel
to that of the Lebanon. Parts of the former had snow on
them, and especially a high point that lay a good deal to
the south. On the general range of the Anti-Lebanon,
there was less snow; and I should think it a good deal
lower than the Lebanon. It has the same naked and
rough appearance, and I am told is even more rough, more
destitute of forests, and less occupied with villages. To
the south, we could see as far as Mount Hermon and the
mountains about the sea of Tiberias. To the north, the
plain ran out till it met the horizon. The whole plain of
Celo-Syria appeared to be a dead level. The mountains
rise from it as if they rose out of a sea. In this it reminded
me of the plain of Ephesus, which stretches up almost to
Smyrna. Baalbec can be seen from Sun-neen, but the
state of the air was not favourable to a distant view on the
plain. North of the point of Sun-neen, on which we stood,
the main ridge of the Lebanon sinks a good deal, as it[25]
does on the south. Beyond this low place, at a considerable
distance, I should think a day's travel, say fifteen or
twenty miles, it throws up another high point, or mass of
mountains. On this last point, which may be about as
high as the Sun-neen, grow the famous cedars so much
spoken of. Our plan was to have extended our tour so as
to visit them and Baalbec, which stands nearly opposite
them, on the other side of the plain, but some engagements
and matters of duty did not allow all the company
to proceed thus far.

Our descent from the top was much more easy and
expeditious than our ascent, owing in part to an experiment
we made with complete success. On the south side
of the point a hollow ran up almost to the top; on the
west side of this hollow was a large field of snow, which
extended from near the top to the foot of what I have
called the cone, or down to the second general level. We
made a trial of how we could descend on the snow, and
found that, by keeping near the edge, and walking with
care, sticking the heel with a little force in it, we could get
along with much more ease and expedition than we could
over the rough and exceedingly rocky ground. Our descent
to our horses was soon accomplished; and just as the sun
went down under the western wave, we arrived at our
tents, a little tired it is true, but greatly gratified in having
reached the top of that "goodly mountain and Lebanon,"
perhaps the most interesting mountain in the world.

While we were on the Mount, the day, as it shone on
us, was perfectly clear; the general state of the air, when
we were shaded with an umbrella, or under the shade of
a rock, was pleasant. The direct force of the sun was,
however, warm. We were above the clouds, and had a
most interesting view of their forming far, far below us,[26]
and especially on the sea. Soon after mid-day they began
to form on the far distant horizon over the sea, and continued
to increase until a large part of it was covered; and
about the time we reached the foot of the cone, where we
had left our horses, the clouds exhibited a most brilliant
spectacle. A small strip of the sea, near the foot of the
mountain, had no clouds on it. It lay smooth, like a
frozen lake. The remainder, in all directions as for as the
eye could reach, was covered with immense masses of
clouds, which appeared to us like hills of cotton or wool
upon the waters. It reminded me of some of those great
plains of the valley of the Mississippi, covered with its
immense forests, as seen from some high point of the Alleghany
or Cumberland range, after the fall of a heavy snow.
The clouds appeared about as high above the water as the
western groves rise above the plain       the irregularity of
hill and dale, and the fleecy whiteness of the clouds, as we
looked upon the upper part, which was strongly illuminated
by the sun, corresponded well with groves loaded
with the new-fallen snow in all its virgin purity.

To make the scene still more interesting, a wind set in
from the sea, and drove the masses of clouds against the
mountains. We saw the plains covered and again laid
bare, as masses of clouds, like the irregular columns of an
army, passed over it       drove against the mountains       rose
higher and higher up its sides       and at last swept over us
and by us in huge piles. It was not one large dense
cloud, but a multitude of clouds of various sizes, and at
different heights. The sun pouring its flood of light upon
these masses, so various in height and density and rapidity
of motion, presented the most brilliant and perpetually
varying spectacle that I have ever seen. We had all the
variety of tints and colouring that light and shade can[27]
make, and that ever-changing aspect which is presented by
the kaleidoscope. There was, however, no rain; for while
we often have clouds on these mountains, there has no rain
fallen since I reached Beyroot, which is now more than six
weeks.

We spent the night at the foot of the snows, where the
former night was passed; and having packed our minerals,
shells, and flowers, which we had collected, set off for
Bru-ma-nah. We took a more direct road than the one
by which we came, as we wished to see as much of the
mountain as possible. We passed along a great ridge that
ran from our tents, at the foot of the cone, with various
irregularities, on to Bru-ma-nah. We found it much as
the ridge on which the coal-pits of Corneil are situate.
The upper part of it much of the way is of the sandstone
formation. On the higher part of this is a stratum of very
fine puddingstone. Almost everywhere, in this sandstone
formation, we find petrified wood, much iron ore, iron
stone, and at many places slate, and all the indications of
coal. There can be no doubt that coal exists extensively
in this formation; and, from the tour which we made, I
should think that from one-sixth to one-fourth of this ridge
was of the sandstone formation. It lies about midway up
the mountain; has, generally considered, a horizontal position;
but is at many places most singularly thrown out of
its place. At the heads of hollows, and at the points of
ridges, and often in other places, the limestone seems
forced up, but retains its horizontal position: at other
places, the sandstone is suddenly cut off, and begins again
at a great distance above or below;       but my paper is full.

LETTER V.



Bru-ma-nah, Aug. 2, 1836.


Last Saturday, I went down to Beyroot, mainly to
spend the Sabbath with the small number of Franks that
usually meet at the American consul's for worship. I had
been on the mountains about three weeks, and found the
general temperature pleasant. The thermometer seldom
rose to 75° Fahr. The direct action of the sun was, it is
true, considerable, but I seldom, except when travelling,
went out during the greatest heat of the day. I found the
heat greater at Beyroot; from five to eight, and at times
ten or more degrees. Still the thermometer does not give
the whole difference. There is a closeness       an oppressive
something in the air in the town that makes it more trying
than the same degrees of heat would produce on the
mountains. There is also a very manifest difference in
the heat, and oppressive character of the air, in the town,
and in what is called the Gardens       the numerous dwellings
that lie without the walls, and are scattered for several
miles round the city, mentioned in a former letter.

I have repeatedly witnessed since I came to the mountains
an appearance in the setting sun which I never before
saw, nor have I ever seen it noticed in books. In this
dry season of the year we have but few clouds, and the
sun usually clear; but in setting, it very often assumes
strange and singular appearances. They begin about the
time the lower part of the sun touches the line of the
horizon. The lower part, at times, appears to flatten up;
the upper, to flatten down; and at times, the sides flatten
in       so that the disk of the sun forms nearly a square; it
seldom, however, took this form. More frequently about
the time that one-half of the disk is sunk below the horizon,[29]
a portion of the upper part of the remainder appears to
separate from the body of the sun, and often assumes the
form of an inverted cone, or rather that of a common washbowl,
set on the sun, and at times separated from it by a
black mark, of, say an inch in diameter. This crown-like
appearance, at times, is distinctly visible after the disk of
the sun has disappeared; at other times the body of the
sun appeared to be surrounded with a groove and a band,
giving it the appearance of the capital of a pillar. I have
seen it again and again, as it sank under the line of the
horizon, flatten down, and spread out horizontally, until
in truth it did not look wider than a large walking staff,
while it appeared nearly a yard in length       the length of
the strip of luminous matter appeared really longer than
the usual apparent width of the disk before it began to
take the new form. But the most singular fact of all
remains to be told. We have several times seen, for it is
the most rare appearance, the sun appear distinctly under
the horizon, after the luminous aspect was wholly gone.
It appeared as a dark mass, nearly of the shape of the sun,
but much larger. It seemed under the water, and gradually
to sink deeper and deeper. This sinking of it below the
line of the horizon causes it to appear to approach nearer
the spectator. I saw it on one occasion most distinctly,
when the distance of its upper edge appeared a full yard
below the line of the horizon. It then gradually became
fainter and fainter, until it disappeared. I am not sure
that I am philosopher enough to account for these strange
appearances. They do not appear every night; and seldom
for two nights together are the forms the same. The
general cause, I suppose, is the peculiar state of the body
of air through which the rays of light from the setting sun
reach us on the mountain. We are in a high, pure, and[30]
elastic atmosphere. At the foot of the mountain, and the
plains on to Beyroot, over which the rays pass, the earth
must be greatly heated, and sends up a heated and rarefied
body of air       then, farther on, is the ocean, which must
keep the stratum of air over it cooler. To this I may add,
that we see the sun set over Cyprus. This island lies at
the very edge of our horizon, as seen from Bru-ma-nah;
so distant that it is only at times that we can distinctly
see it. Now Cyprus is an island of considerable size, and
not having much growth is greatly heated by the action of
the sun. This may, by the rarefied volume of air which
it presents to the rays of the sun, tend still farther to vary
their course. Thus passing two or three warm and rare,
and as many cold and dense strata, may be the cause of
all the variety of phenomena above described. I leave it
however for others to solve the problem.

It will soon be two months since I reached Beyroot, and
few things have struck me more than the uniformity of the
weather. There has not been a drop of rain. There has
been scarcely any weather that we should call cloudy.
True, some clouds do at times collect over the sea, and at
times they rest on the mountain, but they are clouds without
rain. They very seldom spread over the face of the
heavens, so as to withhold the light of the sun; they are
mostly confined to one part, and leave the remainder in its
usual clearness. I have, again and again, been reminded
of the fact, that one day is almost precisely like all the
others. We have no opportunity to say "this is a fine
day,"       all are fine.

We may suppose that when there is for so long a period
no rain, and when the sun, almost without exception, pours
on the earth its full blaze of light and heat, the air would
become very dry. It is so; but not to an unpleasant degree       at[31]
least I am not sensible of any unpleasant effects from
it. Plants and vegetation do, it is true, feel it       they
wither and droop; and those who wish to preserve them
in their freshness and beauty, must resort to the means of
watering them. But, as regards comfortable feeling from
the air, I have found few places that were to be preferred
to Mount Lebanon.

The clearness of the air is a most striking characteristic
of these regions. It is most striking, and is manifested in
many things. It is seen in looking at the starry heavens.
The stars are numerous, and the face of the heavens has a
clearness in it, that makes the impression on the mind that
we can see further into the deep and pathless abyss by
which our little earth is surrounded than we can in other
countries. It agrees in this with the Italian sky, but is, I
think, still more clear. This clearness of the air is also
manifest in looking at distant objects. They appear much
nearer than they really are. I am almost perpetually struck
with this in looking from Bru-ma-nah down to Beyroot,
and the long line of coast which lies to the north and south.
When I stand on some one of the points of the ridge that
runs out towards Beyroot, as I often do, especially in my
evening walks, the town appears so near, and the bay at
such a short distance below me, that I can hardly get clear
of the impression that I could throw a finger-stone into
the bay. The ascent and descent, three or four times
repeated, has, however, given the matter-of-fact proof that
it takes nearly four hours of hard travel to pass the space
that lies between Bru-ma-nah and Beyroot. The air, it is
true, is not always equally pure and transparent; a dulness
and obscurity, like that which is often observable in other
countries, at times exist here. The air here is, I think, at
least in the dry season, less liable to it; how the rainy[32]
seasons may affect the air in all these respects, I am not as
yet prepared to say; as I have had no opportunity of
making observations.

But little dew falls at this place; and from all that I
saw in Beyroot, there is but little there, at least in the dry
season; I have not noticed it in the form of drops on the
leaves, indeed I have at this place hardly observed it in
the form of dampness; a slight degree of this is observable
in the evening after sunset. This is our usual hour for
walking, and I have observed that our clothes were a little
damp on our return. I was struck, however, with the
fact, that the nights we were encamped at the foot of the
cone of Jebal Sun-neen, there was an abundance of dew.
Our tents were wet; and the grass and vegetation, and
even dust of the roads, bore witness to it. How it happened
that there was so much of it up there, and so little
of it down here, I leave for the wise to decide; possibly
the cause may be in the neighbourhood of the fact, that
the heat here and at Beyroot is remarkably uniform. It
varies but few degrees in the twenty-four hours; at our
place of encampment, referred to, the variation was much
greater; we had great heat by day and almost frost at night.

The more usual and valuable produce of the mountains
is the silk. Much of their best ground is planted with the
mulberry-tree, the leaf of which is used for feeding the
worms. Not much of the silk is manufactured here; most
of it is exported to Italy, France, and England.

The principal grain grown here is the barley, and a kind
of bearded wheat that looks much like it. I have not,
however, travelled enough to make observation to much
extent. They raise some tobacco       almost every one here,
as you no doubt have heard, smokes       the pipe is everywhere
one of the most common things seen; they have[33]
long handles, usually made of the cherry-tree; the finer
kind are nearly as long as the owner is high, and are tipped
with a mouth-piece of amber. They often use a kind of
pipe called the nargely, in which the smoke is drawn
through water. Much of their time is spent in smoking
and taking coffee.

I am told that in the plains of the Bokar' or Celo-Syria,
a good deal of Indian corn is grown. I have not seen any
of it on the mountains, nor did I notice it on the plains of
Beyroot as I passed and repassed. The mountains do not
raise bread-stuff sufficient for its own consumption; grain
is brought from the plains. They appear to me, indeed,
to live on very little up here; and I have often, while
looking on their simple fare, thought of the poet's lines:


"Man wants but little here below,
Nor wants that little long."


Still a people may have too few wants, they may be too
indifferent as to comforts and conveniences; and the
absence of these excitements may lead to idleness and
almost complete indifference towards all things. If it be
not good for man to be alone, it is still worse for him to be
idle; and he who in great kindness to man gave him the
woman to be with him, in the same spirit of love gave him
employment       to dress the garden and keep it. The devil, it
is said, finds employment for idle people; and, even if that
were not his peculiar business, the idleness of many must,
I should think, put a sore temptation in the devil's way, to
give them something to do. I have often heard the devil
charged with tempting people, but I am inclined to think,
that the temptation is not all on one side; I suspect that
people often tempt the devil. Had our first mother Eve
been attending to her domestic matters as she ought; or,
in company with her goodman, been helping to take care[34]
of the garden, she would probably have escaped the evil
into which she fell.

But to return from this digression. The people of these
mountains are greatly given to idleness; it may result, in
part, from the kind of culture they pursue. The silkworm
can employ but little of their time, and much of the
remainder is unemployed. It would be better for them were
they employed more constantly. The pasha, it is true,
gives many of them employment in connexion with working
the coal-mines, and taking coal to Beyroot; and, while
there may be hardship in the manner in which he presses
them, with their mules and donkeys, into the service, I am
not sure that in a more enlarged view of things it may not
be to their advantage; were companies of the idlers kept
at work constantly in making roads on the mountains, and
keeping those made in good repair, the benefit to the whole
region would be great indeed. But all improvements
travel very slowly in these ends of the earth.

I have long since read of the big-tailed sheep, but do
not recollect seeing any until I reached this place. The
sheep is about the usual size. On the rump and around
the root of the tail, there is a large mass of soft loose flesh
or fat, which appears to be but loosely connected with the
body, except as kept in connexion with it by the skin.
It hangs loose, and shakes about like the udder of a good
milch cow, and altogether has a very singular appearance.
I have not often, if at all, seen flocks of sheep on these
mountains. The goats are often seen in flocks with their
keeper, but the sheep are usually seen singly, or but two
or three together, having a string about their necks, by
which they are fastened when at the house, and led and
managed when out at pasture. We may see them led
about in the gardens and vineyards, and out on the mountain[35]
side, where a tuft of grass is to be found; a boy or
girl is usually in attendance upon each sheep. In the
evening, I have often seen them bringing the sheep to the
springs and pools of water, and pour the water plentifully
over them, I suppose to cool them. The sheep appear to
take it very kindly, seemingly accustomed to it.

The goats are much used for their milk. The cow is
indeed used, and possibly its milk is considered the best,
but the goat, as the more thrifty animal, is most easily
kept, and suits the spare vegetation which is found on the
mountains. They are seen in considerable numbers, and
some of them have uncommonly long ears, which are of a
speckled whitish colour, and hang down from eight to
twelve inches.

The camel is much used here as a beast of burden. It
is a tall, raw-boned, long-legged, and long-necked animal,
but of a patient, quiet spirit. It shares with the donkey
and mule the hard service which the people of these lands
exact of their cattle. I have been surprised to see what
masses of timber they carry down from these mountains
on the backs of camels       beams for houses, shipping, and
all sorts of things. I have seen a beam from fifteen to
twenty feet long, and from eight to ten, twelve, or fourteen
inches in diameter, laid on the back of a camel, one end
projecting forward before the head of the animal, and the
other reaching far behind, and somehow fastened with ropes
to the huge pack-saddle which he carries. Thus loaded
he is made to pass over roads, which require some fortitude
for a man to ride, and pass up and down descents that are
most fearful for such loads: one driver attends each, who
may at the more dangerous passes take hold of the beam
and aid in keeping it steady. The poor animal usually
reaches his place of destination in safety with his[36]
lumber       I say usually, for at times, over-loaded or worn
down with the length of the way, or missing his step, he
falls, and is crushed to death by the merciless load upon
his back.

Who has not heard of the scorpion? and yet who has
seen one? It was not until after I reached Beyroot that
I saw one, and that occurred in a way that took me a good
deal by surprise. One evening during our quarantine,
the scorpion happening to be mentioned as a reptile that
abounded, I expressed a wish to see one. This was
reported to our guardians. The next morning, soon after
I was out of bed, I was called to the porch, and to my no
small surprise, mixed with some apprehension of danger, I
saw one of the guardians having a handful of them,       literally
a handful of scorpions. He may have had from
six to ten of them. They were all small. They are a short
reptile       these were about the size of a common locust;
the body short and flat, with a tail rather longer than the
body. The sting is in the tip of the tail. They strike
forward with the tail. They appear rather a slow, dull
animal, and do not appear eager to strike or do mischief.
When held in the hand, they cannot strike, and the
pressure of the hand appears to produce a dull, heavy
disposition. The guardian handled them as he pleased       he
took hold of the lower part of the tail, with a quick
motion, and then held them close in his hand, piled one on
the other. They have a way of taking them, I am told,
by putting a stick to them that is covered with bees-wax.
The scorpion strikes his tail in it, it sticks fast, and he is
taken. Their sting produces pain, it is said, but is not
often, if ever, fatal. It is but seldom that persons are
stung by them.

And who has not heard of the chameleon, that wonderful[37]
animal that one traveller declared was blue, and another
that it was black, and its owner asserted that it was green,
but which, when produced, was of a different colour from
any of those mentioned! The chameleon is not the only thing
which has been made more marvellous by report than
nature made it. It is a lizard, of a size rather larger than
those little four-legged, long-tailed animals, that in the
spring and summer are seen about old fences and trees,
nearly the colour of the moccason snake. The chameleon
is, in its usual colour, not unlike the above-mentioned
lizard, rather lighter       more like the rattlesnake as to
colour. It is a perfectly harmless reptile, may be handled
at pleasure. It is rather slow in its motions, and when
you touch it, it will swell and blow at a great rate, but
does nothing else. As its passions are excited by handling,
its colour is in a slight degree changeable, and it may
be still more so when seen in different kinds of light.
The change, however, has been much magnified; and were
it not that "as changeable as a chameleon" has become a
proverb, and every one expects something, hundreds of
people might see and handle it, and not observe any change
in its colour. They are often found about houses, and are
said to be fond of flies       what their art of catching them
may be, I know not; their motions appear too slow to
make a living in that way.

I had heard, long before coming to Asia, fearful accounts
of the annoyance I must expect from fleas, bed-bugs, and
other similar sorts of gentry; I have as yet only come in
contact with the fleas, and an occasional musquito. But
really the number and pertinacity of the fleas will well
make amends for the absence of the other tribes of annoying
insects. I know not to what it may be owing, but the
flea does seem to multiply in a way that is astonishing.[38]
They abound almost everywhere, and it appears to be a
matter of impossibility to get wholly out of their reach.
The evil may be increased by the earthen floor, and the
peculiar character of their houses, and, above all, the
unclean habits of the people; and as all the Frank families
have native servants, and are visited a good deal by the
natives, it is not easy for those families to keep their
houses free from the annoyance. I have heard, indeed, a
very significant saying, that the king of the fleas resides at
Beyroot, and his pasha at Jaffa. I suppose it signifies
those are the favourite places with these light-footed
gentry.

The fruit season is now coming on, and we have some
fine varieties of fruit brought to market. The district of
country a little on this side of Jaffa, is the place most famed
for the water-melon. There are but few grown on these
parts of the mountain. I have seen but few vines, and
these bore a small and inferior kind. But the quantities
that come from the vicinity of Jaffa are very great; vessels
arrive at Beyroot almost daily with them. They are sold
for a mere trifle. They are carried all through these
mountains, and are a very fine fruit of the kind.

I have never seen the plum any where to be compared
with those here. They grow, however, near Damascus.
That place is famed for fruit of various kinds, and great
quantities of it are brought to Beyroot, and other towns on
the coast. At this time of the year, when the fruit is
ripe, it is a considerable business to carry fruit and supply
the market. The plum to which I refer is nearly as large
as a hen's egg, and has a fine rich pulp. It is of a deep
red colour, and does credit to the land where it grows.

The apricot abounds at Damascus; and they are brought
in large parcels for the supply of this market. It is a fine[39]
fruit. I have not seen many growing on this part of the
mountain, nor have I seen the apple or the peach growing
in very large quantities. The best used here are brought
from Damascus. I have not seen any apples to be compared
with our best; the apple season, however, is not yet
come.

The grape grows well, and there are some fine vineyards.
The grape that abounds most, as far as I have observed, is
a large white grape. The single grape is often nearly as
large as a partridge's egg. The branches contain a noble
collection of these grapes, and more than once the large size
of the bunch has made me think of the cluster which the
spies took from Eshcol, as a sample of the fruit of the land.
Some wine is made on these mountains, and of a very good
kind, as is said, for I have not so far forgotten my temperance
habits as to use, unless very occasionally, and under
peculiar circumstances, the wines of any of the countries
through which I pass. The wines, I am told, are peculiarly
free from alcohol, and have, if any, but a very small
portion of the intoxicating principle. They are not so
strong as the well-made cider of the middle States.

These mountaineers have a peculiar way of baking bread.
They dig a hole in the ground, about the size of a large
bottle       put a thick coat of plaster around the side and on
the bottom, and then let it dry. It is very much in the
shape of a large pot, a little bulging in the middle. A fire
is made in the bottom of it, of small branches, and kept up
until the sides are well heated; the flames are then suffered
to go down, leaving the mass of coals in the bottom. They
have the dough ready, and take a piece of it, about as
large as a biscuit, and laying it on a board, press it out as
large as a common-sized plate, and nearly as thin as the
blade of a thick knife. They place it on a round pillow or[40]
cushion, (it is so thin it cannot be handled otherwise,) and
strike it against the inside of this potlike place. It sticks,
and in about one minute is baked. It is then taken off,
and another put on. There are, usually, several women
engaged at it at the same time, and they put them on with
great quickness. You may see three or four of these wafer-like
cakes sticking round the tan-moor, as it is called, at
the same time, and changed for others every minute. They
soon bake bread for a meal.




LETTER VI.



Beyroot, August 26th, 1836.


I have just returned from a tour to Damascus, Baalbec,
and the far-famed Cedars of Lebanon, and will
attempt a brief account of these places, and my adventures
by the way.

I had the company of Mr. B              , Angelo to cook for
us, and a muleteer, who took care of our mules, and who
ought to have been our guide, but who, on trial, was found
not to know the way himself       a state of things not uncommon
in this country       and did it not extend to higher
matters than to find the road from one place to another, it
would not be so bad; but from all I see and hear, it is
most dolefully the case in the great matter of finding the
way to everlasting life. Guides there are many in religion,
but few, if any, understand the way of salvation through
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is, indeed, astonishing
how far the great mass of those who in these
regions call themselves Christians, have sunk in darkness
and ignorance respecting the most plain and leading principles
of the word of God. The priests are "blind leaders
of the blind."

[41]

As we set out for Damascus, from Bru-ma-nah on the
mountain, we did not follow the usual road to Damascus
from Beyroot, but took a more direct route. We made for
the lower part of Mount Lebanon, between the Sun-neen
and Jebal Knee-se. I had before passed over part of this,
on my tour to the Sun-neen, some account of which I have
already given you. Part of our way, however, before
reaching the top, was new, but did not differ much from
what I had before seen. We passed a considerable village,
where the Jesuits are said to have a school. It is in a
lovely, romantic spot, and near a most tremendous
precipice.

The descent from the top to the plain is much greater
than I supposed, when on the top. It took us above two
hours to reach Zahle, which stands on the lower part of
the mountain, and at some distance above the level of the
plain. The side of the Lebanon next the plain is not quite
as rough and rocky as the other; in other respects it does
not essentially differ. The cultivation may possibly extend
farther up       the rock more disintegrated, and the strata
not as distinctly marked,       the general course of the ridge
was more regular and uniform. The road, as we approached
Zahle, was better than any I have seen on the mountains       it
passed through a considerable extent of vineyards, and
labour had been expended upon it       it was very passable,
a rare thing in these parts.

A little above Zahle, and in and near it, a number of
fine springs arose, and their effect on the vegetation was
most striking; while the whole face of the mountain presented
a most dry and parched aspect, with only here and
there a bush to be seen, the heads of the little hollows about
Zahle       a small district near the town, and a narrow slip
along the waters, widening as it approached the plain, were[42]
rich in verdure, and abounded with the Lombardy poplar,
the willow, the white walnut, and a variety of fruit-trees.
You could trace most clearly where there was water by
the vegetation which there covered the ground. Yea, you
could point out most distinctly where the water was carried
along the hill sides, in trenches, by the verdure which
covered the whole district below, while all above was almost
destitute of vegetation. The rising of water above and
near the town, being very considerable, and being carried
along the hill sides, and extensively used in irrigation, a
larger district about this town was covered with trees, and
bore more marks of productiveness than any I have seen in
these quarters. A little below the town were some mills
on this water-course, and many lovely gardens lay on all
sides. The town Zahle contains from eight hundred to
one thousand houses. They are crowded together, with
narrow, crooked streets; and, like all other towns in this
land, it has no claim to cleanliness. Judging from what I
saw, the houses are universally built of unburned brick,
made with a good deal of short straw mixed with them, no
doubt to prevent them from breaking to pieces. The
houses are of one story, have flat roofs, where people are
often seen walking or lounging, and on which various
things are deposited.

It being about sundown when we entered the town, we
made some inquiries for lodging. There are usually in the
towns, and occasionally on the roads, houses built for the
accommodation of travellers, called khans. They have
rooms, but are entirely unfurnished, and the traveller is
expected to provide for himself. They are beginning to
keep, at some of them, the more necessary articles of food
for man and beast, which the traveller may obtain at a
reasonable price. Having, in some of my former tours,[43]
been greatly annoyed with fleas, and knowing these khans
are the very head-quarters of such gentry, we were rather
on the watch, and made inquiry before alighting, whether
they had any fleas in their establishment? They assured
us that they had "a plenty! plenty!" We declined stopping,
and passed on amidst the laugh of the bystanders.
It began, however, to grow dark about the time we got
out of the town, and after passing down the stream, among
the gardens, for some time, and not finding a place that
offered a good encampment, we were constrained to put up
at a house on the road side, and sleep in a kind of open
court. We found, to our discomfort, that we had not
much mended the matter. We were most grievously beset
with fleas, which were as greedy as if it was the first
Frank blood they had tasted, and feared it might be the
last.

We found in the morning that we were in the immediate
neighbourhood of a considerable body of the pasha's troops.
Their parade-ground was over against us; arranged along
one side I counted thirty-six cannon drawn up, and as we
passed, we saw a considerable number of artillery-men,
five or six in a company, manœuvring, each under the
direction of an individual. Several of these groups had a
little carriage, not more than a foot long, a perfect toy,
with a string to it, and were drawing it about and manœuvring
it in place of the cannon. It was laughable to see
five or eight great awkward fellows pulling about a little
toy, like a waggon, which a baby could have thrown
about at pleasure. This is the Egyptian version of European
tactics.

There was near this place, which was on the edge of
the plain, a most noble threshing-floor. It was a large
space of several acres, and there may have been from a[44]
dozen to twenty floors, without any partition between
them. On some of them people were employed in threshing
grain, others separating the straw and chaff from the
wheat; on others lay great piles of grain, some clean, and
others mixed with the chaff and straw. They separate the
wheat by throwing it up and letting the wind blow the
chaff away. Of course they must wait for a wind. I
saw no instrument to make wind. The threshing instrument
is a board, about three feet in width, and six or
eight feet in length; at the fore end it is turned up, a
little like a sleigh. The board is about three inches in
thickness. On the under side many holes are cut in it,
from an inch and a half to two inches, and in these are
fastened pieces of stone, flint, or iron; these project nearly
an inch from the face of the board and serve as teeth, to
tear the heads of the grain in pieces. Oxen are fastened
to the front of these boards, and driven round the floor,
drawing this instrument after them. The driver of the
oxen usually sits or stands on the instrument. This is
the common threshing-machine in these countries. I see
it everywhere       and I have seen no other. It would seem
that it is the same instrument that was used in the days
of the prophet, who speaks of a "new threshing instrument
having teeth." The oxen are usually without muzzles,
and often, as they pass round, take up a few straws
and feed on them. "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn." I do not recollect of ever seeing
the horse used on the floor       the oxen very often.

As we passed the threshing floor, in and around which
were many cattle, I could not but notice a fact of which I
had often heard and read, but had not before seen       the
collecting the manure that fell from the cattle and preparing
it for fuel. A female was employed in collecting[45]
it with her hands, working it into balls, and sticking it in
flat cakes against the walls of the houses to dry       when
dry, it was collected in piles and laid on the house-tops, or
made in little stacks in the yard. When well dried it
burns very well, and will make a fire sufficient to boil
coffee. On some occasions, during our tour, we were glad
to get it, and found it did very well. This throws light
on a passage in Jeremiah, where he is directed to prepare
his food with fire made of human excrement       the prophet
entreated, and was allowed to take cows' dung. This
is a common kind of fuel in many parts of this country.
The prophet was only directed to do as his people generally
did.

Our course took us directly across the celebrated plain
of Celo-Syria. It is nearly a dead level       we were about
two hours and a half in crossing it, which, at three miles
an hour, the usual rate of travelling on mules, will make
it about eight miles wide. This is less than I stated in a
former letter. I mentioned then what a gentleman who
had crossed it gave as its supposed width. I now give
what I found it to be. It may, however, vary in width
at different places, and no doubt does. There are very
few trees on the plain. Near the villages, and there are
usually several in sight, some trees may be seen, and at a
few of the villages are considerable groves of them. As
regards the great body of the plain, not a tree or a bush
is to be seen       not a fence       not a hedge       not a house,
except at the few villages.

On the plain, where we crossed, there was a little water.
The stream which flowed in from Zahle is parted and carried
into the plain, and used in irrigation; and it would
seem nearly if not wholly exhausted in this way. Near
the farther side of the plain, we passed several channels[46]
that contained water, but the amount was not great. The
water had but a slow, dull current, and the ground being
soft, we had a little difficulty in crossing, as we feared
swamping. There appears to be a stream of water entering
the plain from the Anti-Lebanon, a few miles north-east
of Zahle; for on that side of the plain we found most
water; and when we entered the plain on our return from
Damascus, which was half a day's journey to the north-east,
we saw scarcely any water, except this stream passing
in       south-west. The channel shows that more water
flows in at times, but it is never more than a small stream       never
deserves the name of a river.

Much of the plain appeared to have been cultivated
with small grain. It was now gathered about the threshing-floors,
several of which were seen in different directions.
I saw also several lots of Indian corn, and a field
that looked almost precisely like what with us is called
broom-corn. It is, I believe, the millet, here called durah.
The corn was a most diminutive kind, and the same is the
case with all the corn I have seen in the East. It was
beginning to tassel and silk, and yet its general height was
not above four feet; with us such a field of corn would not
be thought worth anything. It was, I believe, of the
usual size and promise.

We passed several fields of the castor-oil plant, and were
informed, on inquiry, that they extract the oil from it.
It did not seem to grow as well as I have seen it in other
countries.

We saw several encampments of Bedouins on the plain.
Their tents are said to be made of goats' hair. They are
black       "black as the tents of Kedar," thought I. There
were many flocks of sheep and goats about their tents.
The Bedouins look almost as black as their tents. They[47]
are a dirty-looking set. We spoke to several of them,
and tried to get a drink of milk. They, however, were
so indifferent and slow, and showed so little inclination to
serve us, that we passed on. I noticed before one of their
tents, a huge skin, suspended on forks. It either had been
taken off the animal nearly whole, or had been sewed up.
It was full of milk, which they were shaking, and thus
churning it, making butter, or something of that sort. I
did not much envy the eaters of it       but every man to his
liking.

The whole plain lay open; and as far as we could see,
without any landmarks to point out the special property-rights,
which particular persons may have to parts of it.
There are no fences, nor hedges, nor even ditches, for the
purpose of designating property. There are, it is true,
channels cut in different directions through the plain for
the purpose of irrigation; but only for that purpose. The
flocks that wander over the plain, are under the care of
keepers; whose business it is not to allow them to commit
trespass on spots under cultivation; except there, the flocks
go pretty much where they please, and eat whatever they
can find; and really they appear to have a poor chance to
find much; the above spots excepted.

The Anti-Lebanon lies on the south-east side of this
plain; and is very much such a mountain as Lebanon. It
is, perhaps, as a general thing, not quite so high. Still,
to the south of us it attains to a great elevation, and its
upper part in that direction has much snow upon it.
These two mountains, the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon,
are nearly of the same appearance; and are nearly parallel
to each other, having between them the plain, nearly level,
of an average width of from six to ten miles, in the part
that I have seen. Our road, which was but a path for[48]
mules and donkeys, led us directly up the mountain, winding
and crossing a hollow, that ran up to the top. The
ascent was steep and fatiguing, and took us about three
hours. There were a few thin bushes, and as we got up
into the mountain we found a good many oak-trees       a
few of them of the size of a small apple-tree, but most of
them were only six or eight feet high. As we approached
the top, these were discontinued; and over the whole of
the upper part of the mountain, there was almost a total
want of vegetation. A few stunted thistles and bunches
of furze were almost the only vegetable growth to be seen.

On the top of the Anti-Lebanon, where we crossed, there
was a general level of four or five miles. Possibly this may
not be a fair sample of the width of the mountain, as we
may have passed over an unusually wide place. As far,
however, as we could see, there appeared to be a wider flat
on the top than any I had seen on the Lebanon. The rock,
as far as I observed, was wholly limestone. It is all of the
secondary formation, and appears to be of a softer kind than
that which composes the great mass of the Lebanon. It is
much more affected by the action of the weather, and is
greatly broken into fine pieces: this is the case on the top;
we often passed over beds of fine broken stone almost like
gravel. The stratum, from the yielding character of the
rock, was not so clearly to be traced as on the Lebanon.
At some places, however, it could be seen; and the general
position of the stratum approached the horizontal. There
were, however, many deviations from it: I noticed several
small locations which had the dip to a very considerable
degree. This was especially the case in some small elevations,
or secondary hills, next the plain.

We had a pretty long, and part of the way a rough,
descent to the narrow and beautiful valley of the Bareda.[49]
The rock, as we descended, retained much of the character
which it had on the top. There was, in places, much rock
on the surface; tremendous precipices; piles of rock heaped
on each other, as if mountains of earth had been washed
away and all the rock left.

In the plain, at the point where we reached it, is the
town of Zebdane. It is near the head of the plain, and is
well watered by the upper springs of the river Bareda, or
Bariade, as it is at times spelled on maps. The town has
several hundred houses, mostly inhabited by Mohammedans.
The waters are here taken out of the bed of the
river, and spread over the plain. There is quite a grove of
trees in and near the village. The houses are not so
crowded together as we often find them in other villages;
many of them have gardens, which are filled with trees       the
mulberry, poplar, willow, hickory, apple, plum, and
other fruit-trees. Much of the town is, indeed, well furnished
with shade; and is a most lovely spot, in the midst
of a dry, parched land.

After six hours' exposure to the burning sun, the cool
shades of Zebdane, its flowing waters and rich gardens
had powerful inducements to stop us. In truth, we needed
both rest and refreshment. We had set out early from
Zahle, that we might cross the plain, and ascend the mountain
before the heat of the day set in, intending to breakfast
on or near the top of Anti-Lebanon; but when we reached
the summit we found no water, and our muleteers had
neglected to fill our leathern bags. There was no alternative
but to go on. The burning sun on the top, added
to the fatigue, made us all suffer for water; but none was
found until we were close to Zebdane. When about to
begin our descent, however, we met several muleteers with
mules loaded with fruit, which they were carrying probably[50]
to Beyroot or Tripoli: in the fruit season, much fruit is
brought from Damascus to Beyroot, Tripoli, and other
places on the coast. Supposing that the mules had fruit
in their packs, I was casting in my mind how we could
induce them to let us have some, especially for quenching
our thirst, when the foremost muleteer, while yet eight or
ten yards from me, put his hand into his bosom, took out
a handful of apples, and, with a kind salutation, handed
them to me. I know not that the apples were better than
usual, but I know that I have seldom eaten apples with a
finer relish; they were most refreshing. Feeling much in
need of our breakfast and rest, we passed through a part
of Zebdane, hoping that we could find a cool and comfortable
place for both these purposes. We wished, in short,
to get into some one of the gardens, and under its trees
loaded with fruit, and near the cool streams of water we
saw flowing through them, take our rest; but no one
invited us in; and to one or two applications we received
a refusal. We stopped under a large tree in the street, and
were about spreading our carpet, when a very good-looking
female came out of a garden near us, and very kindly
invited us in.

A stream of water ran through her garden; near it was
a small fire, and preparations for washing. She had been
washing clothes. A young female, whom I took to be her
daughter, and a little boy, her son, were with her. Although
her clothes were rather soiled, they were of a texture that
indicated wealth: both she and her daughter wore rich
ornaments. The daughter had a clasp of silver on each
arm, of an inch and a half in width; and two of gold,
about three quarters of an inch wide; with rich ear-rings,
     c. Their manners had the ease and frankness of well-bred
persons who have been much in company. They[51]
pointed out to us a good place to spread our carpets,
gathered us some fruit, and sat down near us, and conversed
pleasantly and cheerfully. They spoke of our
clothes in a complimentary manner; said they would be
very pretty, were it not that our pantaloons were too
tight. This last was a hit at me mainly, as my companion,
Mr. B., had on the Persian pantaloons, which are
of most ample dimensions. It was said with great good-humour,
and even a little apparent blushing, by the good
ladies. Mr. B., who acted as interpreter, enjoyed the
laugh at my expense not a little. I felt half inclined to
retaliate on them       that even tight pantaloons were more
modest than absolutely naked breasts. But Mr. B. was
not inclined to interpret it for me, and, on second thought,
I let it pass. Fashion is an odd thing! My pantaloons
were of the ordinary size       what, indeed, many would call
large; yet they were not thought modest by these good,
oriental ladies, as showing too plainly the shape of the
lower parts of the body; while they themselves had their
breasts almost wholly exposed! Such is the fashion of the
ladies here. Indeed, I have often been not a little provoked
at the exposure which females here make of the
upper parts of their bodies: they cover their faces, and
expose their breasts. But thus it is in the East, or in this
part of it; and fashion has its influence here as well as in
the western world. If there be no disputing about taste,
there may be some little about fashion.

When our breakfast was ready, we had quite a company
of people to see us eat. We gave them but a poor sample
of Frank manners, as from necessity we had to eat à-la-turque,
at least in part. They were much interested with
the looks of our loaf of white sugar, and we had various
applications for small pieces. But as it was a fast with them       that[52]
is among the Greeks, and our visiters were mostly
of that church       they did not eat the sugar we gave them,
but laid it away until the fast should be over. The same
took place with some sweet-bread we gave them. They
would not let the little boy I mentioned eat what I gave
him, but took it from him to keep until the season of fasting
was over. I doubt whether he will ever get all of it.

The valley in which Zebdane is situate may be on an
average from three quarters to a mile wide; there are
several other villages in it; and it extends five or six miles
in length. Its general direction is from north-east to south-west,
nearly parallel to the plain of the Bokar. The parts
of this plain that are irrigated by the waters of the Bareda,
and the several springs that rise along the foot of the mountains,
appear productive, and are covered with vegetation,
and a space for a mile below the town is covered with gardens
and trees of various kinds. The remainder has rather
a sterile and naked appearance. The mountain that lies
south-east, has especially the most utterly barren aspect of
any district that I have ever seen. Above the little green
spots, that along its foot mark the places where water rises,
there is hardly a trace of vegetation to be seen, all a naked,
sun-burnt surface, desolation could hardly be more desolate.

The gardens about Zebdane are almost universally
inclosed with well-made hedges. The thorn is much used
for this purpose. They are plaited together in such a way
as to make a most ample defence. They have gates, which
have also a kind of fastening, and are thus made very
secure. They are the best hedges I have seen in the East.
A similar protection, I observed, was in some degree
extended to the fields of Indian corn, the castor oil plant,
and other spots under cultivation.

We had a fine sample of irrigation here. The corn fields[53]
are from time to time covered with water. It is let in upon
a field, and runs until the ground is well saturated, then
turned off to another field, which, in its turn, gives place
to another; and thus the water is transferred from field to
field, and garden to garden, to the no small benefit of the
trees, and vegetation of all kinds. Nothing can thrive in
these lands without being from time to time thus watered.
The righteous man is well compared to a "tree planted
by the rivers of waters." It is eastern imagery, to the life.
About 4 P. M. we left the garden, and took leave of the
good lady who had received us with so much kindness.
We made her a small present, which she very thankfully
received, and intimated that at our return we might enjoy
again the accommodation of her garden.

A little more than an hour brought us to the end of the
plain, where the Bareda turns short to the east, and passes
by a narrow and deep defile, through the mountain. The
road follows the stream. The whole mountain, as seen on
both sides of the pass, is of a peculiar character. The stratum
of the rock is very irregular; at places it has the dip,
but with much irregularity. The rock is limestone, of a
very soft, yielding kind, and breaks to pieces readily from
the action of the atmosphere. Much of it is a very coarse
kind of breccia       appears to have been broken into small
pieces, and again combined with a soft cement. Some of
the pieces seem to have been subjected to the action of
water, while in a separate state. But a great deal of the
mountain has all the appearance of an immense mass of
marl, and much of it is in a very soft state, so as to be easily
reduced to a fine white dust. In some places the road is
worn or cut ten, fifteen, or perhaps twenty feet, down
through this marl-like rock.

There are at some parts of the pass considerable precipices[54]
of rock on one or both sides, and on the face of some
of these rocks and at a considerable height from the ground
we saw the entrances of tombs. It must have been difficult to
cut such holes in the face of the rock at such a height. Near
the end of the pass we crossed a good arched stone bridge,
and soon found the valley beginning to open. The character
of the rock continued the same, and the whole face
of the country was peculiarly barren, except a narrow strip
along the river. The waters of the river, even in the
mountains, were taken out of its bed, wherever it could be
done, and made to water a little space on both sides, which
space was more or less covered with trees. We saw indeed
in two places, channels cut across the face of the rock
above the road, which I am of opinion was for the purpose
of carrying the water thus high, that on clearing the pass,
it might be used for watering a wide space of country on
the eastern side. If this was the case, the neglect of
modern times has let go to ruin what may formerly have
given fertility to a wide district east of the mountain, now
almost utterly barren. Many things have fallen back
greatly in this country. As the valley opened below the
pass, the water was taken out, and made to keep nearly a
horizontal course, along both sides of the channel, and used
to water all the district between it and the former bed, and
on this district were fields, corn, vines, fruit-trees, poplars,
willows, and grass for the flocks of sheep and goats, and
other domestic animals.

We passed one or two small villages, and night began
to set in. After looking in vain for the cover of a good
tree, in such a situation as we wished, we spread our carpets
on a little elevation about fifty yards from a small
village, and made our beds for the night. A few of the
villagers came to look at us; but they did not seem to have[55]
as much curiosity or politeness as our good friends at
Zebdane. They were rather a shabby set.

About the time we had finished our supper and were
going to bed, some cause of dissatisfaction among the villagers,
or a family quarrel, took place; and for a short
time there was a terrible strife of tongues. It died away
in part, and I hoped was about to terminate; but was
revived or continued mainly between one man and woman,
as the voices indicated; and such a scold I have seldom
heard. The woman appeared manifestly to have the
advantage. Her tongue was like a sharp sword. It must
have been used before, or it could not have been wielded
with such terrible power on the present occasion. I thought
of the old saying, that "the tongue is the only instrument
that grows sharper and sharper by daily use." The adversary,
whether neighbour, or brother, or husband, I know
not, but suspect it was the latter, appeared to feel that he
had a losing case. He yielded, lowered his tone, let her do
two-thirds, three-fourths, and, towards the last, a still
larger portion of the talking. Such a storm could not last
always, it gradually passed away and the voices became
silent. How many such storms daily take place on earth!
but not one in heaven, no, not one!

It was a Mohammedan village, and this probably a
Mohammedan wife, maintaining her rights against an unkind
or petulant husband. Verily, we of the western
world are far from the truth in the judgments we form
about the domestic manners and intercourse of the Mohammedans,
and especially their mode of treating their wives.
We not only take it for granted that the Mohammedans
believe their women have no souls, (which is not true,)
but we suppose they have no rights, no privileges, and
dare hardly look at their lords, much less speak to them,[56]
under fear of losing their heads. Now, all this is wide of
the mark. The Mohammedan ladies have their rights, as
well as our own fair ones, and know how to stand up for
them       and the female tongue is fully as powerful an instrument
in the East as it is in the West. Judging from what
I used to hear when a boy about the Mohammedans, I
should have expected to have seen this fair one put in a
sack and thrown in the river, or, as water is rather scarce
here to be used for drowning scolds, I should at least have
expected to have seen her head cut off, and her tongue
nailed up in terror to others. But it was plain that the
good lady was in no fear of such treatment; and the good
people of the village, instead of coming to the relief of the
man, were glad to keep out of harm's way; and the ruler
of the town, if it had any, knew better than to intermeddle
with other people's matters; and the man himself received
a lesson which I hope may do him more good than it did me.

"On that night could not the king sleep!" And so it
was with me. Whether it was owing to the train of
thinking which the strife of tongues occasioned; or whether
that Angelo had made my tea too strong, which he is
almost sure to do, for I can't get the notion out of his head
that the stronger and the richer his dishes are, so much the
better; or whether other and unknown causes tended to
chase sleep from my eyes, I know not; but so it was, I
could not sleep. And really it was worth remaining awake
to look on the face of such a sky. We lay on the summit
of a little hill; not a bush or a green leaf near us. We
had a fair horizon, and one of the clearest skies that I ever
saw. It seemed that I could see farther than usual into
the deep abyss, over which the stars are scattered in wild,
irregular, but beautiful confusion. I do not wonder that
astronomy began in the East, and, admitting the very[57]
strong and general tendency of mankind to idolatry, I the
less wonder that, in this eastern world, with such heavens
nightly spread over them, there should have been so strong
a tendency to the worship of the host of heaven. It has
much more show of reason than the worship of stocks and
stones, the work of men's hands.

When we arose in the morning, there was a scarcely
perceivable dampness on our bedding; but the dust in the
road was not laid. The case was, however, different on
our return. We slept out near Zebdane, and not far from
a district irrigated by the waters of the Bareda. Then
our bedding was wet, and we all felt chilly. The dew
was most copious. This was no doubt owing to the low
situation, and its vicinity to a large district over which the
water had been thrown. It was also near the trees and
gardens which for a mile or two cover the plain.

We had about four hours' ride from our place of lodging
to Damascus. Our course was south-east, and, for the
most part, we followed the course of the Bareda. This
stream runs in a channel depressed below the general level
of the country. The country indeed rises into hills, and
small mountains, all of which, without exception, are wholly
destitute of trees. Indeed, it is rare to see a bush on
them under which a lamb could be shaded. There are a
few stunted thistles, and furze, and an occasional tuft of
grass. I have often noticed the fact, that the thistles, a
small stunted thorn, and the furze, which has on it many
prickles of a thorn-like character, are more uniformly to
be found than any other plants. "Thorns and thistles
shall it bring forth to thee." It is even so in these eastern
regions. They grow where nothing else will, but some
places are too bad for them.

The rock through this whole district is of a soft, friable[58]
nature. Much of it has that puddingstone appearance, which
I mentioned as abounding in the mountain through which
we had just passed. I was inclined to think it that kind
of limestone called aolite. Many of the hills were so white,
and washed so easily, that I doubted whether they did not
belong to the chalk formation. They reminded me of the
chalk cliffs of Dover, and the general appearance of the
chalk formation as seen near Dover.

When near the top of the last high range of hills, near
Damascus, we had, on looking back, the most striking
view of a naked and barren district that I ever saw. The
whole range of country, up to the top of the mountain
through which we passed on leaving Zebdane, and far to
the north and south, was in full view; a range of fifteen
or twenty miles in diameter, perhaps much more; and,
except the little green strip that at some points could be
seen along the river Bareda, there appeared to be neither
tree nor bush, nor any green thing. I called Mr. B              's
attention to it, and asked him if he could point out, with
the exception just made, one green thing       tree or bush.
He could not. As the river runs in a deep channel, and
the trees along it are small, it was only at a few places
that their tops could be seen. A more dry, parched, desolate
landscape I never saw.

Our approach to Damascus was from the north-west.
The general course of the plain on which it stands is north-east
and south-west. The northern part, near Damascus,
is bounded by a high, steep, and precipitous mountain; the
suburbs and gardens of the city extending close to its foot.
It was not until we had reached the top of this range of
mountains, from which the whole region we had passed
over for the last five or six hours rose to view, that we saw
on the other side, along the middle of a most noble plain,[59]
a wide district covered with verdure, fields, gardens, and
a forest of trees, extending eastward towards the Bahr-el-Mrdj
or Sea of Meadows, as far as the eye could reach.
In the midst of this, encircled with gardens for miles
around, rose the old, the famous city of Damascus, with
its many gilded domes glittering in the sun. The sight
was most delightful and refreshing; and the more so from
the absolute barrenness and desolation by which it was
surrounded.

Damascus is a walled town; but on some sides the
town has spread far beyond the walls, and forms extensive
suburbs. The north-west side, through which we passed
on entering the city, and in which most of the Franks
live, is thought to contain, if I recollect aright, nearly
twenty thousand people. This, however, is the most
populous part. The walls have once been of great strength,
and were defended on many parts, if not entirely around,
by a deep foss and rows of towers. They are now much
out of repair. The gates are falling to pieces, or approaching
that state. The foss is much filled up at many
places, and the towers have lost their beauty and strength,
and possibly in great part their use       sic transit gloria
mundi.

The streets are narrow, crooked, and miserably dirty.
But little effort is made to remove filth and produce cleanliness.
In truth, throughout this whole eastern world, the
people appear to have very low ideas of neatness and
cleanliness. While the city abounds with water, and a
fountain of it is seen in most of the good houses, you meet
with filth everywhere, and are often most grievously
annoyed with the stench of dead animals in the roads and
streets. Some of the streets are paved, but in a very
indifferent way, and from the great accumulation of dust[60]
they are not in a comfortable condition for passing over.
Some allowances, however, must be made for this abundance
of dust in streets, roads, and open places, and even
in the houses. It is now nearly three months since I
reached Beyroot, and not one drop of rain has fallen       the
sun has not, with the exception of a few hours, been so
covered with clouds as to be hid from sight       most of the
days it has, without ceasing, poured its burning rays upon
the earth. What marvel if the earth be roasted, and
except when water abounds, be converted into dust! The
roads are indeed dusty to a most uncomfortable degree.
So are the streets       and we need not be surprised if the dust
should find its way into courts, parlours, and even bed-rooms.
One of the main streets, called Straight, is shown
as the one in which Paul was found by Ananias. I did not
find a full agreement about its name, some saying it was
so called, and others that this was its usual name. Different
names, it would seem, are given to different parts
of it.

Most of the houses, when seen from the street, have
an old and very shabby appearance. Many of them are
made up of patch-work       mud, wood, and stone. The
mud, however, as the cheapest article, is most abundant.
Occasionally, you may see the lower part of the building
of good hewn marble,       which soon gives place to a
miserable patch-work kind of half stucco and half mortar.
The door-frames are very often found of hewn stone, and
sometimes arched, and this may be the only stone that you
see in the building.

The precise number of mosques in Damascus I did not,
while with those who could have informed me, think of
asking. As I left the city, however, and ascended the
mountain, which gives such a fine view of it, I made an[61]
attempt to count the minarets. I made about thirty;
and possibly this may be an approximation to the true
number.

While under the guidance of the man who showed us
the house of Ananias, and the window through which Paul
made his escape, we were taken to see several other things,
especially some graves, which were not far from the gate.
In one of the large vaults, which was in part open, we
could see the skeletons of various persons       their winding-sheets
in part rotted off       the flesh all gone, and the whole
exhibiting a spectacle most humbling to human nature.
In health man is the most beautiful of animals, and in
corruption the most loathsome. But death will lose its
victory through Christ, to the believer. We were also
taken to the grave of the gate-keeper, who ought to have
known how Paul made his escape, but did not. While
he watched the gate, Paul, it would seem, by the help of
some friends, escaped by the window. The poor gate-keeper
knew and of course could tell nothing about the
matter. But that very ignorance, as it was with the soldiers
who kept Peter, was brought in charge against him.
He ought to have known, and was put to death for not
knowing. The gate-keeper, however, has fared rather
better than the soldiers. Posterity has sainted him       has
erected a neat tomb over him       put a paling around, and
a cover over it. It is considered as a sacred place, and
little offerings are deposited within the paling. I saw
some pieces of money that were placed on the tomb. I
had often heard, that with the papists, ignorance was the
mother of devotion, but here it was the cause of saintship.
When will the measure of folly, under the name of religion,
have come to its full?

Bad as the falsely so-called Christian saints may be,[62]
they are not so shameless as the living saints, which are at
times seen       the Mohammedan, men who have been to
Mecca, and set themselves up to be saints, are often seen
here. I did not happen to see one at Damascus, but saw
one in Beyroot, who passed about the streets and bazaars
in a state of perfect nudity. With the most perfect
shamelessness, they will pass among females, and even
enter the houses and apartments of females, without so
much as a fig leaf to cover their nakedness. Their supposed
holiness gives them great consequence; and at times
and places of peculiar sanctity, at special processions and
in the mosques, they put themselves forward and take the
most honoured place. Poor human nature! how low it
can and will come down, where grace does not prevent.

There are, just outside the walls of Damascus, some
mills, that looked better than any of the buildings of the
sort I have seen in the East. They stand on the main
channel of the river, and avail themselves of its waters to
work their machinery. The bread of Damascus is, for the
East, good.

One of our longest walks was in the after part of the
day, along the river, and among the gardens and shady
trees which line its borders: I could not but notice how
the people were walking, sitting, or lying along the side of
the stream, and how they appeared to enjoy its refreshing
coolness. They were "beside the still waters." Near
the eastern side of the city I was much interested in meeting
with a field of hemp. It was just beginning to blossom.
It was the first, and I may add, the only field of hemp I
have seen in the East.

Most of the houses have balconies, or places projecting
out on the front, having windows at the three sides. They
serve the double purpose of giving access to the air, and[63]
enabling the people to see what is going on in the streets.
These are more or less common as fixtures in houses, all
through this eastern world. The greater part of them
have also courts that are open to the heavens; these in
several of the best houses that I have visited were paved
with marble, and had noble fountains of water in the centre.
Some have more than one fountain; and the house in
which I lodged had one perpetually flowing in the room in
which I slept. There is water enough to keep their houses
and persons clean, would the people but use it.

I was struck with the great contrast between the outside
of the houses and the appearance within. Without all
looked old, rusty, and ready to fall to pieces; but within
there was often a richness and beauty in the marble pavements,
the gilded ceiling, and fanciful carvings, that was
striking. To what this may be owing I know not. Possibly,
in part to avoid the oppressive exactions which all
through these lands is apt to follow the track of wealth, or
the outward show of it.

Noticing that the roofs and upper parts of many houses
were greatly injured, and sadly in need of repairs, I inquired,
and learned that last winter was one of very great
severity at Damascus,       that an unusual quantity of snow
fell, and by its weight did great injury to the houses.
Their mode of building is not adapted for durability. Their
mud walls do not well stand the rainy season, however
they may abide the dry. The wood they use for joists,
and for supporting their flat mud roofs, is in great part the
Lombardy poplar and willow, which is their most abundant
growth, except perhaps the mulberry. This wood they
put in, full of sap, bark and all, and of course in a few
years it must rot, and fall out of its place. When it is
entirely defended from the air and moisture, it may last[64]
some time, but when, as in most cases, it is almost entirely
exposed to both, no marvel if the house needs repairing
nearly every year; and this I am told is not uncommon.

The bazaars or streets, where the stores and shops are
placed, are generally covered over, so as to exclude the sun.
The streets not being more than ten or fifteen feet wide on
an average, a roof is thrown across, at ten, fifteen, or twenty
feet above       not a very close roof, but one that keeps out
the sun, but lets the air have more or less circulation. All
through these countries there is a great care to procure a
shade from the scorching rays of the sun; for this purpose
the streets are made narrow, and in many places are
covered, so that those who pass may have shade. This
narrowness of the streets, and the covering of them, does,
it is true, give a closeness to them, and operates against a
free circulation of the air; but this is supposed to be compensated,
in part at least, by the protection they give from
the direct action of the sun.

I was taken to the house, as was said, where Ananias
dwelt. It is a kind of cellar,       a poor, miserable place;
and I am sure that so good a man deserved a more comfortable
residence. I doubt altogether whether it was his
house. But I did not judge it worth while discussing the
matter with the Catholic priests, who claim the ownership
of it, and show it. I also went to see the window through
which Paul is said to have been let down in a basket. It
is over one of the gates. I had as little faith in this as the
other. There is indeed, I think, strong evidence against
it. I did not go out to the spot at which Paul is said to
have been converted. The day was hot, the distance
considerable, and nothing marked the place. There is a
thousand chances to one against it being the real place.

The population of Damascus is not certainly known.[65]
From all I could learn from several resident Franks, it
may be 125,000; and in the one hundred and seventy-three
villages which lie round Damascus there may be an
equal number. A gentleman who has paid some attention
to the matter, and has been some time a resident in the
country, supposes the population of all Syria to be about
one million and a half. The chief data used in forming
the estimate is the number of men, the heads of families,
who pay the tax levied on such. They are about 25,000
in Damascus, and may form one-fifth of the population.
This, at least, gives an approximation       the best we have
when no census is taken. The majority of the population
is Mohammedans, but the proportion I either did not get,
or have forgotten it. There are a few Jews, and some of
all the various sects of Christians found in these regions.

Damascus has long been considered by the Mohammedans
as one of their sacred cities; and it is not many years since
when their bigotry was so great that Christians had to use
much caution to avoid its outbreakings. There is a great
change in this respect. Christians may now go about with
little danger. We rode repeatedly through the crowded
bazaars, and no one appeared to take the least offence;
and generally gave their salaam with indications of kindness.
Still, it will sometimes show itself. It is not long
since that Mr. Calman, a Jewish missionary, when engaged
in selling the Scriptures, was taken up by the bigoted
Mohammedans, and for a time feared that he might be put
to trouble, but was released without much difficulty.

The main, if not the only river which waters the part of
the plain where Damascus stands, is the Bareda. It rises
near Zebdane. We followed its course, as I have before
informed you, until it entered the plain. There it is divided
into three parts, which are led at a distance from each[66]
other for the purpose of watering the plain. From these
channels a multitude of smaller ones are led in all directions,
so that every part of the plain within reach of the water
may, from time to time, receive its life-giving influence.
The main channel passes through or near the city, and its
waters are carried by pipes to every part of it.

To the south and south-east other streams are said to
enter and flow through the plain; but we did not visit
those parts. They must be small streams. Indeed the
Bareda is a small stream. It would with us be called a
good mill stream. We would rather term it a creek than
a river. It is mostly confined in a channel of eight or ten
yards wide, and then may be waded without coming above
the knee. Much of the water of these rivers is exhausted
in irrigation. They flow east, and after rendering a noble
plain very fertile and productive for twenty or thirty
miles, form a lake or marsh       they have no outlet. I
wished much to ride eastward through this plain and see
the country about the lake, but the time of the year and
other causes prevented.

It was the sickly season, and there was much sickness
in Damascus. Visiting the city at such a time was not
classed with a high degree of prudence and caution, while
to have spent a week or so in exploring the plain, and
visiting the many villages along the Bareda, would have
been considered almost madness       a tempting of Providence.
I therefore spent but one night and two days in Damascus,
and then hurried back to the high ground on the great
mountain of Lebanon       not, however, without a lingering
purpose that when the heats of summer are passed, I may
take Damascus in my route again, and see more of its wide-spread
plains, and thickly-planted villages.

The whole country east of Damascus, on the Euphrates,[67]
is, I am told, much like what I have seen in the part
already passed over. As a general thing, it is wholly
destitute of trees and even bushes       and during the summer
there is but little verdure; much of it is covered with sand.
There are, however, spots where water is found, and at all
these vegetation is produced. Where these spots are of
any size there are villages, and man contrives to live.
These green spots are like small islands scattered over the
face of the ocean, and may be found all the way to the
Euphrates, and down that stream past Bagdad to the
gulf.

The ruins of Palmyra lie two or three days' travel north-east
of Damascus. They have often been visited lately, and
the danger is not great. Still it is too great to be lightly
hazarded. A party, of whom a friend of mine was one,
were robbed in an attempt to go there about five months
ago. A slight skirmish took place between them and a
large party of Arabs, in which they were overpowered and
robbed; some were wounded, but happily none killed. Indemnification
has been had from the tribe who robbed
them.

An attempt is about being made to establish a regular
communication between Damascus and a point on the
Euphrates, beyond Palmyra; which, if successful, will
throw much more light on the interior of this region, and
may make it an easy thing to visit that far-famed river,
and the many antiquities that abound on its banks.

Damascus is a famous rendezvous for caravans. The
caravans for Mecca, Bagdad, and various other places,
either pass or start from this place. Some had come in
just before we were there, and others were preparing for
their departure. This gave some activity to the business
of the place. The shortness of my stay, for the reasons[68]
above assigned, did not allow me to see much of them. I
had not time to go out to the edge of the desert, where
they usually encamp, and there to see the grotesque appearance,
the odd mixture, and pell-mell state of things produced
by such assemblages of men of all nations, and such
herding together of man and beast.

Damascus, and the region about it, is somewhat celebrated
for its fruit of various kinds. The grapes were fine       the
apricots good, and abundant       the plums the largest
and finest I ever saw, being nearly as large as a hen's egg.
I saw but few peaches, they are said to be good       the figs
were fine of course       the apples indifferent. The white
mulberry-tree is much cultivated in this section of the
country, not for its fruit, which is but little esteemed, but
for feeding the silk-worm. The silk forms a considerable
branch of the Damascus trade, and the manufacture of it
carried on to some extent. The black mulberry is found
in considerable quantities, and is cultivated for its delicious
fruit. The white walnut is with the natives a favourite
tree. The nut is rich and of a pleasant taste. The tree
gives a fine shade, grows well near the water, and is larger
than most of the other trees. The sycamore is found here.
The plane-tree is also found, but not very common       this
is often called the sycamore with us. There is a very large
one in Damascus near one of the gates. We measured it       thirty-six
feet around. The karoob-tree is a variety of
the locust. The fruit is the husks which the Prodigal Son
would have eaten       a bean-like pod with a sweetish meat
in it.

LETTER VII.



Beyroot, Sept. 5th, 1836.


We left Damascus by the same road by which we had
entered it, and continued on the same way as far as Zebdane.
Having already made some remarks on the characteristic
features of this district, I will say no more
about it.

From Zebdane, we kept up the valley, which ran a
north-east direction. It becomes narrow very soon after
leaving that place, the ridges from the mountains on both
sides close in and often almost meet, leaving but a small portion
of level ground. Passing the sources of the streams, the
quantity of water diminishes fast. The trees almost cease
except at occasional spots, where care has been taken to
plant them. The ground for about an hour's travel is
rough; the plain then opens again to a considerable
extent, and is more or less cultivated. There are a few
houses; but this part is but poorly supplied with water,
and without that the regions must be barren and desolate.

We soon found ourselves passing over the highest part
of the plain, and beginning to descend. In short, we found
that this little plain was at the separating point of the head
waters of the Bareda which flows to Damascus, and those
of the El-Kanne, which flows into the Bokar through the
Anti-Lebanon east of Zahle. We soon came to the head
branches of this last stream, which is formed of a set of most
noble springs, rising in the middle of the plain. There is
quite a cluster of them rising near each other, and throwing
off enough water to turn a mill; fine, pure, cool water.
As is usual, it is carried in channels through different parts
of the plain. There is a little cluster of trees, and the
whole district over which the water can be thrown is cultivated,[70]
and rich in verdure. A small village stands just
below, and we found some females at the spring engaged in
washing. For a small present they allowed us the use of
their fire to prepare our food; and again a good deal of
interest was excited to see the Franks eat.

The mountains continued very bare of trees, and shrubbery
of every kind. In the few places where water rose,
there were a few trees, all else was a barren, sunburnt surface.
After passing the village, which was poor in its
appearance, the plain became more barren and rough, and
the cultivated district more and more narrow. At the end
of half an hour it terminated at a rough, narrow pass,
nearly due west, and directly through the Anti-Lebanon.
We followed the waters through this pass. The sides were
steep and high, and the rock thrown about in wild confusion.
The dip of the rock was very variable at different
places. Along the stream were a few trees, and we saw
several large flocks of sheep and goats, under the care of
shepherds and their dogs.

After following the pass for an hour and a half, it bore to
the south-west; we left it, crossed a pretty high ridge to
the north-west, and entered the Bokar. On reaching the
top, the plain opened to view, and we had been led to
expect that we should find Baalbec at the point where we
entered the plain. But no Baalbec was to be seen. We
found, to our no little discomfort, that we had about two
hours' ride northward, along a dry plain, under a burning
sun, before we could reach this far-famed ruin.

We passed several most extensive threshing-floors. Their
threshing instruments and mode of cleaning the grain, were
the same as has been already described. I might add, that
in bringing their grain to the floor, and in carrying away
the straw, they use mules and donkeys, and at times the[71]
camel. I saw, in no instance, the use of a wheel-carriage.
The only wheeled-carriages that I have seen in Syria were
those for cannon at Zahle, and ten or fifteen carts which I
saw at one time passing a street in Damascus. These carts
were of a coarse, strong kind, belonging to the Pasha, and
were then employed in carrying materials for the castle
which he was repairing.

Our road lay over the ridges, at the foot of the mountains,
along the eastern side of the plain. The soil over which
we passed was thin. There was much rock on the surface,
and in many places there were wide-spread masses of
a very coarse puddingstone, that appeared to have once
formed a huge bed of water-worn rock, bowlders, and
pebbles, and owing to some cementing matter which had
come over it, had become a solid rock. As we approached
Baalbec this rock discontinued, and gave place to a very
thick stratum of massy limestone of a peculiar kind, which
is mainly used in the walls of Baalbec.

Baalbec stands near the foot of the Anti-Lebanon, a little
above the general level of the plain. The ridges of the
mountain lower down gradually, and spreading out, form
a general level, which merges insensibly into that of the
plain. It is on this elevated level that the ruins stand;
about a mile from them, on the side of a hill, is the quarry
that has furnished the stone for these stupendous buildings.
A little to the east arises the finest set of springs that I have
seen in Syria. They boil up over a considerable surface,
and send off a stream of water sufficient to set in operation
various kinds of machinery, if applied to that purpose.

The ground on which the ruins stand is nearly a dead
level; a large district has been surrounded by walls, traces
of them remain. The space covered by the ruins of the
temple, or set of temples, and possibly theatre and other[72]
buildings, is about nine hundred feet long, and six hundred
broad. The area is not, however, a regular parallelogram,
there are off-sets at some of the towers       towers having
apparently been added when the place was fortified, and
converted into a fort. A foundation or platform of great
thickness, I should say not less than ten feet, seems to have
been laid over this large space, and upon this foundation the
temples have been reared.

The stones in this foundation and wall, as in the walls
still higher, are many of them of a most enormous size; at
the west and south-west corner especially, they are almost
incredibly large. Where all were so large, we did not think
it worth while to measure very many. In one row, and
that one at some distance from the ground, are three stones
which we measured, and made them about seventy feet long
each, and about fifteen feet wide. The thickness we could
not certainly tell, but we inferred it to be about fourteen
feet. These stones are much of the same shape and appearance,
they are precisely like one which lies nearly cut out
in the quarry, which we were, from its position, enabled to
measure accurately. It was seventy feet six inches long,
fourteen feet two inches thick, and seventeen feet nine inches
wide at one end, and thirteen feet eight inches at the other.
We were at once struck with its perfect likeness to the three
stones in the wall; all of them were wider at one end than
the other. I suppose that these four large stones, the three
in the wall and the one in the quarry, were originally
intended, either for obelisks, pillars, images, or some such
thing; that their being now in the wall, is owing to a
subsequent arrangement, when the place was converted into
a fortress, and those stupendous outside walls put up, which
now fill us with wonder.

Under these three immense stones are seven others,[73]
which almost equal those above them in width; their
thickness also, judging from what is seen at the corner of
the building, does not much fall short of a due proportion.
In truth, they are upon a most gigantic scale. This row
extends along the south-west side nearly one hundred
yards, forming a most solid foundation, ten or twelve feet
high, which, however, on this side, is not built upon out
to the edge, the wall going up about twenty feet inward.
The above-mentioned are the largest stones I saw in these
ruins; but many others are enormous, and, as a general
thing, they are very large. As a sample, I measured one
of a large row of stones at the south-east corner of the
most perfect building now standing, (it was a corner stone,
which enabled me to ascertain the thickness,) and found it
to be twenty-eight feet long, six feet six inches wide, and
four feet six inches thick. I was not at all certain that I
might not, on measuring, have found many still larger.

The most perfect temple, now standing, is on the south-east
side of the above wide foundation. It is one hundred
and fifty-seven feet long, seventy-eight wide, and the walls
now may be sixty-six feet high. We inferred its height
from the length of one of the fallen pillars, with a row of
which it was, and still is in part, surrounded. The pillar
is forty-nine feet eight inches; the capital, six feet two
inches; the entablature and the pediment may be ten;
making       say sixty-six feet. These pillars formed a portico
all round it       a covered way; the pillars being
connected with the temple by enormously large stones
resting one end on the pillars, and the other on the walls.
The lower faces of these stones were most richly wrought
with various devices. The pillars are six feet four inches
in diameter at the bottom, and five feet eight inches at the
top; most of them are in three pieces. The door of the[74]
temple is at the east; the pillars there are fluted; the
porch before the door was wider than at the sides       a noble
arch was sprung over it, and in the centre, and on the
lower face of what is called the keystone, (a stone of most
gigantic size,) was carved a majestic wide-spread eagle.
This stone has sunk out of its place, and threatens to fall
from the arch. A modern wall has been put up, about
ten feet east of the door, and at the end of the walls, no
doubt for the purpose of defence.

In the inside of the building, and half sunk in the walls,
are fluted pillars, and at the corners they are so cut as to
appear double, the piece being one. At about fifteen or
twenty feet from the west end, two noble fluted pillars
have stood at some distance from the sides, evidently making
part of a separation of a more sacred apartment. They
are fallen, but enough remains to show that the sanctum
sanctorum stood there. There is no roof on this building,
and from the fact that there are no windows in it, and other
reasons, it may be doubted whether it ever had one: on
this, however, I hesitate to give an opinion.

The south-east row of pillars belonging to this temple
range with the wall that rose from the deep wide moat, by
which the whole mass of buildings was surrounded. Opposite
this temple, on the north-west side of the foundation,
are the remains of a still larger temple, or building of some
kind. But a small part of it remains; along the north-west
wall is a row of pillars, or rather parts of pillars, the
spaces between which have been filled up with large stones,
forming thus a solid wall. Opposite this, and nearly half
way to the temple, on the other side of the foundation,
stands a row of pillars, now reduced to seven or eight, the
remainder having fallen. They are about the size of those
described       possibly they are larger. The foundation on[75]
which they stand must be eight or ten feet higher than
that of the temple above described. These pillars have the
capitals on, and are connected by their richly-carved and
magnificent masses of entablature. How they have survived
those convulsions which have prostrated their companions,
I know not. The ruins which lie about, the
broken rows of pillars and walls, show that this edifice has
been of great extent. Its sides, I am inclined to think,
have not been solid walls, but composed of these rows of
columns, and most probably the whole building has been
open to the heavens.

There is near the temple I have first described, and but
a few yards from its north-east end, a large building with
very high and strong walls. It projects out a good deal
into the ditch, and has some loop-holes. It is, as the arabesque
work about the door shows, an Arabic or Mohammedan
building. It is badly lighted; it was used as a
granary or magazine for the troops stationed here, and we
were thus prevented from examining it.

Around the outside of the whole of the above wide foundation,
and on the outer edge of it, a wall of most enormous
stones is run up to a very great height; much of it, it is
true, is fallen, but it was originally from forty to fifty feet
high. At the corners were towers, and in various places
loop-holes; at the east end a most stupendous archway
ran far in, having its floor nearly on a level with the ground
without. Possibly there were two of them originally, but
one was partly closed, leaving a small entrance. Such great
changes have been made on these ruins, by the fitting them
up for a fort, that it is not easy to know what their
original plan and uses were. The whole is surrounded by
a deep wide ditch, which could be filled with water; it is
now much filled up with rubbish.

[76]

A wall has originally extended from the south-east, and
possibly also from the north-east, across the narrow plain
which lies between the ruins and the hill to the east.
This wall, much of which remains, has been of great
strength. On the side of the hill is a very large pediment,
and about it lie many pieces of a stupendous column which
once stood upon it. No mortar or cement was used in the
construction of these works. The rock has been cut so
smooth, and fitted so exactly, that it is impossible to insert
the blade of a penknife between them.

I had heard that there were large columns of Egyptian
granite among these ruins. I saw some fragments of small
columns of that kind, but the large columns were all of
the rock which abounds in the quarry near. There is, in
an old mosque not far from these ruins, a number of
columns of Egyptian granite, but none of them of a very
large kind. Still they were large enough to start the
inquiry how they could have been brought from Egypt to
this place       how could masses of rock, three feet in diameter
and ten or fifteen feet long, be brought over Mount
Lebanon, which is so steep and high that it is a great
labour for man unloaded to pass? That it is the true
Egyptian granite, all who know that rock will at once
admit       no such rock is found in Syria.

Within the wall, and among the rubbish, is a small
village. The houses are indifferent, and the population
must be small. The Christians live in one quarter, and
the Mohammedans in another.

Rather to our surprise, on reaching Baalbec, we saw to
the east of the ruins a number of tents, and other appearances
of an encampment. We learned in due time that
there was stationed here a body of four or five hundred
Egyptian troopers, and that they had made this their head-quarters[77]
for several years past. They lodged in tents
separated a little from each other, so as to give room for
fastening their horses. The tents were pitched in rows
and the horses arranged with some regularity. All had a
very pretty appearance.

I was interested in the contrivance for feeding their
horses. Wood is not to be had here; and it would be
labour for a Turk to make a trough for his horse out of
stone. They have found a softer material. They take
earth, and making it into mortar, form a pile of about
three feet in diameter, and nearly the same in height       the
sides are then raised, leaving a place within like a mortar,
in which the horse's food is placed. There are rows of
these horse-troughs, as they may be called, all through the
encampment, and the horses regularly fastened to them.
As we walked round the ruins one morning to get an
entire view, we passed near a tent, before which, under
the shade of a tree, sat several Turkish officers. From
their dress, and some badges of honour which one or two
of them had on their breasts, we took them for persons of
some distinction. They kindly called us to come to the
tent. They had two very good chairs, which they made
us occupy, seating themselves à-la-turque. They entered
freely into conversation, and made us take a cup of coffee,
after which we pursued our walk.

We had intended to take up our quarters among the
ruins, but finding so many soldiers near, we did not deem
it prudent. We therefore applied to the Latin convent,
but on pretence of being full they did not admit us. An
offer was made us of a room in a house near the convent,
but on examination it was so close, dark, and filthy, that
we preferred taking up our lodgings on the top of the
house. There we spread our carpets and spent two nights;[78]
we found it a very pleasant place. It was cool and pleasant,
and no dew fell worth mentioning. The only inconvenience
we experienced was, in dressing we were exposed
to the gaze of all those who felt a wish to see how the
Franks put on their clothes, shave their beards, and
do those other things that are usually done in one's
chamber.

Our route from Baalbec was to the far-famed cedars.
They grow on the Lebanon, and on the side next the sea.
Our road was directly across the plain, as the cedars are
nearly opposite Baalbec. It took us about two hours and
a half to cross the plain. This, at the usual mode of counting,
would make it nearly eight miles wide. We found
scarcely any water in the plain; there was indeed a small
dry channel, and not far from it a slight trace of water,
which was led along so as to water some districts; the
quantity was small, and must soon have been exhausted.
The noble body of water which came from the set of
springs near Baalbec was separated near those ruins: one
part was carried to one side, and the remainder to the
other; a considerable district through which they flowed
was rich with verdure. A pretty line of trees marked for
a mile or two the tract of the plain through which the
water passed, but at the end of a few miles they appeared
to be exhausted. As the trees and richness of verdure
ceased, the plain below assumed its dry and parched aspect.
In these sunny plains the exhaustion of water must be very
great; and I now the less marvel to find lakes which have
no outlets, and rivers which are lost in the sand. They
become exhausted.

When we had nearly reached the foot of the Lebanon,
we saw a large solitary pillar standing in the plain. We
saw no ruins near it. We were told by a peasant that it[79]
was just like the pillars in Baalbec, but what it was doing
there alone he was unable to tell.

The ascent of Mount Lebanon was a most toilsome
matter. We had to cross over one of the highest points of
the mountain. There is another way which is more easy,
but farther; we preferred crossing the highest place, as we
might not cross here again, and wished to see the mountain
in all its majesty. The first ridge which we ascended
had more natural growth on it than any district I have
seen in this country. It was pretty well covered with
shrubs and low trees       most of them oak. The tops of
most of the large ones had been cut off, I suppose for fuel.
They appear to pursue a plan here, much followed in some
parts of France, Savoy, and Italy, of cutting off the tops
of the trees for fuel; and when the branches which shoot
out have grown to the thickness of a man's arm, they are
again cut off for the same purpose, and the same course
still followed.

The rock on this ridge was wholly limestone. As we
approached the top of it, and near the foot of the main
ridge, the rock was very soft and much broken from the
action of the air upon it. This continued to be the character
of the rock over most of the main ridge. In some
parts it was broken very fine and formed beds of loose
rock; in which our mules sunk as if it were a bed of sand.
A little up the side of the main ridge rose a beautiful spring
of clear water, which served to produce verdure over a
small district below. There were a few trees and shrubs
scattered over the ridge almost to its summit; but in these
upper parts they were few and small, and far between. I
saw a few stunted cedars among them. As we approached the
top, we passed through several large banks of snow. The
face of the mountain was not generally covered with it, but[80]
it lay in large masses or spots where, from some cause, the
wind had thrown much of it together. Streams of water
flowed from them. When on the top we had satisfactory
evidence that we were on one of the highest points of
Lebanon. The ridge was narrow at this part of the mountain;
there was no snow on the very summit, nor was
there much on the north-west side       much less than on the
south-east, and much less on either than on the Sun-neen,
when I was there five weeks ago. The entire upper region
was destitute of vegetation, not a bush to be seen, and but
a small sample even of the thistle, which of all other plants
appears the most tenacious of spreading itself everywhere.

From this eminence we had a most extensive view to
the west       the long, irregular slope of the mountain to the
sea       the narrow plain along the coast       and the wide-spread
Mediterranean, till where the heavens appeared to
come down and fence in the waters. But the object
which among the first was sought for, was the cedars       the
far-famed cedars of Lebanon! where could they be?

The Lebanon, at this place, makes on the side next the
sea a considerable bend, having the concave part next the
sea. We stood opposite the deep and wide hollow that
comes up from Tripoli, and down which flows a stream,
the head springs of which rose far below our feet. The
mountain, both to our right and left, threw out high and
long ridges towards the sea. We had a steep descent
before us of, I should think, at least two thousand feet;
on the sides of which not a bush was to be seen. Then,
there was a small level in which several springs of water
took their rise; and from the lower side of this level
another deep and rough hollow opened, with stupendous
precipices on its sides. Below this, and along the sides,
we saw trees and a considerable village. Near the middle[81]
of the little plain, at the foot of the steep descent below us,
we saw a clump of trees, but they looked too few or too
small for the cedars. They resembled a small orchard of
evergreens. We found, however, on reaching the plain,
that they were the cedars we sought. They stand in irregular
groups, spread over several little stony knolls, and may
possibly cover eight or ten acres of ground. They are not
what with us is called the cedar, but a variety of the pine.
It is a resinous tree bearing a cone. The wood is of a
white pine-like appearance. We spread our carpets, and
spent the night under one of the father-trees of this grove.

It is not easy to decide how many old trees there are;
eight or ten have a more venerable appearance than the
remainder; still others approach them so nearly in size
and marks of age, that it is difficult to say why one should
be called old and the other young. I once thought of
counting the grove, but from the irregularity of the ground,
and the situation of the trees, this was no easy matter       especially
for a man who had crossed the Lebanon the
same day. I counted, however, a small section, and am
disposed to think that there may be from 300 to 500 trees
that are more than a foot in diameter       possibly 150 that
may be above two feet       and about 50 or 60 that may be
from three to four feet in diameter. A few we measured;
the largest was 39 feet in circumference       one 32       one 29       one
28, and one 23: these may serve as a sample. Most
of the large ones forked near the ground, and were rather
assemblages of trees from the same root than a single tree.
Those of the third size had some of them fine, straight
bodies, and ran up to a considerable height. We procured
some specimens of the wood, and a sample of the cones,
and then bid adieu to this much-talked-of grove.

It is pretty certain that this grove did not furnish wood[82]
for Solomon. It lies opposite Tripoli, which is two days
north of Beyroot, and Beyroot is north of Tyre and Sidon.
It lies up far from the sea, and has a piece of country
between it and the sea, as rough as can well be found anywhere.
The grove does not appear to be diminishing, but
rather increasing. I saw no stumps of fallen trees, and
young ones are springing up. There is a kind of religious
reverence for these trees among the neighbouring
villagers. They have a singular appearance standing alone
in the midst of a small plain on which no other trees grow,
with no other trees above them, nor for a considerable
space below. Another singular fact is, that there is no
water running among them. There is a stream on the
side of the plain, but it comes not near them. The ground
appears enriched with the leaves that fall from them,
and looks precisely as the soil usually does in a pine
grove.

Leaving the cedars, we passed down the valley; a most
rough and steep descent. We passed a village well watered,
surrounded with mulberry, poplar, willow and fruit trees
of various kinds. The state of cultivation on both sides of
the valley, for some distance down, was much better than
I have usually seen in these mountains. Several villages
were in sight.

I noticed that the females here had a new kind of horn.
It was only about six inches long, but much larger than
those worn at Beyroot and Bru-ma-nah. It was like the
crown of a very small hat, with the front part a little
enlarged like the mouth of a bowl. It is fastened on the
top of the head, but a little back, and has much ornament
upon it. In our descent we passed a sandstone formation;
there were no pines upon it, as upon those formations near
Bru-ma-nah. Near the mouth of this hollow, the rock[83]
becomes very irregular, and has the dip much more near
the top. This is especially the case with the secondary
ridges and the irregular hills which rise between the main
ridge and the sea. There is a plain of some extent between
Tripoli, which stands on the sea-shore, and the foot of the
mountain, interspersed with vineyards, fields, villages, and
fine groves of olive. There is much rock on the surface;
their mode is to throw the rock out of the fields and
vineyards into the road, to the great annoyance of the
traveller.

We passed a very high rock in the middle of the plain
which had a wide, high, flat face to the south       in that
face I counted the mouths of nearly thirty tombs. Most
of them were from ten to twelve feet high. There was a
house on the top, said to be a convent.

We also passed an old city, which must once have been
a place of great strength. The walls are nearly perfect
and very strong. There are but few people in the city.
It stands there almost alone. Most of the houses within
are gone, and cultivated spots occupy their place. It
is said to be the city of Gebal, Ez. xxvii. 9, now called
Jebail. The plain along the coast is rough       has a few
villages       several small rivers enter. On the banks of one,
Nahr El-Kelb, or Dog river, which has a good bridge over
it, we saw some figures cut on the face of the rock. They
are very ancient, and it is said that the Persian arrow-head
may be seen. I did not stop to examine them. They
are too much defaced to be deciphered correctly.

LETTER VIII.



Beyroot, September 12, 1836.


We have had a very pleasant visit at this place from
the American squadron, consisting of the Constitution, the
United States, and the John Adams, under the command
of Commodore Elliott. The general regret was, that its
stay was so short       less than one week. It is seldom that
vessels of war, except those of Mohammed Ali, visit this
place. The English, although they keep a large force in
the Mediterranean, have not sent one ship of war to this
coast for several years, and the last one sent was of a very
small size. The Delaware, under Commodore Patterson,
was here two years ago, and made a very good impression
of American character and power. At that time the
stay was longer, and I was told by a gentleman of the
place, who had the best opportunity of knowing, that he
supposed about forty thousand persons visited the ship
during Commodore Patterson's visit. A very large number
visited the vessels during the few days that they
remained here under Commodore Elliott.

I was on board the Constitution on the Sabbath, and
present at public worship. Several from Beyroot attended,
and it was pleasing to see full attendance of officers and
men, and the perfect quiet and respectful attention which
the crew exhibited. The youngest child of the American
consul had not been baptized, and he expressed a wish to
have it baptized on board the Constitution, and by the
chaplain of that vessel. This was done at his request,
and the child named Washington; and thus, as was pleasantly
remarked to him, he has now a good constitutional
child. In the afternoon, the Commodore and some of his
officers attended worship on shore at the consul's, where[85]
service is regularly performed, usually by one of the
American missionaries, or some other preacher of the
gospel who may be present.

The commanders and officers deserve great credit for the
readiness they manifest to satisfy the natural but almost
troublesome curiosity of the many who go off to see the
vessels. It is really no little trouble to be employed from
morning to night, and that from day to day, in receiving
company after company       it may be having three or four
companies on board at the same time       taking them through
the ship, and showing and explaining to them whatever
excites their notice. It is not to be wondered at, that in
the public vessels of most of the European powers, this
privilege is allowed but to a few. The American commanders
have, very wisely, I think, adopted the plan of
indulging and gratifying the curiosity of the people,
although at the expense of trouble to themselves. The
American flag is not much known as yet in these seas;
the nation is not much known.

Of the few Americans scattered around these shores, a
considerable portion are the missionaries and their helpers,
who are labouring to dispel the darkness that rests on
these countries; to impart correct knowledge of religion
and morals; to break the chains which gross superstition
has here laid on the human mind, and to promote all kinds
of useful knowledge and improvement. Most of these
missionaries are regularly educated men, and all of them
of good repute as to morals and religion. From the peculiar
state of superstition and bigotry in these countries       from
a watchful jealousy of a corrupt and dominant priesthood,
it must be expected that a jealousy will be felt
towards missionaries, and efforts made to counteract their
labours to do good. The occasional visits of the American[86]
squadron to those quarters where these benevolent men are
labouring, the pleasant and profitable intercourse which
the officers may have with the missionaries, and those
among whom they labour, has a most kindly influence.
So far as I have had an opportunity of learning, and my
opportunities have extended to most of the mission stations,
the visits of these public vessels have been most grateful
to the missionaries. The commandants, and many of the
officers, have manifested so much good will to missionaries
as individuals, and such interest in the success of their
efforts to improve the moral and religious condition of
these countries, as encouraged them in their work, and is
not without its good effect on those among whom they are
labouring.




LETTER IX.



Beyroot, September 20, 1836.


Yesterday, Ibrahim Pasha reached this place in an
Egyptian frigate from Tripoli, on his way to the south.
He landed about the middle of the day, under a salute
from the forts, and was escorted by a body of troops to a
large house outside the walls, and near the sands. In the
afternoon, the American consul, who was about to call on
the Pasha, as is usual with the consuls on such occasions,
was so kind as to call and take me with him. We found
a company of soldiers before the door, and a number of
officers and dignitaries of various kinds, in waiting. We
were asked into a carpeted room, with a divan, that is, a
low seat covered with cushions, on all sides. The Pasha
was seated in one corner; several consuls with their suites[87]
were in the act of leaving when we entered. He returned
our salutations with an inclination of the head, and a slight
motion of his hand to his breast, and pointed us to seats on
the divan a few feet from him       the consul on his right and
myself on his left.

The Pasha is a short man, but heavily built, and I
should judge from his appearance that he has considerable
muscular force. He has a coarse, homely, round face, but
none of its features can be called striking. His skin is
rather rough and coarse, and looks as if it would bear
washing more frequently than it receives it, and would not
be the worse if some soap were at times added to the water.
This was the case also with his hands, which looked as if
they had never known a glove. They were fleshy       the
fingers short but thick, and indicated a powerful grasp.
He wore the Turkish dress, which, as you know, consists
of a long robe open in front, and also at the sides from the
knees down, showing the large loose trousers worn under
them. His outside garment was of a flesh-coloured silk;
the second, which showed itself at the breast, was striped
silk. His girdle was a variegated Cashmere shawl, forming
a bandage round him of a foot in width. This shawl
was not of the finest kind. He had a plain red fez on his
head, with no other ornament upon it than the usual blue
tassel. He wore plain stockings and a pair of red slippers.
In truth, his whole dress was far inferior to that of a number
of persons who came in and paid their respects to him
while we were there. Most of them, however, wore the
large Turkish cloak; he was without any. Take him all
in all, the man and the dress, and I think that at least one
half of those who came in while we were there, were his
equals, if not his superiors. He conversed freely, laughed
a good deal, and several times very heartily. I could not[88]
understand enough of the conversation to know what things
had the power of pleasing and amusing him. At times, I
thought a sour and severe expression gathered on his countenance.
He spoke with interest of the American squadron,
and the politeness of Commodore Elliott in showing him
everything about his vessel. He was evidently struck
with the style and equipment of our vessels. He mentioned
with much satisfaction some small present the commodore
made him. The visiters were announced by an officer in
waiting, and approached him usually one at a time. When
they were Turks, and possibly the case was the same with
all but Franks, they kneeled on one or both knees, making
the Turkish salutation, and kissed his hand, which he held
out to them; then rose, repeating the application of the
hand to the forehead and breast, and retired to the part of
the room or divan to which he pointed them. The more
respectable persons were invited to be seated.

One of his objects in coming to Beyroot is, to visit the
coal-mines in this vicinity. He referred to this object,
saying with a laugh that he was going to Corneil to turn
coal-merchant. He has for some time been trying to make
the coal-mines of advantage to his close-run treasury; but
he is a poor manager, and until he adopts a better plan he
is not likely to make a fortune at the coal-trade. He has
the mines worked mainly by mountaineers pressed into the
service, who are, at the end of a few weeks or months,
changed for others; and thus, as soon as they learn how
to work, they are changed for those again who must be
taught. Ibrahim Pasha is, however, a man of some force
of character, and has a mind more fit, it is said, for the
department of a soldier than that of a statesman. He has
for many years led the armies of his father Mohammed Ali,
and, in many contested fields, he has won laurels which do[89]
not fall on the head of every general. The regions of
Upper Egypt, the plains of Arabia, the land of Palestine,
the interior of Asia Minor, not to mention Greece and the
Isles, have felt the desolation caused by his troops. It is
said, however, that the father is the man who plans       that
without him as the head, the son will make but a poor
business of it; and those who thus consider the matter,
infer, that when the father dies, the wide domain which
now submits to his sway will fall in pieces, and become
the prey of those who may have the power and skill to
come in for the spoil. I know not how much ground for
these opinions may exist       but one thing we know, that
power acquired and perpetuated by crime, usually terminates
in the ruin of those who have wielded it.

With respect to his private character, I have not learned
much; but part of what I have learned is not much to his
credit. It is generally admitted that he is a very intemperate
man, and often under the influence of strong drink.
The Turks, indeed, are, many of them, fond of ardent
spirits, and the law of Mohammed to the contrary, will,
notwithstanding, take strong drink when they can get it.
When among the ruins of Baalbec, a soldier came, and for
some time hung about us. We could not tell what the
man wanted, at length he asked for spirits. We had none,
and told him so, asking him if he was not ashamed to
violate his religion in drinking what it forbids? Oh, he
said, he could not read,       he did not know what might be
in the Koran. I have at other times seen them drink,
and do it with a great apparent relish. From all I see, I
am inclined to the opinion that Mohammedanism is fast
losing its hold on thousands of its followers, all through
these regions, and the same holds good with that corrupt
system of Christianity which prevails here. There are an[90]
increasing number who are having their eyes opened to see
the grossness of its superstition       who see and understand
more and more the tricks of the priesthood; and most of
them, having no idea of pure, Bible, Protestant Christianity,
are likely to plunge into scepticism and downright infidelity.
There is need of a tenfold increase of active effort, to spread
abroad among these communities the pure word of truth       the
knowledge of Christ       the healing, purifying doctrines
of the Gospel.

I have heard of several tricks of Ibrahim Pasha's, which
show something of the man. It is an object constantly
kept in view with him, to increase his army. This is done
in great part by seizing persons, mostly young men and
boys, and making soldiers of them. This is confined to the
Mohammedans. A report got out, however, that he
intended to take a number of the Ansairi for soldiers. They
occupy a district of the mountains north of Tripoli, and
onward to Aleppo. The Ansairi took the alarm, and fled
to their fastnesses and strong places in the mountains. His
troops, that were in fact sent out as a press-gang to take
them, returned with very few       it was a failure. Then
did the wily Ibrahim set his trap, and use these few for
the bait. He inquired who they were, and being answered
that they were Ansairi, he ordered them to be freed, saying
that he did not want such       he wanted none for his armies
but good Mohammedans. The Ansairi are a mongrel sort
of Turks, who have a strange medley of religious notions
and practices, which are but partially known, and not, as
yet, satisfactorily classed       neither Christians, Mohammedans,
nor Pagans, but a little of all. The liberated Ansairi
were greatly pleased at their escape, reported it to their
brethren, who came down from their mountains, and were
taken in great numbers. The person who related the fact[91]
saw nearly a thousand of them marched into Aleppo in
chains, to be drilled and trained for soldiers.

The most important religious sects in this region are the
Greeks, Maronites, Druses, and Mohammedans. The
Greeks are divided into the Greek and the Catholic
Greek. The Greeks differ from the Catholic or Roman
church in several things. One of the chief points of difference
is about the procession of the Holy Spirit, which
they hold to be from the Son only, and not from the Father
and Son, as held by the Roman church, and in which the
Protestant churches are mostly agreed with the latter.
The Greek church allows the free use of the Scriptures;
rejects images in worship; but are madly set on the use of
pictures. They reject the authority of the Pope.

The Pope and his missionaries have long made most
strenuous efforts to bring the Greek church to an agreement
with him and a subjection to his authority. They
have for centuries employed missionaries and agents of all
sorts to accomplish this. Nor have these efforts been
wholly without effect. Throughout the East, where the
Greek church exists, there are a portion who have been
prevailed on to admit the authority of the Pope, and more
or less modify their Greek notions to a nearer conformity
to the popish standard. These are called Greek Catholics.
They are pretty numerous in many places, and have a
good deal of influence all through these regions.

The Maronites take their name from an individual who
somehow contrived to be the head of a party, and to leave
it his name as an inheritance. They differ, I am told, but
very little from the Roman Catholics; hardly as much
as the distinctive character of their name would seem to
indicate.

It is not yet fully decided what the Druses are. Some[92]
assert that they are worshippers of the calf. They have a
secret which is imparted only to a part of their people.
This part is what may be called the enlightened       the
initiated       the knowing       and they, like the freemasons
among us, are most careful not to divulge the secret. They
form a large part of the population of Mount Lebanon.
They appear to be a quiet and well-disposed people, but it
is not easy to find out what are their real religious principles
and belief. They are charged by some with modifying,
or pretending to modify, their opinions to suit those
with whom they may be. With a Mohammedan they are
Mohammedans, and with a Christian they are almost, if
not altogether Christian. But in this they may plead the
example of many who have gone before them, and modelled
their creed to suit the circumstances of the times.

The Mohammedans are the followers of Mohammed, who
lived in the early part of the seventh century, and introduced
a new religion. His system borrows some things
from Judaism, and some from Christianity, but in many
important matters differs from both. Nor is it Paganism,
having a most decided aversion to idolatry. It would take
more time than I can at present spare, to give a full
account of it. It may suffice to say, that Mohammed
acknowledged the truth of the Jewish religion       all the
Jewish prophets he received as prophets of the Lord.       He
admitted that Jesus Christ was a great prophet, yea, the
greatest prophet that up to his time had come into the
world, and that the religion he taught was the true religion.
But he pretended that he himself was sent as the last and
greatest of all prophets, and authorized to make such
changes in the religion of the Jews and Christians as to
justify its being called a new religion       and that his system
as set forth in the Koran is now, since he came, the only[93]
true religion. He made circumcision a rite in his system.
They give much honour to the saints of the Old Testament,
the church and the apostles. Their worship is plain. They
are wholly opposed to the use of images or pictures. Their
chief day of worship is Friday. They pray much, have
long fasts, allow a plurality of wives; but in practice this
is not as common as many have supposed, and is confined
to a comparatively small number.

One of those things that immediately strikes the notice
of a traveller in these regions, is the number of monasteries
and religious houses, and the peculiarity of their situation.
There may be eight or ten counted from Beyroot;
and how many may be within the range of twenty or thirty
miles, I cannot well conjecture. From the number I
passed in going to the top of Lebanon, and returning from
the Cedars by Tripoli, I must suppose them to be from one
to two hundred. A friend of mine counted sixteen from a
place near Nahr-El-Kelb; and a native assured me that
from the top of a mountain near Nahr-El-Kelb, nearly one
hundred could be seen. The number of houses for men is
much greater than those for women. There must of course
be a considerable number of monks, but it has occurred to
me that the actual number is not as great as the number of
houses would seem to indicate; many houses have but a
scanty number of inmates. To the inquiry, which I have
often made, whether the monastery system is not losing its
hold on the public mind? it has generally been answered,
that no very perceptible change could be noticed. I am still,
however, of the opinion, that the system is not as favourably
received as it was in times past; and I shall be greatly
disappointed if it does not, and that before long, appear
that the system is wearing out. General developments
have been made, which show that these houses are seats of[94]
corruption and abomination, and that the best interests of
the church and of society would be promoted by the system's
coming to an end.

Beyroot has been the main seat of the Palestine mission.
This has been the usual residence of the missionaries, and
here and in the vicinity most of their labours have been
expended. Good, no doubt, has been accomplished. It
has been, however, a hard soil to cultivate. There are
peculiar difficulties to be met with in the character, habits,
and especially the ignorance and deep-rooted religious prejudices
of the people. The Arabic language, which is the
one almost universally spoken here, is a language difficult
to acquire so as to use it freely in preaching. Of course,
some time must be lost before a missionary can so master
the language as to do much in clerical addresses to the
people. A part of their efforts have been directed to schools,
and in this place have made some progress. They had a
number of schools, and were through them operating well
on the minds of the people. About three months ago, at
the same time that the movement was made against the
missionaries in Greece, Smyrna, and the adjacent parts,
a similar movement was made here, and the effect has been,
the suspension of most of the common schools. I have
no doubt that is a part of a wide-spread plan to counteract
and break up, or render unavailing, if possible, all missionary
operations in and around the Mediterranean. I
hope it will fail, and I doubt not but that it will. It may,
however, make the missionary work more difficult, and, for
a time, less productive of its desired fruit. I have no doubt
the hand of the Roman Catholics is in the matter       for in
all places and at all times they have greatly withstood
missionary efforts.

There is a mission press at this place. It has laboured[95]
under great difficulties for the want of many things to
make complete their Arabic fonte, and from the impossibility
of procuring them here, and the delay in getting
them from America or Europe. The distribution of books
is one of the ways of operating. Something has been done
and is still doing; but the watchful adversary is now
opposing this mode of working. Much suspicion is excited
against their books, and from time to time we hear of some
being burned. In a late tour we had some books with us,
but found that in most of the villages the people had been
warned against receiving them. All these things are to be
expected. It is not to be supposed that the enemy will
quietly see the light of the gospel poured upon his dark
empire of ignorance and superstition. I should not wonder
at an effort being made to add more severe measures than
burning books and withdrawing children from school.
Indeed, there was an effort made about three months since,
to drive the mission families from the mountains, where
they had gone to spend the sickly season, and were about
opening schools for the summer. The prince of the village,
at the instigation, as he admitted, of the Catholic priest,
forbade his people to have any intercourse with them, to
buy or to sell to them, and threatened to burn down the
houses in which the missionaries might reside. The American
consul laid the case before the Emeer Busheer, the
head prince of the mountains, and claimed for them, as
respectable, well-conducted American citizens, who had for
health gone to the mountains for a few months, the right
of protection usually enjoyed. The Emeer sent an officer
and inquired into the case       reversed the orders of the local
prince, and assured them of his protection. It was a lesson
which I hope the local authorities will not soon forget.
The prince who made the attempt to oppress and oppose[96]
them had not long before become a Catholic. The Emeer
Busheer who protected them is not a Catholic; he was
until recently considered a Moslem, but now professes to be
a Maronite Christian. Thus the Lord can raise protectors
and helpers from whom he pleases       make of stones children
to Abraham.

A few nights since we had our attention called to a very
pretty spectacle. As it began to grow dark, we observed
bonfires lighted in the neighbourhood, and other tokens of
festivity. We went to the terrace on the top of the house,
which commanded a most extensive view of Mount Lebanon,
a view of nearly thirty miles. Along the whole range
we could see the bonfires glaring. They looked, on the
dark side of the mountain, like stars on the face of the
deep blue vault of heaven. I made several attempts to
count them; but it was much like counting the stars,
which, when a boy, I often attempted to do, but almost
always abandoned, before I reached a hundred, from a
strange feeling of the difficulty of continuing the enumeration,
when the objects lay thus without order. These
bonfires were of all sizes, and were often marked by fitful
blazes of light, as new fuel was thrown on them. Others
would glimmer and expire, while new ones would burst
forth, and soon attain to the first magnitude, and then die
away, or be subjects of those fitful flashes that indicated
the addition of fresh fuel.

On inquiry I learned that this was the feast of the Cross,
and that these illuminations and bonfires were in commemoration
of the finding of the true cross by the Empress
Helena. It is said that on her way to Jerusalem she gave
orders that preparation should be made that, in case she
was successful in finding the cross, the event might be
made known by bonfires, and thus the intelligence be communicated[97]
to Constantinople. Much of the religion of
these people consists in such things. Their fasts       their
attending mass       their worshipping and kissing the pictures       keeping
the holy days       and counting their beads, constitute
the principal part of their religion. As to the pure
service of the heart       faith that worketh by love       regeneration
by the Spirit       a new moral nature, effected through
the word of truth under the agencies of the Holy Spirit,
with most if not all the other elements of real genuine
piety, they are almost wholly ignorant. It is, indeed,
astonishing that a people, who have the book of God in
their hands, should so long remain in utter darkness and
ignorance of that spirituality which beams forth from all
parts of it. This whole region is yet in the dark ages.
Let any one who wishes to form a correct idea of the state
of things here, read a well-written account of the middle
ages       the preliminary dissertation to Robertson's History
of Charles the Fifth, and Hallam on the Middle Ages       and
he will have before him the leading features of the
state of the church and society now found here. The
agreement will not, it is true, hold good in all points, but
in the main there is a strong family likeness. May the
Lord soon raise up reformers!       and may the truth soon go
forth as the light, and his revelation as a lamp that burneth!
The reformation in Europe was preceded by many things
which betokened the coming of day; and there are many
things now which bespeak the approach of a time of light,
life, and salvation, for these regions that have long lain
waste. The last ten years have witnessed great changes,
and we hope the next ten will record still greater.

You have often heard of the Sherock, or Siroc, as it is
often spelled. The weather had become much cooler, but
this strong south wind has brought it back to its greatest[98]
summer heat. It does not usually blow more than two or
three days at a time; but we have had it now for four or
five days, and it still continues. Many persons complain
much of it       "feel it in every nerve." It does not affect
me, except as it makes the air warm and oppressive.

Last night, for some unknown cause, connected probably
with the Sherock, (which is made to bear the blame of all
sorts of evils, and ought in fairness get credit for some
good,) we had the most heavy dew at Beyroot that I have
seen in Syria. This is the more remarkable, as the dews
have usually been very light. It fell copiously soon after
sunset, and this morning the earth looked as if a little
shower of rain had fallen. There was also this morning,
for the first time since I came to Beyroot, a dense fog       one
of the most dense I ever saw       this also is to be ascribed to
the Sherock, I suppose.

Yesterday I visited the ruins of Dair-El-Kollah, which
lie near a village called Bate-Meiry, about three hours'
ride from Beyroot. They are of the same style of building
as those of Baalbec, but on a much smaller scale. It has
most likely been an old temple. The stones are enormous,
but not equal to the largest at Baalbec. Most of the wall
has been thrown down, but one or two of the lower rows
lie in their places. The stone is put together without
cement, and the face, like those of Baalbec, made so smooth,
that you could not put a knife in the crack. The pillars
before the building were large, but not equal to those of
Baalbec. They were composed of three pieces; the lower
one, about twelve feet long, alone remains standing. The
rock is a coarse marble, and I saw a few fragments of granite.
These ruins are on the top of the secondary ridge,
about half way to the top of Mount Lebanon; a church
now stands on part of them.

LETTER X.



Jaffa, Sept. 30th, 1836.


I have at length set out to make a tour through Palestine,
or at least a part of it, and will send you some brief
notices of what may particularly engage my attention.
The great heat which we felt in this country, particularly
on the plains, induced me to defer my tour thus long, as I
judged it not well to run unnecessary hazard in my eagerness
to see the chosen land, and to visit the places referred
to in the Holy Scriptures. The great heats of summer are
now past, showers of rain have already fallen, and the
driving up of clouds at one time from the north, and at
another from the south, betoken the approach of those
copious showers, which the earth, parched by a whole
summer's sun, so much requires, and which man and beast
need to refresh their exhausted system.

We went on board a small vessel on the 28th, but the
wind was so light that we were only off the sands, and
still in sight of Beyroot the next morning. During the
next day we had very little wind, and made but slow progress.
Towards night, however, a wind sprang up, and
we passed Sidon, but at too great a distance to have a good
view of it. I hope to obtain this on my return, as my plan
is to return by land, for the purpose of seeing as much as
I can of the country.

The mountains appear to retain nearly the same height
and appearance as those near Beyroot. They seemed,
however, to fall back from the sea and leave a wider plain
along the coast, and to the south they appeared to decrease
in height. Night came on, and shut out the land from our
observation. With the night, a fine wind arose, and began
to pass rapidly to the south. About midnight we passed[100]
Soor, the ancient Tyre: we were thus unable to see it. It
would have been pleasant to have seen it from the sea, and
to have been able to make some observations on the plains
and mountains, by which it is surrounded on the land side.
We passed Acre too early, and at too great a distance to
see it distinctly. It has a wide plain to the east, and a
little to the south-east the great plain of Esdralon extends
from the Mediterranean to the sea of Tiberias. Having a
most favourable wind, we passed on at a great rate, and
just as the sun rose we passed the north end of Mount
Carmel. It is a mountain, or hill as we should call it, a
straight and regular ridge, eight or ten miles long, running
north and south; on the top and side next us, almost wholly
destitute of trees, and without cultivation. It has very
little rock on the surface except near the north end       much
less than Lebanon, and appears favourable for cultivation.

I should not have estimated Carmel to be more than
eight hundred or one thousand feet high. It is, however,
usually said to be much higher. This ridge is separated
from the branches of the Lebanon by a part of the plain of
Esdralon. Indeed, Lebanon has come down from the great
loftiness which it has near Sidon, and has spread itself over
the country in small ridges. Carmel lies more west than
the Lebanon range. At its north end it forms an abrupt
termination in a bold promontory. On the top of this
promontory, and near the end, is a monastery belonging
to the Latins. There are a few monks there, how many
I did not learn. It has an imposing appearance, but I
could see no other human habitation near it. There is a
plain of varied width between Carmel and the shore. It
is almost wholly destitute of trees, hardly a bush to be seen
unless of a very small size. The plain varies in width
from one to two miles. Much of it, especially near the[101]
shore, was covered with sand. I saw no human being, or
human habitation on it, except a few old ruins. A few
miles south of the monastery there were considerable ruins
on a sandy point that projects into the sea. It has, probably,
been a fort.

At the distance of eight or nine miles from the promontory,
the ridge called Carmel suddenly sinks down, and
gives place to a wide-spread plain. Near the south end of
the mountain, they point out on the shore the site of the
famous city Cesarea, which is often mentioned in the New
Testament       the place where Paul was detained a prisoner
many years, and made his admirable defence before Agrippa
and Festus. It was once a place of considerable importance,
rose suddenly to much celebrity, and almost as
suddenly declined, and for a long period has been in a state
of utter desolation. I saw a few pillars standing, and
some other remains of departed greatness. The plain which
begins at the southern end of Carmel, is the celebrated
plain of Sharon.

We reached Jaffa about the middle of the afternoon,
having had a most expeditious sail from Sidon. The wind
had served us a good turn, in bringing us so soon to Jaffa,
but we now experienced another consequence not so pleasant;
it still blew hard, and made the sea so rough that
we could not land. The harbour of Jaffa is not good, or
rather there is no harbour worth the name. We had to
anchor some miles out at sea, where there was a tremendous
swell; there was no help, we had to bear it as
we could. We landed the next morning, and were most
kindly received by the American consul. He did all in his
power to render us comfortable.

Jaffa stands on a sandy point, which projects a little
distance into the sea. The ground at the point is more[102]
elevated than farther back. It is a walled town, with a
double wall and fosse in some places, all, however, much
out of repair. We saw but a few cannon on the part of
the wall which we examined, and those small and in bad
order. We passed a number of soldiers in our walks about
the town, and found a strong guard at the gate. Most of
the houses have a very old appearance, few of them are
good; the streets are narrow, crooked, and filthy, as in
almost all the Turkish towns I have visited. The houses are
much crowded together, and cover a very small space, considering
their number. This is the case with most of the
Turkish towns in the East, especially their walled towns on
the coast. We visited the Latin and Greek convents, and
were kindly received, and had coffee and sweetmeats handed
us. The bazaars and shops appeared exceedingly poor, and
to be scantily supplied with articles of merchandise.

Jaffa is a place of interest, chiefly, as being the sea-port
nearest Jerusalem, and the landing-place of a large number
of pilgrims that annually resort, by thousands, to visit the
holy places in and about Jerusalem. It has also, in the noble
plain of Sharon, a most admirable back country. But what
avails a country, however good, if there be not people to cultivate
it, and if the government be so unwise and oppressive
as to hold out no inducement for industry among the people?

While looking at the city, we went without the walls as
far as the grave-yard. I had noticed on the shore, and in
the street, great quantities of a small but beautiful sea-shell,
and at the grave-yard I found them very abundant,
and put to a singular use. They were laid on the graves
in great numbers, often forming quite a little mound on the
top of the grave, and in many cases, a newly-formed stone,
which is found at certain places on the shore, and which is
in great part made up of these shells, was set up at the[103]
head and foot of the graves. It had a tasteful and pretty
appearance.

The place was pointed out to us at a distance, where
Bonaparte is said to have shot several thousand prisoners.
He has been much blamed for it, and probably not without
some cause. If, however, his own account, as I have seen
it given, be true, that they had before been his prisoners,
and had been set at large on parole, under engagement
not again to take up arms against him; that they had
broken parole and were again captured while fighting
against him; if this were the case, he is, according to the
laws of war, less to blame than many have supposed. Not
that I would justify him, but bad as he was, his opponents
did not give him credit for the good he did, and made the
most of his bad actions. Had he lived until the present
time, on the throne of France, the state of Europe would
probably have been twenty if not forty years in advance
of what it now is, in knowledge and arts, in civil and religious
liberty. Those who have succeeded to the now
divided power, which his powerful arm wielded, have
laboured and still labour to hold the people back       to
repress the spirit of enterprise and improvement, and
especially repress and root out the spirit of freedom.




LETTER XI.


October 5th, 1836.

We left Jaffa in the afternoon for Rumla, which lies
about half way from Jaffa to the commencement of the hill
country, on the road to Jerusalem       leaving the gate of
Jaffa, (and I may add, there is only one gate on the land
side,) we took a north-east direction. The point of land[104]
on which Jaffa stands, a kind of sandy knoll, is higher
than the country back of it. We of course made a small
descent, and for a considerable distance passed through
gardens, enclosed lots and fields, many of them well filled
with trees, as fig, orange, lemon, pomegranate, palm. The
Indian fig was much used for forming enclosures, and generally
planted on a ridge of sand. It makes a very good
fence, as the prickles with which it abounds prevent man
or beast from coming much in contact with it. Some of
these gardens had wells and water-wheels, many of which
were at work, mostly with oxen, raising water for the
benefit of the trees and vegetables. There is much sand
on the district that borders the coast, and in many places
directly on the coast the sand has fairly taken possession       nothing
is seen but fields of white sand.

At the distance of half a mile from the shore, the ground
is very little higher, I should think, than the surface of the
water; and a number of things indicate that this low district
was once a marsh, or at least much subjected to water.
And now, in the rainy season, much water would collect
on it were it not for its loose and sandy character, through
which the water easily runs. The abundance of water,
found at a very little distance below the surface, may arise
from the fact that it is but little below the level of the sea;
and the sandy character of the district allows the water to
percolate freely, and thus supply what is taken up by man
and vegetables.

It may be nine or ten miles from Jaffa to Rumla. The
road is good; it is over a plain, and except a little waving
of the surface, forming slight elevations and depressions,
such as we often find on the sea-coasts, and on the
flat districts which border large rivers, one would say it
was level. These elevations suggest the idea that the[105]
water may have once covered this plain; and in retiring
gradually from it, left those graceful elevations and depressions
which give a beautiful variety to its surface. But
a small part, after passing the gardens, was cultivated.
From time to time we passed portions that had been sown
with grain       none of it, after leaving the gardens, was
enclosed       all lay open. We passed several places where
there were a few trees; they formed, however, but little
green spots on the face of this wide-spread and noble plain.
The greater part was destitute of verdure; the burning
heats of summer having burned up the grass; the crops,
except an occasional cotton field, being all gathered in. I
think I saw no Indian corn, although I had seen it on the
Bokar, but of a very diminutive kind. The cotton fields
were few and small, and held out the promise of but a light
crop.

The plain is highly fertile, and if under proper cultivation
would yield largely. The soil is rich, deep, and very free
from rock, at least sufficiently so for all purposes of
cultivation. We do not, indeed, often meet with a finer
district of land; but it is thinly inhabited.

Rumla is a town of considerable size, and has some
pretty good houses. It stands on a slight elevation, and
commands a fine view of the plain out of which it rises.
It is surrounded with gardens, many of which are protected
by hedges of the Indian fig. There are some olive
groves about the town; other fruit-trees, and the palm,
are also to be seen. Around the present town are ruins,
walls, cisterns, and other indications that the town was
once spread over a much larger space than it now covers.
It is supposed to be the ancient Arimathea mentioned in
the New Testament, John xix. 38.

The ancient Lydda lies within a short distance of Rumla,[106]
not above three or four miles; but I had not time to visit
it, as my company were urgent to proceed. It is, I am told,
a poor village, and has nothing to give it interest, unless it
be the fact that is mentioned of it in Acts, ix. 32, 38.

I ought to have mentioned respecting Rumla, that there
is near the town a very remarkable tower, old, and of a
singular structure, with some large apartments under
ground connected with it. At what time it was built, by
whom, and for what purpose, is not now known: probably,
however, as a place of defence, and when built, the town
extended to, if not beyond it. The history of many things
in these regions is lost       irrecoverably lost       until that
great day shall come when the whole history of man shall
pass in review, and all shall be judged according to their
works.

The American squadron left Jaffa only the day before
we reached that place. The commodore and a party of
officers visited Jerusalem. A large party spent a night at
Rumla with the American consular agent, and had made
him a present of a large and beautiful flag, with a notice
of its presentation written on its border. If what was told
me at Jaffa be true, that some of the officers, on their
return from Jerusalem, rode from Jerusalem to Jaffa
in five or six hours, it was a matter-of-fact proof that the
distance is less than the old books of travel have stated.
Ten hours was named at Jaffa as the usual time       that
would make thirty miles, at the usual mode of counting
three miles to the hour: this is probably the real distance.

We spent a Sabbath at Rumla; but as there was no
Protestant worship, and I could not have received much
if any benefit from attending a service in an unknown
tongue, I remained in my room all day, and found, although
thus alone, that the Sabbath of the Lord is a most wise and[107]
gracious appointment of Heaven for the benefit of man.
He needs times which may call his thoughts from worldly
things, and consecrate them more especially to God, and
the things that relate to the welfare of the soul. I have,
therefore, whenever I could, in travelling, rested on the
Sabbath day, and found it good so to do. In almost every
step I take in this country I find myself on ground referred
to in Scripture; and it is with no little interest I walk
over places where the events recorded in God's word took
place. But even in those scenes I find it good to observe
the Sabbath of the Lord. I do not even go out to look at
these places on the Sabbath: the other six days may
suffice for that. The Lord's day is better spent as a day
of rest and devotion.

We left Rumla on Monday morning for Jerusalem. Our
course was still a little south of east. The general character
and condition of the plain was much as the part of
it already described, with the difference that there was
much less sand. Indeed there was little, if any, to be seen       the
soil was a fine, rich, black mould. The state of cultivation
was rather better, but still only a small part was
under the care of man. The country began more regularly
to rise as we approached the hill country. The rise was
however very gradual. Irregular and rounded hills became
more numerous, but none of them were steep. A road
could pass over them in any direction; they were rather
pleasant swells than hills. More stones and pebbles were
mixed up with the soil, but not in quantities that would
impede cultivation. In truth, this part of the plain, that
is from Rumla to the hills, forms one of the richest and
most lovely districts that I have seen. We were above
three hours in going from Rumla to the hills, which would
make the distance from Jaffa about eighteen or twenty[108]
miles. The road however does not cross the plain at right
angles, but declined considerably to the south.

We passed no village worth naming. We did, indeed,
pass a few huts at one or two places, but too few to deserve
notice. We passed several places that appeared to have
once been occupied, and saw several villages at a distance,
but they appeared small. In short, the plain       the noble
and celebrated plain of Sharon, appears to be almost
deserted; and while it has a fertility and extent, were it
occupied and properly cultivated, sufficient to sustain a
nation, it is now roamed over by a few flocks       has small
patches of it cultivated, and here and there a small, poor
village to sustain. With regard to trees,      c. the eastern
part of the plain was on a par with the western. It was
only on little spots, and at a great distance from each other,
that a few olive and other trees were to be seen. They
were mostly confined to the immediate vicinity of the
villages, or where villages have once stood.

While passing over the plain of Sharon, it would have
been out of all propriety not to have thought of the rose of
Sharon and the lily of the valley. I did think of them,
and was on the watch for them; and so eager was I to get
one, that could I have met with any sort of a flower that
would in any fair way have admitted the name, I would
most willingly have reported it, but not one could I find.
I consoled myself, however, with the thought, that I only
shared the disappointment which other travellers had
experienced. For what traveller in these regions has not
sought the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valley? And
what one has been able to assure and satisfy the public
that he has found them?

As we approached the hills, the face of the plain became
more uneven; the points of the ridges ran out irregularly,[109]
and more rocks began to appear on the surface. The line
of hills is however more regular than is usual, and the transition
from the plain to the hills is more gradual than is
usually found on the borders of large plains. We passed
over a low, rocky point of a ridge, and saw some ruins;
and at one place the large hewn stones and broken pillars
indicated buildings of some consequence. The hills are not
continuous ridges, but knobs, not very high, nor very steep;
the top rounded over. Many of them are separated from
each other almost to the base; but a greater number join at
one or more sides, at various heights from their bases. Taking
the hollows, and the passages between the hills, (and in
some places there are little level spots,) as the level of the
country, I should say that the general level, as we pass
east, rises; and the height of the hills above this general
level, continues about the same for a great part of the way
from the commencement of the hills to near Jerusalem.
This district is well called the "hill country of Judea."
Nothing could better express it. They are usually in
books called mountains; but their size, that is their height
above the general level of the country, hardly entitles them
to that appellation. They are rather hills than mountains.

As we rode among the hills, we began to see a few small
shrubs and bushes of oak. Most of them, however, were
small; few as high as a man on horseback. There were
also, at some places in the hollows, where, during the rains,
water flows, some bushes, thistles, and other kinds of vegetation,
but small of size and few in number. As we passed
farther in among the hills, the vegetation increased, both as
to size and quantity; it however never amounted to much.
We saw, from time to time, some orchards of olives, and a
few scattering trees; as we approached the higher part of
the hilly district, we saw some hills that were to some[110]
extent covered with the olives. Still but a small, a very
small part of the country was thus made to minister to the
wants and comfort of man. As we advanced, the rock
became more abundant; it was all limestone, mixed in
some places with veins of flint; usually horizontal, and
often projecting out on the sides of the hills, and much
stratified; and the various strata being of different degrees
of firmness, causing them to have a singular appearance.
The soft stratum had in many places disintegrated, and
formed a stratum of earth, which entirely concealed the
rock; while the hard stratum formed a kind of wall, and
in many places, from its regularity in thickness and direction
round the side of the hill, it had much the appearance
of having been the work of man. In some places again,
where a hard stratum lay directly over a soft one, the
crumbling away of the soft one formed a kind of natural
cave under the hard one; places could be seen where a
man might find shelter from the rain under rocks thus hollowed
out by the wearing away of a soft rock, while its
more sturdy fellow above held on to its proper size and
shape. A ride of between two and three hours, from the
time we entered the hill country, brought us to the higher
part of the district. Our road still lay along what may be
called a hollow, and on each side of us the hills rose to a
considerable size.

We passed on this high district one or two villages. In
one of them were some pretty good houses, and an old ruin,
which, from its size and form, seemed once to have been a
building of some importance. The country around this
village was in a better state of cultivation; more trees,
figs, and vines, than I had seen since leaving Rumla.
From a part of this high ground we had a most extensive
and fine view of the seabord; the deep black sea, till[111]
where it met the sky; the white sand-hills along the shore,
and the wide and long plain of Sharon, extending as far as
the eye could reach, to the north and south, and coming
up to the hilly district, on the top of which we stood. The
view was interesting, and especially so when we thought
how often the pious Israelites, when going up to the house
of the Lord, must have stopped at this place, and looked
back on that rich and lovely part of their inheritance.
The "flocks of Sharon" was a term which then expressed
much; but now few flocks feed there, and those of an
inferior kind of cattle.

After taking this, as I supposed, farewell-look at the
plain of Sharon, the sea-bord, and wide-spread ocean
behind it, we set forward, and thought we must soon reach
a point from which we could see Jerusalem. We found,
however, that we had to descend a hollow, wind along it
for some distance, and then a long ascent to make, to gain
about the same level from which we had taken our farewell-look
at the vale and sea behind us. Above half an
hour must have been spent in doing this. This is said to
be the valley of Elah, where David slew the Philistine.
The precise spot where the engagement took place is not
known. We now found ourselves on ground which was
nearly as high as any near us. We had passed to our
right, at some considerable distance, a cluster of buildings
on the top of a hill, called the tomb of the Maccabees. It
looked like a fort, or place of defence, and was, as I am
told, not long since, the residence of Aboo Goosh, who used
to make free with the property of other people; in other
words, was a notorious robber. But Ibrahim Pasha has
taught such gentry a good lesson. He has nearly, if not
wholly, put a stop to such practices; he has taken the
matter into his own hands. What people have to spare,[112]
he himself takes, or has taken from them; and, indeed,
much more than they are willing to part with; but as to
every fellow who chooses taking for himself, as was the old
way of doing things, why that is not now permitted. The time
was, when a company could hardly have passed from Rumla
to Jerusalem, as we did, without having been relieved of
some of their cash, and perhaps clothes into the bargain.

We passed a district where an immense quantity of stone
had been quarried and removed; the refuse stone lay in piles,
and the excavations showed that large quantities had been
procured. The face of the high ridge, or kind of table land,
over which we now passed, was almost wholly destitute of
vegetation. A few thistles and an occasional small thorn-bush
might be seen; but a more naked district I had not
seen in the holy land. Several miles to the right, I saw a
hill or hills pretty well covered with trees of some sort       olives
I thought from their looks; and at a greater distance
on our left I saw several patches of trees on the side of a
high and long ridge, and a small village or two near them;
but more immediately about me, and over the whole face
of the ridge which I was passing, all was naked       all was
destitute of vegetation, except a small enclosed spot. I
was struck not only with the absence of vegetation, but
with the enormous quantity of rough rock that almost
literally covered the face of the ground. Much of it lay
in irregular patches, projecting from eighteen inches to five
or six feet above the little earth that could be seen. It
really appeared as if the district was given up to be occupied
by rocks, to the exclusion of all other matter. We soon
began a slight but gradual descent, and after a little, some
towers came into view. These were the parts of Jerusalem
first seen. Presently we saw the top of the walls       the
minarets, the domes, and the whole city.

[113]

Jerusalem stands on the east side of a high, flattish ridge,
which runs nearly north and south. To the west of the
city, and at some distance above, towards the top of the
ridge, a small hollow begins, and running south-east,
deepens rapidly, and forms the southern boundary of the
city. This is the channel of the rivulet Gihon. In it are
the pools, the upper and lower; but it is only in wet
weather that there is water in them. The lower part is
called the valley of the Son of Hinnom. The brook Kedron,
or the valley in which the water would run, if there were
any water,       for you must know except during the rains it
is a dry channel, runs nearly north and south, and has a
deep channel, with high steep banks. The valley or ravine
of Gihon falls into that of the Kedron, nearly at right
angles, with a high point forming the angle between them.
On this point the city of Jerusalem stands. It fills, or did
originally, the space that lies between these two ravines,
for some distance up both of them. The ground on which
the city stands has a considerable declination to the east,
and is on the side of a hill, on the lower end of the ridge,
when it terminates abruptly at a deep ravine, both on the
south and east. The site has other inequalities. At the
south-east corner, next the Gihon, was the highest point.
That is the hill of Zion. Part of it is now without the
walls, and used as a burying-ground. The missionaries
have recently procured a small plot on Mount Zion for a
burying-place, to be appropriated to Protestants who may
die at Jerusalem. A little north of Mount Zion, and close
on the bank of the Kedron, is Mount Moriah, or an elevation
so called. On this the temple stood, and on the same
site now stands the mosque of St. Omar. This elevation
was formerly separated from Mount Zion by a considerable
valley. It is now nearly filled up, at least that part[114]
within the walls, and much so without; still it is very
perceptible without the walls, and especially at the pool of
Siloam, which lies at the junction of this ravine with the
valley of the Kedron. Mount Zion was once connected
with Mount Moriah by a bridge or elevated causeway; but
the filling up of the ground within the walls has covered
it, or supplied its place.

There is a large space around the mosque of St. Omar
which forms a fine promenade, but Christians are not
allowed to enter it. They are not allowed to enter the
mosque, or at least this is the general understanding. In
many cases, however, it has been entered lately; a party
of English had been all through it, under the special protection
of the governor, but a few days before my arrival.
There is little doubt that in a few years, unless some reaction
takes place, free admission will be allowed, and
many other foolish and unreasonable customs and prejudices
of the Mohammedans will pass away.

Jerusalem has a high, strong wall around it, and is
occupied by a large body of the Pasha's troops. There are
at present but four gates open and used, several having
been walled up some time since. The Jaffa gate, by which
we entered; the Zion gate being east of the Jaffa, and on
Mount Zion; St. Stephen's gate, which opens next the
valley of Kedron and north of Mount Moriah; and the
Damascus gate, which lies on the north side of the city.
The highest part of the city is a little west of the Jaffa
gate, at the point where the wall leaves the top of the hill
near Gihon, and runs north and north-east toward the
Kedron.



[115]




LETTER XII.


Jerusalem,1836.

One of the first objects that we visited after our arrival
was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It so happened
that the day after our arrival was one of the many days,
which for some reason I know not what, is called a festa,
and this church was opened. This was what we desired,
as it is not accessible at all times. This church is said to
be built over the place where our Lord was buried; and it
also includes the place where he was crucified       that is, it
includes that part of Calvary on which the crosses of our
Lord and the others who were crucified with him were
fixed       and the garden in which Joseph's tomb was placed.
It ought, therefore, to have been without the city, as our
Lord was crucified and interred without the city. Heb.
xiii. 12, and John xix. 41. The excuse for its being in
the city is, that the city does not now occupy the same
ground that it did at that time       its walls were farther
west and north       and the present walls take in what the
old walls, when those transactions took place, left out. It
appears to me very manifest, that the places now shown as
the places of crucifixion and interment, must have always
been within the city. A wall so run as to leave it out,
would be located in a way that no wise builder would ever
think of in running a wall to defend a city situated as
Jerusalem is. These places are not on a hill, but rather
in a low place or hollow, and the wall in passing to the
east of it would leave so much higher and better ground
close to it on the west, and would so straiten the space
between it and the ground occupied by the temple, and
take so irregular and winding a route to enclose sufficient[116]
ground to hold the city, that I must believe that a wrong
place has been fixed upon as the spot where those memorable
things transpired. It is, however, a matter of trifling
importance; we know they took place near Jerusalem.
There is no virtue in the spot where they took place more
than in any other. But the poor, blind, superstitious
people believe, and are taught to believe, that there is
great, yea, saving virtue obtained in visiting these places.

The church of the Holy Sepulchre is a large, and in some
respects a good-looking building, especially the circular
room with the large dome over the holy sepulchre, as seen
from the inside, for it is surrounded with other buildings,
and so connected with them without that it makes but a
feeble impression. It needs to be large, as it contains a
chapel for each of the Christian sects which prevail in the
East, as the Greeks, Latins, Armenians, Copts, Syrians.

We entered at the north side. There is a small open
space before the door, which once belonged to the church,
but most of the pillars are removed. The doors of the
church are large, and there is usually one or more Turks
acting as door-keepers. As there are always monks and
priests in the church to take care of it, attend to the lamps,
perform the sacred offices,      c., there is a small opening
through the door, by means of which food and other necessaries
are passed to them at those times when the doors
are shut. Some monks and priests, it is said, spend weeks,
and it may be months, in the church, without once going
out of it; they no doubt think this a most meritorious act.

Immediately on passing the door of the church, we came
to a large, flat, marble stone, a little elevated from the
floor, having small marble pillars at the corners, and an
ornamental covering above it. This is called the "stone of
unction." It is pretended that the body of our Lord was[117]
laid on it while he was anointed, or rather when he was
taken from the cross, and rolled up in linen with the spices,
by Joseph and Nicodemus. East of the "stone of unction,"
and within a few yards of it, there is an ascent of several
steps, called the ascent of Calvary; and on the top, which
is called Calvary, three holes were shown, said to be the
holes of the three crosses, on which our Lord and the two
thieves were nailed. The middle one stands rather in
advance of the other two. Below this, in a cave-like place
under the spot where the crosses stood, is shown the split
in the rock caused by the earthquake, which took place at
his death. These places are, however, so fenced about with
metal plates, doors, bars of iron and wire network, that
you can barely see and touch them, and that with a poor
light; all arranged to prevent too close an examination       all
adapted to increase the superstition and blind credulity
of the people.

The Empress Helena, Constantine's mother, was the
great patron of all the holy places, and built churches upon
them. How she ascertained for a certainty the precise
spots is not so clear; but that she selected certain spots and
had churches erected on them is admitted. So great an
advocate for such matters, ought of right to have some
honour shown her. They have, therefore, east of Calvary,
and at a few yards' distance, prepared a chapel for her. It
is a low, damp place, quite under ground, and does not do
her much credit. It was down in this place, however, that
she found the true cross, it is said, and an odd thing is told
about her identifying it. Three crosses were found, and
the question was, to which one of the three was our Lord
nailed, for it would have been a fatal mistake to have
selected for such deep veneration, amounting nearly to
worship, the one on which the thief was nailed, instead of[118]
the one on which our Lord hung. Helena was not more
zealous in hunting for places and things, than fertile in
expedients to identify them. A child, either sick or dead,
was brought and laid on the crosses, and strange to tell! it
was made well when it touched a certain one. This was
ample proof that it was the true cross.

Another thing was found in this place, now set apart as
the chapel of Helena. She found Adam's skull, which came
out of the rent made in the rock caused by the earthquake.
How she identified it, the account, as I received it, did not
relate. No doubt she contrived some way to do it. Many
such things are gravely told to the poor deluded pilgrims
that resort here, and many believe them. And to tell all
such folly and nonsense, and to fill their minds with them,
is the business of the monks and priests, instead of teaching
them the great leading truths of the word of God, and
urging the nature and necessity of personal holiness and
practical religion.

We returned from the chapel of Helena to the stone of
unction. A wall is run up between this and the main
body of the church, forming the place in which it lies into
a kind of entry or antechamber. Passing a few steps to
the west, we turned short to the north, and found ourselves
in the body of the church, which is large and nearly
circular, with a large dome over it, and lighted chiefly from
above. In the middle of this large room stands a small
building called the holy sepulchre. It may be sixteen
feet by ten, and ten or twelve feet high. It is divided into
two rooms. The first, which is to the east, forms a kind
of entry, and is entered at the east side. In the middle of
this first room is a place or seat, not unlike a little table or
stool. This stands on the place where the stone lay, after
the angel had rolled it from the door and sat on it. There[119]
are twelve or fifteen lamps burning in this room; and
through the walls are several holes, out of which the light
or holy fire comes, while the bishop plays off that lying
miracle to the poor deluded pilgrims. This miracle is performed
at Easter. The second room is the sepulchre.
On the north side of it lies a large marble tombstone, about
as high from the floor as a common tombstone would be.
The remainder of the room is not much larger or wider
than will allow two persons to pass each other with ease.
In this room are about forty lamps, which, with those in
the outer rooms, are the property of different leading sects,
as the Greeks, Latins, and Armenians. For much as they
hate and quarrel with each other, matters are so arranged
that each shall have a chapel in the church and lamps in
the holy sepulchre.

East of the holy sepulchre and separated by a slight
partition, is the Greek chapel. This is the best chapel of
the establishment       is neatly fitted up, and has some pretty
good paintings. In the middle there is a kind of pillar,
and on the top of that is marked the centre of the world.
How they found out the precise spot my guide did not tell
me, nor who was the happy finder. Possibly the good
Helena who found so many things, for she had a wonderful
talent for such matters.

To the north of the holy sepulchre lies the Latin chapel.
It is richly furnished, and possesses some antiques that are
among the curious, such as the sword and spurs of Godfrey
of Bouillon. This chapel has also a pretty good organ,
and the organist was so polite as to play us several tunes.

At the west end of the holy sepulchre, and in contact
with it, is a small chapel for the Copts. It is but a few
feet square, and is like a shed or tent-like place, put up
against the end of the sepulchre. This chapel stands, of[120]
course, within the large circular room in the middle of
which the holy sepulchre is placed. To the west, and only
separated by a slight wall, is a small chapel for the Syrian
Christians. It is a small dark place, seldom if ever used.
Adjoining it is the tomb of Nicodemus, a little dark hole
quite in keeping with his fear of the day when he came to
Jesus by night; but as he afterwards came out openly in
favour of his lord, he deserved a better tomb than they
have allowed him.

To the south of the holy sepulchre, but raised so as to
permit the entrance to pass under it, is the chapel of the
Armenians. It does not equal that of the Greeks or
Latins, but far exceeds the Copts and Syrians'. Thus the
large and nearly circular area with a dome over it, in the
middle of which the holy sepulchre is placed, is surrounded
with chapels, separated from it by single walls, through
which they are entered from the large area. All this mass
of building is called the church of the holy sepulchre.
There are a number of other places pointed out, in and
about it, as places at which some of the facts recorded are
said to have taken place       as where the centurion stood,
who declared his belief that Jesus was the Son of God.
But I have said enough about these places. My memory
was so burdened with these things, it would not be strange
if I should have lost some on the way, and possibly I may
have misplaced some of them, not designedly however, in
giving this brief detail.

There are nearly twenty convents in and about Jerusalem.
The Greeks have, if I recollect aright, thirteen.
Most of them are, however, very small. Their large one is
directly adjoining the church of the Holy Sepulchre; and
the top of the church (not the dome) may be used as a
terrace for its inmates. From the top of the convent I[121]
passed over most of the top of the church, or of the chapels
contained within its walls. This large monastery is able
to receive and entertain many pilgrims       this is one design
of those establishments. The Latins have a very large
monastic establishment. It covers several acres of ground;
is so constructed as to be capable of making a good defence;
is a strong fort. It is a community of itself, and has within
it provision for carrying on all kinds of work. It has
smiths, carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, millers, bakers,
chandlers, and I know not how many other artisans within
it. The Armenians have a large establishment of a similar
kind, which is said to be equally capacious, and in good
condition. While these establishments no doubt are of use
in the way of entertaining pilgrims, they are most corrupting;
as it is their interest to promote superstition among
the people. From their number, wealth, and influence,
they are able to effect almost any object they please, and
defeat any one that falls under their displeasure. They
will, humanly speaking, be one of the greatest obstacles to
all missionary efforts to spread the light of truth in Jerusalem,
and dispel those dark and foul superstitions that
have long been gathering over these, so called, holy places.

A few days after our arrival, we set out one morning to
make a tour of the city. We went out at the Jaffa gate,
which is situate at the south side of the southern corner,
and near the edge of the valley of Gihon. Up this ravine,
a mile or more, is the upper pool of the fuller's field, mentioned
in 2 Kings, xviii. 17. It is made by running a
strong wall across the ravine, walling the sides and covering
them with a water-proof cement. There was no running
water in this ravine at present, nor is there often except in
the rainy season. A little east of the Jaffa gate is the
lower pool. It is made in the same way as the upper[122]
pool. The wall is used as a bridge       the road passing the
ravine on it. There is no water in this pool.

The valley of the Gihon becomes deeper as it passes
eastward to where it meets the Kedron. Below the
second pool it takes the name of the Valley of the Son of
Hinnom or Tophet. It was formerly used for many
unclean purposes       some of the most abhorrent kinds of
idolatrous worship was once practised here       the burning
of children to Moloch, Jer. vii. 31. The valley appears to
have been much contracted by the great quantity of rubbish
of all kinds which has been thrown into it from the city.
A road from the Jaffa gate passes down the valley, dividing
at the lower pool. One part passes to the south side, and
winding along the top of the bank for some distance,
crosses the plain southward to Bethlehem. The other
winds down the valley until it reaches the bottom       then
along the valley until it meets the one from the valley of
Kedron, following the course of the united valleys towards
the Dead Sea. On the south side of the valley of Hinnom,
and near its junction with Kedron, is the potter's field.
It is a small parcel of ground near the top of the bank
with an old ruined house on it. There was a small level
spot thirty feet below the top of the bank, at the bottom
of a thick stratum of horizontal rock. Walls have been
made enclosing a part of this       the face of the rock forming
the south wall of the building. The roof, which is flat,
is on a level with the top of the bank; and in it are a
number of holes, through which they used to throw the
dead bodies. It is not used now as a place of interment,
and is fast going to ruin, part of the walls having fallen in.
All along the south side of the valley are to be seen old
tombs cut in the rock       some are of considerable size,
having several rooms       some are so large as to be used by[123]
mules, donkeys, and other animals, as places of refuge from
the noonday heat of the sun.

At the junction of the valley of Hinnom with that of the
Kedron, which is nearly at right angles       the Hinnom
running nearly east and the Kedron nearly west       there is
a level space of several acres, laid out in gardens, and well
set with trees. These gardens and trees continue up the
valley of the Kedron, which is wider than that of the
Hinnom, for some distance; this rich and beautiful-looking
spot, watered by the fountain of Siloam, is called the
King's Dale. These valleys have all steep, high banks.
To the east of the Kedron lies Mount Olivet, which runs
north and south, and is separated from the hill on which
the city stands only by the deep, narrow valley of the
Kedron.

Mount Olivet terminates abruptly, or rather a break is
made through it nearly in a line with the valley of Hinnom,
bearing a little to the south of east. At the mouth of this
new valley, which lets off the water (when there is any)
to the eastward, is a small pool, and adjoining it is a kind
of resting or lounging-place, now much neglected       and
close by is the well of Nehemiah, which is very deep, and
we infer from indications about it, that formerly it was
much used; but it is now almost entirely neglected. This
is supposed by some to be the En-rogel in 2 Sam. xvii. 17.
Down this valley there are a number of gardens, and fig
and olive trees.

Turning up the valley of the Kedron, we passed some
pretty gardens and lots of ground well set with the fig and
other fruit trees. A few hundred yards brought us to the
pool of Siloam. It lies in the mouth of that little ravine
I mentioned as separating Mount Zion from Mount Moriah,
and is now much filled up within the walls, which cross it[124]
at some distance from its mouth. It has, no doubt, been
much filled without the walls, still it is very manifest on
the outside, and near its mouth. There is quite a high
bluff on the Moriah side, near the pool. This valley was
formerly called the valley of the Cheesemongers. It was
over this valley that Solomon is said to have made that
splendid ascent to the house of God from Mount Zion,
where his palace stood, that struck the Queen of Sheba
with so much astonishment. 1 Kings, x. 5. The pool of
Siloam is small, not more than twenty or twenty-five feet
long, and ten or twelve wide. It may be eight feet deep,
with only eighteen or twenty inches of water in it. It is
fed by the fountain of Siloam, which rises about three
hundred yards farther up the valley, and is taken under
ground through the point of the hill which projects into
the valley from Mount Moriah, and comes out at this
place. The water passes through the pool, and is conveyed
by a channel to the edge of the valley of the Kedron,
(for the pool is a little up the valley of the Cheesemongers,
say twenty-five or thirty yards,) then it passes through a
set of troughs, where the people come to obtain water for
themselves and their cattle.

A considerable part of Mount Zion, the part which
forms the point of the angle between the valley of Hinnom
and that of Kedron, is not now included in the city. The
wall no doubt formerly ran down the valley of the Gihon
to the point keeping close on the edge of the precipice, up
the valley of the Kedron, crossing the valley of the Cheesemongers
at the mouth, and keeping on the precipice, passed
Mount Moriah. The remains of the basement of the wall
that crossed the mouth of the valley of the Cheesemongers
may yet be seen, south of the pool of Siloam, near the large
trough into which the water flows from that pool. The[125]
present wall of the city leaves the edge of the bank of the
valley a little east of the Jaffa gate, and traversing for a little
space the higher part of the hill of Zion, but leaving a large
part of it to the right, takes nearly a straight course across
the upper part of the valley of the Cheesemongers to Mount
Moriah, leaving out most of this valley, and also the angle
of Mount Moriah, which is between the valley of the
Kedron and the valley of the Cheesemongers. Much of
this space is now made the depository of rubbish and filth
of all sorts. The whole face of the hill, both on the Gihon
and the Kedron side, is evidently much enlarged, and made
to project into the valley, from the quantity of rubbish
thrown over it. Once it must have been a high and
almost, if not altogether, a perpendicular bank, but now
the rubbish has almost wholly hidden the face of the rock,
being visible only in one or two spots; thus forming a
steep but sloping bank of rich, soft earth. Some parts of
it are planted with trees, and portions are used for cultivating
vegetables of various kinds. The present walls
were, if I mistake not, built by Caliph Omar, the successor
of the celebrated Saladin, who warred so bravely against
the Crusaders, and wrested Jerusalem and most of their
possessions in Palestine from them. We saw in the lower
part of the wall on Mount Moriah, many rocks of a very
large size; but none that equalled those at Baalbec. The
style of building in the walls at Jerusalem reminded me
of those parts of the walls of Baalbec of a more recent
erection, especially that on the east side and adjoining the
great temple.

A few hundred yards north of the pool of Siloam, we
came to the fountain of Siloam. This is a small spring on
the city side of the valley, and nearly opposite the corner
of the city wall, where it meets the precipice, and includes[126]
the space occupied by the temple. Milton therefore was
nearly right when he spoke of


"Siloah's stream, that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God."


This fountain is in a place like a cave, artificial, however,
as all the appearances indicate. You descend eight
or ten steps which lead down into the side of Mount
Moriah       there you find a stream of indifferent water.
The quantity of water is not large, and it is said that it
has more water in it one part of the day than in the other,
more, for example, in the morning than in the afternoon.
What is the cause of this is not certainly known. Possibly
it may be the syphon form of the passage through
which the water flows. There are many cases of syphon
springs. It may, however, arise from some connexion
which this fountain has with the water, brought by an
aqueduct to the mosque of St. Omar, on Mount Moriah.
The quantity of water brought is too great to be all used
in the service of the mosque, and as none flows from the
platform, it has most likely some passage under ground,
and may possibly find its way to the fountain of Siloam.
The depth of the fountain below the surface of the ground
does not allow the water to flow off. A passage is cut on
a level with the fountain, large enough to admit a man to
walk erect for some distance. It passes into the hill, and
under that high point of Mount Moriah which lies between
the valley of the Kedron and that of the Cheesemongers,
and comes out at the pool of Siloam. When this work
was done is not known.

The part of Mount Olivet near and opposite Mount
Moriah, is very much covered with Jewish graves. It is
the favourite Jewish place of interment. The rock is
horizontal, and in many spots next the valley, much of the[127]
face of the rock is bare. Parts of the stratum are sufficiently
thick to allow tombs to be cut in the face of it, and
by hollowing the softer stratum, caves have been formed
for the deposite of the dead. There is at one place a little
village almost entirely made up of old tombs that have
been altered more or less. Near the fountain of Siloam,
are several sepulchral monuments of more distinction than
the mixed multitude that cover the side of the mountains.
The most remarkable are, the tomb or pillar of Absalom,
as it is called in 2 Sam. xviii. 18, that of Zechariah, and
Jehoshaphat. The tomb of Absalom is in the form of a
house about twelve feet square, hewn out of a solid rock,
except the top, which has a round cover of stones, neatly
put together, and rising like a short cone. It is hollow,
and appears originally to have had but one small entrance,
high up in front, which was probably stopped with a stone
made to fit it. Several large holes have been broken
through the sides. The side walls appear to have been
from eighteen inches to two feet thick, leaving within
quite a neat little room. It was probably designed as a
place of interment for himself. He found one, however,
in a very different place,       in a pit, and, instead of resting
in the neat stone chamber he had prepared with so much
care, he had a great pile of stones thrown on him. We
saw here a striking sample of the Arab custom of throwing
stones at the graves of persons whom they abhor for their
crimes. There are large piles of stones in and about this
monument, which persons in passing have thrown at it, to
express their hatred of Absalom for his unnatural rebellion
against his father. The stratum of rock at this place is
much more thick and compact than is usually met with in
these regions.

The tomb of Zechariah is much like that of Absalom,[128]
and stands but a short distance south of it. The style of
architecture is not precisely the same       there is no door to
it that I could find, and of course could not ascertain whether
it was hollow. There is behind it, in the open space
that has been cut between it and the rock from which it
is separated, a hole, which descends, but so winding that
it is soon lost. It was so filled up that we could not
descend it. It may have some connexion with the inside
of this building, and have been intended for a secure place
of interment.

About half way between the pillar of Absalom and the
tomb of Zechariah, is the tomb of Jehoshaphat. The same
compact rock is made use of, but it is of a different order
of building. In this case, several large rooms are hewn
out of rock connected with each other. A large front door
or opening separated by pillars, and enriched with carved
work, is cut in the face of the rock, eight or ten feet from
the ground. The way of access is through a small, low
hole, at the outside, near the tomb of Zechariah. After
entering a few feet the space becomes larger, soon you can
walk erect. The passage ascends a little, and opens into
a fine large room, in the front of which is the large door
that I have described. This room is of course well lighted,
and would make no uncomfortable habitation. From this
front room, doors and passages lead to others that lie farther
in the hill, and of course are dark, except the little
light they may receive from the antechamber. I wonder
that this place is not occupied as a residence, as it must, I
think, be much better than any of the tombs a little to the
south, that are thus occupied.

Three or four hundred yards north of Absalom's pillar
we came to the place pointed out as the "Garden of Gethsemane."
It lies on the Mount Olivet side of the valley,[129]
not far from the bottom. There are four or five acres at
this place, partly in the valley and partly on the foot of
Mount Olivet, that have been laid out in gardens, and some
of them are still cultivated. There are a number of olive-trees,
some of them old and large. They point to one of
the enclosures, as the Garden of Gethsemane, where our
Lord was in agony, and where Judas led the band who
took him. As is customary, the priest will tell you the
precise spot where the disciples slept       where our Lord
withdrew       and where Judas betrayed him. That somewhere
here was the place where those transactions took
place, is not unlikely, but it is all idle folly to pretend to
be able to designate the precise spots.

A little north of this is a chapel under ground, said to
be the tomb of the Virgin Mary. It is near the valley, a
little on the Mount Olivet side. A small part of the top
of the building is above ground, but the great body is
below. We descended a wide, noble flight of steps for ten
or fifteen feet, and then we had a great display of lamps
and other rich ornaments, with a large altar in front. At
our right was a recess or little room, shown as the tomb of
Mary; and about half way up the steps were recesses on
both sides, said to be tombs of       I forget whom       Anna,
perhaps, and other females mentioned in the Gospels.
When this place was made, or by whom, I am not able to
say. It is, however, one of the best pieces of under-ground
building that I have seen, and is in good keeping. But
how all these good people were found, after centuries had
passed away, is not for me to tell.

The gate of St. Stephen is nearly opposite the tomb of
Mary, and a road leads up from near the tomb to the gate.
About two-thirds of the way from the gate to the bottom
of the valley, they point out the place where Stephen, the[130]
first martyr, was stoned. It is rather singular that they
have erected no monument over it. It is designated by a
ledge of rocks, which projects from the ground.

Mount Olivet is higher than most of the ground on which
the city stands       higher than Mount Moriah, and about as
high as the ground above the Jaffa gate on the top of the
ridge. There are a few olive-trees scattered over the
mount, but not as many as I had been led to suppose.
There is a mosque near the top of it, nearly opposite Mount
Moriah, and what is singular, there is a small church in
the inside of the mosque. The mosque is not used at present,
and was probably a part of the church formerly. The
church is said to be built on the spot from which our Lord
ascended; and they gravely showed us what they said was
his track, or the print of his foot. We know, however,
that the ascent was nearer Bethany, which lies on the east
side of the mount. Luke xxiv. 38.

While the Jews chose Mount Olivet as their burying-ground,
the Mohammedans love to inter their dead on
Mount Moriah, outside the wall, and as near as they can
to the mosque of St. Omar. They extend these interments
beyond the gate of St. Stephen, as there is more room
outside the walls, north of this place, for this purpose.
Thus the Jews bury on Mount Olivet, the Mohammedans
on Mount Moriah, and north of it along the outside of the
city walls, and the Christians on Mount Zion. There may
be other burying-grounds occupied by each of these classes
of persons; but these appear to be the ones most in use at
present.

The north and west sides are the most assailable parts
of the city. The wall there runs on ground nearly level;
it is, however, high and strong. The rock for making it
appears to have been raised from a space twenty or thirty[131]
feet outside the wall, and thus a pretty deep ditch has been
formed, which gives much strength to the wall as a means
of defence. There is north of the city an extensive grove
of olives, and a few other trees. It seems to me almost
certain, that the city must once have extended farther
north and north-west. The old ruins and cisterns indicate
that buildings have extended in that direction.

I had often heard of the Sepulchres of the Kings, and
took this occasion to visit them. They are about a mile
north-west of the city wall. Instead of being on the side
of a hill as I expected, I found them on a level part of the
plain. That part of the plain, as indeed is usual, is based
on a horizontal stratum of rock. At this place the rock is
more firm and compact than usual. A space, perhaps
forty feet square, has been cut down fifteen or twenty feet,
perhaps originally twenty-five or thirty feet, and the whole
of the rock removed, leaving the sides regular and smooth,
like the walls of a house. Parallel to the south side, and
at the distance of eight or ten feet, a graduated road has
been made fifteen or twenty feet wide, on a moderate
descent, which brings it down near the south-east corner,
to nearly the same level with the floor within. A noble
archway is hewn through this wall, wide enough to admit
three or four men abreast. The whole is evidently much
filled up       enough remains to show that it was well planned
and well executed.

Within this house-like place that I have described, and
at the western side, about eight feet of the upper part is
covered with sculpture of various kinds, wrought on the
face of the rock. It is rich, and of admirable execution.
The part under this is hewn away, and a kind of portico
made, twenty feet long, ten or twelve feet wide, and
twelve feet high. I give these as the probable dimensions,[132]
as I did not measure them. At the south end of this portico,
the rubbish, which had accumulated several feet, has
been removed, and an opening was found cut through the
solid rock. Only so much of the rubbish was removed as
would enable a person, by creeping, to enter. After
creeping a few feet, we entered a room of considerable size,
say twelve feet square. From this room doorways opened to
another room, and from this to others; most of them on the
same level, but some of the passages lead to rooms below,
and, in one place, the hollow sound which the floor gave
clearly showed that there were yet other excavations
beneath. These rooms had niches all around for receiving
the dead.

Originally these doorways had stone doors, with stone
hinges. The place for hanging the doors was obvious, and
we saw several of the broken doors made of a single stone
slab. In one of the inner rooms we saw some richly carved
covers of a sarcophagus; the sarcophagus itself was gone.
The door of this room was lying there nearly entire; it
was richly carved, and wrought in a kind of panel-work.
The stone hinges were like those wooden hinges which we
often meet with in cabins, stables,      c. On one side of
the stone a piece is left at both ends to project out a few
inches; holes are cut in the doorway of such a size as will
receive these projections, the upper one made deep, the
door put in, and made to turn on these points. These
tombs, although called the Tombs of the Kings, are not
believed to have been the place where the kings of Judah
were interred. We are told that they were usually buried
in the city of David,       that is, on Mount Zion. 2 Chron.
xxiv. 16. We know not why they are so called; possibly
because they are the most remarkable sepulchres that are
known in the vicinity.

[133]

Learning that at the distance of a mile or two to the
north-west, on the same plain, there was a remarkable set
of sepulchres, called the Sepulchre of the Judges, we concluded
to visit them also. There are extensive beds of
rock in this part of the plain, and in many places its upper
surface is six, eight, and ten feet above the level of the
soil. The rock is softer than that at the sepulchre of the
kings, being of that soft, friable limestone, which, from the
ease with which it is worked, is so much used in building.
I could see that in all directions it had been quarried and
removed.

Advantage was taken of a place where the rock rose
eight or ten feet above the ground. It was cut so as to
make a plain, smooth front. Then a little porch-like place
is hewn out, not unlike that described at the sepulchre of
the kings, the rock being left above for a cover. A door
was then cut in, with some rich carving over it. This
led into a large room, around which were a number of
niches for depositing the dead. Doorways opened at the
three sides to other rooms, and around these were niches       from
these again to others. Passing down through a hole
in the corner of the first large room, we found that there
was one under it of nearly the same size. It was in a less
finished state than any of the others. It is usually said,
that there are seventy or seventy-two of those niches for
corpses       the number of judges in the Jewish sanhedrim.
We could not make out that number. We found sixty-eight
or sixty-nine, if my memory be correct.

Many ruins are to be seen on this plain to the north and
north-west of the city. There are many olive-trees scattered
over it; and wherever the massy, compact limestone
rises to a height and size that will admit of it, you are
almost sure to see tombs cut in it.

[134]

There are several pools in the city. About half way
from the Jaffa gate to the church of the Holy Sepulchre
there is one of large dimensions; it is surrounded by houses,
and is, I think, called the pool of Hezekiah.

An aqueduct can in part be traced from the upper Gihon
to the city in the direction of this pool, and possibly it
may be the work of Hezekiah, mentioned in 2 Chron.
xxxii. 30. "He stopped the upper water-course of Gihon,
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of
David."

The pool of Bethesda lies near the gate of St. Stephen,
and almost adjoining the large open square, on which the
mosque of St. Omar now stands. It is now dry, and has
not the appearance of often having water in it. It is a
small place. Several arched places are shown at one end,
as a part of the five porches mentioned in the Gospel.

In truth, Jerusalem is badly, very badly supplied with
water. Most of the houses have cisterns for rain water,
but there is but little of good spring or running water.
The fountain of Siloam, which is small and not good, is the
only spring I have seen in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.
Water is brought in for the use of the mosque of St. Omar
in pipes from the pools of Solomon, not I think for general
use.

The streets of Jerusalem are narrow and filthy; the
houses have an old and weather-beaten appearance. There
is one peculiarity about them which is rather singular. I
saw something of it at Jaffa and at Rumla. The dome roof
is almost universal. To me it has a pretty appearance, and
is a much better defence against rain than the flat roofs
which are so universal at Beyroot, and all the towns and
villages in the northern part of Syria.

This mission find their chief employment in distributing[135]
books and conversing with the people, and find a good deal
to encourage them in their work. There is an increasing
disposition among the Mohammedans to have intercourse
with them, and to converse with them on the subject of
religion. This is a promising circumstance.




LETTER XIII.



Jerusalem, October 10th, 1836.


We left Jerusalem early on the morning of the 8th, for
a visit to Hebron. Being informed that there might be
some danger of robbery or evil treatment on the road, we
applied to the governor for a guard, and received an order
to the commandant at the pools of Solomon, the place
where the dangerous district begins, for a guard.

We left the Jaffa gate, and crossing the valley of Gihon,
passed down a pretty plain to the south of Jerusalem
towards Bethlehem. This plain is very fertile, but does
not appear to be under cultivation to any great extent.
On several parts of it we saw orchards of olive and other
trees. When near Bethlehem we took the direct road to
Hebron, intending to visit that place on our return.

In the vicinity of Bethlehem is the tomb of the beloved
Rachel. It is a high, oblong mass of masonry, of an old
and venerable appearance. A neat stone building with a
dome has been erected over it.

We saw an encampment of soldiers under the olive-trees
to the west of Bethlehem, and learned that Ibrahim
Pasha had attempted to disarm a powerful tribe of Arabs
that reside near the Dead Sea; that they had proved
refractory, and that he had ordered a considerable force[136]
to the neighbourhood, and directed some of the powerful
tribes that acknowledge his authority to aid in the work.
There were in the vicinity of Bethlehem several thousand
men, and the disarming of the tribe was going on.

The whole district about Bethlehem is exceedingly
rocky; more so than usual in this rocky country. This
continued the case most of the way to the pools. The
country to our right, that is west of us, rose higher, and
on the side of the ridge were several villages; most of
them had pleasant groves of trees near them, and there
were extensive districts abounding with the olive, and
plains finely adapted for cultivation.

The pools of Solomon are situate about three miles from
Bethlehem, on the road to Hebron. They lie in a ravine
that runs east from a little plain surrounded on all other
sides by moderately high hills. A small spring rises in
this plain, and the water from it was probably made,
formerly, to pass through the pools. At present, the water
from the spring, or from some of them,       for there are
probably more than one, although sealed up and conveyed
away under ground in such a way that the water can be
seen in but one or two places,       is conveyed in earthen
pipes, set in rock, and under ground along the side of the
pools, until it passes them, and is then made to unite with
the old aqueduct that took the waters from the pools to
the city. Most probably the temple was supplied with
waters in this way, and that the pools were made for this
purpose. The distance direct is about nine miles, and must
be increased by the windings necessary to find a water
level. Ibrahim Pasha, since he took possession of this
country, has had the aqueduct repaired. The pools are
called the Pools of Solomon, but it is not with certainty
known that he made them. They are in plan and structure[137]
much like the pools in the valley of Gihon, called the
upper and lower pool. They are three in number, and lie
one below another; each may be about six hundred feet
long, and three hundred broad. There is a large building
adjoining them, which may have been intended for a khan.
It is now occupied by the guard of soldiers that are usually
stationed here.

The order for a guard was safe in our pockets, but on
reaching the place not a soldier was to be found       what
were we to do? There were, counting our servant and
muleteer, and one or two persons who had joined us on the
way, as we supposed for the sake of enjoying our protection,
six or seven of us and two brace of pistols       we did not
therefore hesitate to push forward without a guard; and
saw no cause to regret it. The district we now entered
was more rough, rocky, and hilly, with less cultivation and
more wood upon it, than any we had yet seen. The trees
were small, not much higher than a man's head when
mounted on a good horse. It looks much as if it had been
stripped of its trees and the sprouts allowed to grow unmolested
for about two years. Much of the fuel that is
used in Jerusalem is obtained from this district. We met
many mules and donkeys loaded with wood going to the
city, and this, I may add, is the usual mode of transporting
wood through this country. Everything is packed on
animals. Wheel-carriages they have none. We also met
a number of females with large parcels of wood on their
backs, making their way towards the city. In some cases
they must have to carry it from six to ten miles. What a
labour for females! It is now, as in the days of old, the
women and children sink under the wood. Lam. v. 13.

From many of the hills over which we passed, we had
repeated views of the Dead Sea lying in a long narrow strip[138]
from north to south. For about two hours we passed
through a district hilly and very rocky, and mostly covered
with bushes. In many places these were so abundant as
to justify the use of the word thicket. These are the places
which are considered the most dangerous, as the robbers
can conceal themselves, and thus with more ease perpetrate
their crimes and escape pursuit. This whole region has
once been under cultivation, and a portion of it is yet. That
portion, however, is small. On the sides of the hills were
the remains of terrace-work, and in many places old buildings
and mounds of rock, which showed the labour of man.
We saw several villages in the distance, and far to the east
on a high hill, towns and other indications of inhabitants.
We passed one of the largest and best springs in Palestine.
It rises at the foot of one of the thickest and softest strata
of white limestone rock that I have seen. A number of
tombs were cut in the face of this rock, which may have
been eight or ten feet thick. On first seeing them I thought,
from the soft character of the rock, that they might lead to
extensive excavations, but on examination found this was
not the case. We were now within an hour or two of
Hebron. The face of the country improved, more pains
were taken to collect the loose rock into piles or fences,
and more ground was under cultivation. Many villages
were seen, at a distance from our road.

When about three miles from Hebron we turned a little
off our road to the west, to look for an old ruin which was
said to be worth seeing. This led us on higher ground;
and gave us a more extensive view of the country; and I
was not a little surprised and pleased at having a fine view
of the whole district to the west, embracing a part of the
hill country of Judea, the southern part of the plain of
Sharon, and the wide-spread Mediterranean sea beyond it.[139]
I was, in fact, on the highest ridge of the hill country,
which runs north and south, and could see below me the
secondary ridges and hills, which extended about half-way
to the sea, becoming lower and lower as they approached
the plain       then the plain beyond, and the white sand-hills
and banks along the shore. I fancied that I could see the
south-east corner of the sea near El-Arish, where it turns
to the west       possibly this was fancy. The view, however,
was most extensive and interesting, as I knew that
my eyes were ranging over, not only a large and rich
portion of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, but also
part of the land of the Philistines, those inveterate and
powerful enemies of the people of God. Oh! how often
has the district which I now beheld, witnessed the mustering,
and marching, and warfare of the Philistine against
Israel, and the Israelite against the Philistine.

We now entered a gently declining valley. The soil
did not appear better than usual, but much care and
labour had been bestowed on it, and evidences of this
increased as we passed through to the south. The stones
were gathered off       good stone fences were made along the
road       the ground was well set with vines, and for miles
we had nothing on either side of the road but a succession
of vineyards loaded with the most delicious grapes. Surely,
thought I, this must be the valley of Eshcol. It was here
the spies procured the vine loaded with clusters, which they
carried into the wilderness to the astonishment of the whole
camp. If my conjecture was not entirely correct it was
nearly so, if the Jews of Hebron are to be believed, for
this, if not the valley of Eshcol, terminates in that valley
about a mile from Hebron. This valley through which we
passed became wider and more rich in its fruits until it
joined the other valley, which comes in more from the west.[140]
This second valley is the widest, has a considerable breadth
of level, rich soil finely cultivated, interspersed with trees,
and covered with vineyards. This is called Eshcol, as we
learned from the Jews with whom we lodged, and who
took us out to see it. About a mile up this valley is
pointed out the tree under which they say Abraham
received the angels, Gen. xviii. 4-8. It is the largest
tree in the vicinity, is of the oak kind, which here grows
low and sends out many branches, and looks at a little distance
not unlike a large apple-tree. If it be the self-same
tree under which Abraham entertained the angels, it must
have attained a good old age. I am, however, slow to
believe it, although assured of it by a descendant of the
patriarch. It may be a descendant of that tree thus
honoured, either direct or collateral, but that it should
have lived until now, does not agree with the great law of
mortality which spares no living thing, neither man nor
beast, animal nor vegetable, since death entered this world.
These, however, are the plains of Mamre, and the good old
patriarch long sojourned, and somewhere on these plains
his tent was pitched, his altar raised, and his worship went
up with acceptance to the God who was "his shield and
exceeding great reward." How many generations have
passed away since that time, and yet his name is known,
is dear to the people of these lands       seeing the "memory
of the righteous is blessed!" Abraham had his trials       he
was ordered from the land of his nativity, and, although
Canaan was promised him, he was made to live as a
stranger in it, and at the sufferance of others       while he
saw the nations which possessed it building cities, increasing
their defences, and using means to secure it as an inheritance
for their children, he was not allowed to secure a foot
of it, except a burying-place for himself and family; and[141]
although he was promised a numerous posterity, yet he
saw himself and wife getting old, passing the age in which
men become parents, and not one son born to them. Yet
he believed and loved and served God, and the event proved
that not one word of God's promise fell to the ground.

Following this united valley a little to the south-east, we
came to Hebron. The country about it is better cultivated
than any district I have seen. There are many enclosures
and vineyards; olive groves and fig-trees abound. As we
drew near the town, we passed several wells; these, we
were told, were, one the well of Jacob, one of Isaac, and
one the well of Abraham; so each of the patriarchs has
one. It at least shows their regard for the memory of
these good men. Hebron stands in the valley; but at a
place where the two ridges, which bound it on either side,
are not uniform, but rather like separate hills placed near
each other. While most of the town stands in the valley,
its edges rise in a small degree on four of the hills by which
it is surrounded, but in the greatest degree on the hill to
the south-east. The town has a very old appearance; the
streets are narrow and dirty, and to a great extent arched
over, especially the bazaars. Few of the houses look well;
they are placed uncomfortably close to each other, and are
badly aired and lighted. The bazaars appeared poorly
supplied with goods and provisions; and, on the whole, it
was a poorer place than I was led to expect, from the improved
state of the country around it. Much the largest
part of the population is Mohammedan. There are few
Christians in Hebron; we were told, but one family, and
that was the family of the secretary of the governor. We
had a letter to him, and expected to find lodgings with
him, but to our regret he was not at home. While inquiring
for him, the governor passed, and ascertaining that we[142]
were travellers, and were recommended to his secretary, he
sent a soldier with us to introduce us to a respectable
Jewish family, who were ordered to take care of us. We
were kindly received and provided for. They showed us
the synagogue, which was near our lodgings. We found a
school in operation in the synagogue; the scholars were
reading in the Hebrew Bible. They showed us a most
splendid roll of the law, which they had recently received.
It was fixed on two rollers, so as to roll off the one as it
rolled on to the other, leaving such a part exposed as might
serve for the lesson to be read. The whole put nicely in a
case, and fastened with clasps, and laid away in a closet
not far from the reading-desk or pulpit.

A few years ago, when Ibrahim Pasha's troops took
Hebron, they committed great outrages on the Jews, by
plundering them of all they could find. They broke into
their synagogue, and opened all parts of it in which they
thought anything could be found, mutilated and tore their
roll of the law, and perpetrated many other enormities.
Hebron is esteemed by the Jews as a sacred city; and they
think it a great privilege to live here. They pretend that
persons, when old, if they come and live at Hebron, can
renew their age. They need not go far for materials to
correct the opinion; for some of them had about them
ample proof that old age and all its infirmities come
upon people at Hebron as certainly and as fast as at other
places.

The great mosque, which was probably once a Christian
church, stands over, as we were told, the cave of Machpelah.
We were not allowed to enter it. It is a very large
building, and the lower part contains stones of a very large
size. It stands on the side of the hill, at the south-east
part of the city. The palace of the governor joins it; and[143]
it is not improbable that the palace in which David reigned
for seven years was in that quarter. Near the mosque is a
very large cistern, which the Jew, who was our guide,
pretended was Sarah's bathing-house. It was, however,
of much more modern formation; the declaration of the
Jew to the contrary notwithstanding.

At the south end of the town is a fine pool. This is the
pool, as is supposed, over which David hung the hands and
feet of Rechab and Baanah, the murderers of Ishbosheth.
2 Sam. iv. 12. It appears to have been formerly fed by a
stream through a small aqueduct, that comes into it; but
the stream is now dry, and the aqueduct out of order. A
short distance to the north of this pool, is another of a
smaller size; but the water in it does not appear as good,
nor is it as much used.

While rambling among the olive-trees that almost cover
the hill to the south-west of the town, we came to the ruins
of an old building, which must have been a place of some
consequence formerly, but is now wholly deserted. Our
guide took us into it, and in one of the rooms showed us a
small hole in the wall, which he told us was the tomb of
Jesse, the father of David. The Jews, who were with us,
certainly showed much reverence for the place, pulling off
their shoes, and performing other acts of regard. Whether
this be the grave of Jesse none can tell, nor is it worth
much inquiry. It is not impossible that Jesse may have
died at Hebron, notwithstanding Bethlehem was his usual
place of residence. When David came under the jealousy
of Saul, and was obliged to flee, his family fled with him,
and David had to provide for and protect his father and
mother. 1 Sam. xxii. 1-4. It is not unlikely that while
he reigned in Hebron, and the sons of Saul over the rest of
Israel, his family may have resided with him; Jesse, who[144]
was an old man when David was anointed, may have
finished his days while his son lived and reigned at Hebron.

I could not but notice in passing, some piles of wood of
a larger kind than any I had seen in Palestine. It was
pine, and cut into pieces of four or five feet in length.
Many pieces were from a foot to eighteen inches in diameter,
which, in this country, is large growth. I noticed also
over their shops, and at other places, pine branches used
as a protection from the sun. On inquiry I was told that,
a few hours to the south-west, there was much wood of
that kind. As the pine, in these countries at least, is
seldom found except in sandy districts, there must be a
sandstone formation in that quarter. Hebron, indeed, lies
far south in Palestine, and on the borders of the wilderness,
and probably the limestone formation terminates not far
south of this, and gives place to the sandstone, which
accounts for the immense regions of sand which are met
with in that district. Had time allowed, I would gladly
have made a tour of a day or two to the south, and taken
a glimpse of that waste, howling wilderness in which
Israel, for their rebellion, were made so long to wander.
The peculiar circumstances of my companion, Mr. B              ,
whose aid I needed as interpreter, imposed on us the necessity
of limiting our time. There is a pretty good road
from Hebron to Gaza and El-Arish on to Egypt, which
may be traversed on a dromedary in four days.

We wished on our return from Hebron to take a route
more to the east, and pass Tekoah and the region of the
Dead Sea. We learned, however, that that district was
now in a troubled state, as the population on it were among
those whom the Pasha was disarming, and some of the
more desperate were for keeping out of his reach, and
might, in their ill-humour, injure those who fell in with[145]
them. As we had no guard, we thought it the part of
prudence to keep out of harm's way, and accordingly returned
as far as the pools of Solomon by the same route
we had traversed in going to Hebron. From the pools we
went down the hollow in which they are situate, and followed
the course of the aqueduct. This led us over a new
district, and brought us to Bethlehem on the other side.
The district over which we passed was exceedingly rough
and rocky. The hollow, along the side of which we passed,
became deep, rough, and had very little level space at the
bottom, and the sides of the hills that bordered it really
appeared given up to rocks and stones. The little earth,
however, that was to be seen, was fertile, for the rock was
a soft limestone, which always forms a good soil.

About half way from the pools to Bethlehem, we passed
a place where the valley spread out so as to leave, for a few
hundred yards, a strip of level land from twenty to fifty
yards wide. This was divided into lots, and walls made
across it to prevent the washing away of the earth. Trees
and garden herbs were planted, and the whole had a most
pleasing appearance among the wilderness of rock by which
it is surrounded. On the adjoining hill were a few low
huts, some of them more in the ground than above it, where
the owners of this green spot dwell.

The hills in the immediate vicinity of Bethlehem were
finely terraced, and many olive and fig trees planted. I
could not but notice the number and beauty of the watch-houses
or little towers, which were placed in the vineyards       some
of them were round and some square       made of
stone, from ten to fifteen or twenty feet high. These serve
as places from which a watch is kept on the vineyards
during the season of the grape. It is common to watch in
this way their gardens and fruit-trees, as otherwise they[146]
might be pillaged. Reference is made to these towers in
Scripture, "as a cottage in a vineyard,"       "as a lodge in a
garden of cucumbers," Isaiah i. 8; "built a tower in it,"
(the vineyard,) Matt. xxi. 23. The ground on which Bethlehem
stands is rough and uneven. It is a poor-looking
place, and has but a small population. It was swarming
with the Pasha's troops when we were there, and that, as
well as other reasons, made our stay short.

The principal object of attraction here is the Church of
the Nativity. This is a large establishment, and includes
in it both a monastery and church. It properly belongs
to the Latins, but is, in part, a joint concern, as the Greeks
have a chapel in it, and probably some of the other Christian
sects. They pretend to show you the place where our
Lord was born, and the manger in which he was laid. The
church is built over them. They may be said to be under
the level of the ground, and in a grotto, as almost all their
holy places are. You descend ten or twelve feet, and
approach the place of nativity through a narrow passage,
which is paved, and the sides faced with polished marble.
The place itself is small, and used somewhat as an altar,       a
little recess in the wall. It is almost filled with lamps,
which are kept always burning. The manger is a few
yards to the right, on the other side of the passage. It is
also very richly ornamented, lined in part with silk, and
illuminated with many lamps. From these places a way
leads into the Latin and Greek chapels.

No sooner was our arrival announced than we were beset
by a number of persons with all sorts of trinkets for sale,
crosses, large pieces of mother-of-pearl, with the likeness of
some holy person or thing carved on it, beads, and snuff-boxes.
They followed us into the church, waylaid us in
the passages, and beset us in the streets. A great part of[147]
the population are engaged in manufacturing such things,
and they form the chief article of trade at this place. They
were really troublesome in their efforts to induce us to buy,
and they took care to ask a good price.

When about to start, some of our party were detained
in the church after I came out. I waited on my horse,
and, as the day was hot, and the sun beat down with great
power, I spread my umbrella over me. This excited the
curiosity not only of the boys and common soldiers, of
whom the place was full, but of some of the inferior officers.
They gathered about me in crowds, and looked at the
umbrella on all sides       wished to understand the mechanism
for raising and letting it down       tried it, and held it over
them. They examined my clothes, especially my shoes,
and on the whole, gave the Frank a pretty close examination
as to his exterior. They exhibited great good-nature
in doing it, and appeared much pleased with my willingness
to gratify their curiosity. After leaving the town, we
passed many soldiers and horsemen under the olive-trees
which abound in the vicinity. One of the horsemen joined
us in the ride, and took a hat from Angelo, which he put
on his own head, and caught hold of the umbrella of one
of the company, and spread it over him, assuming in pleasantry
great dignity, to the no little amusement of his
companions. I have heard it said that the Turks seldom
laugh, and I believe they do laugh less than Franks; yet
I have met with several samples of the humorous and droll
among them that was not a little amusing.

On our return to Jerusalem we learned that a French
prince, one of the sons of Louis Philippe, the present king,
had just arrived, escorted by the governor of Rumla. The
governor of Jerusalem and a number of important personages
had gone out to meet and welcome him; the Catholics[148]
were especially assiduous in their attentions       as the French
king, infidel as he is, is considered the protector of the
Catholic church in the eastern part of the Mediterranean.
There has also been a little excitement lately between the
Catholics and the Greeks, as the Catholics have attempted
to take possession of some holy places (they say, only get
back) which the Greeks claim. The Latins had contrived
to get an order from Mohammed Ali, it was said, in favour
of their taking them; but the Greeks were not disposed to
yield willingly what they had long possessed and considered
as of right belonging to them. The presence of the son of
Louis Philippe at such a time was important.

The great quantity of rock on the surface, and the little
earth that is at times to be seen, must at first strike the
observer as a great objection to this country, and may lead
to the inquiry, how could such a rocky land be called "the
land flowing with milk and honey"       the glory of all lands?
There are many districts that are sadly encumbered with
rock, yet the soil among these rocks is of a very superior
kind, and were the rock somewhat broken up, the large
pieces piled and the small mixed with the soil, it might be
made very productive. There is very striking proof of
this in some districts, as that about Hebron, which abounds
with rock, and yet is covered with the most productive
vineyards. As to such a rocky country being so spoken
of in the days of the patriarchs, I suppose that it was in
truth, at that time, the finest of lands; that the rock which
now lies bare in so many places, was then all covered with
earth of the richest kind, which has gradually disappeared
in the wastings, and tillage, and pasturage, of four or five
thousand years. The more I see of Palestine, the more I
am persuaded that it was once one of the first countries in
the world. The time was, I doubt not, when all these
rocks were covered with a fine vegetable mould.

LETTER XIV.



Jerusalem, Oct. 13th, 1836.


We have just returned from a visit to Jericho, the
Jordan, and the Dead Sea, and I now set myself to the
work of giving you a short account of these places. If you
wish for a full and detailed account of these celebrated
places, I must send you to books and the makers of them.
My object is to give you such brief notices, as I have time
to commit to paper. The Rev. Mr. Lanneau of the
Jerusalem mission joined us, and made a very agreeable
addition to our party; we took also two soldiers as a
guard, this district being notorious for robbers.

We left Jerusalem by the gate of St. Stephen, passing
between the chapel of the Virgin Mary and the garden of
Gethsemane. We crossed Mount Olivet a little to the
south of the church of the Ascension, where there is a
slight depression in the mount; the part south of this is
called the Mount of Corruption. On it Solomon built
places for his heathen wives, to practise the heathen rites.
They point out a place where they say he had a large
establishment for these "strange women." The Mount of
Corruption! very well named, when put to such uses; a
very corrupt business it was       bad enough at any place,
but still worse at the holy city, and by the ruler of the
chosen people! Solomon was, no doubt, a very wise
man in some things, but he did not show it in his relation
to females. In that respect he behaved very foolishly. It
is the dictate of wisdom for a man to have one wife, it was
thus intended by his Maker; and he will be the happier
and even the better man, all other things being equal, for
being thus connected. If he uses a little wisdom in making[150]
his choice, and a little more in treating and taking care
of his wife, as every good man ought to do, he will find,
nine times out of ten, that his wife will be a great comfort
and help to him, and do him good all the days of his
life. But what is to be expected of the man who is so very
foolish as to gather them about him by the score, yea, the
hundred? And then, what a selection from all the idolatrous
nations within his reach! I doubt not they were a
bad set, a very bad set of women; but what right had he to
expect a better from the quarter whence he obtained them?
Had he gone to some good old pious father of his own
people, and married his well-raised, virtuous, and pious
daughter, and confined himself to one wife as a wise man
ought to do, and a good man would do, he might have been
happy in the married life. But behaving as he did, there
is no wonder that he was unhappy. It is not at all courteous
and gallant in him, in these circumstances, to show
his spite in making hard speeches about the ladies, as if
there was no fault on his own side.

Mount Olivet, where we crossed it, had a few trees on
it, and a portion was laid out in gardens and vineyards,
but a great deal of it evinced neglect. It has a wide, flat top,
over which we passed for some time, before we began our
descent. We had a pretty good view of the northern end of
the Dead Sea, the valley of the Jordan, and the mountains
of Moab, which run north and south, not far east of the
Jordan and the Dead Sea. These mountains do not
appear to be very high; I should judge them to be about
the height of the hills to the west of Jerusalem. My
attention was arrested by the apparent straightness of the
range, and the uniform height of the ridge. The top of
it, from the south to the north, as far as it could be seen
with distinctness, appeared almost perfectly level. It forms[151]
a most beautiful eastern horizon to a person on the high
grounds about Jerusalem.

On the eastern side of Olivet, a little on the descent, is
Bethany, where Lazarus and his sisters lived. It is a low,
miserable village, containing only a few families, and most
of these live in the lower rooms and cellars of old buildings.
Not one good house did I see in the village. It is little
else than a mass of ruins. An old ruin is pointed out as
the house of Martha. We were shown the grave of Lazarus;
it is an excavation in the rock, narrow at the mouth,
barely allowing a person to enter; we descended eight or
ten steps, and there found a small room, in which was a
place that served for an altar, on which service is at times
performed. In one side of this room is a small hollow place,
rude enough certainly, in which we were told the body of
Lazarus was deposited. The whole concern is certainly a
very poor one, much less like a place of interment than
many we had seen, but may have been intended for that
purpose.

Our course was now nearly due east. We had a very
steep descent to make on the eastern side of Olivet. We
found some cultivated ground, and a few olive and fig
trees. Among the limestone on the surface we saw many
masses of silex, much of it of a variegated and fine kind,
which had the appearance of the coarser kinds of agate.
We passed from the Mount of Olives into a deep hollow,
which runs east towards the valley of the Jordan. Near
the head of this hollow is a spring of water, with a ruin in
the vicinity, which appears to be a great stopping-place for
those who are passing to and from Jerusalem and Jericho.
We found there a company of Arabs and muleteers. Our
road led us down the valley. The hills on both sides were
steep, and the valley narrow. From this place there is a[152]
change in the character of the rock, and a corresponding
one in the character of the soil and the aspect of the country.
The rock becomes a friable limestone of the softest
kind. This continues most of the way to the valley of the
Jordan. It is easily disintegrated, and of course but little
of it appears on the surface. A fine-looking soil covers the
face of the country, the hills are rounded over, and but
few rocks are seen projecting out. Those veins of silex,
which I have mentioned, form an exception; and there are
several of them, one above another, at a greater or less distance.
They vary from two or three to twelve or eighteen
inches in thickness; and, in some places, form a kind of
cord-like appearance round the hills. While, however,
the land looks more favourable for tillage, it does not show
the evidences of it       far otherwise       we saw less and less of
its surface under the care and cultivation of man, and fewer
traces of a resident population; no villages, no houses, no
vineyards nor olive trees, and but occasionally a spot that
had been made to yield grain. About half-way from
Mount Olivet to the plain of Jordan, we passed a district
that exhibited rather a singular aspect. The rock on both
sides of the narrow valley down which we were passing,
was thrown much out of the horizontal position, which is
the general state of the rock in this district, and forced up
in the middle, a rod or two it may be, and made to have
much the appearance of a regularly-formed arch. It was
manifest especially in the siliceous stratum before-mentioned.
In some places you might count many of these
arches along the side of the hill, on both sides of the valley,
and in part corresponding with each other. They had all
the appearance of having been formed by the action of
some great force from below, acting partially on small
locations. I noticed the same, but on a more extended[153]
scale, on the road by which I returned from the Dead Sea,
which lay considerably to the south of this. It was, however,
as far as I could judge, about the same distance from
the valley of the Jordan. It is, indeed, the same district,
and may possibly exhibit a similar appearance both north
and south to a much greater extent. It deserves an examination
from some one who has leisure and the desire to
gain a perfect knowledge of the geology of Palestine.

The west side of the valley of the Jordan is bounded by
a very high hill; it might well be called a mountain. It
cannot be less than from 500 to 800 feet high. The rock
of these hills is limestone, so very soft and white that I
hesitated whether it did not more properly belong to the
chalk formation. As the valleys approach this abrupt
border of the plain, they cut deep into the earth, and some
of them form most tremendous chasms. They reminded me
much of the mouths of the streams in some parts of Kentucky,
and on the Kanhawa. They are all destitute of
trees, and hardly a bush is to be seen that would shade a
goat. This nakedness of the banks and precipices gives
them a wild appearance. On the sides of these deep chasms
you occasionally see ledges of rock jutting out, and caves,
either natural or artificial, entering under them       a noble
place for thieves and robbers. The descent from the hills
to the plain of Jordan is abrupt and steep. To our left was
a most tremendous gorge, with a small flow of water in it.
The face of the hill towards the plain, was almost entirely
destitute of vegetation, and deeply furrowed, from the
washing of its soft and yielding soil. Directly before us,
and a short distance from the foot of the hill, we saw some
ruins, and the remains of a wall which enclosed a considerable
district. Whether this was the remains of some old
village or city, we could not tell, as our road turned north[154]
of it, towards Jericho, and we had not time to visit it and
examine it more minutely. We crossed the rivulet flowing
out of the deep gorge to our left, as we descended the hills;
on its banks were some old ruins, and, to our right, was a
large and very high mound, which, from its regularity, had
the appearance of being artificial, and was much like some
of those large mounds that are seen in the valley of the
Mississippi.

A few small trees adorned the banks of the rivulet within
the gorge, and marked its course through the plain. This
noble, wide-spread plain lay almost as much at waste,
especially toward the hills, as if there was no man to till
the ground. It had the appearance of having been fertile,
and not wholly deprived of its fertility, but as worn a good
deal with former usage. There was, as is usual with plains
near water, a scattering of water-worn pebbles over it, but
not so many as to be at all in the way of tillage. As we
entered more on the plain, we passed some spots that bore
marks of having yielded grain not long since.

After travelling about three miles, we reached the village
which is called Jericho. Just before entering it, we crossed
a small brook which flows from the north-west, and has its
rise in the fountain pointed out as that which Elisha healed.
2 Kings, ii. 21. About this brook, and spreading out over
the plain, were a number of bushes, mostly of the thorn
kind, and not unlike what I have heard called the white
thorn in some parts of the United States. The largest of
them were about as high as a peach tree, but were rather
a clump of branches growing out of one root, than branches
from the same stem. They have many very sharp thorns
on them. Some of them bore an apple, of a whitish colour,
larger than a grape. There was also another bush with
prickles on it, which grew from four to five feet high.[155]
It bore a yellow fruit, about as large as the apricot, that
looked very rich and pretty, enticing the appetite, but
the taste was unpleasant and indescribably nauseous.
When cut, they were soft and watery.

The village called Jericho, may stand about mid-way
from the hills to the Jordan. It is one of the most miserable
villages that I ever saw. The houses are low, dirty,
miserable places, hardly deserving the name. Piles of
rubbish, ashes, and filth, lie all about. There is one building
now occupied by the soldiers stationed there, that has high
and strong stone walls, but is much out of repair. The
village has, however, some gardens about it, and a number
of fig and other fruit trees. Of the many palms which
may once have decorated this city, but one remains. We
encamped near the house used as a fort by the troops, under
some fine spreading fig trees. There were some cattle in
the village, but we were not able to procure any milk that
was fit to drink; a small vessel which they sent to us,
being so bad that we would not have it, but sent it back
to the owner. We have usually found it difficult to
procure milk.

We set out in the morning to visit the fountain of Elisha
before we went down to the Jordan. It lies about three
miles north-west of Jericho. As our guide did not know
the way, we tried to engage a person from the village, and
on inquiring for a boy, they told us they had no boys; all
their boys and young men were taken for soldiers. They
are all Mohammedans in this village; and it is only
Mohammedans, or Druses and Ansairi, who are next-door
neighbours to them, that the Pasha honours with a forcible
incorporation into his army       a happy deliverance for the
Christian. After some inquiry, a woman engaged to be
our guide so far as to put us in the right road. The spring[156]
is a fine large one, near a small hill, half a mile in the
plain. There were some appearances of ruins in the piles
of stone that lay about its head. The water is clear, but
not cold; there is a considerable spreading of the waters
by means of small channels, and also from the level character
of the ground. This district is for some extent
covered with the thorn-bush I have mentioned, together
with some intermixture of other growth.

Mount Quarantania, which is one of the highest and
roughest parts of that range of hills that border on the
plain, has a peculiarly desolate appearance, and is full of
holes and caves. This is the mountain into which, as the
monks tell us, our Lord was led, after his baptism, to be
tempted of the devil. Between its base and the fountain
are a number of old walls and buildings, which indicate
that a place of some consequence may once have been
situate there.

The French prince whom I have mentioned before as on
a visit to Palestine, we learned, had spent the night at the
fountain with his retinue. He had come the day before
from Bethlehem to the Dead Sea, and from thence came
up past Jericho to the fountain of Elisha, and was off this
morning for Jerusalem before we arrived. It would seem
that even to unbelievers this land has a most intense
interest; and well it may, for what land ever witnessed
such wonders as have taken place in Palestine?

We took a south-east direction across the plain, which
differed but little from the district we had already passed
over, in the sterility of its aspect. This appearance may
in part have been owing to the circumstances, that we
were now at the close of the summer, and these plains had
been parched with a six months burning sun, without the
protection of a good covering of vegetable growth, and not[157]
favoured with a shower of rain. This was enough to parch
the life out of almost anything. Parts of the plain had
been under tillage, and on some spots the stubble on the
ground showed that a crop of grain had been gathered, but
the greater part lay untilled. It no doubt serves, as much
of the best lands of these regions do, for pasturage       a
matter, in the estimation of the people of this country,
equally, if not more important than land employed in
tillage. This is not the season for flocks to be seen on the
plains, as they are too much burned up; and I know not
where they can find districts at present that are not. At
the distance of a mile and a half from the Jordan we made
a descent of eight or ten feet. The descent was rather
irregular, the edge of the strata much washed, and there
were many irregular parcels of earth along the edge, that
had resisted the wastings which had removed the strata to
this extent. The whole surface of this part of the plain
was very destitute of vegetation. At the distance of
nearly three quarters of a mile we made another descent,
nearly as great as the former; the edge of it had much the
same washed and irregular appearance. The land on which
we now entered had many of these irregular mounds of
earth that I mentioned as lying along the water edge of
the former descent. It looked as if the whole plain had
once been on a level with the part above the first descent,
and that a sweeping torrent, extending out to where the
first bank is, had passed over it, and swept away about
ten feet of earth, except a few hard spots near the edge;
then, that another torrent had come down, reaching out
only to the place where the second bank is, and within its
range had carried off about ten or twelve feet of earth,
leaving a large number of spots that resisted it; for the
mounds between the first and second banks nearly agreed[158]
in height with the plain above that bank, while those
below the second bank agreed in height with the land
between the first and second banks. In the space between
the second and third banks much of the ground looked as
if it was often covered with water, like the dried mud on
which water has long lain; this was not the general character
of this district. There were at places many small
bushes, and on some parts of it a pretty considerable crop
of dry weeds. We made a third descent near the stream,
of about the same depth. On and near this last bank,
down to the water's edge, there were many bushes of
various kinds; among them considerable quantities of the
willow, "the willow of the water-courses."

The Jordan, where we visited it, may be twenty or
twenty-five yards wide. It is, however, very various in
its width, but I should think what I have given embraced
its common width. It had a strong current at this place,
and was very muddy; whether this is its usual colour, or
was in consequence of a considerable fall of rain two days
before, I am unable to say. After amusing ourselves in
the water for some time, we thought it would not do to
come away without crossing it. We swam to the other
side, and cut some rods from the willows, on "the other
side of Jordan." We could have waded across, if it had
not been for the rapidity of the current, which swept over
a gravel bar into a deep hole. Many lives, it is said, have
been lost at this place. We, however, swam over and
returned in safety. I gathered twelve stones from the
Jordan, and cut half a dozen stems from the willows that
grew on its banks. We looked at the water, and the
banks again and again, as if we were fearful we might
forget how they looked; and at last, yet with reluctance,
set off for the Dead Sea.

[159]

We saw the Jordan at the place usually visited by the
pilgrims, three or four miles from its mouth. Its course
makes it enter the Dead Sea somewhat east of the middle
of the plain. It may be that some visitors follow the
course of the stream, and see it at its entrance; we, however,
did not do this, but made for the Dead Sea, at a
point about midway from the entrance of the Jordan to the
western side of the plain. I may here remark that the
valley of the Jordan appears to be very uniform in its
width. The ranges of hills which border this valley or
plain, run nearly parallel to each other. The Dead Sea
fills up this valley nearly from ridge to ridge, leaving but
a small border of land along its shores.

In going from the Jordan to the Dead Sea, for a considerable
space, not a blade of grass or vegetation was to be
seen. It was so soft and dusty, that the horses sank to
their fetlocks; and in some places it was rendered uneven
by the irregular mounds       many of which did not seem to
know what vegetation is. Whether this peculiar barrenness
was owing to the unfavourable nature of the soil I
know not; possibly this may be the case. I did not see
any other indication of salt, which has been reported as
found on the surface of the ground, until very near the sea.
Between this barren district and the Dead Sea, there was
an evident change in the aspect of the ground       we found
some dry grass and small bushes; and as we came nearer
the shore the bushes increased in size and number, and some
spots might be called thickets. We saw also a cane brake
and a variety of other growth. To my very agreeable surprise,
I found the shore fine, smooth, gravelly, and deepening
very slowly, so that a person might wade in for some
distance. There was along the shore drift-wood, most of
it small, but still larger than any I had seen on the Jordan.[160]
This would seem to indicate that somewhere on its shores
there is more timber than we found in the spot we visited.
The water was not only very salt but exceedingly bitter,
as much so as most travellers have stated. The great
density of the water was amply proved by its power to
bear up the body. There is some truth in the saying, that
it requires an effort to keep the feet and legs under, so as
to use them with advantage in swimming. Some writers
have, however, stated the matter in rather too strong
terms.

I could lie on my back in the water, with my head,
hands, and feet, all out at the same time, and remain thus
as long as I pleased without making any motion whatever;
this I could not do in any other water that I have been in.
Still it is carrying the matter too far and beyond the truth,
when it is said to be so heavy, or so dead, that it never
rises in waves, but always lies smooth and unruffled, let
the wind blow as it will. The drift-wood thrown out is
evidence to the contrary. The shore exhibited proof that
but a day or two before the waves had run high; but the
best proof of all was the ocular and sensible one that they
were then chasing each other out on the shore, as they do
in all other seas       true they did not run high, but then
there was not much wind to make them. The water was
so clear that the bottom could be seen with great distinctness.
In wading in there was, at some places, more softness
at the bottom than I was led to expect from the firm
character of the shore. There were, however, some spots
on the shore where the soil gave way under our feet, and
exhibited a kind of quicksand, as I demonstrated by getting
into one of them over my shoes. Still the bank, the water,
and the bottom, so far as I saw and tried it, had much less
of the terrible, fearful, and unnatural, than I had expected.[161]
Instead of that dark, gloomy, and turbid spread of water,
that from my childhood I had imagined, it struck me as a
very pleasant lake. It reminded me of the beautiful lake
of Nice. As to the deep and fearful gloom which many
writers describe as hanging over it, I must think that it is
mainly found in their imaginations. It is not wonderful that
a place, which, for its great wickedness, was doomed to
such a fearful catastrophe as were the cities which stood
on this plain, should be long looked upon with fear and
horror. It is a wise provision of our nature that it should
be so. It operates, and no doubt is designed so to do, as
a check to that fearful wickedness that calls down such a
doom. It is not an uncommon thing for people to think
that there is something fearful and gloomy in places where
they know awful crimes have been perpetrated, and on
this principle, perhaps, we may account for the fact that so
many travellers have dwelt on the deep gloom which hung
over the water, and the fearful desolation that reigned over
the whole region. Now to me it did not appear thus; the
shore, the waters, and the lake, had a natural and even a
pleasing appearance       the more so as, from my old habits
of thinking, I expected something of the fearful, if not
terrible. The district was, it is true, rather destitute of
trees and vegetation; but not more so than many districts
that I have seen; not more so than the district from Mount
Olivet to the plain of Jordan, and a very large district near
Damascus, which I noticed in a former letter. There are
more small trees, bushes, canes, and other vegetable growth,
for a quarter of a mile along the shore, than there are on
some districts north-west of Damascus, perhaps ten miles
square, leaving out the narrow slips of land irrigated by
the water of the Bareda. There is quite a cluster of small
trees or shrubs at a point on the edge of the water, where[162]
it is soft and swampy. The question whether there are
any living things in these waters is one that I am not able
to decide from my own observation. I saw none.

There is a small island fifty or a hundred yards from the
shore, rising six or eight feet above the level of the water,
and appears to have some stones at the upper part of it.
We thought we could see most distinctly another island,
far to the south. As similar statements have often been
made, and again contradicted, we looked at it the more
carefully; and our conclusion was, notwithstanding all the
declarations to the contrary, it must be an island, and one
of considerable size, unless connected with the other shore
by a very low neck of land, which the great distance prevented
our seeing: this time will show. It is a singular
fact, that a piece of water, which for ages has excited more
intense interest than any other in the world, should yet be
so little known, and so few should have been found who
have made a serious attempt to explore it. There has not,
as far as I know, been but one boat on the waters of the
Dead Sea for ages, if from the days of Abraham; there
may have been in the days of the Jewish nation, but I
have not seen it confirmed by any writer. Last year an
intelligent Irishman took a boat across from Acre to the
lake of Tiberias, and after amusing himself with it on that
lake, he passed down the Jordan to the Dead Sea, and
spent some days in exploring it. How far he went to the
south, and what discoveries he made, is not known. He
had the misfortune to be taken sick, owing in part, it was
supposed, to his imprudence and useless exposure. With
much difficulty he got back to Jericho, and was then
carried to Jerusalem, where he died. He had taken but
few notes, which were unintelligible to all but himself.
When inquired of concerning his expedition on the Dead[163]
Sea, he declined answering until he should recover, when
he would tell them all about it. But death closed up
the communications for ever. The boat was taken out
and carried up to Jericho, as I have since learned. I did
not know it was there, or I should have ascertained its
fitness for another voyage. Were some one, acquainted
with navigating a small vessel, and capable of taking
soundings and making a proper survey of the lake, to spend
a month or two in doing it, and to publish a full account,
with a correct map of the sea and the coast, he would
confer a very great favour on the Christian world. It
would be so easy of execution, and of so universal interest
when done, that I wonder that none of those men who long
for public fame have not before now thought of it. It
would be a curious matter, were some of the ruins of those
ancient and devoted cities yet to be seen. Several of the
old authors have mentioned them as to be seen in their
day, and it is a current report among the natives that they
are now to be seen beneath the water. Travellers now
begin to pass to the eastern side of the Dead Sea, and visit
Kerek at its south-east corner, and Petra the capital of
ancient Edom.

On our return we took a course much more to the
south, than the road by which we went down       having in
view to visit and spend the night at a celebrated monastery,
the San-Saba, which lies south-east of Jerusalem, and
on the borders of the Engedi region. We therefore ascended
the hills near the north end of the Dead Sea.
Several beds of torrents lay in our route, which, although
now dry, exhibited evidence that they do at times carry
much water into the Dead Sea.

We had a striking proof of how little the people here
knew of the country out of the common track. In ascending[164]
the hills, which were high and steep, and of the same
soft yielding character before described, we had near us, on
our right, a very deep gorge. It struck me that this might
be the Kedron; and on asking our guides they at first
hesitated, but after consultation, agreed that it was. We,
however, found to our satisfaction before we reached
Jerusalem, that this could not be the case, as we left this
hollow far to our right in passing over the hills; and still
found that the Kedron was on our left as we approached
Jerusalem. I could not but often think during the tour
of the expression, "going up to Jerusalem," and "going
down to Jericho." It is down, down, all the way to
Jericho; and up, up, all the way to Jerusalem.

Having reached the top of the first steep ascent from
the Dead Sea, we entered on a more gradual one, which
continued for several hours' travel. Our course was south-west       the
Dead Sea lay to our left, and could be seen
extending far to the south. The district we were passing
over, was almost wholly without trees. There was a little
grass, and some thistles, and an almost innumerable multitude
of snails about the roots of the weeds and small thorn
bushes.

This district appeared to be used only for pasturage.
We saw signs of sheep and goats, and passed one or two
wells, that had recently been used for watering flocks.
This whole district appeared fertile. The rock was a very
soft limestone; but I saw no signs of cultivation, and not
a village was to be seen.

Before we reached the monastery, the night came on       and
our guides became doubtful as to the way. We passed
a grave-yard, but when the people had lived, who had been
interred, no one could tell. After hunting our way for
some time, we concluded that we must be wrong, although[165]
our guide still insisted that we were going in the right
direction. We ought to have yielded to him. The majority,
however, were so confident that our course was
wrong, that we turned back, and took another road, which
we had passed; after following this for some time, we came
to a full halt, as our muleteers affirmed that it was not
the right way. While we were debating the merits of the
case, the horse of one of our guard, who had alighted, got
his foot fastened in some part of his harness, and taking
fright at it, made a most ludicrous affray. The Turkish
soldier, who was previously out of humour with the guide,
on account of his not knowing the way, now lost all
patience; and while his horse was like to break his neck
in floundering, he fell to beating the guide with the but-end
of his gun.

Our whole case was unpleasant. We were lost, and our
guard was likely, in his fury, to injure our guide. We
loudly commanded the peace, and after a little, things
began to look better. The horse broke the straps that had
alarmed him. The soldier ceased beating our guide, and
a muleteer, who had gone out to explore the road, returned
with the assurance that he had found the right one, and
that we were not far from the monastery.

We again set out, and soon reached San-Saba; but there
new trials awaited us. It was now near midnight, and
the gates were shut. We knocked loud and long before
any one took notice of us; at last a small window, above
one of the gates, was cautiously opened, and inquiry made
who we were and what we wanted.

It was too dark for them to see us distinctly; and in our
eagerness to get the gate opened, we all talked and urged
our suit, each in the language which he could best use       English,
Italian, Turkish, Arabic, and Greek, were all[166]
put in requisition. The good fathers were evidently in
doubt of us       who we could be, and wherefore come at
such an untimely hour! All our entreaties did not move
a bar of the gate. We pleaded, which was true, that we
were suffering for water. A small jar of water was let
down by a rope. This was soon emptied       it was let down
a second and third time. This, in some degree, satisfied
our present wants; but our animals were not supplied,
except the horses of our guard, who poured water in their
red caps and gave it to them to drink. The jar was
drawn up, and the window shut, all our entreaties to the
contrary notwithstanding.

We had no alternative but to wait until morning. We
were hungry, but our provisions were exhausted. We
could not cook, for we had no water. We felt a good deal
of displeasure at the fathers who thus refused us admittance.
We lay down at the gate and waited for the morning.
About sunrise, after seeing that we were Franks, and but
few in number, they opened the gates and gave us admittance.
The superior apologised for their refusal to admit
us in the night. He said most of the monks were absent,
it being the season for making their wine       that there were
but a few old men in the monastery       that the district
about them was in a disturbed state       and they did not
know who we were       they knew not but that it might be a
stratagem of some freebooters to get in and rob the monastery       that
had we sent them word from Jerusalem that we
were coming, they would at once have admitted us. I
thought that there was much reason in what they said;
and this, together with the readiness with which they provided
us refreshments, and showed us all parts of their
establishment, made me cordially forgive their seeming
rough treatment in refusing to admit us before.

[167]

The monastery of San-Saba stands on a narrow, deep
ravine. It takes in part of the ridge on both sides, and has
a very high and strong wall, which crosses the ravine at
two places, so as to include the valley for a considerable
distance. In the valley within the walls, is a small spring,
the only one that is near. On the hills are towers connected
with the walls. There are many buildings within,
and rooms sufficient to hold several thousand persons.
There are a number of chapels, several of which are richly
furnished, and they, as well as most of the Greek monasteries
in Jerusalem, have lately received rich presents from
Russia. Above twenty boxes were lately sent to the Greek
church in these regions, filled with rich chandeliers, censers,
crosses, altar cloths, and priests' garments. They showed us
a chapel, in which was a pile of human skulls, said to be
of monks and martyrs. There was an altar before them,
on which religious service seemed to be at times performed.

Most of the chapels had many pictures in them. The
Greeks make much use of pictures in their worship. I was
especially struck with a picture of the Last Judgment.
God was represented as an old man       a fiery stream came
out from before Him. The apostles were acting as judges       the
dead were rising, and a halo of glory was around the
head of the righteous       Peter was opening the gates of
Heaven to the righteous, and the fiery stream was beating
on the wicked, and forcing them into the mouth of a
monstrous serpent.

There were many artificial caves in the sides of the
ravine on which San-Saba stands. These were formerly
inhabited by monks, it is said, but their number now not
being great, they can find accommodation within the
building.

With the history of this monastery I have very little[168]
acquaintance. It is an old institution, but still in good
repair. The whole district about San-Saba, and from that
to the Dead Sea, and I may add from that to near Jerusalem,
is unusually destitute of vegetation.

In several places the rock had the dip, and not unfrequently
veins of flint were seen in the limestone rock, and
in many places the rock was nearly as white and soft as
chalk. The whole district from the foot of Mount Olivet
to the plains of Jordan, and from the end of the Dead Sea
to Jerusalem, past San-Saba, seems not to have been cultivated,
at least in modern times. The soil appears good,
but from some cause it lies neglected; while west and north
of Jerusalem, where the soil does not seem better, and
where there is much more rock on the surface, there are
many villages, and much of the ground is under tillage.

To the south of San-Saba, we saw the Frank mountain.
It rises much above the neighbouring hills       has a sugar-loaf
appearance, and is said to have many ruins on and
about it. Still farther to the south, lie Engedi and Maon,
and a second Mount Carmel, the one referred to in the life
of David. 1 Sam. xxv. 2.




LETTER XV.



Nazareth, October 17, 1836.


We left Jerusalem, and passed northward; and having
in view to visit Nabloos, Samaria, Tiberias, Nazareth,
and many other interesting localities, on our return to
Beyroot.

Our route led us near the tombs of the kings, and I
could not but notice the immense quantities of loose stones[169]
that lay over the district west and north-west of Jerusalem       most
of them are small. They often form immense
piles. What may have caused such banks of them is not
known. Possibly they indicate that buildings were once
spread over this district       or it maybe that much rock has
been taken from the upper stratum, and these piles are the
refuse rock       or it may be that in the many sieges which
Jerusalem sustained, the besieging armies may have collected
them for embankments, or for the purpose of defending
their camps. To the north of Jerusalem there are some
fine orchards of olives. The country is rolling, but not
too much so for cultivation; and we passed a succession of
small plains, which were fertile and under tillage.

At the distance of about six miles, we passed Rama, the
city of Samuel the Prophet. It stood to our left, and on
one of the highest points of the hill country of Judea. It
is now a poor Moslem village, surrounded with groves of
olives and other fruit trees: the Mediterranean sea, and a long
stretch of the plains of Sharon, may be seen from Rama.

Near Rama, and north-west of it, stands Gibeon, the
city of the ancient Gibeonites, who made peace with
Israel under Joshua, and practised a deception on them.
(Joshua ix.) It stands on the top of a small sugar-loaf
hill, and is capable of being made a strong place. It is
now a poor village       several other villages lay to our left,
the names of which I do not now recollect.

To our right we passed several villages, but most of
them lay at some little distance from the road       as Anathoth,
the town of Jeremiah, now a poor Mohammedan
village       Geba, and Gibeah of Saul       Michmash, where
Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines       Rimmon,
in which the Benjamites found refuge when Gideon was
destroyed. (Judges xx. 45.)

[170]

At the distance of ten or twelve miles from Jerusalem
we came to Beer, the town to which Jotham is supposed
to have fled from his brother Abimelech. In approaching
it, we passed over a fine plain, a part of which was under
cultivation; near the town were orchards of olive and other
fruit trees.

We had intended to spend the night here, but we found
several thousand Turkish horsemen encamped on the plain
near the town. They were spread over the whole district
adjoining the springs; and men, horses, camels, and
donkeys, mixed together in the most irregular manner.
Some of the officers and men had tents, but the majority
of the army either had none or did not think it necessary
to pitch them. The town, which is not large, was overrun
with troops. We thought it, on the whole, not best to
lodge with such company, and passed on to Ain-Brood.
This led us past ancient Bethel,       there is now a small
village there, and many ruins that show that it has once
been a place of considerable size. It stands near the top
of the ridge, and commands a fine view of the adjacent
country. It was here that Abraham pitched his tent soon
after entering the land of Canaan       and from this place he
was made to look north and south, and east and west; and
was assured that all the land he saw should be given to
him and his seed. (Gen. xii. 8, and xiii. 3-14.) And
here Jeroboam set up one of the golden calves, and induced
Israel to worship before it. (1 Kings, xii. 29.)

The precise situation of it, which lies a little to the east,
is not known. There are ruins in several places, but a
doubt remains as to which is the site of the city first taken
by the Israelites on the hill country.

The country about Bethel is slightly diversified with
small plains and ridges; it is fertile, and well adapted to[171]
tillage       olive orchards, fruit trees, and vineyards are more
numerous than in most parts of Palestine       the country is,
moreover, better watered than the parts of the hill country
that lie more to the south.

It became dark before we reached Ain-Brood (Cold
Spring). The village of that name stands a little off the
road, on the top of a hill. It is a small place, and has
nothing that distinguishes it, unless it be the excellent vineyards,
and olive-orchards, and fruit trees with which it is
surrounded: to which may be added that a good deal of
labour has been expended in gathering off the stones,
which abound on the surface, and forming low walls around
these vineyards. In some places the rock had been broken
up about as fine as would suit for a Macadamized road,
and earth mixed with it, and thus lots are prepared that
produce fine grapes and fruit trees.

As the night was clear, which is always the case in
Palestine during the summer, we did not take the trouble
to hunt for lodgings; but getting over one of these low
stone fences with our horses, we spread our carpets, and
made our beds under a large fig-tree, and there spent the
night.

Knowing that the company of troops that we had left
at Beer were moving northward, we concluded we would
make an early start, and try and keep before them. In
this, however, we were disappointed. We had not gone
many miles before we saw some horsemen not far behind.
We whipped up our animals, but it would not do; they
gained on us continually: and in a few hours we had them
pouring by us in all the confusion of the Turkish march.
They, however, were perfectly civil, and some of their
officers entered pleasantly into conversation with us.

They had been to the south of Bethlehem, disarming a[172]
tribe of Arabs that frequented the country near the south
end of the Dead Sea; and having accomplished that service
they were returning to the north, where most of them
lived.

They were much scattered, and altogether regardless of
order on their march; and it was several hours before they
all passed us. Between ten and twelve o'clock we descended
a long steep hill into a plain of some extent. Near the
foot of the hill was a spring, and when that came in view
there was a kind of rush made for the water; and it was
a striking spectacle to see such a body of horsemen pouring
down the hill, each trying to be the first, or at least not the
last, to water his horse, and obtain a portion for himself.

We were willing to let the men of war be satisfied before
we approached. They then rode to a fine growth of olive-trees
that covered a part of the plain, and then separating
themselves into small companies, dismounted and placed
themselves and horses in the shade to pass the heat of the
day.

We pursued our journey and passed several villages, and
one or two of a larger size than are usually met with. The
country was more hilly, and intersected with deeper valleys,
than it had been near Jerusalem; but on the whole it was
fertile, and a considerable portion set with vineyards and
orchards, or bearing marks of cultivation. Passing over a
ridge from the plain in which we left the troops, we entered
a wide plain, which ran north and south. The hills which
bounded the plain on our left were of considerable height,
and had several villages on their sides. On the east side
of this plain, the hills were lower, and appeared to become
still more so as we proceeded north. After several hours'
travel along this plain, which was a fine one, and partly
set with cotton, we reached a place where a small plain[173]
came in from the west at right angles. The hill on the
north of this small plain is the Ebal, and that on the south
the Gerezim, of the Scriptures; and this is the place which
Moses pointed out as the place at which the Law was to
be read, while six tribes stood on the one side to say amen
when the blessings were read, and six on the other side to say
amen when the curses were read. (Deut. xxvii. 12-14.)

I do not understand it as meaning that all the people
stood on the top of the mountains; I suppose they were
divided into two parts       one part stood on one side of the
priests, who probably occupied the middle of the plain,
and the other part on the other side, and occupied the
sides of the mountains as far as might be necessary. The
place is most admirably adapted for such a thing; possibly
a more suitable place could not be found. In this plain the
ancient Sychar or Shechem stood. It is now called Nabloos.
It may have 6,000 or 8,000 people; the most of them are
Moslems.

At the mouth of the small plain is shown the piece of
ground Jacob bought when he came from Padanaram, and
which he, at his death, gave to his son Joseph; (Genesis
xxxiii. 19; John iv. 5.) There are some sepulchral monuments
on it; and nearer the city they show what is called
Jacob's well. A little east of the town is a spring, the
waters of which flow eastward; and close to the town, on
the west side, is a fine spring, the waters of which flow
west, and fall into the Mediterranean. There are fine olive
orchards, and other fruit trees about the town, and some
fine gardens, especially on the west of the town.

I saw at the gate of Nabloos eight or ten lepers. They
were covered with spots that looked like raw flesh; had a
most disgusting appearance; they seemed to be shut out
from the city, and were most importunate as beggars.[174]
They were the only lepers that I recollect to have seen in
Palestine.

There are remains of an old Christian church here,
which must have been a most splendid building. The
pillars, and other parts which remain, have a richness of
workmanship about them that excels anything that I saw
in Palestine. Not much of them, however, remains. There
are many indications about the town, and on the mountains,
that a large city once stood here.

Passing west along the narrow plain for a few miles, we
then turned due north, and at the distance of eight or ten
miles, we came to the site of ancient Samaria, the capital
of the kingdom of Israel. The country around it is rocky,
but very fertile. The rock is the soft limestone, which disintegrates
so easily that very little is seen on the surface.
There are about it more extensive orchards of olive and
other fruit trees than are usually met with, and the whole
aspect of the country is fine.

Samaria stood on a low, broad, sugar-loaf hill. It seems
to have been terraced all round, and all the way to the top;
but the terraces were so wide as to admit a row or rows of
houses, and a street. These rose one above another, and,
when filled with houses, must have had a fine appearance.
All are now gone but a few ruins, piles of rock and rubbish,
and a few pillars. This hill is surrounded with a
narrow plain, except at the east side, where a low ridge
connects it with some adjacent hills, which, at a little
distance, border this plain.

Samaria was the seat of great wickedness while the
capital of the kingdom of Israel, and now it lies desolate.
It deserves notice, that the capital of both the kingdoms of
Israel and Judah stood on the hill country, and distant
about forty miles from each other, and each of them about[175]
midway from the Mediterranean to the Jordan. Jerusalem
is on the highest ground, but Samaria on the most
fertile.

North of Samaria, we passed over a high hill. There is
more brushwood on this hill than is usually met with, and
among it some small oaks. On the north of this hill, the
country presented a variegated, rolling surface, with more
natural growth than usual, and a number of small villages
and ruins. Many of the small plains were very fertile,
and we saw some fields of cotton.

As it grew dark, we reached a fine spring of water, and
about it grew a good many fig and olive trees. We spread
our mats and made our beds under one of them, and there
spent the night. A number of other travellers encamped
at the same place, and all slept under the trees in the
open air.

Next morning we pursued our route three or four hours
northward, to the plain of Esdralon; we passed over two
or three plains of considerable extent, separated by hilly
districts. The plains were very fertile, and on some of
them cotton was growing. The hills were low, and on
some of them were small villages, and ruins indicating that
villages or towns had once stood there. In much of this
district the rock was of that soft kind which I have often
mentioned. Many of these hills exhibited remains of the
ancient terrace-work, and showed that, in days past, more
labour was expended on them, and much more of them
were cultivated, than at present.

We at length approached the great plain of Esdralon.
A row of low hills, with small spaces between them, separated
a strip of the plain to the south. This portion was
especially rich; a good deal of it had the appearance of
having once been under water. It looked like the bottom[176]
of a lake, from which the water had been removed. It
being the latter part of the long dry season, the ground
was so shaped in many places, that I really felt a fear that
my animal might step in some of the cracks and fall, or
break a limb. The soil, as seen in the edge of these
cracks, seemed as rich as soil could be.

We reached the edge of the great plain at a considerable
town called Jeneen. It stands on the point of a ridge, a
little above the level of the plain. The similarity of the
name made me think it might be the ancient Jesreel. Its
distance from Carmel would agree with this supposition,
as Ahab passed from Carmel to Jesreel in a part of a day,
when Elisha ran before his chariot. (1 Kings, xviii. 40-46.)
There are ruins about the town which indicate that it may
have been larger in time past than it is now.

There is near this village a large garden spot, well
inclosed, and planted with various trees, which grow so
thriftily as to show how easy it would be, with proper care,
to raise trees of various kinds, in such quantities as greatly
to contribute to the comfort and advantage of the population
of this country.

We passed from Jeneen north-east across the plain. But
a small part of it is cultivated       around its edge a few
villages were to be seen, with their vineyards, olive and
other trees about them. We saw some flocks and herds
on the plain, but not in as great numbers as I had been
led to expect.

To our right the point of a ridge ran out considerably
into the plain. This is Mount Gilboa, on which Saul and
his sons fell in battle against the Philistines. Bethshan,
the village to which the Philistines fastened their bodies,
lies a few miles north-east of the end of this hill. The
battle seems to have begun on the plain, and when overcome,[177]
Israel fled to the hill, and then Saul and his sons
fell. I could not but notice, while looking on the mount
from the plain, how it accorded with the statement, that
the chariots and horsemen followed hard after Saul on
Mount Gilboa. The ascent from the plain is such that
horsemen and chariots might pass up even to the top of
this hill.

The plain of Esdralon may be thirty-five or thirty-six
miles by forty. Our course led us to the east of a rough
and very rocky hill, that rises in the plain a little south-east
of Mount Tabor. As soon as we passed the south-east
corner of this hill we entered on a district that was evidently
volcanic. The lava was very old, and much disintegrated,
so as to make a most excellent soil. This continued
all the way to the edge of the lake. We did, indeed,
for a short distance, as we passed close by the foot of Mount
Tabor, get off, for a short distance, the bed of lava. Mount
Tabor did not to me appear volcanic. I did not, however,
ascend it. It was Saturday afternoon, and wishing to
reach Tiberias to spend the Sabbath, I had not time to
make the ascent. We, however, wound round nearly one-third
of the mountain at its very foot, and examined
the stone that cropt out, and the stone that had rolled
down from its sides, and saw no signs of its being volcanic.
How the matter may appear on its top I know not. There
are ruins there, and as much lava lies on the plain a little
east of Tabor; and as it is used in the buildings of several
villages, the fact that some of it may be found on the top
of the Tabor would not prove that the mountain was volcanic.
It may have been taken up as building stone.
Tabor is a sugar-loaf hill, and rises to a considerable
height. It is supposed that our Lord was transfigured on
this mountain.

[178]

A small branch of the Kishon rises north of the Tabor,
flows east of the mountain, washing its foot, and then runs
south and west, and falls into the Mediterranean Sea at the
north end of Carmel. The Kishon is at best a small
stream; and the branch which we crossed at the foot of
the Tabor was about the size of a good spring.

Near Tabor we passed a small village called Nain, the
place where Christ brought to life the widow's son.

Leaving Mount Tabor, we passed over a high part of
the plain, covered with disintegrated lava. Part of this
plain had been cultivated. It is, perhaps, the most fertile
district in Palestine. In many places the weeds were
nearly as high as a man's head, a thing of rare occurrence
in the East.

The descent to the lake from the level of the plain is
very considerable       I should think from five hundred to
eight hundred feet, opposite the town of Tiberias; at the
southern end of the lake of course it is much less, as the
plain lies like an inclined plane towards the south.

It was night before we reached the town; but we were
readily admitted by the guard of soldiers who kept the
gates. We found some difficulty in finding a place to lodge
in. After employing several persons to look for a place,
and waiting some time, we were conducted to the court of
the Greek church, and told we might lodge there. It
might be called a church-yard. It was a space before the
church, inclosed with a wall, with a gate to it; but all
open to the travellers. It was in part at least paved
with rock. We found other travellers there, with their
animals. As the air was mild, and there was no danger
of rain, the case was not as bad as some might suppose.
We had slept out every night since we left Jerusalem       and
in places not more comfortable than Tiberias. It did[179]
indeed appear rather hard that in the heart of a walled
and garrisoned town we could not find a house to lodge in.

We found a great merry-making going on in the town.
Nearly the whole population were gathered before what
we learned was the governor's palace. On inquiry we
were informed that the merry-making was in honour of
the circumcision of the governor's son. The Moslem religion
has borrowed the rite of circumcision from the Jews;
and they perform it on all their male children       at the age
of thirteen, if I remember right. They usually honour this
occasion with some festivities. They had various kinds of
musical instruments       some that were bad enough in all
reason. They had dancing; and some, especially the
women, made a singular noise, somewhat like a short,
shrill whistle. I was especially struck with one thing
which took place. It was a procession of a considerable
body of persons, who bore torches. I was told that they
were Jews, and did it in honour of the occasion. It reminded
me of the parable of the virgins who took their
lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. (Matt.
xxv.)

In the morning of the Sabbath, before we had dressed
and finished our breakfast, the people began to come to
church. Our situation was even worse than it had been at
Baalbec, where we had to make our toilette on the house-top,
in the face of all who chose to look at us. Here we
were, with men and women, and children, all crowding
about us, and looking and thinking more, I fear, about us
than they did about the church-service that was going on.
We hurried and got things put to rights as soon as we
could, and deemed it proper to be present at their service,
although we could understand but little of it. It consisted
of a great variety of prayers, and crossings, and[180]
bowing before the pictures and kissing them; and reading
portions of God's word.

There was a great want of reverence in the worshippers;
and, for the most part, the reading was so hurried and
indistinct, that not much of it could, I should think, be
understood. The whole of the service was not performed
by the priest himself; from time to time he called on some
one to read portions of the service. At its close, the priest
and a number of his people remained for some time, in part
to look at us and talk to us. We asked him why he did
not preach to the people, and instruct them in religion?
He seemed surprised that we should think this necessary.
We reminded him that the apostles preached and taught
the people; at this he shrugged up his shoulders, and said
somewhat significantly       "Oh! that was before the church
was regulated as it now is." This was getting out of the
difficulty with more tact than we had expected from him.
It must be a bad regulation, however, that sets aside the
preaching of the gospel!

As we were a good deal annoyed with the multitude of
people that came into the court to see us, and as our baggage
was not altogether safe unless we kept a watch over
it, we requested the priest to allow us to take up our quarters
in the church; which he permitted, on our engaging
that we would take care that nothing was injured.

This church is said to be the house of Peter. It is an
old building, with an arched roof, but has no just claims to
an origin so early as the days of the apostles. There is, I
think, another reason given why it is called the house of
Peter, that is, it stands on the place where our Lord
appeared to the disciples, and put the searching question
to Peter       "Lovest thou me?"

Among those travellers who spent the night in the court[181]
of the church, was a sick man for whom we felt most
deeply. He lived near Constantinople, and had visited
the Holy Land as a pilgrim. He had left a family at
home; was well dressed; rode a good horse, and travelled
with a company of the better sort of pilgrims. He had
been unwell for several days; but as his company could
not or would not stop, his great unwillingness to be left
induced him to travel on, when under a raging fever. On
Sabbath morning he was utterly unable to rise       and seldom
have I seen a person that more needed medical aid. We
tried to do what we could for him; but I had not the medical
knowledge which his case called for. While I stood over
him and felt his pulse, he gazed on me with a brightening
countenance; no doubt in the hope that I might give him
relief. He tried to make me understand the nature and
seat of his pain; but he spoke modern Greek, and we had
no one that could interpret; and, moreover, his case was
one that was utterly beyond my skill. Never did I feel
so deeply my need of medical knowledge; never did I feel
more deeply how impotent is man to save his fellow-man.
When I turned from him in despair of doing anything that
would at all benefit him, he seemed to read my feelings;
and never did I see a deeper disappointment than was
expressed in his looks. It seemed to say, You see I am
dying, and yet you do not save me.

We gave him some simples, which might possibly afford
momentary relief. His company had left him. We prevailed
on the Greek priest to take him into his family, and
had him conveyed there. What became of him I know
not. There was little prospect of his living.

The lake is a pretty sheet of clean, fresh water, about
twelve miles long and six miles broad, of an oval shape.
The water deepens very gradually on the western side[182]
where I visited it. I saw many small fish in it; but saw
no means for taking them. It is said, however, that the
Jews have a fishery at the southern part, and take a good
many. I saw but one boat on the lake. It would hold
eight or ten men       it lay off the town       but I saw no one
in it during the time I was there.

The banks of the lake were more precipitous on the
eastern than on the western side; and as it seems to have
been on the eastern side that our Lord healed the demoniac,
and permitted the devils to enter the swine, I could not
but think that it did argue that the swine were possessed,
that the whole herd should leap from the top of such a
precipice into the sea.

The town of Tiberias stands on the western side, about
mid-way of the lake, and on the edge of the water; it is
walled, and has a small garrison in it. The population is
but a few thousand, possibly not above 3,000. Most of
these are Moslems; there are a few Christians of the Greek
church, and a small number of Jews.

The whole district about the lake, as far as I saw it, is
volcanic. The walls of the town, and of most of the houses
are built of lava, and most of the rock that lies about the
town, and the bottom of the lake is lava. There is
a mixture of limestone among it; for the whole district is
based on limestone. The volcanic district extends north of
the lake, and also far to the east of the Jordan, according
to my best information.

There were originally many towns about this lake       most
of them have disappeared; and the very sites of Chorasin,
and Bethsaida, and Capernaum, on which the Lord pronounced
a woe, are not with certainty known.

The Jordan rises some distance to the north-east of
Tiberias, and passes through another small lake called the[183]
waters of Merom. It was by it that Joshua defeated the
second confederacy of kings. (Joshua ii. 5.) Passing through
this lake, the Jordan enters the lake of Tiberias at the
north-east corner, and leaves it at the south end, and passes
through the plain of Jordan from sixty to eighty miles, and
falls into the Dead Sea. There is no outlet to this sea.
The waters are carried off, as is supposed, by evaporation.

There is a fine district of country, it is said, about the
waters of Merom, and formerly the towns of Cesarea and
Philippi stood there.

North of lake Tiberias, and on the top of a high mountain
in sight, stands Safet, a town of considerable size.
This is one of the sacred cities of the Jews; and more Jews
are found here than in any place in Palestine. The whole
district about it is volcanic, and has been a good deal disturbed
by earthquakes. On the western side of the lake,
and a mile or two south of the town, are some copious
springs of warm salt water. They are so hot as to require
to be tempered when used for bathing. There is a good
bathing-house, and a considerable resort here for that purpose.
On the east side of the lake, and a little from it, is
another spring of warm water; and, if I was rightly
informed, there is another west of the lake, and I think on
some part of the hills near Mount Tabor. The whole
district is a good deal subject to earthquakes, and gives
evidence of internal fires.

The road from Tiberias to Nazareth runs nearly west;
and the distance maybe about twenty or twenty-five miles.
At the distance of six or eight miles, we passed a low hill
to our right, with two little elevations on it; this is called
the Mount of Beatitudes. It would afford a very good
place to take a seat and address a large assembly collected
on the plain below. We cannot be certain, however,[184]
as to the sermon on the mount having been preached
here.

Our road passed north of Mount Tabor, and the range
of hills called the hills of Nazareth. The plain over which
we passed was fertile. It was uneven on its northern side,
where the ridges of the Anti-Lebanon shut it in. We
passed several villages, both to our right and left, but most
of them were at a distance, and their names did not accord
with those of the Bible. But a small part of the plain was
cultivated. A few miles before reaching Nazareth, we came
to Cana of Galilee, the place where our Lord turned water
into wine. It is a small village, and has nothing that gives
it much interest, except the above fact.

At a large well below the town, we saw a fine sample
of their mode of drawing water, and pouring it into troughs,
and allowing their flocks and herds to come up in succession
and drink. Thus the shepherds were engaged as we
passed the well. They allowed us to ride up, and let our
animals drink of the water which they had drawn.

Cana lies on the north side of the hills of Nazareth, and
Nazareth lies on the south side, a mile or two farther to
the west. This range of hills is not high, and Nazareth is
built on the side of it, and, in part, on a little level space
that is somewhat elevated above the small plain that
spreads out before it. A ridge of the hills runs to the
south-east, so as nearly to shut out Nazareth from a view
of the great plain in which it stands.

Nazareth is one of the best built towns that I saw in
Palestine. At its east end, and on the edge of the little
plain that lies before it, is a spring or well; and here, it is
said, the angel appeared to Mary; and here she often came,
accompanied by the infant Saviour, to draw water for
family use.

[185]

There is a church over the place that is shown as the
house of Mary, and adjoining it is a Latin convent. We
lodged in this convent, and were kindly entertained. There
was a paper in our room, stating that the convent was
authorised and required by the Pope to receive all persons
who were devoutly visiting the holy places, and entertain
them three days; after which, it was expected, that such
persons would pass on their way. The church was the best
we saw in Palestine; the organ was good, and well played;
and the religious service was, on the whole, better conducted
than any one I had seen in Syria.

Near the middle of the church, a wide flight of stairs
descends for about twelve or fourteen feet; there stands an
altar. Passing a door, we entered a small room, in which
is another altar. On both of these, religious service appears
at times to be performed. Passing through another door,
we were in a low cave, that has been hewn out of the soft
limestone rock. The wall on all sides is rough; made so,
perhaps, by the pilgrims breaking off pieces of the rock to
carry home as holy earth. This is shown as the room in
which Mary lived and raised the infant Saviour. It did
not appear to me a comfortable place for a residence; and
I could not but think that Joseph must have loved his
wife, and prized the privilege of raising the Messiah, to
such a degree as to have induced him to provide for them
a more suitable place. The whole appearance of the place
was, in my view, against its being the true locality. We
know they lived at Nazareth, but as to the precise spot,
the Bible is silent, and we are left in doubt.

They show the synagogue in which our Lord read the
law; and, a little out of town, they show the precipice over
which the enraged people wished to cast him. The situation
of the town on the hill, and the height of the hill, agrees[186]
with the account recorded, but which is the precise spot
may not be perfectly certain. They show also the shop in
which Joseph followed his trade, with some other things
that need not be specified.




LETTER XVI.



Beyroot, Oct. 23d, 1836.


We left Nazareth by the same road that we entered it;
but on reaching the top of the ridge north of the town we
took a north-west direction into the plain which we had
left, which is here broken with hills, and can hardly be
said to be continuous. Some of these hills are very much
covered with rocks. After a few miles we passed, on the
top of a hill on our left, the ruins of Sefora, which was at
one time a place of note. There is more natural growth
on these hills than on those more to the east. This district
is stony; but appears to have had more labour bestowed
on it than most of those that are better adapted for
cultivation. The plain of Zebulun, a little farther on, is
separated from the great plain by some hills, which are,
however, not very high. It is a most lovely and fertile
district. On one side of it were many olive-trees, and a
part of it was cultivated with cotton. The cotton appeared
to have had but little labour bestowed on it, and promised
a corresponding small return, notwithstanding the fertility
of the plain. Between this place and the plain on the
coast, and lying between Acre and the hills, we crossed a
considerable distance that was hilly; the hills were not
very high, but spread pretty generally over the face of the
country. Most of them have more or less rocks on the[187]
surface, but, as a general thing, they are not so rocky as the
country about Jerusalem. From this low hilly district we
entered the plain which lies east of Acre, and spreads along
the coast. This is a noble plain of considerable extent,
and is generally exceedingly fertile. On entering this
plain we saw Acre, nearly before us, on the shore of the
sea. A little to the right of the city, and out near the
middle of the plain, were some good-looking buildings with
gardens about them, and others partly finished. I have
seldom seen a finer set of orange and lemon trees. There
is an aqueduct that brings water from the hill, across the
plains, to Acre. This water is used for watering the
gardens, which, we were given to understand, belong to
Ibrahim Pasha. At some distance to our left, we had the
north end of Mount Carmel in view, with the Latin
monastery on the top of it. Between us and that point
was a fine spread of plain, which might be called either
the plain of Acre or the plain of Esdralon. This plain, as
I have before stated, crosses the whole district from the
lake of Tiberias and the Jordan to the Mediterranean. It
comes to the coast directly at the north end of Carmel, and
there the plain is a wide and noble one. The plain of
Esdralon, on the eastern side, is higher, except at the south-east
corner near Gilboa. It lies toward Safet, a high,
rolling table land, most of which is exceedingly rich. The
Lebanon, or rather the Anti-Lebanon, (for I think the
Lebanon may be considered as terminating north of the
river Leantes, which comes out of the Bokar near Soor,)
lowers down at the high points near Safet, and spreads its
still lowering ridges towards the middle and western part
of the plain, between the lake Tiberias and the Mediterranean.
There are various hills, rather separated from
each other, on the plain, which may be considered as[188]
belonging to it,       the Tabor, the mount south of it, and
the hills near Nazareth; but the terminating ridges are
more continuous, north and north-west of Nazareth, and
run down south, so as to narrow the western side of the
plain of Esdralon. I doubt not, indeed, that the mountains
which rise south of the plain, and cover the whole middle
district, from north of Sebaste to south of Hebron, forming
the hill country of Israel and Judah, may with propriety
be considered as the southern continuance of the great
Lebanon chain. It is there lowered down much, and is
more spread out, and more like an elevated table land, with
many low hills covering its general surface.

It would have been highly satisfactory to me could I
have proceeded to the north of Safet, far enough at least
to see the southern end of the plain of the Bokar, and
ascertain how the mountains, Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon,
dispose of themselves and their branches at that place, and
in their further progress south. I am inclined to think,
that our usual maps are not very accurate in their delineations
of this northern district.

Acre stands on a sandy point which projects out in the
Mediterranean. It is strongly fortified, having a most
stupendous wall, and a deep ditch. It is a place of great
strength, and is under the keeping of a considerable body
of the Pasha's troops. There was some shipping there,
but not much. The city is much crowded together; and
to be comfortable ought to be spread over twice or thrice
as much ground       the streets narrow and filthy       the
bazaars poor, and badly supplied with goods. There is a
large open square within the city, which appeared appropriated
for the use of troops and cavalry. A new bazaar
was pointed out, which was said to have been put up by
the present pasha. It was, compared with the others,[189]
pretty good; but needed that comparison to make it pass
muster. Acre is interesting from its location on the coast       has
a fine back country, and, under a proper government,
might become a place of some importance. A great effort
was made by the French, under Buonaparte, to take this
place. He attempted several times to carry it by assault,
and it was mainly owing to the efforts of Sir Sidney Smith
that he failed. The name of Smith is still held in great
respect by the natives of this region. They say of him,
that "his word was like the word of God       it never fell to
the ground," that is, he always did what he said he would
do. So true is it, that while people tell falsehoods themselves       and
the people of this country have no little propensity
that way       they still have a regard for those who
are known to adhere strictly to the truth. This place was
long held by the Crusaders, and was one of the last places
in Palestine that was wrested from them; and there may
be, and no doubt are, ruins in the town and vicinity that
may be referred to the period of their power. I had not
time, however, to make much research respecting them.
The pasha has some public works going on here. We saw
a good deal of timber in an open square, but did not learn
the use it was intended for       probably for the building of a
vessel, from its size and appearance. We lodged in the
Latin convent, which is a place of some size, and would
contain many persons, though much out of repair. We
found only two or three monks, and a lay brother, who
appeared to act as steward, servant, factotum,      c.

From Acre we went along the coast, towards Soor, the
ancient Tyre, which lies about twenty-five miles to the
north. The first part of our route was over the noble plain by
which Acre is bounded on the west. It is, as to its general
character, good; and ought, and would, if properly cultivated,[190]
richly supply Acre with bread-stuff and many other
necessary articles. Much of it, however, lies in a neglected
state. In several places there are small districts, that are
more improved       a few garden spots that are beautiful,
and several elevations near Acre that have buildings or
ruins on them, and were, probably, in the days of warfare,
places of much more importance than they now are. About
three hours' travel brought us to the termination of this
beautiful plain, and we began to ascend a high promontory
called Capo Blanco, or White Cliff, from the whiteness of
the rock of which it is composed. This is made up of the
softest limestone I have ever seen, interspersed with nodules
of flint. It was well for our nerves that a barrier had
been left between us and the precipice, for sometimes there
was a perpendicular descent from the road above, to the
sea below, which was dashing and foaming at its base.
From this point, or ridge of hills, we entered the plain of
Soor. This plain is narrow at first, but gradually spreads
out, and presently has a wide extent, with a gentle rising
of its eastern side into hills, with mountains towering
beyond. The soil is rich and productive. There are some
villages, on the hills, but none of any size. We passed
several places near the shore where there had evidently
once been villages; in one or two of these there were
remains of walls and other relics of former habitations.
As we approached Soor, the mountains and hills fell back,
making a kind of amphitheatre; rising more or less, as it
approached the mountains; but forming a rich and valuable
back country to this former mistress of the sea. Night
came on before we could reach Soor, and a small part of
the district nearest the town, was, of course, not subjected
to that close inspection which, under other circumstances, it
would have received. We passed a fine flow of water, on[191]
which there appeared to be mills or other buildings; but
it was too dark to allow us a clear view of what they were.
There are, it is said, several remains of ruins on the south
of the town, which the darkness prevented our seeing. As
we approached the town, there was a much wider border
of sand along the coast.

Soor stands on the point of a projection that runs out, it
may be, a half or three quarters of a mile into the sea. Its
outer part is broader and less covered with sand than the
neck of land that joins it to the main land. About half
way from the main land to the extreme point, a wall crosses
the isthmus, and through a single gate in that wall, you
enter the village which stands on the extreme point. The
site of old Tyre was, as we learn from history, on the main
land. When hard pressed, the inhabitants, availing themselves
of their shipping, moved their more valuable articles
to this point, which was then an island, and there built a
town, and escaped the capture which threatened them.
This first capture of Tyre, and the escape of the people with
their riches to the island, is referred to in Ezek. xxix. 18;
where the army of Nebuchadnezzar is said "to have served
a hard service, and yet to have got no wages"       failed to
obtain the wealth of the captured city. The new city was
also taken in after-times by Alexander the Great; and his
army had a hard service. Being on an island, and having
command of the sea through their vessels, they braved the
power of the Grecian king for a time. But he resorted to
a stratagem which was successful. He constructed a wide
causeway from the main land to the island, and thus made
a way for his soldiers, who soon took the city. For centuries
past, as all travellers during that period assure us, it
has been almost completely desolate. The old site on the
main land is so now       not one house, and scarcely a vestige[192]
remains to mark the spot. It is scraped as a rock, and
probably was thus treated by Alexander, to get materials
for the stupendous causeway he made. The city, on what
was once an island, was also almost wholly forsaken, as
many travellers assure us, and thus the prophecy has had
its fulfilment. There is, however, a new village growing
up on its site. It has much increased within a few years.
There may be between one and two hundred houses, the
quarter part of them very miserable things, but a few tolerably
good for this region. The pasha has established
some factories here, and the place is evidently reviving.
Three or four of the European powers have consuls residing
here, and the Americans have a consular agent. The old
harbour, which once contained the first trading ships in the
world, lies on the north side of the town, and was once
surrounded by a strong wall, some small fragments of which
still remain. The harbour is much filled up, so that only
vessels of small burden can come within it. It does not,
indeed, appear to have much trade of any kind. The water
at the extreme point of the island is very shallow       a considerable
space barely covered with water. There are
some ruins on a part of this, and some fallen pillars       whether
it was once covered with houses, I am unable to say.
To the south, the water is deeper, but still so shallow as
to oblige vessels to lie off at a considerable distance from
the shore. The neck which joins the island to the main
land is little else than a bed of sand. The part next the
village, and without the wall I have mentioned, is full of
old walls, mounds, cellars, and all the indications of having
once been covered with houses. There are, indeed, one or
two huge old buildings still standing on it. The part of
this neck adjoining the main land is so low as to have considerable
pools of water in it. We passed a number as we[193]
coasted along the edge of the sand from the south, on
approaching the village. There is all the appearance that
the water once came out to the steep bank at the edge;
but the passage between the island and the main land being
stopped, the sand, both to the north and south, has been
thrown up so as to form a wide, flat beach, extending out
near the island as far as what was formerly the east
side of the island. The whole space here shows great
changes.

The most remarkable and interesting relic of antiquity
which I saw at Soor, was the remains of the church of
Origen. It stands at the south side of the village, and
makes part of the wall at that place. Much the larger
part of it is fallen and removed. The remaining fragments
show that it has been of very great size. There are a few
small huts on the ground on which that part of the church
that has been removed stood. There is some richly-wrought
stone in the walls and about the stairs that run
up at one part of the building. The stone is the soft spongy
limestone which abounds on this coast, and I may add,
through most of Palestine. It is a stone that works easily,
but wastes away under the action of water, and is especially
liable to be saturated with water, and to form damp
walls. No part of the ruins of this old and celebrated
church more interested me, than the stupendous granite
pillars which were once connected with it, but now lie on
the ground, and some of them almost buried in it, and by
the ruins which covered this quarter. These pillars were
of the fine Egyptian granite, of great length and thickness.
They formed masses of stone of a most enormous weight.
We seldom saw pillars of a larger size. There must have
been some regard for Christianity at Tyre when its citizens
erected this splendid edifice. But oh! what changes[194]
have passed over these lands since those days, when Origen
ministered here, and raised his voice to the thousands which
this church was capable of holding. A deep darkness now
rests on all these regions       the Moslem rules, but his pride
is humbled       his strength broken       and he appears conscious
that the day of his glory is past, and not likely again to
return! The few Christians that are now found in these
regions have lost the spirit of Christianity. It is with them
a body without a soul       a form, and a greatly altered form,
without the spirit and power which makes it a transforming
principle among mankind. But the darkness is passing
away       rays of light are breaking upon these regions       and
we doubt not the day is not far remote when the religion
of Christ will, in its enlightening and transforming
power, revisit these regions, and make them revive and
flourish like the garden of the Lord.

From Soor we made our next stage to Saida, the ancient
Sidon, which is so often mentioned in connection with Tyre       "Tyre
and Sidon." It is a day's travel distant. We
found the northern part of the plain of Soor not much different
from the southern, which we have already described.
In many places along this coast, there are old mounds of
rubbish, or piles of stones, that bespeak former buildings.
On the whole, ancient Tyre had a fertile district adjoining
it, and was, no doubt, more or less the seaport for the
lower part of the great valley of the Bokar, through the
passage on the borders of the river Leantes, which flows out
of that valley and passes into the sea a little north of Soor.
The district of mountains that border the plain must also
have contributed its share to the market of this port; for
in these countries and among these nations, the mountain
districts are often better cultivated than the plain, and are
occupied by a more enterprising and efficient people. About[195]
midway from Soor to Saida, a ridge of hills comes into
the shore, much like the one between Acre and Soor. The
plain is superseded by a rough and hilly district. It is, for
a short distance, exceedingly rough and rocky, and for a
still greater space, the level along the shore is narrow and
much covered with sand. Gradually the plain opens, and
spreads out to a considerable extent, and becomes one of
the finest plains, when taken in connection with the low
ridges of hills that bound it, and from the rising ground
towards the mountains, that I have seen on the coast. The
several ridges of low hills that lie between the level space
along the shore and the high mountain range, are finely
covered with a soft, rich soil; and have scattered over them
more trees than we usually see on this part of the coast.
The plain about Soor was rather barren of trees       this was
one of its greatest defects       that of Saida is much better
furnished. We passed several streams of water and some
small villages, on the low hills to our right. The mulberry-tree,
which we had but seldom seen to the south,
here made its appearance. We passed some considerable
districts covered with them. This shows the limits of the
silk-making district. The culture of the mulberry, and
raising the silkworm, is a main business all through these
mountains about Beyroot; how far north it may extend, I
am not able to say; but we had ample proof in our tour
that it is not much, if at all attended to in the land of
Palestine, properly so called.

Back of Saida, among the low hills that border the foot
of the Lebanon range, Lady Hester Stanhope has her
residence. She was engaged to be married to Sir John
Moore, who fell near Corunna, in the Peninsular war, in
the contest which the English had with the French. That
Lady Hester Stanhope felt the affliction most deeply, may[196]
well be supposed; other matters tending to alienate her
affections from England, she came to the East, and has for
many years made her home in the mountains near Saida.
She has gained the affections of the native population, and
has had great influence over them formerly; her power is
now on the wane. She is occasionally visited by foreigners,
but does not see all who would call on her, as some of
them have made statements about her that gave her displeasure.

Saida, like most of the towns on this coast, stands on a
sandy point that projects out a short distance into the sea.
It is surrounded with gardens, and has more fruit trees
about it, and a greater extent of groves, than any of the
towns on the coast south of this, that I have visited. The
plain about it appears peculiarly adapted to fruits. The
town is walled, and has a garrison of soldiers. The houses
are old, as you may suppose; the streets narrow, crooked,
and dark, from the fact that many of them are, in many
places, arched over; so much so, that you are nearly one
half of your time passing under arches, which shut out all
the light but that which comes in from the end of these
narrow, crooked streets. I have often mentioned narrow,
crooked streets, and once more repeat it, with the addition
of dark. The bazaars and markets are much as those at
Soor and Acre, poor, and badly supplied. On the whole,
while the outside of the town had a most lovely appearance,
the inside was the reverse. The harbour appeared
mean, and not such as would give any recommendation to
the place. The distance from Saida to Beyroot is between
twenty and twenty-five miles. For some miles north of
Saida, the road is much covered with sand, and the whole
district, until near Beyroot, resembles that already described,
some parts rocky, and others good, and well adapted to[197]
tillage. A few small villages are scattered along the coast.
As we approached Beyroot, we took a road through the
olive-grove, and not by the sands. This gave me a more
perfect knowledge of the extent of the plain, south-east of
Beyroot, and of the large orchards that lie in that quarter,
covering miles, and bordering the lower part of the hills.
The plain is more fertile, and more thickly settled, than I
had at first supposed.

We found our friends at Beyroot well,       the mission
families had returned from their summer residence on the
mountains, and were engaged in carrying on their various
operations in and about Beyroot. At first view it appears
a rather untoward circumstance that they have to resort
to the mountains during a part of each summer. It must,
no doubt, in some degree interrupt the thread of their
operations; but the climate makes it necessary, especially
until they are well acclimated. The evil, however, is not
so great as might be expected. The mountains are full of
villages; indeed, the mountains of Lebanon are the most
populous districts in these countries. The missionaries
take their station in some of these villages, and when their
number will admit they occupy two or more. There they
usually open schools, mix with the people, distribute the
Scriptures and other books, talk and preach, as the nature
of the case will admit. Thus village after village becomes
personally acquainted with the missionaries, and persons
are brought within the hearing of the truth who might
never be reached by the sound of the gospel were the missionaries
always to remain in Beyroot. Thus what in one
respect may seem an evil and a drawback to their work,
in another is beneficial, and contributes to the furtherance
of the gospel.

I have much reason to bless God for his kind care over[198]
me during the tour I have now finished, and hope that I
shall be led by it more and more to realise that it is only
His hand that keepeth me, and maketh me to go out and
come in in safety.




LETTER XVII.



Beyroot, December 18, 1836.


I think I have mentioned in several of my letters, that
the mulberry tree is much cultivated in this region, principally
for the raising of the silk-worm. At times vegetables
are raised on the same lot, but generally nothing else is
allowed to grow among them, and the weeds are carefully
removed. The trees are planted in rows, and the plough
is passed among them several times in the year. I now
find that the tree serves another purpose, and one of some
importance, though secondary to the making of silk. They
gather the leaves from the trees in the fall and beginning
of winter, to feed their sheep and cows. The first crop of
leaves is eaten by the silk-worms; by the time the worms
begin to spin their silken shrouds, the trees are nearly bare;
the branches are then all cut close to the body of the tree,
and used for fuel. In a few days new branches shoot out,
which are soon covered with leaves. They gather the
leaves with their hands, put them in baskets, and give
them to their sheep and cows. They appear, indeed, to
be the chief food of these animals for many months in the
autumn and beginning of winter. The entire absence of
rain during the long hot summer burns up what grass
may have been on the ground in the spring and early part
of the summer, but the mulberry trees, which have much
care taken of them, and watered, when it can be done, by[199]
a channel from a stream, or by the hand, retain their greenness,
and serve the important purpose of food for the cattle.
So far as I have observed, they were always fed with the
green leaves, at least I have not seen any dried and preserved
in that state, excepting the fibres of the new leaves,
that the silk-worm rejects, which are carefully collected
and preserved for the animals. The mildness of the climate
causes the leaf to retain its freshness much longer than it
would in the northern and middle parts of the United
States. We have entered on the month of December, and
yet the leaf of the mulberry is as green and fresh as it was
in midsummer; true, most of the trees near us are nearly
bare, not, however, by the fall of the leaf, but by their
having been gathered for the animals. The horses, mules,
and donkeys, are fed with barley and straw, which is cut
fine by their mode of threshing out the grain. For a few
weeks in the spring of the year they are kept on the green
barley. I have generally seen the camel fed on weeds,
which are gathered for that purpose.

I mentioned that some rain fell, about the time I set out
on my tour to Jerusalem. The showers were light, and
but few of them. Small showers fell from time to time
during the month that I was travelling, but not in such quantities
as to give us much annoyance. This was a matter
greatly to our comfort, as we had to sleep nearly every
night out under the canopy of heaven, and as we wished to
travel without much incumbrance, we did not carry a tent
with us. During the month of November there was a
great increase of clouds and cloudy weather, but not much
rain. There were, however, occasional showers, and some
of them fell in snow on the upper parts of Mount Lebanon.
It was not until the first part of the present month that it
began to rain in good earnest, and for some days it has[200]
rained as if the "windows of heaven" were opened; great
quantities of water have fallen, and the earth, thirsty from
the long, dry summer, seems to drink it in as if it would
never say       It is enough. Still, I have not yet seen a long,
cloudy period, as we often have in the United States, of
many days and weeks, in which the sun is seldom seen.
Not a day has past in which it has not contrived to find
some opening in the clouds through which to show itself.
Indeed, the rain generally comes in showers; large masses
of black clouds are driven over us, often with strong winds
accompanied with thunder and lightning, and pour down
water as if from buckets; then there is an intermission,
and possibly the sun shines forth, and then comes another
cloud loaded with water, which it pours out and passes
away. Thus, "the clouds return after the rain." For a
day or two the rains have ceased, and the weather is fine,
a little colder and more chilly, as might be expected from
the great fall of water, but not to the degree that I
expected. The higher parts of Mount Lebanon are covered
with snow. They have a singular appearance, two or
three thousand feet of the top, especially the highest peak,
called the Sunneen, is covered with snow, while the lower
parts are bare. Snow may be found at all times on some
of these high points, from whence it is brought down
during the summer in considerable quantities, for the use of
those who will pay the pretty good, though not unreasonable
price, that is asked for it. The rains have caused the
grass to spring forth, and whole districts that were before
dry dust, or stubble, are now fresh with verdure. The
face of the land looks like spring, so wonderfully does the
rain operate to give beauty and fertility to the earth. The
heat without the water will not do it, nor the water without
some degree of heat; but when both are united, they[201]
make vegetation spring forth, and give food for man and
beast.

The troops which marched from this place to the Houran,
a few months since, have returned. It is now said they
were sent there to aid in killing the young locusts, which
had appeared in great numbers, and threatened to destroy
the crops. Last year the troops were thus employed
towards Aleppo, and with great advantage to the country.
It is, however, a new kind of warfare for a regular army
to be engaged in.

It would be inexcusable in me to omit mentioning honey,
an article still to be obtained in abundance, and which
deserves notice for its delicious flavour. Bees are kept in
various parts of the country. Milk can generally be
obtained without much difficulty, although it may be said
of it, as of honey, that the land does not literally "flow"
with it. The Arabs, I think, do not often use milk in a
fresh state: they convert it into an article called lebban,
not unlike bonny-clabber, and eat it with rice, bread,      c.
Some cheese is made, but of an inferior kind; it is generally
white, and made in small pieces. A considerable
quantity is imported from Cyprus. The process of churning
in skins I have before alluded to; most of the butter
thus produced is boiled, and thereby converted into more
of an oily substance. It is much used in cooking, but the
Arabs do not spread it upon their bread, as is our custom.
In the spring, the produce of the churn can be procured in
Jerusalem and its vicinity without having been boiled;
this, by picking out the hairs, washing thoroughly, and
salting, can be made very palatable.

The Irish potato, as it is usually called, is grown about
Tripoli, and succeeds well. It is of a good size, dry, and
of a good flavour. The sweet potato is not known in this[202]
country; this is much to be regretted, as there is reason
to believe that the soil and climate would suit it, and it
would be a most valuable addition to the vegetables already
cultivated. I hope that some one will make an effort to
introduce it. The principal vegetables are the cabbage,
cauliflower, onion, cucumber, lettuce, and radish, which
are all of an excellent quality; the coosa, a small kind of
squash; beans of an inferior kind; bammey, a mucilaginous
pod, which, when cooked with butter and the juice of a
lemon or pomegranate, forms a very pleasant article;
addice, a kind of bean much used in a dried state; turnips
of a diminutive size and an inferior quality; bateinjan, a
kind of egg-plant much esteemed by the natives; beets of a
superior kind, and tomatoes of a rich and fine flavour. The
first notice that I ever met with of the sugar-cane was in
the account of the crusaders, who found it on this coast, and
it is here yet. Below Sidon, there are places where it is
cultivated, but not for making sugar. When ripe, it is
cut and brought from time to time into the towns, and sold
in the stalk. The people buy it and chew the stalk;
children especially are fond of it. Boat-loads of it are
brought up to Beyroot, and sold in the market. Much of
the sugar used here comes from France, and is the fine
loaf-sugar made from the beet, and is sold cheap; brown
sugar, the product of the West Indies, may be occasionally
procured. The flour which is used here comes in part
from Damascus, but more from the plain that lies between
the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon. Some of the wheat is
grown on the mountains, and a good deal comes from about
Acre, and from some other quarters. Much of the flour,
however, is ground in the neighbourhood, and the bran
separated from the flour with a common sieve. I know
not that there is such a thing as a bolting-cloth in the whole[203]
country. Meal made of Indian corn is usually found in
the market at Beyroot, and is called smeed. It is much
used in the Frank families, not, however, in the form of
bread, but in that of hasty-pudding, here called smeed.
Very good French flour may at times be had, and sometimes
wheat is brought from Constantinople, raised probably
about the Black Sea. Rice forms a considerable
article of diet, and is brought from Egypt.

The principal meat used is mutton, which is certainly
the best I have ever eaten. The beef is poor, and is not
much prized by the natives; and pork is an abomination
to most of the people in this land. I have seen a few
swine, but am told they are kept by foreigners. The
chickens are mostly small, and not much encumbered with
fat. Geese and turkeys are exceedingly rare. Great
quantities of sparrows are found in the towns, and they
sometimes visit the houses, and build about them to such
a degree as to become an annoyance. The singing of birds
is not often heard in Palestine; there are a few species of
birds with a gaudy plumage, but their notes are not melodious.
The sweet, plaintive note of the nightingale is
sometimes heard, but oftener the harsh cawing of the
crow. But few wild animals are now found in the country,
excepting the jackals, immense numbers of which are
found in this vicinity. They are gregarious, and a most
noisy animal. They are like a small dog, with short,
upright ears, and a short tail; all that I have seen were of
a light-brown colour. We often hear them in the gardens
and near our houses.

The natives have a taste for flowers; the females cultivate
a variety in pots, and are fond of ornamenting their
turbans with them. They are generally decked with a
profusion of them on their bridal days. They also place[204]
them about and upon the dead bodies of their friends, as
mementos of affection. It is a common saying, that, in
making their visits, they never go empty-handed. At such
times, it is not uncommon for them to take from their
pockets, an appendage with which each person seems to be
furnished, either an orange, a sweet lemon, a few nuts, a
piece of sugar-cane, or something of the kind, and present
the person visited. At other times, they will bring you a
beautiful nosegay of rosebuds, carnation pinks, geraniums,
jessamines,      c., which they arrange and tie together very
tastefully. A rich profusion of wild flowers are found in
the spring.

It is amusing to one not accustomed to the sight, to
observe how partial the people are to a sitting posture.
You may see the blacksmith sitting and hammering his
iron; the carpenter sitting and hewing his wood, or planing
his plank; the merchant sitting and selling his goods;
and the women sitting and washing their clothes,       not
sitting on chairs, or on benches, but á-la-turque, with their
feet folded under them.

Having remained in Palestine as long, and even longer
than I originally intended, I was about preparing to leave
this place for Egypt, when Mr. W. M. Thomson, one of
the missionaries, called on me as a committee, in behalf of
the station. He informed me that he had held a consultation
with Mr. Hebard about carrying on the mission work,
and had come to the conclusion that part of it must be
suspended for the present, unless I remained to assist them.
They had little expectation that Mr. Bird, then in America,
from the peculiar circumstances of his family, would be able
to return; that Mr. Smith, then in Smyrna, would probably
visit the United States before his return to Beyroot,
and could not be expected back under a year or two; that[205]
he himself had just begun to preach in Arabic, and that
the labour of preparing for it, superintending the press,
with other necessary calls, gave him full employment; that
Mr. Hebard had the High School to superintend, and
wished much to give a course of lectures on natural science,
which the opposition now made to the school made it very
important he should do; but that he could not do this,
and keep up the English preaching, which many circumstances
rendered it important should not be suspended;
and in this state of things, they laid the case before me, to
see if I would not remain and assist them. I considered
the case as a strong one; and after looking at the whole
matter, I have concluded that I will remain for a time. I
may, therefore, write you again from this place.




LETTER XVIII.



Beyroot, May 29th, 1837.


On the first day of the new year, (the orientals follow
the old style, which is twelve days later,) about four o'clock
P.M., while we were assembled at the Mission-house, and
engaged in celebrating the Lord's Supper, there was a very
severe earthquake; at first a sudden shock, then a momentary
pause, then a rocking motion, so that the arms of
nearly every person were involuntarily extended to preserve
their balance. It was preceded by a dull murmuring sound.
The sound and motion seemed to proceed from the north.
There had been for several days a haziness of the atmosphere
which is unusual; no rain had fallen since the first
of December, and the ground had become dry for this season
of the year. The haziness increased considerably about[206]
the time of the first shock, and part of the sky was covered
with a fleecy cloud, in some places of a dark appearance.
This was very unusual in the region. There were several
slight shocks during the night. It did not do much injury
in Beyroot, excepting cracking some of the houses; but
Safet, Tiberias, and many other villages were almost
entirely destroyed, and many lives lost. A meeting of the
Franks was held, to see what could be done for these suffering
villages; a collection was made, and Messrs. Thomson
and Calman appointed as a committee to visit and aid them.
I would gladly have accompanied them, and made observations
for myself, but the circumstances of the mission
rendered it inexpedient for Mr. T. and myself to be absent
at the same time. Slight shocks of earthquakes were frequent
for ten or twelve days, and the people were much
alarmed. Many have feared to sleep in their houses. A
Jew at Damascus prophesied that the whole coast from
Sidon to Antioch would be destroyed. The governor,
believing, very properly, that he was an impostor, had him
confined, and threatened to punish him if his predictions
were not fulfilled. Most of the Jews left their houses, and
encamped without the city.

The attention of the English government has, for several
years past, been much turned to the opening and maintaining
a passage from some port in Syria, through the valley
of the Euphrates to the East Indies. Two steam-boats,
the Euphrates and Tigris, were taken across from the
Mediterranean Sea, near Scanderoon, to the Euphrates, at
Beer. They were carried in pieces on camels, and put
together at Beer, and the expedition, under the command
of Colonel Chesney, proceeded, on their exploring tour
down the river. The Tigris, which was the smaller boat,
was lost in a tornado; the Euphrates continued on her[207]
route, and the river was explored. The matter did not
succeed quite as well as some of its more ardent advocates
expected, but well enough to prove that it was practicable.
Large quantities of bitumen are found in that region, and
the experiment was tried of substituting this for coal, as
there is not much wood in the vicinity. It would not
answer; it melted too rapidly. A person is now engaged
in examining whether coal may not exist there. In the
meantime Mr. Farren, the Consul-General at Damascus,
using the great influence he has gained over some of the
Arabs, opened a direct communication with Bagdad
through the wilderness. He made use of dromedaries,
and the mail passed in six or eight days. Since Mr. Farren's
recal, the post is continued under the present consul.
There is thus a regular communication from Beyroot to
India, viâ Damascus and Bagdad. In a few years, I
doubt not that steamboats will run regularly on the
Euphrates, and that a great travelling route will thus cross
the most interesting part of the great valley of the
Euphrates, the ancient seat of early cities, kingdoms, and
civilisation. This will, as it may be hoped, prepare the
way for the spread of the gospel in the interior of Asia.

I have attended, by special request, an Arab wedding,
the parties being members of the Greek church. The men
and women were in separate apartments. In both rooms
there was music from a rude drum, and the women kept
up a singular hallooing, or kind of shrill cry. I was taken
into the female apartment, and introduced to the bride.
She was much adorned with gold and gold foil, her face
and hands painted in the most fantastic manner; she kept
her eyes closed, or nearly so, which she must do for several
days. They made her put on cob-cobs, a kind of sandal
nearly a foot high, and dance before us, or rather walk very[208]
slowly backwards and forwards, keeping time with the
music; her hands were held up by an attendant, to be
seen and admired. They then took her into another room
to eat, after which the marriage ceremony commenced.
The priest read the marriage service, during which he put
a ring on the finger of each, with many crossings, and
touching the head and breast, and afterwards he changed
the rings; he then put a chaplet made of an olive branch
with its leaves on the head of each, and after a similar
crossing and touching the head and breast, the chaplets
were changed; he then took a cup of wine, and made them
both drink of it: this, with the priest's blessing, closed the
marriage. The bride was then made to follow her husband
to the place where the horses were fastened. Her
attendants led her, and her walk was as slow as you can
well conceive,       a step, then a pause, then a very slow
moving of the foot forward; she must show great reluctance,
and be forced after her "well beloved." He seemed
to give himself no trouble about her, but mounted his
horse, and waited with his back towards her, until the
signal should be given for starting. At last, by half carrying
and half pushing her, the bride reached the horse
brought to take her to her new home, and was mounted
astride, as is the custom for females to ride here. The
signal was given, and the bridegroom moved forward,
accompanied by most of the male guests, while the
females surrounded the bride, some on animals, others
on foot. The music and screaming were kept up, and
"the friend of the bridegroom" danced and played all sorts
of odd tricks before him. It was his business to make
sport for them. A pomegranate was given to the bride,
which she breaks as she enters her husband's door, thus
showing that she promises to be an obedient and dutiful[209]
wife. About dark, a few weeks ago, we were somewhat
startled by a discharge of artillery from the castles about
the town, one of which stands very near us. We were,
however, soon told that it was meant to signify the commencement
of the fast of the Rammedan, a fast of the
Mohammedans. During the continuance of this fast they
are not to eat, drink, or smoke, from sunrise to sunset.
They may, however, eat and drink during the night, and
they make amends for their abstinence during the day.
Many of them turn day into night, night into day, eating
at sundown, midnight, and just before sunrise, and after
making it a time of great revelry and wickedness. This
fast is a moveable one, and passes round to all seasons of
the year. When it falls in midsummer it must be a sore
trial to abstain from water in these thirsty countries; they
have, however, various ways of getting round the law of
the fast, and in some degree modifying the deprivations it
would cost them. All the systems of religion in the
eastern world lay much stress on fasting, and with many
it is carried to an idolatrous extent. They make a saviour
of them. That this should be the case with systems that
do not take God's Word for the rule of their faith and
practice, would not surprise us; but that those who call
themselves Christians, and profess to found their faith on
God's Word, and appeal to it as their rule, should do so,
may well grieve us. It is true, that while the Bible is in
a general way acknowledged as the Word of God, they do
not appeal to it, but to the authority of the church; they
have left the word of God,       have rendered it void, that
they may "follow their own devices,"       that they may
"keep their own traditions." The fasts of the Christian
sects are rather a distinction of meats, an abstinence from
animal food, than fasts properly so called. The Greeks,[210]
in accordance with all the Oriental churches, observe
Wednesday and Friday of each week. The Papists,
Friday and Saturday. In addition to these weekly fasts,
they have others of many days in succession. During one
of forty days' continuance, they are not allowed to eat
until after twelve o'clock at noon. It is astonishing with
what rigidity even small children observe these seasons.

A few days since, some dervishes, or Mohammedan
priests, who have been on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
returned. They came back as holy men, and great crowds
went out to see their wonders. I was assured by several
persons who witnessed its performance, that boys threw
themselves on the ground, in a row as close together as
they could lie, with their faces to the earth, making a row
of forty or fifty yards, and one of the priests paced his
horse over them, the horse literally stepping on their backs.
The boys jumped up very briskly, though some of them
showed what they were unwilling to acknowledge, that they
were slightly hurt. The fact may seem strange, but Christians
have tried the experiment, and succeeded as well as
the Moslems. Some of the priests thrust spears and swords
through their cheeks       a most unnatural thing. The people
consider such things in the light of a miracle.

I had a very pleasant interview not long since with Dr.
Wilson, of Scotland, who has just returned from a tour
through Palestine, and who went south as far as Petra.
At Hebron he made a special contract with a Sheik, who
for about one hundred and fifty dollars took him and his
party to Petra and back, and left his own brother as a hostage
with the governor, until they returned. Petra is in a
very rough district. The El-Ghor is a wide valley, but
much more elevated than I had supposed, much more so
than the Dead Sea, possibly a thousand feet at the highest[211]
part. It is very destitute of vegetation, and this is especially
the case with the country about Mount Hor, and
Petra. There is a district more to the south that is more
fertile, and has a good many inhabitants on it. The antiquities
at Petra are most wonderful; a town hewn out in
a sandstone rock, only one house of any size built above
ground, and that a church. This building has been slightly
injured by the late earthquake. There are most extensive
excavations       a considerable town under ground; the tomb
of Aaron on Mount Hor is an excavation. The mount is a
round sugar-loaf hill, with a small level on the top.

We have had fearful accounts of the prevalence of cholera
at Jerusalem, Aleppo, Malta, and some other places; much
fear is felt that it will visit us; may the Lord preserve us
from its ravages!

A few days ago, a moolah, a Mohammedan priest, died
at this place. He was one of those who last spring made
a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and on his return rode over the
boys in the plain outside the town. After his death, the
other priests pretended that his body would fly off to
heaven, if they did not prevent it. They, therefore, had
ropes tied to his body, and fastened them to other things,
that the body might not get away. They held on to the
ropes as they took the body to the grave-yard. On their
way the bearers stopped several times, and would pull this
way and that way, as if some invisible power would not
let them go forward, and the pretence was, that the dead
man was not willing to go that way, or to be buried. They
at length, however, got him to the grave, put him in, and
made great lamentation over him. This is a sample of the
tricks they play to delude the people.

I spent an hour on the 17th of last month, very
pleasantly, with Lord Lindsay, who has travelled extensively[212]
in these countries. From Egypt he passed Mount
Sinai and the Elanetic Gulf       visited Petra, Bosrah, Gerash,
and most of Palestine and Palmyra. He says there are
many ruins about Bosrah; a Roman road thirty feet
wide runs from that place towards Bagdad. It is in a
good state of preservation, but not used. Lord Lindsay had
the affliction to lose a brother, who travelled with him; if
I mistake not, he died from what is called a stroke of the
sun. Means were used to preserve the body, and he took
the corpse with him in the same vessel to England.




LETTER XIX.



Beyroot, October 14th, 1838.


Yesterday I returned with my family from the mountains,
where we had been to recruit from the effects of the
warm weather. For you must know, that after knocking
about in a very extempore way for some time, I concluded
it was better to go into partnership, and accordingly we
commenced house-keeping for ourselves, early in March
last. In doing this, I showed all my partiality for my
own country, by passing by all the dark-eyed beauties
of the East, and selecting one of the daughters of my own
people.

Bhamdoon, the village at which we spent the summer,
stands high on the mountains; only on one occasion before
had any Franks lived among them. About two-thirds of
the people belong to the Greek church. The remainder
are Maronites. We found the people friendly, but the
Maronites were less disposed to have intercourse with us
than the Greeks. We distributed a number of books in[213]
that and the adjacent villages, and almost every night
some of the people came in to hear the Scriptures read,
and to be present at evening prayers. This was usually
followed by conversation, which often lasted an hour or
two. Sometimes the number was so great, as to fill the
room. Hykel, my teacher, was almost always present,
and took part in the conversation; not unfrequently curious
and puzzling questions were asked, as what that light was,
which is spoken of as separated from the darkness, in the
first of Genesis; and how the day and night were measured
before the sun was made? They often showed a good deal
of intelligence. To vary the exercises, I sometimes gave
them tracts to read, and generally very good attention was
paid to the reading of them.

The old priest of the village was blind, and there was a
monk assisting him, who was better informed than any of
that order that I have met with. He visited us frequently,
and read portions of the New Testament with us, and
commented on them. He often gave exhortations, or
preached to the people. He, as well as the people, seemed
to consider this as a matter that did him some credit. My
knowledge of the language was not sufficient to enable me
fully to understand all he said, but from what I could
understand, I thought he was fond of giving curious and
far-fetched interpretations. Both he and the people seemed
to rest on the outward form of religion, and to be strangers
to its inward and spiritual power. The Greek church
stood near our house, and we often saw travellers in passing
the church ride up to it, touch it with their hand, put that
to their heads, cross themselves, and then pass on. The
same was done by the villagers, and they would often kiss
the stones a number of times. I witnessed a rite in this
church that was new to me. I had been informed by one[214]
of the leading men, that our friend, the monk, would preach
the next morning. I considered the information as a kind
of invitation to attend, which I did. His sermon, as far as
I could understand it, was not very instructive, but rather
of the spiritualizing kind. It was, however, delivered
with earnestness, and listened to with attention by a full
house. At its close, prayers were read, and some bread
produced and broken into very small pieces, and handed
to the people in a plate. It was sought for with great
eagerness, and many of the little boys were particularly
pressing to receive it. I supposed at first that it was the
Lord's Supper, but was told afterwards that it was not,
but a representation of the body of the Virgin Mary.

I made a second very pleasant trip to Baalbec with Mrs.
P. and our two little girls. We had many opportunities
of distributing books and tracts along the road. In most
instances, as soon as it was known that we had books, our
tent was surrounded by persons importuning for them.
As soon as one was supplied, he would withdraw to a little
distance, and set himself to reading in good earnest. The
success of some encouraged others, and each had some particular
reason to urge, why he should be supplied before the
others. We were absent five days, and on our return,
were welcomed with great joy by our good friends in the
village.

Bhamdoon is surrounded with vineyards. The vines
are, for the most part, allowed to lie on the ground. In a
few places peculiarly situated, they are trained on supports,
which raise them several feet above it. The grapes are of
various kinds, most of them white and large. We are
supplied with them most generously and munificently by
the people. There are several houses that seem to be
common property, where they express the juice of the[215]
grape. They have, along one side of the house, a row of
large vats, into which the grapes are thrown; and beside
these, stone troughs, into which the juice flows. Men get
in the vats, and tread the grapes with their feet. It is
hard work, and their clothes are often stained with the
grape. The figures found in Scripture, taken from this,
are true to the life. "I have trod the wine-press alone;"
"I will stain all my raiment;" "The wine-press was
trodden without the city." The juice that was extracted
when I visited the press, was not made into wine, but into
what is called dibbs. It resembles molasses. They take
the juice from the troughs, put it into large boilers, and
reduce it to one-half, possibly one-third of the original
quantity. It is then removed to large earthen jars, and subjected
to a process, not unlike churning, which is repeated
for a few days, until it thickens. When properly churned,
or beaten, but little separation of the particles takes place.
It forms a very pleasant article for table use, and is decidedly
preferable to molasses.

We witnessed the process of making raisins. The grapes
are collected and dipped in a weak ley, with which a small
quantity of olive-oil has been mixed. They are then
spread out on the ground, and several times a day this
mixture is sprinkled over them. This is continued, for
six, eight, or ten days, according to the dryness of the
atmosphere, until the raisins are cured. They are then
taken up, and while warm from the sun, put into jars and
pressed down hard, and thus preserved for use or sale.
There is, however, but little wine, raisins, or dibbs exported.
Most that is made is kept for family use.

The salutations of these people are very similar to those
of ancient times. In passing persons at work, as in cultivating
their vineyards, or thrashing out grain, the usual[216]
form is "Salam-a-laykoom," Peace be unto you; and the
answer is, "A-laykoom-issalum," Upon you be peace. On
entering a house, it is Peace be upon you, or "Olloh
makoom," God be with you. In giving orders to servants,
or requesting favours of friends, the answer generally given
is, "A-lah-rass-ee," On my head be it. The women, in
taking a quantity of flour from their store for a batch of
bread, will precede it with a "Bismillee," In the name of
God. As a general thing the Arabs may be said to be a
polite people. The morning and evening salutations are
always passed among the inmates of the same house; they
will seldom pass you in the road without some kind word.
When lights are brought, the servants will say, "Good
evening to you," and the company will say the same to
one another. They have a great variety of salutations,
forms of expression, and compliments suited to all the
various circumstances of life, and these are familiar to all;
to the youngest and the poorest, as well as to the prince.

Several bands of gipsies at different times visited our
village. They came in companies of from ten to thirty,
men, women, and children, mostly mounted on donkeys.
They encamped in a thrashing-floor near by, which gave
us an opportunity to observe their motions and learn their
habits. They carry with them a few utensils for cooking,
and a few articles with which they cover themselves at
night. They will occasionally put up a rude tent to shelter
them from the sun. Some of them manufacture a few
things, which they dispose of in their rambles. Attached
to each company are two or three who play on musical
instruments, and amuse the people with their feats of
jugglery. They have a language of their own, with which
they converse among themselves, but are familiar with
Arabic. They are great beggars, and notorious thieves.[217]
The people are careful to secure their chickens and donkeys
when the gipsies are in the neighbourhood. They do not
remain long at one place,       here to-day and gone to-morrow.
They stroll over the mountains in the summer, but remove
farther south in winter.

April 18, 1838.       On the first Sabbath of the present
year, a Druse family was baptised by the missionaries at
this place. They had for two years been attentive to the
instructions of the missionaries, and both the parents gave
evidence of piety. They, with their six children, were
baptized at the mission-house at the close of the Arabic
service. It was an interesting occasion, and excited a good
deal of interest among those who are in the habit of attending
the Arabic preaching. There are several other Druses,
who are constant in their attendance at the Sabbath school
and Arabic preaching, and profess a great desire to become
Christians.

You are, no doubt, familiar with the account of Asaad
Shidiak. I have learned several things about him lately,
which to me, at least, had a considerable degree of painful
interest. I have seen several persons who, as they declare,
saw him during his imprisonment, and one who saw him
after his death. He was of the Maronite church, and from
his intercourse with the missionaries he came to understand
the corruption of his church, and the nature of true spiritual
religion. This brought on him the displeasure of the dignitaries
of that church. He was a man of learning and
talents, and, with the truth on his side, he was too much
in argument for any of them. After various attempts to
bring him back to their corrupt system in vain, he was
seized and imprisoned, and subjected to much cruel treatment.
He held fast to the truth which he had learned.
His faith was built on the Bible. One of the individuals[218]
from whom I gained information about him said, he had a
long conversation with him while in prison. He was shut
up in a small room only a few feet square, the door walled
up so as to leave but a small opening, like a window. He
was loaded with chains, and his food handed to him through
this small opening. He assured this person that his religious
faith rested alone on the Bible.

His confinement was so close that it had become, with
people generally, a matter of doubt whether he was dead
or alive. Thus it had been for some time before the
Egyptian government took possession of this country. Some
of the Franks felt an intense interest in his fate. Immediately
after the fall of Acre, which event secured to the
Egyptian government the control of this part of Syria, an
English merchant of this place by the name of Todd,
waited on the Pasha, and made known the case of the
imprisoned Asaad, and asked and obtained authority to
examine the convent where he was confined, and have him
set at liberty if he were alive.

Todd visited the convent, and made some search, but
Asaad was not found. He was informed that he was dead,
and was shown what was said to be his grave; this confirmed
the opinion that he was dead. This movement on
the part of Todd was well meant; it may, however, be
doubted, whether it was well managed. The news got
out that he was about to visit the convent, and search for
Asaad. It was known on the mountains before he reached
Cannobeen. It is now declared, and pretty generally
believed on the mountains, as I am told, that Todd was
over-reached in the matter, that Asaad was then alive, but
concealed when the examination was made. Todd spent
but a few hours in the convent, and that at night, and left
the place with the full impression that Asaad was dead.

[219]

After this, it is said that the high ecclesiastics, fearing
that the matter might be divulged that he was still living,
had him destroyed. A sheik, who lives near the place,
and who has since had a quarrel with the patriarch, has
declared lately that Asaad was destroyed not long after
the search by Todd, and that he saw the dead body before
it was interred. How much truth there may be in this I
know not; for truth is a thing that does not abound among
this people. From the fact, however, that a wide-spread
opinion on the mountains places his death subsequent to
the search by Todd, and ascribes it to violence, there is
much reason to believe that it is correct.

His case has evidently made a great impression on the
people of the mountains. When I went to Bhamdoon, I
was almost immediately inquired of for the little book that
told about Asaad Shidiak. I sent to Beyroot, and procured
some copies of a small Arabic tract, written by
Asaad himself, giving a short account of his change of
views, and discussions with the priests, up to near the
time of his imprisonment. These were sought for with
more eagerness than almost any book I had. The solicitations
for it came principally from the Maronites. It is,
however, proscribed by their church; still I found that
some of them would read it. A good-looking young man,
who was evidently a pretty good scholar, would come to
my room and read the book by the hour. He would not
take it away for fear of the priest. And this reminds me
of a case that was rather amusing, that took place not long
before we went to the mountains. Some of the Maronite
princes were down from the mountains, and one of them
procured the tract containing the account of Asaad Shidiak,
and a priest saw him reading it. This being strictly
forbidden, the prince had a penance assigned him, as did[220]
also the servants who were within hearing at the time the
book was read. He was directed to fast so long; make so
many prostrations; and pay such a sum of money. The
prince replied:       as to fasting, it made him sick, and he
could not do it; and as to the prostrations, they gave him
the back-ache, and he could not perform them; that the
priest might, if he chose, make the attendants do it       and
there was some money, throwing down a part of what was
called for, which they might do what they pleased with.
There are a good many indications that the power of the
priesthood over the people is beginning to give way. The
time, I hope, is near, when more of the people will dare to
think for themselves, and follow the dictates of an enlightened
conscience.

A few months ago, a heavy conscription, as it may be
called, was raised over the most, if not the whole of Syria;
and out of it has arisen the present war in the Houran.
This is the name now used to designate an extensive district
east of the Jordan. It embraces the country occupied
by the tribes that lived east of that river       Reuben, Gad,
and the half tribe of Manasseh; the country of Bashan,
Moab, and a district to the east, that is not much known
to Europeans. It is said to be a high country, and abounding
with remains of cities. The Egyptian government
extends over this, but how far to the east I do not know.

In raising soldiers, the Pasha sent a body of troops out
among these towns and villages, to take such as were fit
for soldiers. The people, who have much of the Arab character,
did not like this, rose on the soldiers, and destroyed
several hundred of them. The Pasha then sent a considerable
body of troops to destroy the towns and chastise the
people. The people left their towns as the soldiers approached,
and joined the Arabs of the desert. They were[221]
joined by many from other parts of the country, and in all
made a pretty imposing force. Taking advantage of the
rough and mountainous districts, they did not allow the
troops of the Pasha to bring them to a fair fight; and
attacking his army in a situation that gave them the
advantage, they have twice beaten his army; and on the
last occasion, with a great loss to the Pasha, both of men
and munitions of war. The army of the Pasha had to
retreat towards Damascus. There is much discontent with
the Pasha; and it need not cause much surprise if other
movements of a rebellious character should follow the affair
of the Houran, especially if it be not soon put down.
Some slight indications of the kind have appeared at
Damascus; but several, suspected of causing it, had their
heads taken off with little ceremony, and the matter seems
to be stopped. Should the Pasha subdue the Houran, it
will produce a safer state of things to the east of the Jordan
than what has heretofore existed, and throw open a vast
region that must have peculiar interest to the traveller,
from the multitude of ruins that exist there, as well as the
connexion which it has with many of the events of ancient
and sacred history.

On the evening of the first of April, we witnessed a
most wonderful flight of locusts. They came like a dark
cloud, filling the air for a long distance. The greater part
of them were above the tops of the houses; but many flew
lower, and passed through the tops of the mulberry trees.
There had been a strong south-east wind for about twelve
hours. They came from the east, and must, of course, have
crossed the Lebanon. Their course was west; but as they
approached the sea, I thought they varied, and passed more
south-west, as if not willing to go out of sight of land. For
about half an hour the air was full of them; afterwards[222]
their number decreased, but it was a long time before the
last straggler had passed. About three days afterwards,
we had them again from the south-west; the wind had
changed, and now came from that quarter. They now
seemed disposed to stop: the gardens and sands were full
of them. They did not seem to eat anything, but were
employed in depositing their eggs, which they place in the
sands or earth. An acquaintance of mine, who has just
returned from Tripoli, states, that all the way from Ji-bail
to the river Beyroot, a distance of nearly twenty miles, the
locusts are thrown out on the shore in such numbers as to
lie from eighteen inches to two feet deep       they have been
drowned in the sea. The old locusts do not do much
injury; it is the young ones, which will come out in a
month or six weeks after the eggs are deposited in the
sands, that eat so voraciously, and destroy all before them.
I understand the Emeer has issued an order for each person
to collect about a quart of their eggs, as a means of
destroying them, and thus preventing the destruction
which the young locusts would make.




LETTER XX.



Jaffa, May 21st, 1838.


Having concluded to return during the ensuing summer
to the United States, and made my arrangements accordingly,
I took passage from Beyroot to this city, in a Greek
vessel, April 20th. The families of Rev. Messrs. Thomson
and Hebard had preceded us, to attend the annual meeting
of the mission, which was to be held at Jerusalem. It was
not without feelings of sorrow that I left Beyroot. For[223]
about two years I had considered it my home, and excepting
while making tours, which I occasionally did, I had
remained there and on the adjacent mountains. I had
preached a good deal to the English congregation at Beyroot,
and aided, in all the ways I could, the mission work.
I had become acquainted with many of the natives, more
particularly with those who maintained a friendly intercourse
with the mission. I had enjoyed the acquaintance
and friendship of the consuls and English residents, and
could not bid them a final farewell without strong emotion.
But circumstances made it indispensable, and we parted,
expecting to see each other no more.

We reached this place on the 22d, after a moderately
short but rough passage. To our great discomfort, we
found that the plague had broken out a few days before;
the city was shut up, and we were not allowed to enter.
At first we were not permitted to land; but after some
entreaty we were permitted to land at the Lazaret, under
the watch of the health officers, who took us and our baggage
into that building. There were some cases of plague
in the Lazaret, and it was the last place we wished to be
in; and, moreover, our room had literally nothing in it. I
wished to send word to the American consul, whose hospitality
we had more than once experienced; hoping that he
would be able to place us in a more comfortable situation,
and was told that he was at his country-house, about two
miles from town, and that we might go there if we chose;
but that we must walk, as all the animals had been used
by the pilgrims, who were returning in great numbers from
Jerusalem, and might be infected. After a most laborious
walk through the sand, with our children       two of whom
we were obliged to carry       we reached the house of the
consul, but he was not there; his family being still in town[224]
and his house shut up. It was too late to return to the
Lazaret; and there was no alternative, but to lodge, without
bed or supper, on the floor of an unfinished room that was
designed for a kitchen.

In the morning, the consul came out with his family,
and our situation was made more comfortable. Through
his aid we had our baggage landed and conveyed to a place
of safety, excepting what we wished to take with us; and
having procured animals, we set off for Rumla about sunset,
which we reached about ten in the night. For once we
resolved to make trial of the camel, and we all rode on
them; but before we arrived at Rumla, we were satisfied
that the horse, the mule, and the donkey, are each and all
to be preferred to the camel, as a riding animal. The
motion of the camel is a long swinging motion, with rather
a sudden stop at each step; for a little while it is pleasant,
but soon becomes tiresome and at last painful.

We were on our way at an early hour on the morning
of the 25th, and reached Jerusalem about five in the afternoon,
where we were kindly entertained by Mr. and Mrs.
Nicolayson. We found the friends well. The sessions
of the missionary meeting were drawing to a close. Professor
Robinson, and the Rev. Messrs. Smith and Adger, had
arrived some days before from Egypt, via Suez and Sinai.

One object I had in view in revisiting Jerusalem and its
vicinity before I returned to the United States, was to
correct, as far as I might be able, any errors that might
exist in my former descriptions, and supply any defects
which a second visit might suggest. I have not seen much
that deserves special notice in the way of correction or
addition.

It struck me at the time that I visited the plain of
Jordan and the Dead Sea, that the descent from Jerusalem[225]
to them was greater than that from Jerusalem to the
Mediterranean. It is now a pretty well ascertained fact
that the Dead Sea is lower than the Mediterranean; and
as the water of the latter sea is above thirty feet lower than
the Red Sea, it must follow that the Jordan never flowed
through the El Ghor into the Elanetic Gulf. Count
Barteau, who has just returned from a visit to Petra
Acaba, and an examination of the district between the
south end of the Dead Sea and Acaba, states that a high
district crosses the El Ghor, and causes the water to run
north and south from it. Dr. Wilson and Lord Lindsay
gave me substantially the same information. From some
experiments it is estimated that the level of the Dead Sea
is several hundred feet lower than those of the Mediterranean.
If a passage then were made connecting the Red
with the Dead Sea, the waters would flow into it, so as to
cover all the plain of the Jordan, and even raise the level of
the waters of Lake Tiberias. The question will naturally
be asked, where did the waters of the Jordan flow to,
before the destruction of the cities of the plain? what
outlet did they find? The more common opinion heretofore
has been, that before the overthrow of those cities
there was no lake on the south end of the plain of Jordan.
The Bible does not, however, say so, but rather intimates
the reverse. The Salt Sea is mentioned before the account
of the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah. It seems to
me most likely that there was a lake at the south end of
the plain, and that those cities were situate near its borders;
their destruction was followed by the enlargement
of the lake, and the ruin of some part of the plain on which
they stood. It is indeed an almost universal opinion among
the Arabs, that some of the ruins of these cities may yet be
seen. Costigen found ruins, as his servant declared, which[226]
he took for the ruins of those cities; and Count Barteau
states, that he saw at the south end of the lake old cisterns,
and other things that indicated the former existence of
towns. There is now not much doubt that we shall in
due time have the facts so examined into and certified, as
to add another proof to the many which have lately been
given, of the verity and accuracy of the Scriptural account
of things.

While at Jerusalem, I had occasion to visit Jaffa. I rode
down past Rumla, and reached Jaffa in about ten hours.
My horse was not a good one; the day was warm, and I
did not ride fast. I infer, from the time spent on the road,
that the distance must be at least thirty-five miles, and
possibly forty.

I returned by a road which separates from that of Rumla,
a few miles from Jaffa, and passes over the plain farther to
the north. It led us past several villages on the plain,
among which was Lydd, the ancient Lydda, where Peter
healed Eneas. It is a small village, but contains some
better buildings than we usually meet with in such small
towns. It is surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards
of fruit-trees; and on the east side of the village is a good
well, much resorted to for water. The plain of Sharon on
this road was very fertile, and more of it had been cultivated
than is usual. The harvest was going on, and men,
women, and children, were out in the fields: some reaping
with the common reap-hook       some pulling up the
grain with their hands       some binding up the grain in
bundles       some carrying it on their shoulders, or on
donkeys, or mules, or camels, to the thrashing-floor       and
some thrashing out the grain by driving the cattle over
it. They use a thrashing instrument not unlike a harrow.
In its under side they have pieces of stone or iron fastened[227]
which serve as teeth. These instruments are dragged by
the oxen over the grain, and thus separate it from the straw.

After leaving the plain, our road followed a ridge for a
considerable distance; a little west of the highest ground
we passed two ruined villages at some distance from each
other, that were called Beth-horon. They are, I doubt
not, the upper and the nether Beth-horon. This opinion
is, I think, confirmed by the account given of the defeat of
the kings that were confederated against Gibeon. It is
said that Israel "chased them along the way that goeth up
to Beth-horon; and it came to pass that as they were in
the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord threw down
on them great hailstones from heaven." Josh. x. 11, 12.
Beth-horon lies on the west side of the ridge, and Gibeon
lies on the east side, and at the distance of several miles
from the top. The flight began from Gibeon, and was
first up to the top of the ridge on the road towards Beth-horon;
and from the top of the ridge it was down to
Beth-horon, and on this last part of the way, that the hailstones
fell on them. Until I saw the ground, I never
understood the "up" and "down," as used in the record of
this flight and pursuit. Near Gibeon I saw some sandstone,
singularly mixed up with the limestone. It lay about
in large masses, but I saw no continuous rock of it. The
ancient Gibeon is now a small-village, inhabited by a few
Mohammedan families. It stands on the summit of a
round hill, and from the steepness of its sides is capable of
being made very strong. There are various old ruins and
some arches of great size running into the sides of the hill,
forming rooms, in which various labours are now carried
on. A little out of town is a spring in a cave, and below
it, on the side of the hill, the remains of an old pool,
which is probably the one beside which Abner and Joab,[228]
with their men, sat down before the battle in which Asahel
fell.

The plague made its appearance in Jerusalem shortly
after our arrival. We did not pay much attention to it,
excepting that we were more careful in passing about the
city not to come in contact with the people. The monks
from some of the religious houses left the city, and took
refuge in other places. We found the monks at Bethlehem
keeping quarantine, and there was plague in some of the
convents in the country.

A health officer from Jaffa visited the city on the 16th,
and declared his intention to shut up the gates and prevent
egress or ingress, until the plague abated. He gave us
permission to leave, provided we would do it early the
next day. Having no wish to be shut up even in Jerusalem,
for a month or two, we made all possible haste to get
ready to leave town the next morning. We found some
difficulty in procuring animals, but at last succeeded, and
bidding farewell to all our kind friends, and the missionary
brethren resident there, we left the city and bent our
course to Rumla. Our animals proved miserable creatures,
and one of our muleteers gave us the slip and returned,
leaving us to make our journey as best we could. We
had been informed at Jerusalem that we would not be
permitted to enter Rumla; but supposed that we should
arrive in season to consult with the consular agent, and
obtain lodging in the old tower, or some place in the
vicinity. Our mules were so intolerably bad, however,
that it was dark when we approached Rumla. To our
frequent inquiries of the muleteer, as to where he was
taking us, we received the reply, "to the water," and
supposing that we would halt at some watering place near
the town, we allowed him to proceed. Finding from the[229]
length of the way that we must be taking the road to
Jaffa, we insisted on coming to an understanding of the
matter. He had no idea of stopping, but intended to land
us safe at Jaffa that night; after a great deal of noise on
both sides we prevailed on him to halt. He took us under
an olive-tree near by, saying, what he supposed was true,
that if he took us to the town they would cut his head off.
Angelo set off immediately, to see if he could gain admittance
within the town. The children, worn out with the
fatigue of the journey, had lost all patience, and were crying
for their suppers. I seated them on the ground and
began to search about in the dark for the remains of our
luncheon, which there was much reason to fear the muleteer
and his boy had eaten. Presently Mrs. P. began to
shake with an ague fit, and called out to me that she
should die with the cold if relief was not soon obtained. I
had procured some wine at Jerusalem, which I was taking
home as a sample of the wines of Palestine; and thinking
this was a time, if ever, when its use would be justifiable, I
succeeded in disengaging a bottle from our baggage and
administered a quantity of it to those "who were ready to
perish." Drawing a small carpet from the saddle of the
mule on which I rode, I covered up my little family, and
with no enviable feelings waited the result. It was not
long before the well-known voice of Angelo hallooing in
the distance broke upon my ear. He came with one of the
consul's sons, who welcomed us to his father's house,
assuring us there was no obstacle in the way of our admittance.
Thus our difficulties were removed, and we were
most hospitably lodged for the night. The next day we
arrived at the country-seat of our very kind consul at this
place, who has furnished us with a room, and is assiduous
in his attentions to promote our comfort and happiness.

LETTER XXI.



Alexandria, June 21st, 1838.


We left Jaffa on May the 24th for this place. It was
not without trouble and delay that we were able to obtain
a passage. On our arrival at Jaffa, in April, we found
many vessels there. They were, we were told, waiting for
pilgrims, who were at that time returning from Jerusalem,
where many attend during the great feasts. They were
at that time coming down in crowds, and going off to the
vessels: but before our return from Jerusalem, in May,
they were gone, and hardly a vessel remained at Jaffa.
Possibly the fear of the plague, which prevailed at Jaffa,
had driven some away, and at the same time prevented
others from coming. Our wish was to take passage to
Damietta, and ascend the Damietta branch of the Nile to
Grand Cairo, and come down the Rosetta branch to Alexandria.
We found a vessel that was willing to take us to
Damietta, but before we had completed our bargain, the
Russian consul, whose family had lost many members by
the plague, made, in his great eagerness to get away, so
large an offer, as induced the captain to change his course,
and immediately sail with the consul for Smyrna. As we
passed Damietta, about a week afterwards, we spoke the
same vessel, and learned that, soon after sailing, the consul
took the plague and died, and the vessel put in at Damietta.
The consul fled from Jaffa, but not from the plague or
death       both met him on the way       how little do we foresee
what a day may bring forth! After some delay a
vessel came from Beyroot, which offered to take us to this
place, but asked about four times the usual price       there[231]
was no help       no other suitable vessel offered       and the
captain said, which was true, that he would have to perform
a long quarantine. A letter came to the consul, from
several other travellers, to engage them a vessel, as they
would be at Jaffa in a few days; and it was agreed that I
should pay one-half of the required sum, and those travellers
the other, and the engagement was closed.

Through the kind attention of our consul, who spared no
pains to promote our comfort, our arrangements were made,
our baggage put on board, and our provisions and stores
laid in. The plague added much to the trouble of doing
this. On going on board we found it was a Turkish vessel,
and a Turkish crew. The captain seemed to be much of a
gentleman for a Turk. He was polite, silent, and would
sit all day smoking his pipe, and watching the working of
his vessel. The crew also were sober, silent, and appeared
to move about as if they had no care but to mind their own
business. We had stipulated to have the sole use of the
cabin, provided we should prefer it. On examining the
premises, however, we decided on taking up our quarters
on the deck, as plainly the cleanest and most comfortable
place. The captain readily yielded to our wishes, and
fitted up the long boat, which was on the deck, spreading
a sail over it, and making quite a tent       in this we took up
our abode.

When the travellers referred to came on board, we recognised
them as a party we had met a few miles this side of
Jerusalem. They had come from Egypt to Palestine
through the wilderness, and were on their way to Jerusalem
as we left it. Their cavalcade had attracted our
attention, being all mounted on camels; and what looked
rather oddly, two were on the same camel, in what are
called baskets, sitting back to back       one facing to the[232]
right and the other to the left. The party consisted of two
German officers, who belonged to King Otho's army in
Greece       a Frenchman and a Swiss. The fact that we
had no common language prevented our having as much
intercourse with them as we should otherwise have had.
They also took up their quarters on deck, the captain
having put up an awning. As there was no danger of
rain, the deck was decidedly the most comfortable place.
While we could not fully understand the subject of their
discourse, we were not a little amused during our voyage
with the long and almost continual debates of our fellow-voyagers.
It was all in great good-humour, but a set of
more everlasting talkers and disputants I have seldom met
with.

There were several others on board, who came in without
paying their part of the expense. This is almost always the
case when a Frank charters a vessel. I have heard of a
captain, who had especially engaged not to take any one on
board except the Franks who had chartered his vessel,
stowing away privately in the hold nearly a dozen who
were never to be seen on deck. The captain of course gets
a fee from such       it is so much clear gain. He first asks
and gets a full price for his whole vessel, and then stows
away as many persons and things as he can, on such
terms as may be offered. We had a Greek sea captain as
a passenger       he was one of the most silent Greeks I recollect
to have met with, for, as a general thing, they are a
talking, noisy people. He hardly ever spoke a word, and
had little intercourse with any one except a Greek servant.
There was another, "old Dominico," as we called him,
who, oddly enough, passed himself off as one of my party,
and not only went rent free, but ate of my bread. On
reaching our consul's from Jerusalem, we saw there a[233]
middle-aged man, who had much the appearance of a
domestic, but in a Frank dress. He seemed to turn his
hand to anything       at times he was in the garden directing
the water to the trees and plants       then again he was
going with a mule or donkey and bringing home loads of
grass for the animals       at one time called here and another
there. On first seeing him, it struck me he might be a
Scotchman       but he knew no English       I then thought he
must be an Italian       he proved to be a Genoese. He had
been at Jerusalem, and was living on the consul until he
could get a passage from Jaffa       and the consul, very properly,
to keep him from rusting through mere idleness, was
employing him in all sorts of ways, as occasions offered.
When on the point of starting, the consul, who was probably
willing to get clear of him, requested that Dominico
might so far be considered, as belonging to my party as to
secure him a free passage; and, according to his own rule
for managing such cases, advised that I should keep the old
man in employ as far as I had anything that he could do.
Of course I assented. After getting all on board, and under
sail, and the time for eating had come, Angelo reported
old Dominico as minus all sorts of provisions for the voyage.
I was fairly in for it. He belonged to my party, and must
not be allowed to suffer. This however was an appendix
to the matter that I had not looked for; and in laying in
stores, for each party found themselves, (old Dominico
excepted,) I had not counted him       and no small eater was
he. Angelo was directed to give the old man his rations
from my stores, and advised that he should give him something
to do       make him cut the wood, kindle the fire,
watch the coffee       do anything that would keep his hand
in: for I hold that perfect idleness is not good for man or
beast. And finding that the old man had a pretty good[234]
knack for pleasing children, many an hour were they permitted
to while away with him, to his own as well as their
amusement.

The Moslems are in their way a religious people. They
are regular in saying their prayers at the prescribed times.
They usually pray, wherever they may happen to be, when
the proper time arrives. They do not retire to a secret
place, but spread a small mat, and kneel and prostrate
themselves on it       touch the ground with their forehead,
facing towards Mecca, and repeating at the same time, in
a low and almost unintelligible voice, their forms of prayer.
The fore-part of the deck was the place at which they
performed their devotions.

Our winds being light, we did not lose sight of Palestine
for nearly twenty-four hours after we embarked. We had
a pretty good view of the south part of the plain of Sharon
and of the hill country that rose behind it. Several villages
were seen, surrounded with their olive-trees, vineyards, and
gardens. The land at last disappeared, and nothing but
water was seen on all sides. Our course brought us
within sight of Egypt, east of Damietta. The coast was
low, and seemed to be a bed of sand. To the south-east
we saw some large buildings that appeared to rise out of
the water. We learned that they were forts at the mouth
of some inlet. As we passed to the west, our course
brought us nearer the shore, and gave us a better view of
it. The water had a greenish colour, and such a current
set to the east, that during a calm that took place we had
to cast out an anchor to prevent our being swept far to the
east.

In passing Damietta, we saw several vessels lying off.
The shallows and bars at the mouth of the river are such as
to prevent vessels from entering, and cause much trouble[235]
and delay in loading and unloading at that place. Large
lighters are used in passing produce and merchandise to
and from the shore. We could not see much of the town.
It lies a little back, and the sand hills near the coast tended
to prevent a good view of it. From all I could learn, it is
a small place, and much on the decline. There are some
strong forts at the mouth of the river, and so placed as to
command the entrance. The implements of war are everywhere
to be met with in the dominions of Mohammed Ali.

Groves of date-trees began to be seen on the coast. This
is the tree of Egypt, and is everywhere in Egypt to be met
with in greater numbers than any other tree. It has a
singular appearance, and not unlike a spread umbrella.
The stem is long, and of the same thickness, and has no
branches until you reach the top,       then a large cluster of
branches, which bend out and hang down their tops, so as
to look much like the top of an open umbrella. They often
are found together in groves or orchards, and make a very
fine appearance.

Along the coast, and near the water, are many sand-hills.
They almost line the coast       are of various shapes
and sizes. Most of them are composed of white, fine sand,
and are utterly destitute of vegetation. In a few places
I could see some small bushes about the base of some of
them; and through the openings between the sand-hills we
could see groves of palms in the interior. In a few places
we saw villages; for the most part they appeared small.
Some of them had minarets, which indicated Moslem
places of worship; and in several places we saw the top of
minarets where we could see neither the village nor the
mosque to which they belonged.

The minaret, I may here remark, is to the mosques
what a steeple is to the church. Instead of a bell to call to[236]
worship, the moolah (the Mohammedan priest) mounts the
minaret, proclaims the hour, and calls his people to prayer.
The minaret rises higher above the mosque than the steeple
usually does above the church. It is always white, and
has a stairway up in the inside, by which the moolah
ascends to the place from which he proclaims the hour and
its accompanying duty. Near the top is a door through
which he comes out. A little platform runs all round the
minaret, fenced in with a low railing. There is a cover
over the top, which protects them in time of rain. If I
may compare a small thing with a great, I would say that
a minaret is much like a tall candlestick, with a long
spermaceti candle in it, and an extinguisher on the top of
the candle. They have a very pretty and tasteful appearance.

The whole coast from east of Damietta to the west of
Rosetta, bends like a bow, the convex part being next the
Mediterranean. It is caused, no doubt, in part at least,
by the immense deposits which the Nile makes of the mud,
with which its waters are loaded. There are, however,
some very deep bays on the coast, as the bay of Aboukir.

The coast about Rosetta did not differ much from that
about Damietta. The mouth of the river is obstructed
with bars, which is much in the way of its commerce.
The town lies back, so that we had not a good view of it,
at the distance at which we passed. There were once, I
am told, many good houses here; the trade was much
concentrated here; but since the canal has been made from
Atpi to Alexandria, the trade has taken that direction, and
Alexandria has been built up at the expense of Rosetta.
All along this coast the current seemed to set eastward.

We reached Alexandria on the first of June. It stands
on a point of land that projects considerably into the sea,[237]
and has a part that turns west like the upper part of a
capital T. On this west point stands a palace of the pasha,
to which he resorts in summer. There are two harbours,
one on the east and the other on the west side of the town;
and in each harbour is a Lazaret.

We had hoped, that as we had kept quarantine at Jaffa       as
our vessel had little intercourse with the shore, having
come from Beyroot, and as the health-officer promised he
would state this on our papers, that we would have but
little, if any, assigned us here. But we found that all
availed not. We had twenty-one days assigned us, and
all our entreaties availed not to lessen the number. The
Turks, for the most part, take things patiently, and in
few things is it more wise to imitate them than in this.
We had our place assigned us in the Lazaret of the eastern
harbour, and early the next morning the captain had us
and all our baggage conveyed there. Our fellow-passengers
were all assigned to the same place, while the captain
and his crew were allowed to perform their quarantine
on board their vessel       one soldier being put with them to
see that none left the vessel, and none entered it; while
another soldier was assigned to us to have a similar watch
over all our doings.

On reaching the Lazaret, we were a good deal disconcerted
at finding that all men, women, and children,
masters and servants, were to be put in one and the same
room. Who ever heard the like! I protested against it,
but of what use to protest! We were told the rooms were
scarce, and that this was their mode, to put all who had
come in the same vessel in the same room. The room was
large       about sixty by twenty. Several years' experience
had satisfied me that there was more trouble than profit in
trying to get Turks and Arabs to think and reason as we[238]
do. I therefore set myself to make the best of the case,
and set off to examine the premises. At and about the
door of the room       for we were not in the open court
before it       I met several of our voyagers, who, with much
earnestness, urged me not to go in. Angelo, who had just
come out, earnestly advised me not to enter, and let me
know that the place was literally overrun with fleas. I
found them there in great numbers truly. But after having
it swept again and again, and using other means to destroy
them, we took possession. I had a strong cord stretched
across, so as to cut off about one-third, and made a room
about twenty feet square. On this cord we hung sheets,
and blankets, and bed-spreads, and thus made a private
and comfortable chamber. We procured a frame-work of
palm wood that was a very good substitute for bedsteads       and
some other articles of the first necessity, and did very
well; for our room, as we found it, had not an article in it.

Our fellow-voyagers took possession of the other part of
the room, and renewed their discussions and debates, which
for a little had been suspended.

The Lazaret has a set of large rooms, formed into squares,
and surrounded with high walls. Attached to each room
is a court, rather larger than the room, and open to the
heavens. There is a tank of water in this court, and at
one side, what is called a parletorio       a place with a kind
of wood grating, through which they may see and converse
with friends who call on them. Those in quarantine have,
during the day, free use of the court attached to their
rooms, but at night they are locked up in their rooms,
their guardian with them, and the key taken to the room
of the head of the quarantine.

There is a kind of market in the Lazaret, or rather a
shop is kept there, at which most of the common necessaries[239]
may be had, and at about a fair price. I engaged a
man to send us bread and milk daily, and was well supplied.
Angelo as usual cooked for us and had the general
management of our table, and continued to have it nearly
as well furnished as when we were at Beyroot, and at
about the same expense.

We were a few times allowed to walk out as far as the
sea-side, but not without our guard. Nor were we allowed
to go more than a few rods from the walls. We much
wished to take some walks in the vicinity, but this was
not allowed. There was, however, nothing rude in their
mode of denial.

The Lazaret is a new building, and not yet finished, and
the work is still in progress. It is made of a soft limestone,
which is brought in vessels and landed near the
building. I observed that females were almost wholly
employed in unloading the stone from these vessels, and
the attendance on the workmen was chiefly, if not wholly,
done by females. There were small companies of girls,
from twelve to sixteen years of age, who carried stones and
mortar. They usually went together, and sung and kept
a kind of time. Their singing was in a kind of response to
each other, and was evidently, in part at least, extempore;
as they often alluded to what they saw, and to what
was taking place about them. It reminded me of what is
called the corn-song, as sung by the slaves in the southern
States. They seemed cheerful, and are said to receive some
wages for their service.

Soon after we were in the Lazaret, Mr. Gliddon, U. S.
consul, called on us, and kindly tendered his aid in any
way that might add to our comfort while thus shut up in
the Lazaret. To be twenty-one days shut up in a room
was tiresome, but not so much so to us as might be[240]
expected. We had books       we read and wrote, and
through the kindness of our consul and others we received
files of papers, which let us know what was going on in
that much-loved land, from which we had been so long
absent, and to think now we were about to return.

Alexandria stands on the site of the old town of that
name. The point of land which I have before mentioned,
is pretty much covered with houses. The houses of the
older part of the town are very inferior, but many of the
buildings lately put up are in European style, and very
good, and some splendid buildings. These stand, at least
most of them, near the eastern harbour, and on a long
street that runs south-east across the town. Many of
these new and elegant houses are occupied by Europeans,
of whom there are a considerable number in Alexandria.
There are many Frank shops, and stores, and artists; and
almost all kinds of European articles and goods may here
be obtained.

A little to the east of the Frank quarter, as it may be
called, stands Cleopatra's Needle. It is a granite obelisk       near
it lies another on the ground. There is a large
space on the south-east side of the city, that is not built
on. It is a bed of ruins. In many places excavations
have been made, and curious antiques found. The city is
surrounded by a high and strong wall, with a deep fosse on
the outside. The gates are always guarded with soldiers.
The Navy-yard and Custom-house are on the western
harbour; and in that harbour ride some noble vessels, and
others are being built. The pasha and the sultan seem
running a race in ship-building, and certainly each has
done a good deal within a few years past. A little south
of the town, and on a small elevation, stands Pompey's
Pillar. It has so often been described that I may well[241]
pass it over, with the remark, that it is a large and beautiful
shaft of solid rock.

Alexandria has been much revived of late, and is now
the chief seaport of Egypt. Having selected it as the
place for his navy-yard, and through the canal of Mahmudieh
opened a direct communication between Alexandria
and the Nile at Atpi, the trade has almost all centred at
Alexandria, to the ruin of Rosetta. The population of
Alexandria may be from 30 to 40,000.

The district about Alexandria has, with few exceptions,
a dry and burnt-up appearance. In a few places the date
and the acacia trees are seen, but a large part of the surface
has almost nothing on it.

The pasha has shown a commendable degree of zeal for
introducing the arts and improvements of Europe into his
dominions. He has manufactories, and artists, and schools,
at Alexandria and other places. His leading object in the
whole seems to be, to promote and confirm his own power
over the people that he now governs. He has intelligence
enough to see that arts and improvements have given a
decided advantage to those who possess them, and for the
sake of those advantages he desires to be possessed of them.
This has led him to employ many European artists and
masters       has induced him to send a number of youth to
Europe to be educated there, and instructed in the various
departments of useful knowledge.

LETTER XXII.



Cairo, June 29th, 1838.


Wishing to make our tour up the Nile as soon as we
were relieved from quarantine, we had in part made our
arrangements when that took place. On the 21st, we
were called down to be inspected by the man of medical
science, and were declared free from all suspicious symptoms,
and entitled to mingle with the good people of the country,
and travel where we pleased. It was farcical enough to
see the man stand at the distance of ten or fifteen feet, and
inspect our tongues, and make us move our arms, and then
gravely decide that we were free from infection. Our
keepers, who, on the whole, had been kind and attentive,
but careful not to touch us, now approached and gave us a
cordial shake of the hand, and their congratulations on our
restoration to freedom. Each had to pay a small rent for
the room. We had also several small fees to pay       as the
board of our guardian. Through the aid of our consul a
boat had been engaged, and some other preparations made
for our trip up the Nile: deeming it best, after so long a
delay, to lose no time in making our visit to this place.
We found the boat in readiness, with such stores as were
necessary; and the American flag floated in the air at the
mast-head. This was to make known to all whom it
might concern, that the boat was mine pro tem., and not to
be searched or molested while under my protection. We
were soon in readiness to leave. Several persons, however,
whose animals we had used in riding from the Lazaret to
the boat, and some who had brought us various articles,
were to be paid. As I knew not what the usual prices[243]
were, I requested a Janissary to give each what was right.
He soon settled the matter, and paid them about one-third
of what they demanded of me. Thus, almost perpetually,
these people try to extort from travellers more than is
due, and especially if the traveller be a stranger among
them.

Alexandria does not stand on the Nile, but near thirty
miles west of the Rosetta branch of that river. A canal
(the Mahmudieh) connects the town on the western
harbour with the river, not at its mouth, but at Atfi.
This place may be nearly sixty miles from Alexandria,
but not so far from the mouth of the river. This canal is
the work of the Pasha. Owing to the bars and shallows
at the mouth of the river, much difficulty was found in
loading and unloading vessels; and the trade of Egypt,
which was carried on mainly through that branch, was
much impeded. Possibly a wish to build up Alexandria,
which was the best harbour for his navy, may have had
its influence. The Pasha resolved to open a canal from
some point of the Rosetta branch to Alexandria. Atfi was
fixed on as the point. The course of the canal marked
out, and multitudes of people from all the adjacent towns
and villages, marched down to different parts of the line
and set to work. The greater part had nothing to work
with but their hands; but the soil was soft and no stone
in it. In a few months the work was done, but it is said,
many lives were lost through the hardships to which the
people were subjected. Sail-boats are used on the canal;
but as the wind is not always fair, they at times use the
tow-line, but men, and not animals, pull it. The boats
that are on the canal do not pass into the river, nor those
of the river into the canal. There must of course be
another boat taken at Atfi, and the baggage changed from[244]
one to the other. This consumes time and is attended with
some expense.

The country through which the canal passes is nearly a
dead level, and, in some places, I should think, lower than
the level of the river. The banks of the canal were from
eight to twelve feet above the water. They were too
high to allow us to have a good view of the country over
them. At some places, however, they were lower, and at
others, by stopping the boat, and ascending the bank, we
had fine views of the rich meadows of Egypt. For
many miles after leaving Alexandria, we passed a succession
of houses and gardens, along the canal, that had a
very pleasant appearance. Several of them were fitted up
in Frank style, with glass windows, and other fixtures
indicating European society. They may have been occupied,
possibly owned, by Europeans. Connected with
several of these houses, were extensive gardens, and in a
good state of keeping. In addition to the palm tree,
which is the tree of Egypt, there were several other kinds
along the canal, as the acacia. It is low, and not unlike the
olive in its shape and size, but its bark and leaf approach
more to the locust. It is pretty as a shady and ornamental
tree, but I know not its other uses.

There are, all along the canal, water-wheels at work,
raising water for irrigating the adjacent gardens and fields.
The mode of making them is simple: a channel is cut into
the bank, so deep that the water will flow into it; a wheel
is made to turn in this cut, being suspended over it; a
rope, with a set of jars, passes over this wheel, and is
turned by it. This is long enough to allow the jars to pass
through the water and come up full, and, in turning, the
water is poured into a cistern, and thence conveyed by
small troughs to the place where it is needed. The wheels[245]
are usually worked by oxen. The number of wheels is
very great, and most of them are constantly in motion
through the day.

We passed some villages near the canal, but none of
much size. There were some of a larger size at a distance,
as we concluded, from the minarets which we could see.
In several places we saw water at a distance that looked
like a lake. In passing up the canal, and the same was
true after we entered the river, I could not but notice how
the people and the animals loved to be in the water. The
children and youth were seen in it, and the cattle seemed
to have a passion, not only for wading in the water, but
for lying down in it, so as often to cover their whole bodies,
except a small part of their heads. This may, in part,
have been to keep off the flies, but mainly, I judge, to
enjoy the coolness which the water imparted to them. I
never before understood the force of the expression in
Pharaoh's dream, where it is said, he "saw seven kine
coming up out of the river." It is true to the life. They
lie in the water until satisfied, then come up and feed on
the low grounds or meadows near it.

We had often heard dismal accounts of the annoyances
met with in the boats of the Nile; we were now to have
a proof of them. On entering our boat we observed that
it had recently been painted, and hoped that this betokened
a deliverance from those gentry that so annoy Frank
travellers. But in this we were mistaken. No sooner
were our lights put out, than they came upon us from their
hiding-places in such numbers, as to make it one of the
most trying nights we had ever passed. And especially
did they assail our children. And whether it was that
they liked their young blood better, or that the children, in
their sound sleep, made less resistance, I know not, but so[246]
it was, that in the morning their faces were disfigured with
bites, and their eyes so swollen that they could hardly see.
Fortunately, we were not doomed to spend another night
in this boat. We reached Atpi during the following day,
in time to transfer ourselves and baggage to a river boat,
which was about leaving for Cairo. This boat was happily
less infested with the gentry above referred to, and we
made out pretty well as to sleeping.

Atpi is a small village at the place where the canal
leaves the river. It has grown up since the canal was
made. There are some stores and shops, and a number of
persons who attend to the produce and goods that pass and
repass from the canal to the river. We here procured a
boat, and made other necessary arrangements. In all
these boats we had to provide for ourselves, from the beds
we slept on to the fuel with which we cooked our food.
As necessary articles are not to be had at all places, and
especially as the boat may not stop when you find yourself
minus in some needful article, the only sure way is to keep
a good stock on hand. We had our flag, as before, flying
at the mast-head, and could not but feel a little national
pride at the notice which it attracted.

Near Atpi, on the eastern side of the river, is a considerable
town, with some pretty good buildings, and among
them some occupied as factories. There was also a large
building on the western side, where the red fez, now so
much used throughout Turkey, are made. These manufactories
are, we were told, public property. The government
monopolizes all things in this land. The policy may
well be questioned. Possibly in no other way could they
be so soon introduced.

The average height of the banks of the Nile may be
from twelve to sixteen feet. Fields of corn and sugar-cane[247]
were seen on the banks, but not in as great numbers
as I had expected. This in part, however, was accounted
for by the fact, that the time of the rise was at hand, and
their crops were gathered off.

The productiveness of Egypt depends on the annual
overflowing of the Nile. The Nile is the river, and the
only river of Egypt; and beside it, it is said, there is not a
brook, not a spring, of running water in Egypt. There
are wells; for by digging down to nearly the level of the
water in the Nile, water may be obtained at any place.
There is no rain in Egypt. Near the sea coast, as at
Alexandria, light showers may fall, but up in the country
there are none. There may be cloudy weather during the
winter, but no rain. Once every year the Nile rises so as
to cover the greater part of the country. It begins in the
latter part of June, and gradually continues for nearly two
months, then gradually falls to its usual volume of water.
The rise has now begun, but it is perceivable only to those
who are acquainted with the river. The cause of this rise
is supposed to be the great rains, and possibly melting of
snows, in the high country in which its main stream rises;
but the matter is not certain. As the Nile falls, the grain
is sown on the wet ground, and produces most abundantly.

There are many canals, from four to six and eight feet deep,
and wide enough to convey a considerable body of water.
These pass off from the river, and from these, smaller channels
pass in various directions, so as to divide much of the
surface into lots or small fields. These were much more
observable at some places than at others. The design of
these channels, probably, was to bring the water more
generally over the ground than it would otherwise come;
or when the Nile did not rise high enough to cover the
field, the water, by means of these small canals, would[248]
pass in so many directions through the district, as, by percolation,
to moisten the ground more generally than it
otherwise would do.

There were along the river a great many water-melons,
cucumbers, and other vegetables. It reminded me of the
complaint of Israel, in the wilderness, that they were deprived
of the melons and cucumbers of Egypt. Num. xi. 5.

The Nile winds a good deal. It has many of those long
sweeps that characterise the Ohio and Mississippi; and as
the whole country is alluvial, the water at those turns
washes away the banks against which it strikes, while, on
the opposite side of the river, a shoal or a sand bank is
formed. In these places, and they increased as we
ascended, considerable districts lay along the edge of the
water, and only a few feet above it, and on them the
vegetables above named, with many others, were raised in
great numbers. There was usually a small place in these
garden spots built to protect a person from the rain, whose
office it is to prevent pillage, and sell the vegetables to
boat-men and passengers; for almost all the travelling
from Alexandria to Cairo is done in boats on the Nile.
It reminded me of the "cottage in a vineyard,"       "a lodge
in a garden of cucumbers." A little more than half-way,
from Alexandria to Cairo, on the western side of the river,
we saw the end of a new and much larger canal, now
being made in a more direct course to Alexandria. It
will probably intersect the Mahmudieh canal, at some
point south of Alexandria. The southern end is near
where the sands have almost covered the district west of
the Nile. Whether it will pass into the sandy district,
and thus reclaim some of it, and prevent the farther encroachments
of the sand, I know not. There is no doubt
that tillage extended much farther to the west, in some[249]
places, formerly, than at present. The canals and means
of irrigation have been neglected, and the sands have
spread over considerable districts; some of these might no
doubt be reclaimed, were a proper mode followed with
respect to them. This will hardly be done at present, as
there are large parts of Egypt now irrigated, that lie
neglected; the population, with their idle habits, are not
sufficient to cultivate the whole. For a considerable distance
on the west of the river the sands from the desert
covered the banks, and ran down to the edge of the water;
it was a very white, fine sand, and easily moved by the
wind.

A little below the junction of the Rosetta and Damietta
branches of the Nile, which takes place twelve or fifteen
miles below Cairo, the Pasha has begun a great work for
the more perfect irrigation of the Delta, or the district
between the rivers which is thus called. The plan is to
make a strong dam across both branches of the Nile, and
throw the water into a new channel, the bed of which
shall be much more elevated, and thus bring the waters
nearer the level of the country, and of course greatly facilitate
the irrigation of the land at all seasons. The greater
part of the most valuable land of Egypt lies between the
rivers. This part is called the Delta from its likeness to
the Greek letter of that name, which is of a triangular
form. A district of land on both sides of the triangle was
cultivated and productive as far as the waters of the Nile
could be made to reach it; but beyond that, the long
burning suns scorch up vegetation, and convert all into a
waste of barren sand. At some distance in the interior,
both to the east and west, water is found, and there vegetation
exists, but these places are not in the valley of the
Nile.

[250]

Most of the villages we passed were poor and small;
the houses for the most part made of mud or unburnt
brick; sometimes the brick had straw in it. We saw
several places where they had establishments for hatching
eggs. This practice has long prevailed in Egypt. They
spread the eggs in layers on the floor; and have a way
of subjecting them to such a degree and uniformity of heat
as perfects the process of incubation. Their fowls seemed
to me to be inferior both as to size and flavour.

The Nile seemed to me to be about as large as the Ohio at
Cincinnati. It was, however, at its lowest state when
I saw it. The rise began while I was at Cairo, but at
first it is so slow, that a person not acquainted with the
river would probably not observe it for several days. Our
boat, which was not as large as a common steam-boat,
grounded several times in ascending the river. The boatmen
would readily get out in the water and push her off.
This was easily done, as there were no rocks in the river,
but mud and sand banks. The boatmen are a shameless
set and were often, and especially when in the water, in a
state of perfect nudity, and this was the common condition
of the multitudes which we saw bathing in the river.

We had a daily wind up the river, which at times blew
pretty strong. It usually began soon after sunrise, and
increased as the day advanced. Towards night it began to
abate, and nearly ceased soon after sundown. The causes
which give it this regularity we leave to be explained by
those wise men in philosophy who feel bound to give
reasons for all the phenomena of nature. During one or
two months in the year it is said to change its direction,
and blow the other way.

I had several times in the south-west a fine view of the
whirlwinds of the desert; several of them could often be[251]
seen at the same time. A thick column of dust and sand
seemed to run up to the clouds, and then gradually disappear;
at times they would pass with considerable rapidity;
and while thus in quick motion, had a pretty, but
rather singular appearance. While considerably below
Grand Cairo, we had a view of the pyramids. Their
tapering points ran high in the air, and broke the smooth
outline of our southern horizon.

Grand Cairo stands on the western bank of the Nile,
and at the distance of above a mile from the river. One of
its large suburbs, called Bulack, is on the river, and may be
considered its port. There the boats lie, and there much
of the business of the town is transacted. For several miles
before we reached Cairo, we were passing gardens and
country-houses, some of which are of a superior kind.
Cairo is rather an assemblage of towns than one great and
continuous city; its parts lie contiguous to each other, as
chance and caprice may have decided. Close to the south-east
side of it a range of hills rises, the first and almost the
only hills that we saw in Egypt       those back of the pyramids
of Gheza excepted       on a part of these hills the
citadel is situate, which commands the city, and is a place
of considerable strength.

Between the town and the river there lies a large open
space       immense piles of rubbish disfigured some parts of
it. The Pasha is making improvements here that will add
much to the beauty of this open space       he is levelling it,
and with the rubbish filling up low places, and making
wide, elevated roads across it in various directions, and
having it planted with trees. A large canal crossed this
place; many people were employed in cleaning it out, and
putting it in order to receive the waters from the Nile.
There is also within the city, and before the palace, an open[252]
space of considerable size, which has lately had much
labour bestowed on it. Elevated roads or causeways are
made round it and through it, and their edges set with
trees, which give the whole a pretty appearance. The
water from the Nile, when at its height, is let into this
square; but the elevated parts are designed to be above
the waters, and afford pleasant walks for the idlers and
loungers, which are found even in Egypt.

The pyramids, so much talked of, lie near Grand Cairo,
and it would have argued a great want of curiosity not to
have visited them when so near. A few days ago, we made
a visit to those of Gheza, which lie on the west side of the
Nile, and in full view of the city. We set off about six in
the morning, and rode up the river to the upper part of old
Cairo; this took us about an hour. We then crossed the
Nile in boats, to a small old village called Gheza, which
gives its name to this cluster of pyramids. We then had
the wide river bottom of the Nile to cross; this took us
about two hours. The river being low, there was no water
in the several deep and wide canals that pass through this
river bottom, and we were able to cross them. This shortened
our ride much. We passed several remains of
villages on this plain. As we drew near the last village,
which seemed little better than a pile of ruins, several
Bedouin Arabs came out, with nothing but a long shirt on,
and ran as hard as they could until they met us, and urged
us to employ them as our guides. It now appeared, that
it was a race among themselves, on the plan that those who
first reached us, were considered as having the right to be
employed as a guide and get the pay. As we had a cawass
with us, whom we brought from Cairo to manage all such
matters, and among other things to save us from the annoyance
which these Bedouins at times give travellers, we[253]
left it for him to make such a bargain with them as he
thought best. He engaged one or two, and let the remainder
know that we did not need their aid. We saw, at a
distance on our right, a line of arches on the plain, and
a bridge-like place over them, the uses of which we could
not ascertain.

The pyramids stand on the first rise after leaving the
river flats. The ridge of that place may be from one hundred
and fifty to two hundred feet. The ground on which
the large one stands (the Cheops) is nearly level. The
pyramid is square, and stands to the four cardinal points.
Each side, its base is said to be seven hundred feet, while
its height is only six hundred. It seems to be a solid mass
of rock, excepting the small rooms which I shall presently
mention. The plan on which it is built is singular. A
large platform is laid down, seven hundred feet square       this
is the first row; the stone is nearly three feet in
thickness. A second row is laid on of a similar size. This
row is not laid out to the edge of the other, but falls back
all round about eighteen inches. The third and fourth
and following rows are laid in the same manner       forming
stairs. There are about two hundred rows of stones, which
average nearly three feet in thickness, and terminate in a
small flat at the top of about thirty feet square. The
ascent is usually made at the north-east corner. About
half-way up there is a small room, which seems designed as
a resting place. There have evidently been some stones
thrown from the top, a part of one row being left, and
possibly one stone of a second row at the south-east
corner. It took me not quite half an hour to ascend; this
included the several stops in order to rest. From the top
I had a most splendid view, as to space       Grand Cairo and
all the villages and gardens about it; the valley of the Nile[254]
far to the north; the several groups of pyramids, and the
palm trees that lay to the south, and in the region of
ancient Memphis. The descent required about as much
time, but was attended with less difficulty than the ascent.
The whole, with the time spent on the top, occupied about
an hour, and did not seem to have half the peril or labour
that some have represented. The entrance to the interior
is on the north side. We went to the mouth and examined
it, but, on the whole, concluded we would not go in; the
descent is long, and nothing to be seen within, but one or
two empty rooms. While the rocks of which the pyramids
are built, are limestone of the secondary formation, as is
manifest from the shells in it, the passage is lined with
polished Egyptian granite; the same is said to be the case
with the rooms. The entrance of the passage may be fifty
feet above the ground, but it descends as one enters.

A little to the south-west is a second pyramid, nearly as
large as that of Cheops. It is sharp at the top, and cannot,
with ease, be ascended. To the south is a small one.
There were in all directions tombs, many of them of most
enormous size. The pyramids are in the midst of a large
grave-yard. We went up the hill to the north-west some
distance, and visited several rooms that were full of hieroglyphics.
Passing round the southern side of the pyramids,
we examined several places where excavations had recently
been made. Some old monuments, that had been covered
with sand, were laid bare; and, from the bottom of some
deep well-like places, several most beautiful sarcophagi had
been raised       two of black porphyry, beautifully polished,
and covered with hieroglyphics, lay on the ground; others
had probably been removed. We then visited the Sphynx,
and took our lunch under the shade of its head. It has a
lion's body, in a couching posture, with the head and face[255]
of a Nubian female, and is of most enormous dimensions.
The head about ten feet in diameter. The height from the
ground, and the length of the body, in proportion. It is
hewn out of a rock, which is the soft limestone, and has
much disintegrated; the features are much injured. The
back is almost wholly covered with sand, which has blown
in from the desert. As we crossed the low grounds to the
river, on our return, we had a fine specimen of that wonderful
phenomenon called the mirage. From some cause,
the air near the ground assumes the appearance of water;
the similarity is such, that persons are often deceived, and
are confident that it is water, when seen at a little distance.
We had crossed the plain about nine or ten o'clock A.M.,
and there was no appearance of water; but now, between
one and two P.M., there were many places, at some distance,
that had the precise appearance of water. In some cases,
the spots that had this appearance were but a few inches,
or one or two feet in width, and looked precisely like
puddles of water after a rain: at other places whole acres
seemed covered with water, and on several occasions, it
was round the roots of trees; which seemed growing out of
it. I had, on one or two occasions, seen the same as I
came up the Nile. At a considerable village on the western
side of the river, just below where the sands come in
so near the river, our boat stopped, and while the captain
and part of the crew went into the village, I ascended the
bank, and walked to a place at a little distance that was
more elevated than the other parts of the plain. It gave
me a fine view of the face of the country; but I was surprised
to see, towards the north-west, an extensive portion,
as far as the eye could reach, that appeared a lake of water.
In several places there were clusters of palms growing out
of it. I had not seen on any map a lake marked in that[256]
place, nor had I heard of any such thing. I wondered if
it could be the mirage; the appearance was so perfectly
like water, that it was hard to believe it could be anything
else. On returning to the bank, I inquired of some one if
it was water that I had seen, and was assured that there
was no water in that direction, but that it was a curious
appearance in the air. I will leave it to the philosopher
to explain this matter. The ruins of what is said to be
ancient Heliopolis lie but a short distance from Cairo; we
did not, however, visit them; the remains above ground
are so few, as hardly to repay the trouble of a ride to them.
The sandy deserts are to the east and south of Cairo, and
the whole way from that city to Suez on the Red Sea, a
distance of about sixty miles, is a cheerless waste of barren
sand. The remains of an old canal can be traced, it is
said, most of the way from the Nile, a little south of Cairo,
to Suez, and it is supposed that it might be reopened.
Much has lately been said about the Pasha's making a
railroad from Cairo to that point, and I was assured some
materials for that purpose were brought from England;
but nothing as yet has been done, and probably years will
pass before the plan is carried into effect.

We had several pleasant interviews with the mission
families at Cairo; less, however, than we had hoped, and
would have had, but for the sickness of some of their
number. They are mostly Germans, in the employ of the
Church Missionary Society. Their attention is principally,
but not exclusively, directed to the Christian sects in the
country. Miss H. has lately, at the special invitation of
the Pasha, opened a school in the harem, and is giving
instruction to the females of the Pasha's family. Thus far
it has been well received; what may be its result, time
alone will show. About the time we reached Cairo, several[257]
of the missionaries of the Church Missionary Society,
who had for some years been labouring in Abyssinia,
returned from that country. Some difficulty had arisen,
growing out of the intrigues of persons unfriendly to
them, which made it advisable for them, for a time at
least, to leave that country. It was hoped that before
long they would be able to return and resume their
labours.

The Pasha has a number of schools at this place, and
various manufactories and establishments, which no doubt
are doing good. Whether the good will equal what has
been expected from them, may be doubted. His improvements
and innovations are certainly tending to produce
changes in the Moslem manners, habits, and modes of
thinking, which will in part remove the obstacles in the
way of introducing the gospel among them; "but he
meaneth not so, neither does his heart think so." While
the great body of the Egyptians are Moslems, there are a
number of the Christian sects to be found here       as the
Armenians, Greeks, Copts, Latins, and perhaps some
others. The state of all these sects is much like what it
is through the East       the life and power of the gospel is
not known. The Church Missionary Society have for
many years maintained a mission at Grand Cairo; they
have distributed the Scriptures and other books, published
at their mission press at Malta       conducted schools       talked
and preached to the people. Their success has been
but moderate. At present, their schools are in a pretty
prosperous condition, and their field of usefulness seems
more encouraging.

Grand Cairo is much the largest town in Egypt, but its
precise population is not known. A fire broke out in the
Frank quarter, (the place where most of the Franks live,)[258]
a few days before we arrived, and destroyed several hundred
houses and much property.

The Copts have a curious custom about making their
Patriarch. He is always taken from a particular monastic
establishment. When chosen, he refuses to serve, and
they literally beat him until he gives his consent. The
Abyssinians receive their Patriarch from Egypt; and after
having been chosen, and even gone into Abyssinia, he will
refuse to serve, and deny that he is the person sent to be
their Patriarch, until they give him a sound drubbing,
when he will agree to receive the office. There is a
strange mixture of childish folly and weakness in such a
practice.

I was much struck with the immense numbers of water-carriers,
employed in bringing water from the Nile; some
to deal out to individuals by the cupful, some to sell to
families by the load, and others to water the streets before
the houses of their employers. There were hundreds, and
possibly thousands, thus employed. The common goat-skins,
taken off nearly whole, and sewed up, excepting a
small place, was the usual vessel. This they generally
carried on their backs, but some used donkeys, and others
had camels, with enormous leather bags, made much like
saddle-bags, that would carry a barrel or more of water.

The range of the thermometer at Alexandria was from
74° to 76°. There was great uniformity, except when a
sherack prevailed, which raised it several degrees. We
had one while in the lazaretta, which covered us with
dust, and increased the heat six or eight degrees; it did
not last long. As we ascended the river, there was a considerable
rise of the thermometer; and at this place it
stands from 92° to 94°; and it is not so warm now, I am
told, as is usual at this season.

LETTER XXIII.



Alexandria, July 14.


A little before we left Cairo on our return, I had a
disagreement with the captain in whose boat I had gone
up from Atfi. On reaching Cairo, I was induced, in part
owing to the fire which was raging in the Frank quarter
of the town, to think I had better not take rooms in that
quarter, as otherwise I might probably have done. The
captain, who had been wishing to engage to take me back
to Atfi, expressed his willingness that I should remain in
his boat, retain the use of his cabin, and he would take
me back for what he received for bringing me up; and
engaged to be ready to start back at the time I named.
When the time drew near at which we were to set off, I
found that he was not likely to be ready to go, as he had
not discharged the loading which he brought up. It came
also to my knowledge, through Angelo, that he intended
to make a special charge for the use of the cabin, which I
fully understood was a part of the accommodation he was
to find me. On inquiry, I found that thus it was; and the
prospect was that I would be detained, as well as greatly
overcharged. I told him, as we had misunderstood each
other, we must have a new bargain. I would agree to the
bargain as I understood it; but not as he now explained it.
He declared he would not agree to it but as he understood
it. I let him know I would leave his boat, paying him
for the time I had used the cabin. On inquiry I found
another boat was about to start at the time that I had fixed
on, and made my arrangements to leave him. This took[260]
place near night, and the captain changed his tone, and
declared I should not leave his boat. He would not allow
his men to hand my baggage; forbade the men of the other
boat that was hard by to set foot on his deck. The English
consul was fully engaged with taking care of the effects
of the Franks who had been burned out; and, moreover,
night came on, and we had no way to get word to him. I
threatened the captain with a complaint through the consul;
but he let me know he cared not for the consul. Poor
Angelo was in a great fright. He always had a fear of
the Turks, and now all his fears came over him. I did not
myself feel altogether comfortable. There I was with my
wife and three little children, in the cabin of a boat, the
captain and crew of which were Turks, and had not only
abused me, but positively refused to let me leave it. I had
but one servant, and he was much frightened. There was
no alternative; we had to stay and did stay that night, and
that without any molestation. At the dawn of day, the
crew were at work unloading, and getting ready to set off.
I had no intention, however, of remaining in the power of
a captain who had shown me so little respect. I found
means to get word to a cawass of the consul's, who was
often employed near where our boat lay; and through his
interference had my baggage landed per force, paid the
captain what the cawass said was right, and went on
board the other boat with my family. When the captain
found that leave him I would, he, Turk-like, submitted to
it with more quietness than I had expected. We were all
glad to get out of the boat, after the dispute, and none of
us more so than Angelo, who did not seem to think his
head was safe on his shoulders, until he was safely on board
another boat.

The vessel in which we took passage to Atfi had two[261]
giraffes on board, destined for the United States. We did
not see them until we went on board the boat. They are
a mild and inoffensive animal, and feed on dates, bread, and
hay. They were under the special care of a mustapha
or janissary of the U. S. Consul, who had engaged to
accompany them to the United States. He had with him
two Arabs, for the twofold purpose of waiting on himself,
and taking care of the giraffes.

The wind up the river was so strong, that we found it
much more difficult to get down than we had found it to
ascend; and but for the energetic character of Mustapha,
who had special orders to be in Alexandria by such a day,
we would, in all probability, have had a long passage. He
hurried, and scolded, and used his cowskin freely on the
crew, hardly sparing the captain, with whom he had some
terrible quarrels. The wind was much against us, and we
had a few days that were most oppressively hot. At times
we were obliged to lie by, and the wind covered us with
dust and sand. We at last reached this place, but it took
us nearly half as long again as it did to go up. We did
not get back, however, without experiencing some of the
evils of travelling in Egypt. The hot winds and dust
met with on our return, had given sore eyes to all our
children. Some of them could hardly see; and Angelo,
who had been our factotum in all our travels, was entirely
laid up with the same complaint; and under this affliction
his heart began to fail him as to the long voyage on
which we were about to enter; and he fairly intimated
that he felt like changing his purpose, and remaining in
the East. He had lived with me above two years. In
all my journeys, and travels, and residences, Angelo never
left me. He knew enough of English to understand the[262]
directions I gave him, and enough of Arabic to have intercourse
with the people. I always found him honest, and
faithful, and attentive to my wants and interest. I tried
again and again to teach him to read, but it really seemed
that his talents did not lie that way; after going over the
same lesson twenty times, he still could not make it out;
and without losing his book, he gradually fell into the way
of not using it. He was raised a Catholic, as most of the
Maltese are, but had fallen out with his priest before he
left Smyrna, and seemed not inclined to have much to do
with his church. He generally attended family worship,
and either the English or Arabic preaching, but showed
a disposition to let little things keep him away. On the
whole, he had less religious feeling than his advantages
ought to have produced. He always showed much attachment
to our children, was a good nurse, and the children
loved him. From the early part of our acquaintance,
he declared his wish to accompany me home; and up to
the day of our reaching Alexandria, I did not doubt that
he would do so. I did not indeed see how we could do
without him. But now his heart seemed to fail him; his
eyes were grievously sore       and, possibly, as the time
drew near, he may have had an increase of fears as to
how he could live, where no one could understand his language.
I am not sure, indeed, that a more special cause
existed. He had manifested much kindness of feeling for a
young female servant that had spent some time in our
family before we left Beyroot. I could not but think that
the thoughts of having so many thousand miles between
them, had an influence which he did not own, and possibly
hardly admitted to his own mind. However that
may be, he expressed a desire to remain, and we were[263]
able to make such arrangements as allowed of it. He
continued his attention to the last day we stayed, and carried
with him our best wishes and prayers, that he prove
as good a servant of Jesus Christ as he has been to us;
and meet us again, where all is love, and purity, and
peace.


THE END.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
