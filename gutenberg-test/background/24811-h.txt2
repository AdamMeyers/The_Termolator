Iceland is a little country far north
in the cold sea. Men found it and
went there to live more than a thousand
years ago. During the warm season they
used to fish and make fish-oil and hunt
sea-birds and gather feathers and tend
their sheep and make hay. But the winters
were long and dark and cold. Men
and women and children stayed in the
house and carded and spun and wove
and knit. A whole family sat for hours
around the fire in the middle of the room.
That fire gave the only light. Shadows
flitted in the dark corners. Smoke curled
along the high beams in the ceiling.
The children sat on the dirt floor close
by the fire. The grown people were on a
long narrow bench that they had pulled
up to the light and warmth. Everybody's
hands were busy with wool. The work
left their minds free to think and their
lips to talk. What was there to talk
about? The summer's fishing, the killing
of a fox, a voyage to Norway. But[10]
the people grew tired of this little gossip.
Fathers looked at their children
and thought:

"They are not learning much. What
will make them brave and wise? What will
teach them to love their country and old
Norway? Will not the stories of battles,
of brave deeds, of mighty men, do this?"

So, as the family worked in the red
fire-light, the father told of the kings of
Norway, of long voyages to strange lands,
of good fights. And in farmhouses all
through Iceland these old tales were told
over and over until everybody knew them
and loved them. Some men could sing
and play the harp. This made the stories
all the more interesting. People called
such men "skalds," and they called their
songs "sagas."

Every midsummer there was a great
meeting. Men from all over Iceland
came to it and made laws. During the
day there were rest times, when no business
was going on. Then some skald
would take his harp and walk to a large
stone or a knoll and stand on it and begin
a song of some brave deed of an old[11]
Norse hero. At the first sound of the
harp and the voice, men came running
from all directions, crying out:

"The skald! The skald! A saga!"

They stood about for hours and listened.
They shouted applause. When
the skald was tired, some other man
would come up from the crowd and sing
or tell a story. As the skald stepped
down from his high position, some rich
man would rush up to him and say:

"Come and spend next winter at my
house. Our ears are thirsty for song."

So the best skalds traveled much and
visited many people. Their songs made
them welcome everywhere. They were
always honored with good seats at a feast.
They were given many rich gifts. Even
the King of Norway would sometimes
send across the water to Iceland, saying
to some famous skald:

"Come and visit me. You shall not go
away empty-handed. Men say that the
sweetest songs are in Iceland. I wish to
hear them."

These tales were not written. Few
men wrote or read in those days. Skalds[12]
learned songs from hearing them sung.
At last people began to write more easily.
Then they said:

"These stories are very precious. We
must write them down to save them
from being forgotten."

After that many men in Iceland spent
their winters in writing books. They
wrote on sheepskin; vellum, we call it.
Many of these old vellum books have
been saved for hundreds of years, and
are now in museums in Norway. Some
leaves are lost, some are torn, all are
yellow and crumpled. But they are precious.
They tell us all that we know
about that olden time. There are the
very words that the men of Iceland wrote
so long ago&mdash;stories of kings and of battles
and of ship-sailing. Some of those
old stories I have told in this book.

The Baby

King Halfdan lived in Norway
long ago. One morning his queen
said to him:

"I had a strange dream last night.
I thought that I stood in the grass before
my bower.[1] I pulled a thorn from my
dress. As I held it in my fingers, it grew
into a tall tree. The trunk was thick
and red as blood, but the lower limbs
were fair and green, and the highest ones
were white. I thought that the branches
of this great tree spread so far that they
covered all Norway and even more."

"A strange dream," said King Halfdan.
"Dreams are the messengers of the
gods. I wonder what they would tell
us," and he stroked his beard in thought.

Some time after that a serving-woman
came into the feast hall where King
Halfdan was. She carried a little white
bundle in her arms.[16]

"My lord," she said, "a little son is
just born to you."

"Ha!" cried the king, and he jumped
up from the high seat and hastened forward
until he stood before the woman.

"Show him to me!" he shouted, and
there was joy in his voice.

The serving-woman put down her bundle
on the ground and turned back the
cloth. There was a little naked baby.
The king looked at it carefully.

"It is a goodly youngster," he said, and
smiled. "Bring Ivar and Thorstein."[2]

They were captains of the king's soldiers.
Soon they came.

"Stand as witnesses," Halfdan said.

Then he lifted the baby in his arms,
while the old serving-woman brought a
silver bowl of water. The king dipped
his hand into it and sprinkled the baby,
saying:

"I own this baby for my son. He
shall be called Harald. My naming gift
to him is ten pounds of gold."

Then the woman carried the baby
back to the queen's room.

[17]

"I own this baby for my son. He shall be called Harald"

[18]"My lord owns him for his son," she
said. "And no wonder! He is perfect
in every limb."

The queen looked at him and smiled
and remembered her dream and thought:

"That great tree! Can it be this little
baby of mine?"

[19]





The Tooth Thrall

When Harald was seven months old
he cut his first tooth. Then his
father said:

"All the young of my herds, lambs
and calves and colts, that have been born
since this baby was born I this day give
to him. I also give to him this thrall,
Olaf. These are my tooth-gifts to my
son."

The boy grew fast, for as soon as he
could walk about he was out of doors
most of the time. He ran in the woods
and climbed the hills and waded in the
creek. He was much with his tooth
thrall, for the king had said to Olaf:

"Be ever at his call."

Now this Olaf was full of stories, and
Harald liked to hear them.

"Come out to Aegir's Rock, Olaf, and
tell me stories," he said almost every day.

So they started off across the hills.
The man wore a long, loose coat of white[20]
wool, belted at the waist with a strap.
He had on coarse shoes and leather leggings.
Around his neck was an iron
collar welded together so that it could
not come off. On it were strange marks,
called runes, that said:

"Olaf, thrall of Halfdan."

But Harald's clothes were gay. A cape
of gray velvet hung from his shoulders.
It was fastened over his breast with great
gold buckles. When it waved in the
wind, a scarlet lining flashed out, and the
bottom of a little scarlet jacket showed.
His feet and legs were covered with
gray woolen tights. Gold lacings wound
around his legs from his shoes to his
knees. A band of gold held down his
long, yellow hair.

It was a wild country that these
two were walking over. They were
climbing steep, rough hills. Some of
them seemed made all of rock, with a
little earth lying in spots. Great rocks
hung out from them, with trees growing
in their cracks. Some big pieces
had broken off and rolled down the
hill.[21]

"Thor broke them," Olaf said. "He
rides through the sky and hurls his
hammer at clouds and at mountains.
That makes the thunder and the lightning
and cracks the hills. His hammer
never misses its aim, and it always
comes back to his hand and is eager
to go again."

When they reached the top of the hill
they looked back. Far below was a soft,
green valley. In front of it the sea came
up into the land and made a fiord. On
each side of the fiord high walls of rock
stood up and made the water black with
shadow. All around the valley were high
hills with dark pines on them. Far off
were the mountains. In the valley were
Halfdan's houses around their square
yard.

"How little our houses look down
there!" Harald said. "But I can almost&mdash;yes,
I can see the red dragon on the
roof of the feast hall. Do you remember
when I climbed up and sat on his head,
Olaf?"

He laughed and kicked his heels and
ran on.



"He threw back his cape and drew a little dagger from his belt"

[23]At last they came to Aegir's Rock and
walked up on its flat top. Harald went
to the edge and looked over. A ragged
wall of rock reached down, and two hundred
feet below was the black water of
the fiord. Olaf watched him for a while,
then he said:

"No whitening of your cheek, Harald?
Good! A boy that can face the fall of
Aegir's Rock will not be afraid to face
the war flash when he is a man."

"Ho, I am not afraid of the war flash
now," cried Harald.

He threw back his cape and drew a
little dagger from his belt.

"See!" he cried; "does this not flash
like a sword? And I am not afraid. But
after all, this is a baby thing! When I
am eight years old I will have a sword, a
sharp tooth of war."

He swung his dagger as though it
were a long sword. Then he ran and sat
on a rock by Olaf.

"Why is this Aegir's Rock?" he asked.

"You know that Asgard is up in the
sky," Olaf said. "It is a wonderful city
where the golden houses of the gods are[24]
in the golden grove. A high wall runs
all around it. In the house of Odin,
the All-father, there is a great feast hall
larger than the whole earth. Its name is
Valhalla. It has five hundred doors.
The rafters are spears. The roof is
thatched with shields. Armor lies on the
benches. In the high seat sits Odin, a
golden helmet on his head, a spear in his
hand. Two wolves lie at his feet. At
his right hand and his left sit all the gods
and goddesses, and around the hall sit
thousands and thousands of men, all the
brave ones that have ever died.

"Now it is good to be in Valhalla; for
there is mead there better than men can
brew, and it never runs out. And there
are skalds that sing wonderful songs that
men never heard. And before the doors
of Valhalla is a great meadow where the
warriors fight every day and get glorious
and sweet wounds and give many. And
all night they feast, and their wounds
heal. But none may go to Valhalla except
warriors that have died bravely in
battle. Men who die from sickness go
with women and children and cowards[25]
to Niflheim. There Hela, who is queen,
always sneers at them, and a terrible cold
takes hold of their bones, and they sit
down and freeze.

"Years ago Aegir was a great warrior.
Aegir the Big-handed, they called him.
In many a battle his sword had sung,
and he had sent many warriors to Valhalla.
Many swords had bit into his
flesh and left marks there, but never a
one had struck him to death. So his hair
grew white and his arms thin. There
was peace in that country then, and Aegir
sorrowed, saying:

"'I am old. Battles are still. Must I
die in bed like a woman? Shall I not see
Valhalla?'

"Now thus did Odin say long ago:

"'If a man is old and is come near
death and cannot die in fight, let him
find death in some brave way and he
shall feast with me in Valhalla.'

"So one day Aegir came to this
rock.

"'A deed to win Valhalla!' he cried.

"Then he drew his sword and flashed
it over his head and held his shield high[26]
above him, and leaped out into the air
and died in the water of the fiord."

"Ho!" cried Harald, jumping to his
feet. "I think that Odin stood up before
his high seat and welcomed that man
gladly when he walked through the door
of Valhalla."

"So the songs say," replied Olaf, "for
skalds still sing of that deed all over
Norway."





[27]





Olaf's Farm

At another time Harald asked:

"What is your country, Olaf? Have
you always been a thrall?"

The thrall's eyes flashed.

"When you are a man," he said,
"and go a-viking to Denmark, ask men
whether they ever heard of Olaf the
Crafty. There, far off, is my country,
across the water. My father was Gudbrand
the Big. Two hundred warriors
feasted in his hall and followed him to
battle. Ten sons sat at meat with him,
and I was the youngest. One day he said:

"'You are all grown to be men.
There is not elbow-room here for so
many chiefs. The eldest of you shall
have my farm when I die. The rest of
you, off a-viking!'

"He had three ships. These he gave
to three of my brothers. But I stayed
that spring and built me a boat. I made
her for only twenty oars because I[28]
thought few men would follow me; for I
was young, fifteen years old. I made her
in the likeness of a dragon. At the prow
I carved the head with open mouth and
forked tongue thrust out. I painted the
eyes red for anger.

"'There, stand so!' I said, 'and glare
and hiss at my foes.'

"In the stern I curved the tail up
almost as high as the head. There I put
the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the
rudder. On the breast and sides I carved
the dragon's scales. Then I painted it
all black and on the tip of every scale I
put gold. I called her 'Waverunner.'
There she sat on the rollers, as fair a ship
as I ever saw.

"The night that it was finished I went
to my father's feast. After the meats
were eaten and the mead-horns came
round, I stood up from my bench and
raised my drinking-horn[3] high and spoke
with a great voice:

"'This is my vow: I will sail to Norway
and I will harry the coast and fill
my boat with riches. Then I will get[29]
me a farm and will winter in that land.
Now who will follow me?'

"'He is but a boy,' the men said. 'He
has opened his mouth wider than he can
do.'

"But others jumped to their feet with
their mead-horns in their hands. Thirty
men, one after another, raised their horns
and said:

"'I will follow this lad, and I will not
turn back so long as he and I live!'

"On the next morning we got into my
dragon and started. I sat high in the
pilot's seat. As our boat flashed down
the rollers into the water I made this
song and sang it:


"'The dragon runs.
Where will she steer?
Where swords will sing,
Where spears will bite,
Where I shall laugh.'


"So we harried the coast of Norway.
We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
Many men we found overburdened with
gold. Then I said:

"'My dragon's belly is never full,' and
on board went the gold.[30]

"Oh! it is better to live on the sea and
let other men raise your crops and cook
your meals. A house smells of smoke, a
ship smells of frolic. From a house you
see a sooty roof, from a ship you see
Valhalla.

"Up and down the water we went to
get much wealth and much frolic. After
a while my men said:

"'What of the farm, Olaf?'

"'Not yet,' I answered. 'Viking is
better for summer. When the ice comes,
and our dragon cannot play, then we will
get our farm and sit down.'

"At last the winter came, and I said
to my men:

"'Now for the farm. I have my eye
on one up the coast a way in King Halfdan's
country.'

"So we set off for it. We landed late
at night and pulled our boat up on shore
and walked quietly to the house. It was
rather a wealthy farm, for there were
stables and a storehouse and a smithy at
the sides of the house. There was but
one door to the house. We went to it,
and I struck it with my spear.



"I struck my shield against the door so that it made a great clanging"

[32]"'Hello! Ho! Hello!' I shouted, and
my men made a great din.

"At last some one from inside said:

"'Who calls?'

"'I call,' I answered. 'Open! or you
will think it Thor who calls,' and I struck
my shield against the door so that it
made a great clanging.

"The door opened only a little, but I
pushed it wide and leaped into the room.
It was so dark that I could see nothing
but a few sparks on the hearth. I stood
with my back to the wall; for I wanted no
sword reaching out of the dark for me.

"'Now start up the fire,' I said.

"'Come, come!' I called, when no one
obeyed. 'A fire! This is cold welcome
for your guests.'

"My men laughed.

"'Yes, a stingy host! He acts as
though he had not expected us.'

"But now the farmer was blowing on
the coals and putting on fresh wood.
Soon it blazed up, and we could see about
us. We were in a little feast hall,[4] with
its fire down the middle of it. There[33]
were benches for twenty men along each
side. The farmer crouched by the fire,
afraid to move. On a bench in a far
corner were a dozen people huddled
together.

"'Ho, thralls!' I called to them. 'Bring
in the table. We are hungry.'

"Off they ran through a door at the
back of the hall. My men came in and
lay down by the fire and warmed themselves,
but I set two of them as guards at
the door.

"'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one,
'why such a long face? Do you not think
we shall be merry company?'

"'We came only to cheer you,' said
another. 'What man wants to spend the
winter with no guests?'

"'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting
up. 'Here comes something that will be
a welcome guest to my stomach.'

"The thralls were bringing in a great
pot of meat. They set up a crane over
the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we
sat and watched it boil while we joked.
At last the supper began. The farmer
sat gloomily on the bench and would not[34]
eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw
us putting potfuls of his good beef and
basket-loads of bread into our big mouths.
When the tables were taken out and the
mead-horns came round, I stood up and
raised my horn and said to the farmer:

"'You would not eat with us. You
cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink
this to your health.'

"Then I drank half of the hornful
and sent the rest across the fire to the
farmer. He took it and smiled, saying:

"'Since it is to my health, I will drink
it. I thought that all this night's work
would be my death.'

"'Oh, do not fear that!' I laughed,
'for a dead man sets no tables.'

"So we drank and all grew merrier.
At last I stood up and said:

"'I like this little taste of your hospitality,
friend farmer. I have decided to
accept more of it.'

"My men roared with laughter.

"'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for
that, farmer. Did you ever have such a
lordly guest before?'

"I went on:[35]

"'Now there is no fun in having guests
unless they keep you company and make
you merry. So I will give out this law:
that my men shall never leave you alone.
Hakon there shall be your constant companion,
friend farmer. He shall not
leave you day or night, whether you are
working or playing or sleeping. Leif
and Grim shall be the same kind of
friends to your two sons.'

"I named nine others and said:

"'And these shall follow your thralls
in the same way. Now, am I not careful
to make your time go merrily?'

"So I set guards over every one in that
house. Not once all that winter did they
stir out of sight of some of us. So no
tales got out to the neighbors. Besides,
it was a lonely place, and by good luck
no one came that way. Oh! that was fat
and easy living.

"Well, after we had been there for a
long time, Hakon came in to the feast
one night and said:

"'I heard a cuckoo to-day!'

"'It is the call to go a-viking,'
I said.[36]

"All my men put their hands to their
mouths and shouted. Their eyes danced.
Big Thorleif stood up and stretched himself.

"'I am stiff with long sitting,' he said.
'I itch for a fight.'

"I turned to the farmer.

"'This is our last feast with you,' I
said.

"'Well,' he laughed, 'this has been
the busiest winter I ever spent, and the
merriest. May good luck go with you!'

"'By the beard of Odin!' I cried; 'you
have taken our joke like a man.'

"My men pounded the table with their
fists.

"'By the hammer of Thor!' shouted
Grim. 'Here is no stingy coward. He is
a man fit to carry my drinking-horn, the
horn of a sea-rover and a sword-swinger.
Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it
into the farmer's hand. 'May you drink
heart's-ease from it for many years.
And with it I leave you a name, Sif the
Friendly. I shall hope to drink with you
sometime in Valhalla.'

"Then all my men poured around that[37]
farmer and clapped him on the shoulder
and piled things upon him, saying:

"'Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly.'

"'And here is a bracelet.'

"'A sword would not be ashamed to
hang at your side.'

"I took five great bracelets of gold
from our treasure chest and gave them
to him.

"The old man's eyes opened wide at
all these things, and at the same time he
laughed.

"'May Odin send me such guests
every winter!' he said.

"Early next morning we shook hands
with our host and boarded the 'Waverunner'
and sailed off.

"'Where shall we go?' my men asked.

"'Let the gods decide,' I said, and
tossed up my spear.

"When it fell on the deck it pointed
up-shore, so I steered in that direction.
That is the best way to decide, for the
spear will always point somewhere, and
one thing is as good as another. That
time it pointed us into your father's ships.
They closed in battle with us and killed[38]
my men and sunk my ship and dragged
me off a prisoner. They were three
against one, or they might have tasted
something more bitter at our hands.
They took me before King Halfdan.

"'Here,' they said, 'is a rascal who has
been harrying our coasts. We sunk his
ship and men, but him we brought to you.'

"'A robber viking?' said the king, and
scowled at me.

"I threw back my head and laughed.

"'Yes. And with all your fingers it
took you a year to catch me.'

"The king frowned more angrily.

"'Saucy, too?' he said. 'Well, thieves
must die. Take him out, Thorkel, and
let him taste your sword.'

"Your mother, the queen, was standing
by. Now she put her hand on his
arm and smiled and said:

"'He is only a lad. Let him live. And
would he not be a good gift for our baby?'

"Your father thought a moment, then
looked at your mother and smiled.

"'Soft heart!' he said gently to her;
then to Thorkel, 'Well, let him go,
Thorkel!'[39]

"Then he turned to me again, frowning.

"'But, young sharp-tongue, now that
we have caught you we will put you into
a trap that you cannot get out of. Weld
an iron collar on his neck.'

"So I lived and now am your tooth
thrall. Well, it is the luck of war. But
by the chair of Odin, I kept my vow!"

"Yes!" cried Harald, jumping to his
feet. "And had a joke into the bargain.
Ah! sometime I will make a brave vow
like that."

Olaf's Fight With Havard

At another time Harald said:

"Tell me of a fight, Olaf. I want
to hear about the music of swords."

Olaf's eyes blazed.

"I will tell you of our fight with King
Havard," he said.

"One dark night we had landed at a
farm. We left our 'Waverunner' in the
water with three men to guard her. The
rest of us went into the house. The
farmer met us at the door, but he died
by Thorkel's sword. The others we shut
into their beds.[5] The door at each end of
the hall we had barred on the inside so
that nobody could surprise us. We were
busy going through the cupboards and
shouting at our good luck. But suddenly
we heard a shout outside:

"'Thor and Havard!'

"Then there was a great beating at
the doors.[41]

"'He has two hundred fighters with
him,' said Grim; 'for we saw his ships last
night. Thirty against two hundred! We
shall all drink in Valhalla to-night.'

"'Well,' I cried, 'Odin shall have no
unwilling guest in me.'

"'Nor in me,' cried Hakon.

"'Nor in me,' shouted Thorkel.

"And that shout went all around, and
we drew out our swords and caught up
our shields.

"'Hot work is ahead of us,' said
Hakon. 'Besides, we must leave none
of this mead for Havard. Lend a hand,
some one.'

"Then he and another pulled out a
great tub that sat on the floor of the cupboard.

"'I drink to Valhalla to-night,' cried
Thorkel the Thirsty, and he plunged his
horn deep into the tub.

"When he brought it up, his sleeve
was dripping and the sweet mead was
running over from the horn.

"'Sloven!' cried Hakon, and he struck
Thorkel with his fist and knocked him
over into the cupboard.[42]

"He fell against the wooden wall at
the back, and a carved panel swung open
behind him. He dropped down head
first. In a minute he put his head out
of the hole again. We all stood staring.

"'I think it is a secret passage,' he
said.

"'We will try it,' I answered in a
whisper. 'Throw dirt on the fire. It
must be dark.'

"So we dug up dirt from the earth
floor and smothered the fire. All this
time there was a terrible shouting and
hammering at the doors, but they were
of heavy logs and stood.

"'I with four more will guard this
door,' I said, pointing to the east end.

"Immediately four men stepped to
my side.

"'And I will guard the other,' Hakon
said, and four went with him.

"'The rest of you, down the hole!' I
said. 'Close the door after you. If luck
is with us we will meet at the ships.
Now Thor and our good swords help us!
Quick! The doors are giving way.'



"Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly"

"So we ten men stood at the doors[43]
and held back the king's soldiers. It was
dark in the room, and the people out of
doors could not tell how many were inside.
Few were eager to be the first in.

"'Thirty swords are waiting in there
to eat up the first man,' we heard some
one say.

"We chuckled at that.

"But the king stood in the very doorway
and fought. Our five swords held
him back for a long time, but at last he
pushed in, and his men poured after him.
We ran back and hid behind some tubs
in a dark corner. The king's men went
groping about and calling, but they did
not find us. The room was full of shouting
and running and sword-clashing; for
in the dark and the noise the men could
not tell their own soldiers. More than
one fell by his friend's sword. When it
was less crowded about the doorway, I
whispered:

"'Follow me in double line. We
will make for the ships. Keep close
together.'

"So that double line of men, with
swords swinging from both sides, ran out[44]
through the dark. Swords struck out at
us, and we struck back. Men ran after
us shouting, but our legs were as good as
theirs. But I and Hakon and one other
were all that reached the ship. There
we saw our 'Waverunner' with sail up
and bow pointing to open sea. We
swam out to her and climbed aboard.
Then the men swung the sail to the
wind, and we moved off. Even as
we went, a spear whizzed through the
air, and Hakon fell dead; for the king
and all his men were running to the
shore.

"'After them!' they were shouting.

"Then we heard the king call to the
men in his boats lying out in the
water:

"'Row to shore and take us in.'

"Thorkel was standing by my side.
At that he laughed and said:

"'They do not answer. He left but a
handful to guard his ships. They tasted
our swords. And we went aboard and
broke the oars and threw the sails into
the water. It will be slow going for
Havard to-night.'

[46]"Then he turned to the shore and
sang out loudly:


"'King Havard's ships are dead:
Olaf's dragon flies.
King Havard stamps the shore:
Olaf skims the waves.
King Havard shakes his fist.
Olaf turns and laughs.'


"That was the end of our meeting
with King Havard."

Foes'-fear

Every day the boy Harald heard
some such story of war or of the
gods, until he could see Thor riding
among the storm-clouds and throwing his
hammer, until he knew that a brave man
has many wounds, but never a one on his
back. Many nights he dreamed that he
himself walked into Valhalla, and that
all the heroes stood up and shouted:

"Welcome! Harald Halfdanson!"

"Ah! the bite of the sword is sweeter
than the kiss of your mother," he said to
Olaf one day. "When shall I stand in
the prow of a dragon and feast on the
fight? I am hungry to see the world.
Ivar the Far-goer tells me of the strange
countries he has seen. Ah! we vikings
are great folk. There is no water that has
not licked our boats' sides. This cape of
mine came in a viking boat from France.
These cloak-pins came from a far country
called Greece. In my father's house are[48]
golden cups from Rome, away on the
southern sea. Every land pours rich
things into our treasure-chest. Ivar has
been to a strange country where it is all
sand and is very hot. The people call their
country Arabia. They have never heard
of Thor or Odin. Ivar brought beautiful
striped cloth from there, and wonderful,
sweet-smelling waters. Oh! when shall
the white horses of the sea lead me out
to strange lands and glorious battles?"

But Harald did something besides
listen to stories. Every morning he was
up at sunrise and went with a thrall to
feed the hunting dogs. Thorstein taught
him to swim in the rough waters of
the fiord. Often he went with the men
a-hunting in the woods and learned to ride
a horse and pull a bow and throw a lance.
Ivar taught him to play the harp and to
make up songs. He went much to the
smithy, where the warriors mended their
helmets and made their spears and swords
of iron and bronze. At first he only
watched the men or worked the bellows,
but soon he could handle the tongs and
hold the red-hot iron, and after a long[49]
time he learned to use the hammer and
to shape metal. One day he made himself
a spear-head. It was two feet long
and sharp on both edges. While the
iron was hot he beat into it some runes.
When the men in the smithy saw the
runes they opened their eyes wide and
looked at the boy, for few Norsemen
could read.

"What does it say?" they asked.

"It is the name of my spear-point, and
it says, 'Foes'-fear,'" Harald said. "But
now for a handle."

It was winter and the snow was very
deep. So Harald put on his skees and
started for a wood that was back from
shore. Down the mountains he went,
twenty, thirty feet at a slide, leaping over
chasms a hundred feet across. In his
scarlet cloak he looked like a flash of fire.
The wind shot past him howling. His
eyes danced at the fun.

"It is like flying," he thought and
laughed. "I am an eagle. Now I soar,"
as he leaped over a frozen river.

He saw a slender ash growing on top
of a high rock.[50]



"He drove it into the wolf's neck"

"That is the handle for 'Foes'-fear,'"
he said.

The rock stood up like a ragged tower,
but he did not stop because of the steep
climb. He threw off his skees and thrust
his hands and feet into holes of the rock
and drew himself up. He tore his jacket
and cut his leather leggings and scratched
his face and bruised his hands, but at last
he was on the top. Soon he had chopped
down the tree and had cut a straight pole
ten feet long and as big around as his
arm. He went down, sliding and jumping
and tearing himself on the sharp stones.
With a last leap he landed near his skees.
As he did so a lean wolf jumped and
snapped at him, snarling. Harald shouted
and swung his pole. The wolf dodged,
but quickly jumped again and caught the
boy's arm between his sharp teeth. Harald
thought of the spear-point in his belt.
In a wink he had it out and was striking
with it. He drove it into the wolf's neck
and threw him back on the snow, dead.

"You are the first to feel the tooth of
'Foes'-fear,'" he said, "but I think you
will not be the last."

[52]Then without thinking of his torn arm
he put on his skees and went leaping
home. He went straight to the smithy
and smoothed his pole and drove it into
the haft of the spear-point. He hammered
out a gold band and put it around
the joining place. He made nails with
beautiful heads and drove them into the
pole in different places.

"If it is heavy it will strike hard," he
said.

Then he weighed the spear in his hand
and found the balancing point and put
another gold band there to mark it.

Thorstein came in while he was working.

"A good spear," he said.

Then he saw the torn sleeve and the
red wound beneath.

"Hello!" he cried. "Your first wound?"

"Oh, it is only a wolf-scratch," Harald
answered.

"By Thor!" cried Thorstein, "I see
that you are ready for better wounds.
You bear this like a warrior."

"I think it will not be my last," Harald
said.

[53]





Harald is King

Now when Harald was ten years old
his father, King Halfdan, died. An
old book that tells about Harald says that
then "he was the biggest of all men, the
strongest, and the fairest to look upon."
That about a boy ten years old! But boys
grew fast in those days for they were out
of doors all the time, running, swimming,
leaping on skees, and hunting in the forest.
All that makes big, manly boys.

So now King Halfdan was dead and
buried, and Harald was to be king. But
first he must drink his father's funeral ale.

"Take down the gay tapestries that
hang in the feast hall," he said to the
thralls. "Put up black and gray ones.
Strew the floor with pine branches. Brew
twenty tubs of fresh ale and mead. Scour
every dish until it shines."

Then Harald sent messengers all over
that country to his kinsmen and friends.

"Bid them come in three months' time[54]
to drink my father's funeral ale," he said.
"Tell them that no one shall go away
empty-handed."

So in three months men came riding up
at every hour. Some came in boats. But
many had ridden far through mountains,
swimming rivers; for there were few roads
or bridges in Norway. On account of that
hard ride no women came to the feast.

At nine o'clock in the night the feast
began. The men came walking in at the
west end of the hall.[6] The great bonfires
down the middle of the room were flashing
light on everything. The clean smell
of this wood-smoke and of the pine
branches on the floor was pleasant to
the guests. Down each side of the hall
stretched long, backless benches, with
room for three hundred men. In the
middle of each side rose the high seat,
a great carved chair on a platform.
All along behind the benches were the
black and gray draperies. Here hung
the shields of the guests; for every man,
when he was given his place, turned and
hung his shield behind him and set his[55]
tall spear by it. So on each wall there
was a long row of gay shields, red and
green and yellow, and all shining with
gold or bronze trimmings. And higher
up there was another row of gleaming
spear-points. Above the hall the rafters
were carved and gaily painted, so that
dragons seemed to be crawling across, or
eagles seemed to be swooping down.

The guests walked in laughing and
talking with their big voices so that the
rafters rang. They made the hall look all
the brighter with their clothes of scarlet
and blue and green, with their flashing
golden bracelets and head-bands and
sword-scabbards, with their flying hair of
red or yellow.

Across the east end of the hall was a
bench. When the men were all in, the
queen, Harald's mother, and the women
who lived with her, walked in through the
east door and sat upon this bench.

Then thralls came running in and set
up the long tables[7] before the benches.
Other thralls ran in with large steaming
kettles of meat. They put big pieces of[56]
this meat into platters of wood and set it
before the men. They had a few dishes
of silver. These they put before the
guests at the middle of the tables; for the
great people sat here near the high seats.

When the meat came, the talking
stopped; for Norsemen ate only twice a
day, and these men had had long rides
and were hungry. Three or four persons
ate from one platter and drank from
the same big bowl of milk. They had no
forks, so they ate from their fingers and
threw the bones under the table among
the pine branches. Sometimes they took
knives from their belts to cut the meat.

When the guests sat back satisfied,
Harald called to the thralls:

"Carry out the tables."

So they did and brought in two great
tubs of mead and set one at each end of the
hall. Then the queen stood up and called
some of her women. They went to the
mead tubs. They took the horns, when
the thralls had filled them, and carried
them to the men with some merry word.
Perhaps one woman said as she handed a
man his horn:[57]

"This horn has no feet to be set down
upon. You must drink it at one draught."

Perhaps another said:

"Mead loves a merry face."

The women were beautiful, moving
about the hall. The queen wore a trailing
dress of blue velvet with long flowing
sleeves. She had a short apron of striped
Arabian silk with gold fringe along the
bottom. From her shoulders hung a long
train of scarlet wool embroidered in gold.
White linen covered her head. Her long
yellow hair was pulled around at the sides
and over her breast and was fastened
under the belt of her apron. As she
walked, her train made a pleasant rustle
among the pine branches. She was tall
and straight and strong. Some of her
younger women wore no linen on their
heads and had their white arms bare,
with bracelets shining on them. They,
too, were tall and strong.

All the time men were calling across
the fire to one another asking news or
telling jokes and laughing.



"I vow that I will grind my father's foes under my heel"

An old man, Harald's uncle, sat in the
high seat on the north side. That was[58]
the place of honor. But the high seat on
the south side was empty; for that was
the king's seat. Harald sat on the steps
before it.

The feast went merrily until long
after midnight. Then the thralls took
some of the guests to the guest house to
sleep, and some to the beds around the
sides of the feast hall. But some men
lay down on the benches and drew their
cloaks over themselves.

On the next night there was another
feast. Still Harald sat on the step before
the high seat. But when the tables were
gone and the horns were going around,
he stood up and raised high a horn of ale
and said loudly:

"This horn of memory I drink in honor
of my father, Halfdan, son of Gudrod, who
sits now in Valhalla. And I vow that I will
grind my father's foes under my heel."

Then he drank the ale and sat down in
the king's high seat, while all the men stood
up and raised their horns and shouted:

"King Harald!"

And some cried:

"That was a brave vow."

[60]And Harald's uncle called out:

"A health to King Harald!"

And they all drank it.

Then a man stood up and said:

"Hear my song of King Halfdan!" for
this man was a skald.

"Yes, the song!" shouted the men,
and Harald nodded his head.

So the skald took down his great harp
from the wall behind him and went and
stood before Harald. The bottom of the
harp rested on the floor, but the top
reached as high as the skald's shoulders.
The brass frame shone in the light. The
strings were some of gold and some of
silver. The man struck them with his
hand and sang of King Halfdan, of his
battles, of his strong arm and good
sword, of his death, and of how men
loved him.

When he had finished, King Harald
took a bracelet from his arm and gave it
to him, saying:

"Take this as thanks for your good
song."

The guests stayed the next day and
at night there was another feast. When[61]
the mead horns were going around, King
Harald stood up and spoke:

"I said that no man should go away
empty-handed from drinking my father's
funeral ale."

He beckoned the thralls, and they
brought in a great treasure-chest and set
it down by the high seat. King Harald
opened it and took out rich gifts&mdash;capes
and sword-belts and beautiful cloth and
bracelets and gold cloak-pins. These he
sent about the hall and gave something
to every man. The guests wondered at
the richness of his gifts.

"This young king has an open hand,"
they said, "and deep treasure-chests."

After breakfast the next morning the
guests went out and stood by their horses
ready to go, but before they mounted,
thralls brought a horn of mead to each
man. That was called the stirrup-horn,
because after they drank it the men put
their feet to the stirrups and sprang upon
their horses and started. King Harald
and his people rode a little way with them.

All men said that that was the richest
funeral feast that ever was held.

Harald's Battle

Now King Halfdan had many foes.
When he was alive they were afraid
to make war upon him, for he was a
mighty warrior. But when Harald became
king, they said:

"He is but a lad. We will fight with
him and take his land."

So they began to make ready. King
Harald heard of this and he laughed and
said:

"Good! 'Foes'-fear' is thirsty, and my
legs are stiff with much sitting."

He called three men to him. To one
he gave an arrow, saying:

"Run and carry this arrow north.
Give it into the hands of the master of
the next farm, and say that all men are
to meet here within two weeks from this
day. They must come ready for war
and mounted on horses. Say also that
if a man does not obey this call, or if he
receives this arrow and does not carry[63]
it on to his next neighbor, he shall be
outlawed from this country, and his land
shall be taken from him."

He gave arrows to the other two men
and told them to run south and east with
the same message.

So all through King Harald's country
men were soon busy mending helmets
and polishing swords and making shields.
There was blazing of forges and clanging
of anvils all through the land.

On the day set, the fields about King
Harald's house were full of men and
horses. After breakfast a horn blew.
Every man snatched his weapons and
jumped upon his horse. Men of the same
neighborhood stood together, and their
chief led them. They waited for the starting
horn. This did not look like our army.
There were no uniforms. Some men wore
helmets, some did not. Some wore coats
of mail, but others wore only their jackets
and tights of bright-colored wool. But at
each man's left side hung a great shield.
Over his right shoulder went his sword-belt
and held his long sword under his
left hand. Above most men's heads shone[64]
the points of their tall spears. Some men
carried axes in their belts. Some carried
bows and arrows. Many had ram's horns
hanging from their necks.

King Harald rode at the front of his
army with his standard-bearer beside him.
Chain-armor covered the king's body. A
red cloak was thrown over his shoulders.
On his head was a gold helmet with a
dragon standing up from it. He carried
a round shield on his left arm. The king
had made that shield himself. It was
of brass. The rivets were of silver, with
strangely shaped heads. On the back of
Harald's horse was a red cloth trimmed
with the fur of ermine.

King Harald looked up at his standard
and laughed aloud.

"Oh, War-lover," he cried, "you and
I ride out on a gay journey."

A horn blew again and the army
started. The men shouted as they went,
and blew their ram's horns.

"Now we shall taste something better
than even King Harald's ale," shouted one.

Another rose in his stirrups and sniffed
the air.[65]

"Ah! I smell a battle," he cried. "It
is sweeter than those strange waters of
Arabia."

So the army went merrily through the
land. They carried no tents, they had
no provision wagons.

"The sky is a good enough tent for
a soldier," said the Norsemen. "Why
carry provisions when they lie in the
farms beside you?"

After two days King Harald saw
another army on the hills.

"Thorstein," he shouted, "up with the
white shield and go tell King Haki to
choose his battle-field. We will wait but
an hour. I am eager for the frolic."

So Thorstein raised a white shield on
his spear as a sign that he came on an
errand of peace. He rode near King
Haki, but he could not wait until he came
close before he shouted out his message
and then turned and rode back.

"Tell your boy king that we will not
hang back," Haki called after Thorstein.

King Harald's men waited on the hillside
and watched the other army across
the valley. They saw King Haki point[66]
and saw twenty men ride off as he
pointed. They stopped in a patch of
hazel and hewed with their axes.

"They are getting the hazels," said
Thorstein.

"Audun," said King Harald to a man
near him, "stay close to my standard all
day. You must see the best of the fight.
I want to hear a song about it after it is
over."

This Audun was the skald who sang
at the drinking of King Halfdan's funeral
ale.

King Haki's men rode down into the
valley. They drove down stakes all about
a great field. They tied the hazel twigs
to the stakes in a string. But they left
an open space toward King Harald's
army and one toward King Haki's. Then
a man raised a white shield and galloped
toward King Harald.

"We are ready!" he shouted.

At the same time King Haki raised a
red shield. King Harald's men put their
shields before their mouths and shouted
into them. It made a great roaring war-cry.[67]

"Up with the war shield!" shouted
King Harald. "Horns blow!"

There was a blowing of horns on both
sides. The two armies galloped down
into the field and ran together. The fight
had begun.

All that day long swords were flashing,
spears flying, men shouting, men falling
from their horses, swords clashing against
shields.

"Victory flashes from that dragon,"
Harald's men said, pointing to the king's
helmet. "No one stands before it."

And, surely, before night came, King
Haki fell dead under "Foes'-fear." When
he fell, a great shout went up from his
warriors, and they turned and fled. King
Harald's men chased them far, but during
the night came back to camp. Many
brought swords and helmets and bracelets
or silver-trimmed saddles and bridles
with them.

"Here is what we got from the foe,"
they said.

The next morning King Harald spoke
to his men:

"Let us go about and find our dead."[68]



"King Haki fell dead under 'Foes'-fear'"

[69]So they went over all the battle-field.
They put every man on his shield and
carried him and laid him on a hill-top.
They hung his sword over his shoulder
and laid his spear by his side. So they
laid all the dead together there on the
hill-top. Then King Harald said, looking
about:

"This is a good place to lie. It looks
far over the country. The sound of the
sea reaches it. The wind sweeps here.
It is a good grave for Norsemen and
Vikings. But it is a long road and a
rough road to Valhalla that these men
must travel. Let the nearest kinsman of
each man come and tie on his hell-shoes.
Tie them fast, for they will need them
much on that hard road."

So friends tied shoes on the dead men's
feet. Then King Harald said:

"Now let us make the mound."

Every man set to work with what tools
he had and heaped earth over the dead
until a great mound stood up. They
piled stones on the top. On one of these
stones King Harald made runes telling
how these men had died.[70]

After that was done King Harald said:

"Now set up the pole, Thorstein. Let
every man bring to that pole all that he
took from the foe."

So they did, and there was a great hill
of things around it. Harald divided it
into piles.

"This pile we will give to Thor in
thanks for the victory," he said. "This
pile is mine because I am king. Here
are the piles for the chiefs, and these
things go to the other men of the army."

So every man went away from that
battle richer than he was before, and
Thor looked down from Valhalla upon
his full temple and was pleased.

The next morning King Harald led
his army back. But on the way he met
other foes and had many battles and did
not lose one. The kings either died in
battle or ran away, and Harald had their
lands.

"He has kept his vow," men said,
"and ground his father's foes under his
heel."

So King Harald sat in peace for a while.

[71]




Gyda's Saucy Message

Now Harald heard men talk of Gyda,
the daughter of King Eric.

"She is very beautiful," they said,
"but she is very proud, too. She can
both read and make runes. No other
woman in the world knows so much
about herbs as she does. She can cure
any sickness. And she is proud of all
this!"

Now when King Harald heard that, he
thought to himself:

"Fair and proud. I like them both.
I will have her for my wife."

So he called his uncle, Guthorm, and
said:

"Take rich gifts and go to Gyda's
foster-father[8] and tell him that I will
marry Gyda."

So Guthorm and his men came to that
house and they told the king's message
to the foster-father. Gyda was standing
near, weaving a rich cloak. She heard[72]
the speech. She came up and said, holding
her head high and curling her lip:



"I will not be his wife unless he puts all of Norway under him for
my sake"

"I will not waste myself on a king
of so few people. Norway is a strange
country. There is a little king here and
a little king there&mdash;hundreds of them
scattered about. Now in Denmark there
is but one great king over the whole
land. And it is so in Sweden. Is no
one brave enough to make all of Norway
his own?"

She laughed a scornful laugh and
walked away. The men stood with open
mouths and stared after her. Could it be
that she had sent that saucy message to
King Harald? They looked at her foster-father.
He was chuckling in his beard
and said nothing to them. They started
out of the house in anger. When they
were at the door, Gyda came up to them
again and said:

"Give this message to your King
Harald for me: I will not be his wife
unless he puts all of Norway under him
for my sake."

So Guthorm and his men rode homeward
across the country. They did not[74]
talk. They were all thinking. At last
one said:

"How shall we give this message to
the king?"

"I have been thinking of that,"
Guthorm said; "his anger is no little
thing."

It was late when they rode into the
king's yard; for they had ridden slowly,
trying to make some plan for softening
the message, but they had thought of
none.

"I see light through the wind's-eyes
of the feast hall," one said.

"Yes, the king keeps feast," Guthorm
said. "We must give our message
before all his guests."

So they went in with very heavy
hearts. There sat King Harald in the
high seat. The benches on both sides
were full of men. The tables had been
taken out, and the mead-horns were
going round.

"Oh, ho!" cried King Harald. "Our
messengers! What news?"

Then Guthorm said:

"This Gyda is a bold and saucy girl,[75]
King Harald. My tongue refuses to give
her message."

The king stamped his foot.

"Out with it!" he cried. "What does
she say?"

"She says that she will not marry
so little a king," Guthorm answered.

Harald jumped to his feet. His face
flushed red. Guthorm stretched out his
hand.

"They are not my words, O King; they
are the words of a silly girl."

"Is there any more?" the king shouted.
"Go on!"

"She said: 'There is one king in Denmark
and one king in Sweden. Is there
no man brave enough to make himself
king of all Norway? Tell King Harald
that I will not marry him unless he
puts all of Norway under him for my
sake.'"

The guests sat speechless, staring at
Guthorm. All at once the king broke
into a roar of laughter.

"By the hammer of Thor!" he cried,
"that is a good message. I thank you,
Gyda. Did you hear it, friends? King[76]
of all Norway! Why, we are all stupids.
Why did we not think of that?"

Then he raised his horn high.

"Now hear my vow. I say that I will
not cut my hair or comb it until I am
king of all Norway. That I will be or I
will die."

Then he drank off the horn of mead,
and while he drank it, all the men in the
hall stood up and waved their swords and
shouted and shouted. That old hall in
all its two hundred years of feasts had
not heard such a noise before.

"Ah, Harald!" Guthorm cried, "surely
Thor in Valhalla smiled when he heard
that vow."

The men sat all night talking of that
wonderful vow.

On the very next day King Harald sent
out his war-arrows. Soon a great army
was gathered. They marched through
the country north and south and east and
west, burning houses and fighting battles
as they went. People fled before them,
some to their own kings, some inland to
the deep woods and hid there. But some
went to King Harald and said:[77]

"We will be your men."

"Then take the oath, and I will be
friends with you," he said.

The men took off their swords and
laid them down and came one by one
and knelt before the king. They put
their heads between his knees and said:

"From this day, Harald Halfdanson,
I am your man. I will serve you in war.
For my land I will pay you taxes. I will
be faithful to you as my king."

Then Harald said:

"I am your king, and I will be faithful
to you."

Many kings took that oath and thousands
of common men. Of all the battles
that Harald fought, he did not lose one.

Now for a long time the king's hair
and beard had not been combed or cut.
They stood out around his head in a great
bushy mat of yellow. At a feast one day
when the jokes were going round, Harald's
uncle said:

"Harald, I will give you a new name.
After this you shall be called Harald
Shockhead. As my naming gift I give
you this drinking-horn."[78]

"It is a good name," laughed all the
men.

After that all people called him Harald
Shockhead.

During these wars, whenever King
Harald got a country for his own, this is
what he did. He said:

"All the marshland and the woodland
where no people live is mine. For his
farm every man shall pay me taxes."

Over every country he put some brave,
wise man and called him Earl. He said
to the earls:

"You shall collect the taxes and pay
them to me. But some you shall keep
for yourselves. You shall punish any
man who steals or murders or does any
wicked thing. When your people are in
trouble they shall come to you, and you
shall set the thing right. You must
keep peace in the land. I will not
have my people troubled with robber
vikings."

The earls did all these things as best
they could; for they were good strong
men. The farmers were happy. They
said:[79]

"We can work on our farms with peace
now. Before King Harald came, something
was always wrong. The vikings
would come and steal our gold and our
grain and burn our houses, or the king
would call us to war. Those little kings
are always fighting. It is better under
King Harald."

But the chiefs, who liked to fight and
go a-viking, hated King Harald and his
new ways. One of these chiefs was Solfi.
He was a king's son. Harald had killed
his father in battle. Solfi had been in
that battle. At the end of it he fled away
with two hundred men and got into ships.

"We will make that Shockhead smart,"
he said.

So they harried the coast of King
Harald's country. They filled their ships
with gold. They ate other men's meals.
They burned farmhouses behind them.
The people cried out to the earls for help.
So the earls had out their ships all the
time trying to catch Solfi, but he was too
clever for them.

In the spring he went to a certain
king, Audbiorn, and said to him:[80]

"Now, there are two things that we
can do. We can become this Shockhead
Harald's thralls, we can kneel before him
and put our heads between his knees. Or
else we can fight. My father thought it
better to die in battle than to be any
man's thrall. How is it? Will you join
with my cousin Arnvid and me against
this young Shockhead?"

"Yes, I will do it," said the king.

The Sea Fight

Many men felt as Solfi did. So
when King Audbiorn and King
Arnvid sent out their war arrows, a great
host gathered. All men came by sea.
Two hundred ships lay at anchor in the
fiord, looking like strange swimming
animals because of their high carved
prows and bright paint. There were red
and gold dragons with long necks and
curved tails. Sea-horses reared out of
the water. Green and gold snakes coiled
up. Sea-hawks sat with spread wings
ready to fly. And among all these
curved necks stood up the tall, straight
masts with the long yardarms swinging
across them holding the looped-up sails.

When the starting horn blew, and
their sails were let down, it was like the
spreading of hundreds of curious flags.
Some were striped black and yellow or
blue and gold. Some were white with a
black raven or a brown bear embroidered
on them, or blue with a white sea-hawk,[82]
or black with a gold sun. Some were
edged with fur. As the wind filled the
gaudy sails, and the ships moved off, the
men waved their hands to the women on
shore and sang:


"To the sea! To the sea!
The wind in our sail,
The sea in our face,
And the smell of the fight.
After ship meets ship,
In the quarrel of swords
King Harald shall lie
In the caves under sea
And Norsemen shall laugh."


In the prow stood men leaning forward
and sniffing the salt air with joy. Some
were talking of King Harald.

"Yesterday he had a hard fight," they
said. "To-day he will be lying still,
dressing his wounds and mending his
ships. We shall take him by surprise."

They sailed near the coast. Solfi in
his "Sea-hawk" was ahead leading the
way. Suddenly men saw his sail veer
and his oars flash out. He had quickly
turned his boat and was rowing back.
He came close to King Arnvid and
called:[83]

"He is there, ahead. His boats are
ready in line of battle. The fox has not
been asleep."

King Arnvid blew his horn. Slowly
his boats came into line with his "Sea-stag"
in the middle. Again he blew his
horn. Cables were thrown across from
one prow to the next, and all the ships
were tied together so that their sides
touched. Then the men set their sails
again and they went past a tongue of
land into a broad fiord. There lay the
long line of King Harald's ships with
their fierce heads grinning and mocking
at the newcomers. Back of those prows
was what looked like a long wall with
spots of green and red and blue and
yellow and shining gold. It was the
locked shields of the men in the bows,
and over every shield looked fierce blue
eyes. Higher up and farther back was
another wall of shields; for on the half
deck in the stern of every ship stood the
captain with his shield-guard of a dozen
men.

Arnvid's people had furled their sails
and were taking down the masts, but the[84]
ships were still drifting on with the wind.
The horn blew, and quickly every man
sprang to his place in bow and stern.
All were leaning forward with clenched
teeth and widespread nostrils. They
were clutching their naked swords in
their hands. Their flashing eyes looked
over their shields.

Soon King Arnvid's ships crashed into
Harald's line, and immediately the men
in the bows began to swing their swords
at one another. The soldiers of the
shield-guard on the high decks began to
throw darts and stones and to shoot
arrows into the ships opposite them.

So in every ship showers of stones and
arrows were falling, and many men died
under them or got broken arms or legs.
Spears were hurled from deck to deck
and many of them bit deep into men's
bodies. In every bow men slashed with
their swords at the foes in the opposite
ship. Some jumped upon the gunwale to
get nearer or hung from the prow-head.
Some even leaped into the enemy's boat.



"Then he leaped into King Arnvid's boat"

King Harald's ship lay prow to prow
with King Arnvid's. The battle had been[85]
going on for an hour. King Harald was
still in the stern on the deck. There was
a dent in his helmet where a great stone
had struck. There was a gash in his
shoulder where a spear had cut. But
he was still fighting and laughed as he
worked.

"Wolf meets wolf to-day," he said.
"But things are going badly in the
prow," he cried. "Ivar fallen, Thorstein
wounded, a dozen men lying in the
bottom of the boat!"

He leaped down from the deck and ran
along the gunwale, shouting as he went:

"Harald and victory!"

So he came to the bow and stood
swinging his sword as fast as he breathed.
Every time it hit a man of Arnvid's men.
Harald's own warriors cheered, seeing
him.

"Harald and victory!" they shouted,
and went to work again with good heart.

Slowly King Arnvid's men fell back
before Harald's biting sword. Then Harald's
men threw a great hook into that
boat and pulled it alongside and still
pushed King Arnvid's people back.[86]

"Come on! Follow me!" cried Harald.

Then he leaped into King Arnvid's
boat, and his warriors followed him.

"He comes like a mad wolf," King
Arnvid's men said, and they turned and
ran back below the deck.

Then Arnvid himself leaped down and
stood with his sword raised.

"Can this young Shockhead make cowards
of you all?" he cried.

But Harald's sword struck him, and
he fell dead. Then a big, bloody viking
of King Arnvid leaped upon the edge of
the ship and stood there. He held his
drinking-horn and his sword high in his
hands.

"Ran[9] and not you, Shockhead, shall
have them and me!" he cried, and leaped
laughing into the water and was drowned.

Many other warriors chose the same
death on that terrible day.

All along the line of boats men fought
for hours. In some places the cables had
been cut, and the boats had drifted apart.
Ships lay scattered about two by two,
fighting. May boats sank, many men[88]
died, some fled away in their ships, and
at the end King Harald had won the
battle. So he had King Arnvid's country
and King Audbiorn's country. Many
men took the oath and became his
friends. All people were talking of his
wonderful battles.

[89]




King Harald's Wedding

It had taken King Harald ten years to
fight so many battles. And all that
time he had not cut his hair or combed it.
Now he was feasting one day at an earl's
house. Many people were there.

"How is it, friends?" Harald said.
"Have I kept my vow?"

His friends answered:

"You have kept your vow. There is
no king but you in all Norway."

"Then I think I will cut my hair," the
king laughed.

So he went and bathed and put on
fresh clothes. Then the earl cut his hair
and beard and combed them and put a
gold band about his head. Then he
looked at him and said:

"It is beautiful, smooth, and yellow."

And all people wondered at the beauty
of the king's hair.

"I will give you a new name," the
earl said. "You shall no longer be called[90]
Shockhead. You shall be called Harald
Hairfair."



"I, Harald, King of Norway, take you Gyda, for my wife"

"It is a good name," everybody cried.

Then Harald said:

"But I have another thing to do now.
Guthorm, you shall take the same message
to Gyda that you gave ten years
ago."

So Guthorm went and brought back
this answer from Gyda:

"I will marry the king of all Norway."

So when the wedding time came, Harald
rode across the country to the home
of Gyda's father, Eric. Many men followed
him. They were all richly dressed
in velvet and gold.

For three nights they feasted at Eric's
house. On the next night Gyda sat on
the cross-bench with her women. A
long veil of white linen covered her face
and head and hung down to the ground.
After the mead-horns had been brought
in, Eric stood up from his high seat
and went down and stood before King
Harald.

"Will you marry Gyda now?" he
asked.

[92]Harald jumped to his feet and laughed.

"Yes," he said. "I have waited long
enough."

Then he stepped down from his high
seat and stood by Eric. They walked
about the hall. Before them walked
thralls carrying candles. Behind them
walked many of King Harald's great
earls. Three times they walked around
the hall. The third time they stopped
before the cross-bench. King Harald
and Eric stepped upon the platform, where
the cross-bench was.

Eric gave a holy hammer to Harald,
and it was like the hammer of Thor.
Harald put it upon Gyda's lap, saying:

"With this holy hammer of Thor's, I,
Harald, King of Norway, take you, Gyda,
for my wife."

Then he took a bunch of keys and
tied it to Gyda's girdle, saying:

"This is the sign that you are mistress
of my house."

After that, Eric called out loudly:

"Now, are Harald, King of Norway,
and Gyda, daughter of Eric, man and
wife."[93]

Then thralls brought meat and drink
in golden dishes. They were about to
serve it to Gyda for the bride's feast, but
Harald took the dish from them and said:

"No, I will serve my bride."

So he knelt and held the platter.
When he did that his men shouted. Then
they talked among themselves, saying:

"Surely Harald never knelt before.
It is always other people who kneel to
him."

When the bride had tasted the food
and touched the mead-horn to her lips
she stood up and walked from the hall.
All her women followed her, but the men
stayed and feasted long.

On the next morning at breakfast
Gyda sat by Harald's side. Soon the
king rose and said:

"Father-in-law, our horses stand ready
in the yard. Work is waiting for me at
home and on the sea. Lead out the
bride."

So Eric took Gyda by the hand and
led her out of the hall. Harald followed
close. When they passed through the
door Eric said:[94]

"With this hand I lead my daughter
out of my house and give her to you,
Harald, son of Halfdan, to be your wife.
May all the gods make you happy!"

Harald led his bride to the horse and
lifted her up and set her behind his saddle
and said:

"Now this Gyda is my wife."

Then they drank the stirrup-horn and
rode off.

"Everything comes to King Harald,"
his men said; "wife and land and crown
and victory in battle. He is a lucky
man."





[95]





King Harald Goes West-Over-Seas

Now many men hated King Harald.
Many a man said:

"Why should he put himself up for
king of all of us? He is no better than I
am. Am I not a king's son as well as he?
And are not many of us kings' sons? I
will not kneel before him and promise to
be his man. I will not pay him taxes. I
will not have his earl sitting over me.
The good old days have gone. This
Norway has become a prison. I will go
away and find some other place."

So hundreds of men sailed away.
Some went to France and got land and
lived there. Big Rolf-go-afoot and all
his men sailed up the great French River
and won a battle against the French king
himself. There was no way to stop the
flashing of his battle-axes but to give
him what he wanted. So the king made
Rolf a duke, gave him broad lands and
gave him the king's own daughter for[96]
wife. Rolf called his country Normandy,
for old Norway. He ruled it well and
was a great lord, and his sons' sons after
him were kings of England.



"In Norway they left burning houses and weeping women"

Other Norsemen went to Ireland and
England and Scotland. They drew up
their boats on the river banks. The
people ran away before them and
gathered into great armies that marched
back to meet the vikings in battle.
Sometimes the Norsemen lost, but oftener
they won, so that they got land and lived
in those countries. Their houses sat in
these strange lands like warriors' camps,
and the Norsemen went among their
new neighbors with hanging swords and
spears in hand, ever ready for fight.

There are many islands north of Scotland.
They are called the Orkneys and
the Shetlands. They have many good
harbors for ships. They are little and
rocky and bare of trees. Wild sea-birds
scream around them. On some of them
a man can stand in the middle and see
the ocean all about him. Now the vikings
sailed to these islands and were
pleased.

[98]"It is like being always in a boat,"
they said. "This shall be our home."

So it went until all the lands round
about were covered with vikings. Norse
carved and painted houses brightened the
hillsides. Viking ships sailed all the seas
and made harbor in every river. Norsemen's
thralls plowed the soil and planted
crops and herded cattle, and gold flowed
into their masters' treasure-chests. Norse
warriors walked up and down the land,
and no man dared to say them nay.

These men did not forget Norway. In
the summers they sailed back there and
harried the coast. They took gold and
grain and beautiful cloth back to their
homes. In Norway they left burning
houses and weeping women.

Every summer King Harald had out
his ships and men and hunted these
vikings. There are many little islands
about Norway. They have crags and
caves and deep woods. Here the vikings
hid when they saw King Harald's
ships coming. But Harald ran his boat
into every creek and fiord and hunted in
every cave and through all the woods and[99]
among the crags. He caught many men,
but most of them got away and went
home laughing at Harald. Then they
came back the next summer and did the
same deeds over again. At last King
Harald said:

"There is but one thing to do. I must
sail to these western islands and whip
these robbers in their own homes."

So he went with a great number of
ships. He found as brave men as he had
brought from Norway. These vikings
had brought their old courage to their
new homes. King Harald's fine ships
were scarred by viking stones and
scorched by viking fire. The shields of
Harald's warriors had dents from viking
blows. Many of those men carried viking
scars all their lives. And many of
King Harald's warriors walked the long,
hard road to Valhalla, and feasted there
with some of these very vikings that
had died in King Harald's battles. But
after many hard fights on land and sea,
after many men had died and many had
fled away to other lands, King Harald
won, and he made the men that were yet[100]
in the islands take the oath, and he left
his earls to rule over them. Then he
went back to Norway.

"He has done more than he vowed
to do," people said. "He has not only
whipped the vikings, but he has got a
new kingdom west-over-seas."

Then they talked of that dream that
his mother had.

"King Harald was that great tree,"
they said. "The trunk was red with the
blood of his many battles, but higher
up the limbs were fair and green like
this good time of peace. The topmost
branches were white because Harald will
live to be an old man. Just as that tree
spread out until all of Norway was in its
shade, and even more lands, so Harald
is king of all this country and of the
western islands. The many branches of
that tree are the many sons of Harald,
who shall be earls and kings in Norway,
and their sons after them, for hundreds
of years."

[101]
PART II





WEST-OVER-SEAS



[102]



[103]





Homes in Iceland

Men had been feasting in Ingolf's
house. But there was no laughing
and no shouting of jokes. Ingolf sat in
his high seat frowning and gloomy. His
head hung on his breast. He was staring
into the fire. Now he raised his head
and looked about the hall.

"Comrades," he said, "what shall we
do? Herstein and Holmstein died by our
swords. Their kinsmen hunger to kill us.
Besides, when Harald hears of our deed,
there will not be a safe place in Norway
for us. He will never let a man fight out
an honest quarrel. Where shall we go?"

A man stood up from the bench.

"We have friends in the Shetlands,"
he said. "Let us find homes there."

Then Leif, in the high seat opposite
Ingolf, stood up.

"No, not the Shetlands, my foster-brother.[10]
They are crowded already.[104]
Besides, Harald will not long keep his
hands off them. Then they will be no
better than Norway. England and Ireland
and Scotland are old. My eyes ache
for something new. What of that far
island that Floki found? It is empty.
We could choose our land from the whole
country. There is good fishing. There
are green valleys. And Butter Thorolf
says that butter drops from every weed.
There are mountains and deserts where
we may find adventure. I say, let us
steer for Iceland!"

When he stopped, many of the men
shouted:

"Yes! Iceland!"

But an old man stood up.

"We have all laughed at that tale of
Butter Thorolf's," he said. "But Floki
himself said that the sea about the island
is full of ice that pushes upon the land,
that no ship can live in that water in
the winter, that great mountains of ice
cover the island. Did not all his cattle
die there of hunger and cold, and did
he not come back to Norway cursing Iceland?"[105]

"Oh, Sighvat, you are old and fearful,"
called out Leif, and he laughed.

Then he stretched himself up and
threw back his head.

"Are we afraid of ice? Have we not
seen angry water before? I have been
hungry, but I have never died of it.
Surely if there are fish in the sea and
grass in the valleys, we can live there.
I should like to stand on a hill and look
around on a wide land and think, 'This
is all ours,' and out upon a rough sea and
think, 'Far off there are our foes and
they dare not come over to us.' Besides,
we shall have no Shockhead Harald to
lord it over us. We can come and go and
feast and fight as we please. We shall
be our own kings. And our ships will be
always waiting to take us away, when we
are weary of it. And we shall see things
that other men have never seen. I am
tired of the old things. Perhaps in after
days men will make songs about 'those
foster-brothers, Ingolf and Leif, who
made a new country in a wonderful land,
and whose sons and grandsons are mighty
men in Iceland!'"[106]

Ingolf leaped up from his chair.

"By the strong arm of Thor!" he
cried, "I like the sound of it. Now I
make my vow."

He raised his drinking-horn.

"I vow that I will find this Iceland and
pass the winter there, and that if man
can live upon it I will go back there and
set up my home."

"And I vow that I will follow my
foster-brother," cried Leif.

And many men vowed to go.

So on the next day they began to make
ready a boat. They looked her over
carefully and recalked every seam and
freshly painted her and put into her their
strongest oars and made her a new sail.

"This will be the longest voyage that
she ever made," Ingolf said.

When the work was done, they put
into her great stores, axes, hammers, fish-nets,
cooking-kettles, kegs of ale, chests
of hard bread, chests of smoked meat,
brass kettles full of flour, skin bottles of
water. They stowed these things away
in the ends of the ship. When they were
ready they put in four head of cattle.[107]

"We shall need the milk and perhaps
the meat," Ingolf said.

Many men wished to go, but Ingolf
had said:

"There is little room to spare and little
food and drink. I have planned for half
a year. But perhaps we must be sailing
longer than that. Our food may run
short. We must not have extra mouths
to feed. There are thirty oars in our
boat. I will take only one man for every
oar, and Leif and I will steer."

So they started off. Leif stood in the
prow leaning forward and looking far
ahead, and he sang:


"What does the swimming dragon smell?
A stormy sea, an empty land,
Hunger, darkness, giants, fire.
Leif and his sword do laugh at that."


They sailed for days and saw no land.
Sometimes they passed ships and always
made sure to sail close enough to hail
them.

"Where are you going?" Ingolf would
call.

"To Norway," would come back the
answer.[108]

"For trade or fight?" Leif would shout.

Then would ring out a great laugh
from that boat and this answer:

"A shut mouth is a good friend."

So the two ships sailed on, and the men
were glad to have heard a greeting and
to have called one.

But at last there were the Shetlands.

"We will go in here and rest," Ingolf
said.

When they rowed to shore a certain
Shetland man stood there. He watched
them land and looked them all over.
Then he walked up to Ingolf and said:

"You look like brave men. Welcome
to Shetland. You shall come to my
house and rest your legs from ship-going
and fill your stomachs. I hunger for
news of Norway."

So they went to his house and stayed
there for three days. And good it seemed
to be near a fire and in a quiet bed and
before a steaming platter. When they
went to the shore to start off again, the
Shetland man had his thralls carry a keg
of ale and a great kettle of cooked meat
and put them into the ship.[109]

"Think of me when you eat this," he
said.

Then the Norsemen put to sea again
and sailed for a long time.

One day a terrible storm came up; the
sky was black; the wind howled through
the ship. Great waves leaped in the sea.

"Down with the sail and out with the
oars!" Ingolf shouted.

So the men furled the sail and took
down the mast and laid it along the bottom
of the boat. As they worked, one
man was washed overboard and drowned.
The men sat down to row, but the tumbling
waves tossed the boat about and
poured over her and broke three of the
oars. But still the men held on. They
were wet to the skin and were cold, and
their arms and legs ached with the hard
work, and they were hungry from the
long waiting, but not one face was white
with fear.

"Ran, in her caves under sea, wants
us for company to-night," Ingolf laughed.

So they tossed about all night, but in
the morning the wind died down. Great
waves still rolled, and for days the sea[110]
was rough, but they could put up the sail.
Then one day Leif, as he sat in the pilot's
seat, jumped to his feet and sang:


"To eyes grown tired with looking far,
All at once appeared an island,
A stretching-place for sea-legs,
A quiet bed for backs grown stiff
On rowing-bench on rolling sea.
A place to build a red fire
And thaw the blood that sea-winds froze."


But when they came near they saw no
place to land. The island was like a
mountain of rock standing out of the
water. The sides were steep and smooth.
They sailed around it, but found no place
to climb up.

"There are many other islands here,"
said Leif. "We will try another."

So he steered to another. It, too, was
a steep rock, but one side sloped down to
the water and was green with grass.

"Oh, I have not seen anything so good
as that green grass since I looked into
my mother's face," one man said.

There was a little harbor there. The
men rowed in and quickly jumped out and
put the rollers under the ship and pulled[111]
her upon shore. Then they threw themselves
down on the grass and rolled and
stretched their arms and shouted for joy.
After that they built a fire and warmed
themselves and cooked a meal and ate like
wolves. They slept there that night.

In the morning before Ingolf's men
started away they were standing high
up on the hillside, looking about. They
saw no houses on any of the islands, but
they saw smoke rise from one hillside.

"Some other men, like us, weary of
the sea and stopping to rest," said Ingolf.

They saw the island that they had
sailed around the night before.

"There can surely be nothing but
birds' nests on top of that," Sighvat said.

"Look!" cried another, pointing.

Men were standing on the flat top of
that island. They were letting a boat
down the steep side with ropes. When
it struck the water, they made a rope fast
to the rock and slid down it into the ship
and sailed off.

"Some robber vikings from Scotland
or Ireland," laughed Leif. "It is a good
hiding place for treasure."[112]

Soon Ingolf and his men got into their
ship and were off. Old Sighvat grumbled.

"Is this land not new enough and
empty enough and far enough? I am
tired of sea, sea, sea, and nothing else."

"We started for Iceland," said Ingolf,
"and I will not stop before I come there.
I have a vow. Did you make none,
Sighvat?"

Then they were on the water again
for weeks with no sight of land.

"Oh! I would give my right hand to see
a dragon pawing the water off there and
to fling a word to its men," Sighvat said.

"No hope of that," replied Ingolf.
"Only three dragons before ours have
ever swept this water, and men are not
sailing this way for pleasure or riches."

So only the desolate sea stretched
around them. Sometimes it was smooth
and shining under the sun. Often it was
torn by winds, and a gray sky hung over
it, and the men were drenched with rain.
Once they ran into a fog. For three days
and nights they could not see sun or stars
to steer by. They forgot which way was
north. When after three days the fog[113]
lifted, they found that they had been
going in the wrong direction, and they
had to turn around and sail all that weary
way over again. But at last one afternoon
they saw a white cloud resting on
the water far off. As they sailed toward
it, it grew into long stretches of black,
hilly shore with a blue ice mountain rising
from it. The sun was going down
behind that mountain, and long lines of
pink and of shining green, and great
purple shadows streaked the blue.

"It is Iceland!" shouted the men.

"It is like Asgard the Shining," Ingolf
said.

But it was still far off. Men can see
a long way there because the air is so
clear. So Ingolf and his people sailed on
for hours and at last came into a harbor.
A little green valley sloped up from it.
On one side was the bright ice mountain.
Back of it were bare black and red hills.
In that valley Ingolf and his men drew
up their boat and camped. At supper
that night one of the men said:

"I almost think I never felt a fire
before or had warm food in my mouth."[114]

The men laughed.

"It is four months since we left Norway,"
Ingolf said. "Few men have ever
been on the sea so long."

That night they put up the awning in
the boat and slept under it.

After that some men went fishing
every day in the rowboat that they had.
And Ingolf took others, and they sailed
along the shore, seeing what kind of a
land this was. But winter began to come
on. Then Ingolf said:

"Remember what Floki said of the ice
and the rough sea in winter. Soon we
cannot sail any longer. Let us choose a
place to stay and build a hut there and
cut hay for our cattle."

So they did. Their hut was a little
mean thing of stones and turf. They
kept the cattle and the hay in it. Sometimes
they slept there, when it was very
cold. But most of the time they ate
and slept by a great bonfire out of doors
where it was clean. Leif said:

"I like the cold air of the sea better
than the bad-smelling air of a house,
even though it is warm."[115]

Now every day Ingolf and Leif and
some of the men walked about the island.
At night they all sat around the campfire
and talked of what they had seen
during the day.

"This is surely a wonderful land,"
Ingolf said once. "It is at the same time
like Niflheim and like Asgard. Here is a
spot green and soft, a sweet cradle for
men. Next it is a mountain of ice where
men would freeze to death. And next to
that is a hill of rock that seems to have
come out of some great fire. Yesterday I
saw a cave on the seashore. The door
of it was big enough for a giant. The
waves broke at the doorstep. A terrible
roaring came from the cave. I think it
is the home of a giant. I think that
giants of fire and giants of frost made
this island. I have seen great basins in
the rocks filled with warm water. They
looked like giants' bath-tubs. I have
seen boiling water shoot up out of the
ground. I have walked, and have felt
and heard a great rumbling under me as
though some giant were sleeping there
and turning over in his sleep. One day[116]
I stood on a mountain and looked inland.
There was a wide desert of sand and
black and red rock with nothing growing
on it. The fierce wind blew dirt into my
eyes, and the cold of it froze the marrow
in my bones. When I have seen these
things I have cursed the country, and have
said: 'The gods hate Iceland. I will not
stay here.' But then I have walked
through beautiful warm valleys where
the winds did not come. I saw in my
mind the flowers that we found last summer.
I saw our cattle feeding on the
sweet grass. I thought of the sea full of
good fish. I saw my house built among
green fields, and my wife sitting in her
home, and my children playing among
the flowers and making up tales about
the bright ice mountains. I saw the
wide, rough seas between me and Harald
and our foes. Then I thought to myself,
'It is the sweetest home on earth.' As
for me, I am coming here to live. What
do you say, comrades?"

"Have I not vowed to follow you,
foster-brother?" said Leif. "And indeed
I never saw a land that I liked better.[117]
I don't believe in your giants. My sword
is my god, and my ship is my temple, and
I like this land to set them up in."

They sat about the fire long that night
making plans.

"You shall go home and get our
women and our things, Ingolf," said Leif.
"I will off to Ireland and have a frolic.
There will be little play of swords in this
empty land, and I want to have one last
game before I hang up my battle-knife.
Besides, I will come to you with a ship full
of gold and clothes and house-hangings
such as we cannot get here, and they will
cost me nothing but the swing of a sword."

As they talked, Ingolf looked up at the
sky. The northern lights were quivering
there. They were like great flames
of yellow and green and red.

"See," he said, and pointed. "We are
not so far that the gods will forget us.
There is the flash of the armor of the
Valkyrias.[11] A battle is on somewhere,
and Odin has sent his maidens to choose
the heroes for Valhalla."

Leif only laughed and lay down to sleep.[118]

So in the spring they all went back to
Norway. Leif got ready the boat again
and merrily sailed for Ireland.

"Here I go to get riches for our new
land," he said.

Ingolf set his men to cutting down pines
in the forest and some to building a new
ship. He had his thralls plant large crops of
grain and grind flour and make new kegs
and chests of wood. He himself worked
much at the forge, making all kinds of
tools&mdash;spades, axes, hammers, hunting-knives,
cooking kettles. The women were
busy weaving and sewing new clothes.
Ingolf sold his house and land and everything
that he could not take with him.

After about two years Leif came back.
He had ten thralls that he had got in Ireland.
He took Ingolf aboard his ship and
raised the covers of great chests. Gold
helmets, silver-trimmed drinking-horns,
embroidered robes, and swords flashed
out.

"Did I not say that I would come
back with a full ship?" he laughed.

At last all things were ready for starting.[119]

"To-day I will sacrifice to Thor and
Odin," Ingolf said. "If the omens are
good we will start to-morrow."

"Well, go, foster-brother," laughed
Leif. "But I have better things to do.
I will be putting the cattle into the ship
and will have all ready."

So Ingolf and his men went into the
forests a little way. There in a cleared
space stood a large building. In front of
this temple the men killed two horses for
Odin. Ingolf caught some of the blood
in a brass bowl. He raised it and looked
up at the sky and said:

"All-wise and all-father Odin, and
Thor who loves the thunder, I give these
horses to you. Tell me whether it is
your will that we go to Iceland."

As he said that, a raven flew over his
head. Ingolf watched it.

"It is Odin's will that we go," he said.
"He sent his raven[12] to tell us. It is flying
straight toward Iceland."

The men shouted with joy at that.

Now they hung some of the meat of
the horses on a tree near the temple.

"For the ravens of Odin," they said.[120]

Ingolf carried the bowl of blood into
the temple. He went through the feast
hall in front to a little room at the back.
Here stood wooden statues of the gods in
a semicircle. Before them was a stone
altar. Ingolf took a little brush of twigs
that lay on it and dipped it into the blood
and sprinkled the statues.

"You shall taste of our sacrifice," he
said. "Look kindly on us from your
happy seats in Asgard."

Then they went into the feast hall.
There thralls were boiling the horseflesh
in pots over the fire. The tables were
standing ready before the benches. Ingolf
walked to the high seat. All the
others took their places at the benches.
When the horns came round, Ingolf made
this vow:

"I vow that I will build my house
wherever these pillars lead me."

He put his hand upon a tall post that
stood beside the high seat. There was
one at each side. They were the front
posts of the chair. But they stood up
high, almost to the roof. They were wonderfully
carved and painted with men[121]
and dragons. On the top of each one
was a little statue of Thor with his
hammer.

At the end of the feast Ingolf had his
thralls dig these pillars up. He had a
little bronze chest filled with the earth
that was under the altar.

"I will take the pillars of my high seat
to Iceland," he said, "and I will set up
my altar there upon the soil of Norway,
the soil that all my ancestors have trod,
the soil that Thor loves."

So they carried the pillars and the
chest of earth and the statues of the gods,
and put them into Ingolf's boat.

"It is a well-packed ship," the men
said. "There is no spot to spare."

Tools, and chests of food, and tubs of
drink, and chests of clothes, and fishing
nets were stowed in the bows of both
boats. In the bottom were laid some
long, heavy, hewn logs.

"The trees in Iceland are little," Ingolf
said. "We must take the great beams for
our homes with us."

Standing on these logs were a few
cattle and sheep and horses and pigs.[122]
The rowers' benches were along the sides.
In the stern of each boat was a little
cabin. Here the women and children
were to sleep. But the men would sleep
on the timbers in the middle of the boat
and perhaps they would put up the awning
sometimes.

At last everyone was aboard. Men
loosed the rope that held the boats. The
ships flashed down the rollers into the
water, and Ingolf and Leif were off for
Iceland. As they sailed away everyone
looked back at the shore of old Norway.
There were tears in the women's eyes.
Helga, Leif's wife, sang:


"There was I born. There was I wed.
There are my father's bones.
There are the hills and fields,
The streams and rocks that I love.
There are houses and temples,
Women and warriors and feasts,
Ships and songs and fights&mdash;
A crowded, joyous land.
I go to an empty land."


There was the same long voyage with
storm and fog. But at last the people
saw again the white cloud and saw it
growing into land and mountains. Then[123]
Ingolf took the pillars of his high seat
and threw them overboard.

"Guide them to a good place, O Thor!"
he cried.

The waves caught them up and rolled
them about. Ingolf followed them with
his ship. But soon a storm came up. The
men had to take down the sails and
masts, and they could do nothing with
their oars. The two ships tossed about
in the sea wherever the waves sent them.
The pillars drifted away, and Ingolf could
not see them.

"Remember your pillars, O Thor!" he
cried.

Then he saw that Leif's ship was being
driven far off.

"Ah, my foster-brother," he thought,
"shall I not have you to cheer me in this
empty land? O Thor, let him not go
down to the caves of Ran! He is too
good a man for that."

On the next day the storm was not so
hard, and Ingolf put in at a good harbor.
A high rocky point stuck out into the sea.
A broad bay with islands in the mouth
was at the side. Behind the rocky point[124]
was a level green place with ice-mountains
shining far back.



"Then he saw that Leif's ship was being driven afar off"

After a day or two Ingolf said:

"I will go look for my pillars."

So he and a few men got into the rowboat
and went along the shore and into
all the fiords, but they could not find the
pillars. After a week they came back,
and Ingolf said:

"I will build a house here to live in
while I look for the posts. This way is
uncomfortable for the women."

So he did. Then he set out again to
look for the pillars, but he had no better
luck and came back.

"I must stay at home and see to the
making of hay and the drying of fish,"
he said. "Winter is coming on, and we
must not be caught with nothing to eat."

So he stayed and worked and sent
two of his thralls to look for the holy
posts. They came back every week or
two and always had to say that they
had not found them. Midwinter was
coming on.

"Ah!" said Ingolf's wife one day, "do
you remember the gay feast that we had[126]
at Yule-time? All our friends were there.
The house rang with song and laughter.
Our tables bent with good things to eat.
Walls were hung with gay draperies.
The floor was clean with sweet-smelling
pine-branches. Now look at this mean
house; its dirt floor, its bare stone walls,
its littleness, its darkness! Look at our
long faces. No one here could make a
song if he tried. Oh! I am sick for dear
old Norway."

"It is Thor's fault," Ingolf cried. "He
will not let me find his posts."

He strode out of the house and stood
scowling at the gray sea.

"Ah, foster-brother!" he said. "It was
never so gloomy when you were by my
side. Where are you now? Shall I never
hear your merry laugh again? That spot
in my palm burns, and my heart aches to
see you. That arch of sod keeps rising
before my eyes. Our vows keep ringing
in my ears."

At last the long, gloomy winter passed
and spring came.

"Cheer up, good wife," Ingolf said.
"Better days are coming now."[127]

But that same day the thralls came
back from looking for the posts.

"We have bad news," they said. "As
we walked along the shore looking for
the pillars we saw a man lying on the
shore. We went up to him. He was dead.
It was Leif. Two well-built houses stood
near. We went to them. We knew from
the carving on the door-posts that they
were Leif's. We went in. The rooms
were empty. Along the shore and in the
wood back of the house we found all
of his men, dead. There was no living
thing about."

Ingolf said no word, but his face was
white, and his mouth was set. He went
into the house and got his spears and his
shield and said to his men:

"Follow me."

They put provisions into the boat and
pushed off and sailed until they saw
Leif's houses on the shore of the harbor.
There they saw Leif and the men who
were his friends, dead. Their swords
and spears were gone. Ingolf walked
through the houses calling on Helga
and on the thralls, but no one answered.[128]
The storehouse was empty. The rich
hangings were gone from the walls of
the houses. There was nothing in the
stables. The boat was gone.

Ingolf went out and stood on a high
point of land that jutted out into the
water. Far along the coast he saw some
little islands. He turned to his men and
said:

"The thralls have done it. I think we
shall find them on those islands."

Then he went back to Leif and stood
looking at him.

"What a shame for so brave a man to
fall by the hands of thralls! But I have
found that such things always happen to
men who do not sacrifice to the gods. Ah,
Leif! I did not think when we made those
vows of foster-brotherhood that this would
ever happen. But do not fear. I remember
my promise. I had thought that a
man's blood is precious in this empty
land, but my vow is more precious."

Now they laid all those men together
and tied on their hell-shoes.

"I need my sword for your sake, foster-brother.
I cannot give you that. But you[129]
shall have my spears and my drinking-horn,"
said Ingolf. "For surely Odin has
chosen you for Valhalla, even though you
did not sacrifice. You are too good a man
to go to Niflheim. You would make
times merry in Valhalla."

So Ingolf put his spears and his drinking-horn
by Leif. Then the men raised
a great mound over all the dead. After
that they went aboard their boat and
sailed for the islands that Ingolf had
seen. It was evening when they reached
them.

"I see smoke rising from that one,"
Ingolf said, pointing.

He steered for it. It was a steep rock
like that one in the Faroes, but they
found a harbor and landed and climbed
the steep hill and came out on top. They
saw the ten thralls sitting about a bonfire
eating. Helga and the other women from
Leif's house sat near, huddled together,
white and frightened. One of the thralls
gave a great laugh and shouted:

"This is better than pulling Leif's
plow. To-morrow we will sail for Ireland
with all his wealth."[130]

"To-morrow you will be freezing in
Niflheim," cried Ingolf, and he leaped
among them swinging his sword, and all
his men followed him, and they killed
those thralls.

Then Ingolf turned to Helga. She
threw herself into his arms and wept.
But after a while she told him this
story:

"When springtime came, Leif thought
that he would sow wheat. He had but
one ox. The others had died during the
winter. So he set the thralls to help pull
the plow. I saw their sour looks and
was afraid, but Leif only laughed:

"'What else can thralls expect?' he
said. 'Never fear them, good wife.'

"Now one day soon after that the
thralls came running to the house calling
out:

"'The ox is dead! The ox is dead!'

"Leif asked them about it. They said
that a bear had come out of the woods
and killed it, and that they had scared
the beast away. They pointed out where
it had gone. Then Leif called his men
and said:[131]

"'A hunt! I had not hoped for such
great sport here. Ah, we will have a
feast off that bear!'

"So they took their spears and went
out into the woods. As soon as they were
gone, the thralls came running into the
house and took down all the swords and
shields from the wall and ran out. In
some way they met my lord and his men
in the woods and killed them. Then they
came back and took everything in the
house and dragged us to the boat and
sailed here."

"O my brother!" said Ingolf, "where
is that song about 'those two foster-brothers,
Ingolf and Leif, who made a
new country in a wonderful land, and
whose sons and grandsons are mighty
men in Iceland'? But come home with
me, Helga."

So they took the women and Leif's
things and Leif's boat and sailed home.
The next day after they came to Ingolf's
house, Helga said:

"We have made your family larger,
brother Ingolf. Will you not take Leif's
two houses and live in them? He does[132]
not need them now. He would like you
to have them."

"It would be pleasant to live there,"
Ingolf said. "I thank you."

So the next day they loaded everything
aboard the two ships and sailed
for Leif's house. There they stayed for
a year. Ingolf still sent his thralls out
to look for the pillars. He was careful
always to have hay, so his cattle prospered.
That spring he planted wheat, but
it did not grow well.

"This is sickly stuff," Ingolf said. "It
takes too much time and work. It is
better to save the land for hay. Perhaps
we can sometime go back to Norway for
flour."

At last one day the thralls came home
and said:

"We have found the pillars."

Ingolf jumped to his feet. He cried
out:

"You have kept me waiting three
years, Thor. But as soon as my house
and temple are built, I will sacrifice to
you three horses as a thank-offering."

"It is a long way off, master," the[133]
thralls said, "and we have found much
better places in our walks about the
island."

"Thor knows best," Ingolf answered.
"I will settle where he leads me."

So that summer they loaded everything
into the ships again and sailed west
along the coast until they came to the
place where the pillars were. The land
there was low and green. On both sides
were low hills. A little lake glistened
back from shore. In the valley were hot
springs, with steam rising from them.

"It looks like smoke," the men said.
"It is very strange to see hot water and
smoke come out of the ground."

In front of this green land was a good
harbor with islands in it. Far over the
sea toward the north shone a great ice-mountain.

"I like the place," Ingolf said. "I will
make this land mine."

So he built fires at the mouth of the
river near there, and stood by them and
called out loudly:

"I have put my fire at the mouth of
these rivers. All the land that they drain[134]
is mine, and no man shall claim it but me.
I will call this place Reykjavik."[13]

Then Ingolf built his feast hall. He
himself carved the beams and the door-posts.
Gaily painted dragons leaned out
from the doors and stood up from the
gables. Men and animals fought on the
door-posts. For the doors he made at
the forge great iron hinges. Their ends
curved and spread all over the door. Near
his feast hall he built a storehouse and a
kitchen and a smithy and a stable and
a bower for the women.

"We do not need a sleeping-house for
guests," he said. "Who would be our
guests?"

He roofed all his buildings with turf. It
made them look like green mounds with
gay carved and painted walls under them.
He built also a temple, and on that was
beautiful carving. In this he set up those
statues that had been in his old temple.
He put up, too, those pillars of his high
seat that had been drifting about so long.
Under them he laid the soil of Norway that
he had brought in the little bronze chest.[135]

"I have kept my vow, O Thor!" he
cried.

Then he sacrificed three horses that
he had promised to Thor. After that was
over, he said:

"Here is a good field for sport. Let
us have some of the old games that we
used to play at home. Who will wrestle
with me?"

So they wrestled there and ran races
and swam in the water. The women sat
and looked on.

"Oh, this is good to see!" Helga cried.
"We are as gay as we used to be in old
Norway."

But it was not many weeks before
Ingolf said:

"I wish that I might sometime see
sails in that harbor. I wish that I might
think, 'Around this point of land is
another farm, and across the bay is
another. I can go there when I am very
lonely.' I wish that I might sometime
be invited to a feast. I wish that I might
sometimes hear the good, clanging music
of weapons at play. It is a good land,
but we have lived alone for four years.[136]
I am hungry for new faces and for tidings
of Norway."



"Those Icelanders clapped them on the shoulders"

One night as he and his men sat about
the long fire in the feast hall, a servant
threw a great piece of wood upon the fire.
It was streaked with faded paint and it
showed bits of carving.

"See," said Ingolf, pointing to it,
"see what is left of a good ship's prow!
What lands have you seen, O dragon's
head? What battles have you fought?
What was your master's name? Where
did the storm meet you? Perhaps he was
coming to Iceland, comrades. Would it
not have been pleasant to see his sail and
to shake his hand and to welcome him
to Iceland? But instead he is in Ran's
caves, and only his broken prow has
drifted here."

Now it was not many months after
that when one of the men came running
into the feast hall, shouting:

"A sail! a sail in the harbor!"

All those men gave a shout with no
word in it, as though their hearts had
leaped into their throats. They jumped
up and ran to the shore and stood there[138]
with hungry eyes. When the men landed,
those Icelanders clapped them on the
shoulders, and tears ran down their faces.
For a long time they could say nothing but
"Welcome! Welcome!"

But after a while Ingolf led them to
the feast hall and had a feast spread at
once. While the thralls were at work,
the men stood together and talked. Such
a noise had never been in that hall
before.

"We have already built our fires and
claimed our land up the shore a way,"
the leader said. "Men in Norway talk
much of Ingolf and Leif, and wonder
what has happened to them."

Then Ingolf told them of all that had
come to pass in Iceland; and then he
asked of Norway.

"Ah! things are going from bad to
worse," the newcomers said. "Harald
grows mightier every day. A man dare
not swing a sword now except for the
king. We came here to get away from
him. Many men are talking of Iceland.
Soon the sea-road between here and Norway
will be swarming with dragons."[139]

And so it was. Ships also came from
Ireland and from the Shetlands and the
Orkneys.

"Harald has come west-over-seas," the
men of these ships said, "and has laid
his heavy hand upon the islands and put
his earls over them. They are no place
now for free men."

So by the time Ingolf was an old man,
Iceland was no longer an empty land.
Every valley was spotted with bright
feast halls and temples. Horses and
cattle pastured on the hillsides. Smoke
curled up from kitchens and smithies.
Gay ships sailed the waters, taking Iceland
cloth and wool and Iceland fish and
oil and the soft feathers of Iceland birds
to Norway to sell, and bringing back
wood and flour and grain.

When Ingolf died, his men drew up
on the shore the boat in which he had
come to Iceland. They painted it freshly
and put new gold on it, so that it stood
there a glittering dragon with head raised
high, looking over the water. Old Sighvat
lifted a huge stone and carried it to
the ship's side. With all his strength he[140]
threw it into the bottom. The timbers
cracked.

"If this ship moves from here," he
said, "then I do not know how to moor
a ship. It is Ingolf's grave."

Then men laid Ingolf upon his shield
and carried him and placed him on the
high deck in the stern near the pilot's
seat where he had sat to steer to Iceland.
They hung his sword over his shoulder.
They laid his spear by his side. In his
hand they put his mead-horn. Into the
ship they set a great treasure-chest filled
with beautiful clothes and bracelets and
head-bands. Beside the treasure-chest
they piled up many swords and spears
and shields. They put gold-trimmed
saddles and bridles upon three horses.
Then they killed the horses and dragged
them into the ship. They killed hunting-dogs
and put them by the horses;
for they said:

"All these things Ingolf will need in
Valhalla. When he walks through the
door of that feast hall, Odin must know
that a rich and brave man comes. When
he fights with those heroes during the[141]
day, he must have weapons worthy of
him. He must have dogs for the hunt.
When he feasts with those heroes at
night he must wear rich clothes, so that
those feasters shall know that he was a
wealthy man and generous, and that his
friends loved him."

Ingolf's son tied on his hell-shoes for
the long journey.

"If these shoes come untied," he said,
"I do not know how to fasten hell-shoes."

Then he went out of the ship and stood
on the ground with his family. All the
men of Iceland were there.

"This is a glorious sight," they said.
"Surely no ship ever carried a richer
load. Inside and out the boat blazes
with gold and bronze, and, high over his
riches, lies the great Ingolf, ready to take
the tiller and guide to Valhalla, where
all the heroes will rise up and shout him
welcome."

Then the thralls heaped a mound of
earth over the ship. This hill stood up
against the sky and seemed to say:
"Here lies a great man." Sighvat put a
stone on the top, with runes on it telling[142]
whose grave it was. All this time a
skald stood by and played on his harp
and sang a song about that time when
Ingolf came to Iceland. He called him
the father of Iceland. People of that
country still read an old story that the
men of that long ago time wrote about
Ingolf, and they love him because he
was a brave man and "the first of men
to come to Iceland."

Eric the Red

It was a spring day many years after
Ingolf died. All the freemen in the
west of Iceland had come to a meeting.
Here they made laws and punished men
for having done wrong. The meeting
was over now. Men were walking about
the plain and talking. Everybody seemed
much excited. Voices were loud, arms
were swinging.

"It was an unjust decision," some one
cried. "Eric killed the men in fair fight.
The judges outlawed him because they
were afraid. His foe Thorgest has many
rich and powerful men to back him."

"No, no!" said another. "Eric is a
bloody man. I am glad he is out of Iceland."

Just then a big man with bushy red
hair and beard stalked through the crowd.
He looked straight ahead and scowled.

"There he goes," people said, and
turned to look after him.[144]



"He looked straight ahead of him and scowled"

"His hands are as red as his beard,"
some said, and frowned.

But others looked at him and smiled,
saying:

"He walks like Thor the Fearless."

"His story would make a fine song,"
one said. "As strong and as brave and
as red as Thor! Always in a quarrel. A
man of many places&mdash;Norway, the north
of Iceland, the west of Iceland, those
little islands off the shore of Iceland.
Outlawed from all of them on account of
his quarrels. Where will he go now, I
wonder?"

This Eric strode down to the shore
with his men following.

"He is in a black temper," they said.
"We should best not talk to him."

So they made ready the boat in silence.
Eric got into the pilot's seat and they
sailed off. Soon they pulled the ship up
on their own shore. Eric strolled into
his house and called for supper. When
the drinking-horns had been filled and
emptied, Eric pulled himself up and
smiled and shouted out so that the great
room was full of his big voice:[146]

"There is no friend like mead. It
always cheers a man's heart."

Then laughter and talking began in
the hall because Eric's good temper had
come back. After a while Eric said:

"Well, I must off somewhere. I have
been driven about from place to place,
like a seabird in a storm. And there is
always a storm about me. It is my
sword's fault. She is ever itching to
break her peace-bands[14] and be out and
at the play. She has shut Norway to me
and now Iceland. Where will you go
next, old comrade?" and he pulled out
his sword and looked at it and smiled as
the fire flashed on it.

"There are some of us who will follow
you wherever you go, Eric," called a man
from across the fire.

"Is it so?" Eric cried, leaping up.
"Oh! then we shall have some merry
times yet. Who will go with me?"



"More than half the men in the hall jumped to their feet"

More than half the men in the hall
jumped to their feet and waved their
drinking-horns and shouted:

"I! I!"

[148]Eric sat down in his chair and laughed.

"O you bloody birds of battle!" he
cried. "Ever hungry for new frolic! Our
swords are sisters in blood, and we are
brothers in adventure. Do you know
what is in my heart to do?"

He jumped to his feet, and his face
glowed. Then he laughed as he looked
at his men.

"I see the answer flashing from your
eyes," he said, "that you will do it even
if it is to go down to Niflheim and
drag up Hela, the pale queen of the stiff
dead."

His men pounded on the tables and
shouted:

"Yes! Yes! Anywhere behind Eric!"

"But it is not to Niflheim," Eric
laughed. "Did you ever hear that story
that Gunnbiorn told? He was sailing for
Iceland, but the fog came down, and then
the wind caught him and blew him far
off. While he drifted about he saw a
strange land that rose up white and shining
out of a blue sea. Huge ships of ice
sailed out from it and met him. I mean
to sail to that land."[149]

A great shout went up that shook the
rafters. Then the men sat and talked
over plans. While they sat, a stranger
came into the hall.

"I have no time to drink," he said. "I
have a message from your friend Eyjolf.
He says that Thorgest with all his men
means to come here and catch you to-night.
Eyjolf bids you come to him, and
he will hide you until you are ready to
start; for he loves you."

"Hunted like a wolf from corner to
corner of the world!" Eric cried angrily.
"Will they not even let me finish one
feast?"

Then he laughed.

"But if I take my sport like a wolf,
I must be hunted like one. So we
shall sleep to-night in the woods about
Eyjolf's house, comrades, instead of in
these good beds. Well, we have done it
before."

"And it is no bad place," cried some of
the men.

"I always liked the stars better than a
smoky house fire," said one.

"Can no bad fortune spoil your good[150]
nature?" laughed Eric. "But now we
are off. Let every man carry what he
can."

So they quickly loaded themselves
with clothes and gold and swords and
spears and kettles of food. Eric led his
wife Thorhild and his two young sons,
Thorstein and Leif. All together they
got into the boat and went to Eyjolf's
farm. For a week or more they stayed
in his woods, sometimes in a secret cave
of his when they knew that Thorgest
was about. And sometimes Eyjolf sent
and said:

"Thorgest is off. Come to my house
for a feast."

All this time they were making ready
for the voyage, repairing the ship and
filling it with stores. Word of what Eric
meant to do got out, and men laughed
and said:

"Is that not like Eric? What will he
not do?"

Some men liked the sound of it, and
they came to Eric and said:

"We will go with you to this strange
land."[151]

So all were ready and they pushed
off with Eric's family aboard and those
friends who had joined him. They took
horses and cattle with them, and all kinds
of tools and food.

"I do not well know where this land
is," Eric said. "Gunnbiorn said only that
he sailed east when he came home to Iceland.
So I will steer straight west. We
shall surely find something. I do not
know, either, how long we must go."

So they sailed that strange ocean, never
dreaming what might be ahead of them.
They found no islands to rest on. They
met heavy fogs.

One day as Eric sat in the pilot's seat,
he said:

"I think that I see one of Gunnbiorn's
ships of ice. Shall we sail up to her and
see what kind of a craft she is?"

"Yes," shouted his men.

So they went on toward it.

"It sends out a cold breath," said one
of the men.

They all wrapped their cloaks about
them.

"It is a bigger boat than I ever saw[152]
before," said Eric. "The white mast
stands as high as a hill."



"It is a bigger boat than I ever saw before"

"It must be giants that sail in it, frost
giants," said another of the men.

But as they came nearer, Eric all at
once laughed loudly and called out:

"By Thor, that Gunnbiorn was a foolish
fellow. Why, look! It is only a piece
of floating ice such as we sometimes see
from Iceland. It is no ship, and there is
no one on it."

His men laughed and one called to
another and said:

"And you thought of frost giants!"

Then they sailed on for days and days.
They met many of these icebergs. On
one of them was a white bear.

"Yonder is a strange pilot," Eric
laughed.

"I have seen bears come floating so to
the north shore of Iceland," an old man
said. "Perhaps they come from the land
that we are going to find."

One day Eric said:

"I see afar off an iceberg larger than
any one yet. Perhaps that is our white
land."

[154]But even as he said it he felt his boat
swing under his hand as he held the
tiller. He bore hard on the rudder, but
he could not turn the ship.

"What is this?" he cried. "A strong
river is running here. It is carrying our
ship away from this land. I cannot make
head against it. Out with the oars!"

So with oars and sail and rudder they
fought against the current, but it took
the boat along like a chip, and after a
while they put up their oars and drifted.

"Luck has taken us into its own
hands," Eric laughed. "But this is as
good a way as another."

Sometimes they were near enough to
see the land, then they were carried out
into the sea and thought that they should
never see any land again.

"Perhaps this river will carry us to a
whirlpool and suck us under," the men
said.

But at last Eric felt the current less
strong under his hand.

"To the oars again!" he called.

So they fought with the current and
sailed out of it and went on toward land.[155]
But when they reached the shore they
found no place to go in. Steep black
walls shot up from the sea. Nothing
grew on them. When the men looked
above the cliffs they saw a long line of
white cutting the sky.

"It is a land of ice," they said.

They sailed on south, all the time looking
for a place to go ashore.

"I am sick of this endless sea," Thorhild
complained, "but this land is worse."

After a while they began to see small
bays cut into the shore with little flat
patches of green at their sides. They
landed in these places and stretched and
warmed themselves and ate.

"But these spots are only big enough
for graves," the men said. "We can not
live here."

So they went on again. All the time
the weather was growing colder. Eric's
people kept themselves wrapped in their
cloaks and put scarfs around their
heads.

"And it is still summer!" Thorhild
said. "What will it be in winter?"

"We must find a place to build a house[156]
now before the winter comes on," said
Eric. "We must not freeze here."

So they chose a little spot with hills
about it to keep off the wind. They made
a house out of stones; for there were
many in that place. They lived there that
winter. The sea for a long way out from
shore froze so that it looked like white
land. The men went out upon it to hunt
white bear and seal. They ate the meat
and wore the skins to keep them warm.
The hardest thing was to get fuel for the
fire. No trees grew there. The men
found a little driftwood along the shore,
but it was not enough. So they burned
the bones and the fat of the animals they
killed.

"It is a sickening smell," Thorhild
said. "I have not been out of this mean
house for weeks. I am tired of the darkness
and the smoke and the cattle. And
all the time I hear great noises, as though
some giant were breaking this land into
pieces."

"Ah, cheer up, good wife!" Eric
laughed. "I smell better luck ahead."

Once Eric and his men climbed the[157]
cliffs and went back into the middle of
the land. When they came home they
had this to tell:

"It is a country of ice, shining white.
Nothing grows on it but a few mosses.
Far off it looks flat, but when you walk
upon it, there are great holes and cracks.
We could see nothing beyond. There
seems to be only a fringe of land around
the edge of an island of ice."

The winter nights were very long.
Sometimes the sun showed for an hour,
sometimes for only a few minutes, sometimes
it did not show at all for a week.
The men hunted by the bright shining of
the moon or by the northern lights.

As it grew warmer the ice in the sea
began to crack and move and melt and
float away. Eric waited only until there
was a clear passage in the water. Then
he launched his boat, and they sailed
southward again. At last they found a
place that Eric liked.

"Here I will build my house," he said.

So they did and lived there that summer
and pastured their cattle and cut hay
for the winter and fished and hunted.[158]

The next spring Eric said:

"The land stretches far north. I am
hungry to know what is there."

Then they all got into the boat again
and sailed north.

"We can leave no one here," Eric had
said. "We cannot tell what might come
between us. Perhaps giants or dragons
or strange men might come out of this
inland ice and kill our people. We must
stay together."

Farther north they found only the
same bare, frozen country. So after a
while they sailed back to their home and
lived there.

One spring after they had been in that
land for four years, Eric said:

"My eyes are hungry for the sight of
men and green fields again. My stomach
is sick of seal and whale and bear. My
throat is dry for mead. This is a bare
and cold and hungry land. I will visit
my friends in Iceland."

"And our swords are rusty with long
resting," said his men. "Perhaps we can
find play for them in Iceland."

"Now I have a plan," Eric suddenly[159]
said. "Would it not be pleasant to see
other feast halls as we sail along the
coast?"

"Oh! it would be a beautiful sight,"
his men said.

"Well," said Eric, "I am going to try
to bring back some neighbors from Iceland.
Now we must have a name for our
land. How does Greenland sound?"

His men laughed and said:

"It is a very white Greenland, but men
will like the sound of it. It is better than
Iceland."

So Eric and all his people sailed back
and spent the winter with his friends.

"Ah! Eric, it is good to hear your
laugh again," they said.

Eric was at many feasts and saw many
men, and he talked much of his Greenland.

"The sea is full of whale and seals and
great fish," he said. "The land has bear
and reindeer. There are no men there.
Come back with me and choose your
land."

Many men said that they would do it.
Some men went because they thought it[160]
would be a great frolic to go to a new
country. Some went because they were
poor in Iceland and thought:

"I can be no worse off in Greenland,
and perhaps I shall grow rich there."

And some went because they loved
Eric and wanted to be his neighbors.

So the next summer thirty-five ships
full of men and women and goods followed
Eric for Greenland. But they met
heavy storms, and some ships were
wrecked, and the men drowned. Other
men grew heartsick at the terrible storm
and the long voyage and no sight of land,
and they turned back to Iceland. So of
those thirty-five ships only fifteen got to
Greenland.

"Only the bravest and the luckiest
men come here," Eric said. "We shall
have good neighbors."

Soon other houses were built along
the fiords.

"It is pleasant to sail along the coast
now," said Eric. "I see smoke rising
from houses and ships standing on the
shore and friendly hands waving."

Leif and His New Land

Now Eric had lived in Greenland for
fifteen years. His sons Thorstein
and Leif had grown up to be big, strong
men. One spring Leif said to his father:

"I have never seen Norway, our
mother land. I long to go there and
meet the great men and see the places
that skalds sing about."

Eric answered:

"It is right that you should go. No
man has really lived until he has seen
Norway."

So he helped Leif fit out a boat and
sent him off. Leif sailed for months.
He passed Iceland and the Faroes and
the Shetlands. He stopped at all of these
places and feasted his mind on the new
things. And everywhere men received
him gladly; for he was handsome and
wise. But at last he came near Norway.
Then he stood up before the pilot's seat
and sang loudly:[162]


"My eyes can see her at last,
The mother of mighty men,
The field of famous fights.
In the sky above I see
Fair Asgard's shining roofs,
The flying hair of Thor,
The wings of Odin's birds,
The road that heroes tread.
I am here in the land of the gods,
The land of mighty men."


For a while he walked the land as
though he were in a dream. He looked
at this and that and everything and loved
them all because it was Norway.

"I will go to the king," he said.

He had never seen a king. There
were no kings in Iceland or in Greenland.
So he went to the city where the king
had his fine house. The king's name
was Olaf. He was a great-grandson of
Harald Hairfair; for Harald had been
dead a hundred years.

Now the king was going to hold a
feast at night, and Leif put on his most
beautiful clothes to go to it. He put on
long tights of blue wool and a short jacket
of blue velvet. He belted his jacket with
a gold girdle. He had shoes of scarlet[163]
with golden clasps. He threw around
himself a cape of scarlet velvet lined
with seal fur. His long sword stuck out
from under his cloak. On his head he
put a knitted cap of bright colors. Then
he walked to the king's feast hall and
went through the door. It was a great
hall, and it was full of richly-dressed
men. The fires shone on so many golden
head-bands and bracelets and so many
glittering swords and spears on the wall,
and there was so much noise of talking
and laughing, that at first Leif did not
know what to do. But at last he went
and sat on the very end seat of the bench
near him.

As the feast went on, King Olaf sat in
his high seat and looked about the hall
and noticed this one and that one and
spoke across the fire to many. He was
keen-eyed and soon saw Leif in his far
seat.

"Yonder is some man of mark," he said
to himself. "He is surely worth knowing.
His face is not the face of a fool. He
carries his head like a lord of men."

He sent a thrall and asked Leif to[164]
come to him. So Leif walked down the
long hall and stood before the king.

"I am glad to have you for a guest,"
the king said. "What are your name
and country?"

"I am Leif Ericsson, and I have come
all the way from Greenland to see you
and old Norway."

"From Greenland!" said the king. "It
is not often that I see a Greenlander.
Many come to Norway to trade, but they
seldom come to the king's hall. I shall
be glad to hear about your land. Come
up and speak with me."

So Leif went up the steps of the high
seat and sat down by the king and talked
with him. When the feast was over the
king said:

"You shall live at my court this winter,
Leif Ericsson. You are a welcome guest."

So Leif stayed there that winter.
When he started back in the spring, the
king gave him two thralls as a parting
gift.

"Let this gift show my love, Leif
Ericsson," he said. "For your sake I
shall not forget Greenland."[165]

Leif sailed back again and had good
luck until he was past Iceland. Then
great winds came out of the north and
tossed his ship about so that the men
could do nothing. They were blown
south for days and days. They did not
know where they were. Then they saw
land, and Leif said:

"Surely luck has brought us also to a
new country. We will go in and see
what kind of a place it is."

So he steered for it. As they came
near, the men said:

"See the great trees and the soft, green
shore. Surely this is a better country
than Greenland or than Iceland either."

When they landed they threw themselves
upon the ground.

"I never lay on a bed so soft as this
grass," one said.

"Taller trees do not grow in Norway,"
said another.

"There is no stone here as in Norway,
but only good black dirt," Leif said.
"I never saw so fertile a land before."

The men were hungry and set about
building a fire.[166]



"He pointed to the woods and laughed and rolled his eyes"

"There is no lack of fuel here," they
said.

They stayed many days in this country
and walked about to see what was
there. A German, named Tyrker, was
with Leif. He was a little man with a
high forehead and a short nose. His
eyes were big and rolling. He had lived
with Eric for many years, and had taken
care of Leif when he was a little boy. So
Leif loved him.

Now one day they had been wandering
about and all came back to camp at
night except Tyrker. When Leif looked
around on his comrades, he said:

"Where is Tyrker?"

No one knew. Then Leif was angry.

"Is a man of so little value in this
empty land that you would lose one?" he
said. "Why did you not keep together?
Did you not see that he was gone? Why
did you not set out to look for him?
Who knows what terrible thing may
have happened to him in these great
forests?"

Then he turned and started out to
hunt for him. His men followed, silent[168]
and ashamed. They had not gone far
when they saw Tyrker running toward
them. He was laughing and talking to
himself. Leif ran to him and put his
arms about him with gladness at seeing
him.

"Why are you so late?" he asked.
"Where have you been?"

But Tyrker, still smiling and nodding
his head, answered in German. He
pointed to the woods and laughed and
rolled his eyes. Again Leif asked his
question and put his hand on Tyrker's
shoulder as though he would shake him.
Then Tyrker answered in the language
of Iceland:

"I have not been so very far, but I
have found something wonderful."

"What is it?" cried the men.

"I have found grapes growing wild,"
answered Tyrker, and he laughed, and his
eyes shone.

"It cannot be," Leif said.

Grapes do not grow in Greenland nor
in Iceland nor even in Norway. So it
seemed a wonderful thing to these Norsemen.[169]

"Can I not tell grapes when I see
them?" cried Tyrker. "Did I not grow
up in Germany, where every hillside is
covered with grapevines? Ah! it seems
like my old home."

"It is wonderful," Leif said. "I have
heard travelers tell of seeing grapes growing,
but I myself never saw it. You shall
take us to them early in the morning,
Tyrker."

So in the morning they went back into
the woods and saw the grapes. They ate
of them.

"They are like food and drink," they
cried.

That day Leif said:

"We spent most of the summer on the
ocean. Winter will soon be coming on
and the sea about Greenland will be
frozen. We must start back. I mean to
take some of the things of this land to
show to our people at home. We will
fill the rowboat with grapes and tow it
behind us. The ship we will load with
logs from these great trees. That will be
a welcome shipload in Greenland, where
we have neither trees nor vines. Now[170]
half of you shall gather grapes for the
next few days, and the other half shall
cut timber."

So they did, and after a week sailed off.
The ship was full of lumber, and they
towed the rowboat loaded with grapes.
As they looked back at the shore, Leif
said:

"I will call this country Wineland for
the grapes that grow there."

One of the men leaped upon the gunwale
and leaned out, clinging to the sail,
and sang:


"Wineland the good, Wineland the warm,
Wineland the green, the great, the fat.
Our dragon fed and crawls away
With belly stuffed and lazy feet.
How long her purple, trailing tail!
She fed and grew to twice her size."


Then all the men waved their hands
to the shore and gave a great shout for
that good land.

For all that voyage they had fair
weather and sailed into Eric's harbor
before the winter came. Eric saw the
ship and ran down to the shore. He took
Leif into his arms and said:[171]

"Oh, my son, my old eyes ached to see
you. I hunger to hear of all that you
have seen and done."

"Luck has followed me all the way,"
said Leif. "See what I have brought
home."

The Greenlanders looked.

"Lumber! lumber!" they cried. "Oh!
it is better stuff than gold."

Then they saw the grapes and tasted
them.

"Surely you must have plundered Asgard,"
they said, smacking their lips.

At the feast that night Eric said:

"Leif shall sit in the place of honor."

So Leif sat in the high seat opposite
Eric. All men thought him a handsome
and wise man. He told them of the storm
and of Wineland.

"No man would ever need a cloak there.
The soil is richer than the soil of Norway.
Grain grows wild, and you yourselves saw
the grapes that we got from there. The
forests are without end. The sea is full
of fish."

The Greenlanders listened with open
mouths to all this. They turned and[172]
talked to Leif's ship-comrades who were
scattered among them.

Leif noticed two strangers, an old
man who sat at Eric's side and a young
woman on the cross-bench. He turned
to his brother Thorstein who sat next
to him.

"Who are these strangers?" he asked.

"Thorbiorn and his daughter Gudrid,"
Thorstein answered. "They landed here
this spring. I never saw our father more
glad of anything than to see this Thorbiorn.
They were friends before we
left Iceland. When they saw each other
again they could not talk enough of old
times. In the spring Eric means to give
him a farm up the fiord a way. It seems
that this Thorbiorn comes of a good
family that has been rich and great in
Iceland for years. And Thorbiorn himself
was rich when our father knew him,
and was much honored by all men. But
ill luck came, and he grew poor. This
hurt his pride. 'I will not stay in Iceland
and be a beggar,' he said to himself.
'I will not have men look at me and say,
"He is not what his father was." I will[173]
go to my friend Eric the Red in Greenland.'

"Then he got ready a great feast and
invited all his friends. It was such a
feast as had not been in Iceland for years.
Thorbiorn spent on it all the wealth that
he had left. For he said to himself, 'I will
not leave in shame. Men shall remember
my last feast.' After that he set out
and came to Greenland.

"Is not Gudrid beautiful? And she is
wise. I mean to marry her, if her father
will permit it."

Now Leif settled down in Greenland
and became a great man there. He was
so busy and he grew so rich that he did
not think of going to Wineland again.
But people could not forget his story.
Many nights as men sat about the long
fires they talked of that wonderful land
and wished to see it.





[174]




Wineland the Good

On an autumn, a year or two after
Leif came home, Eric and his men
saw two large ships come to land not far
down the shore from the house.

"They look like trading ships," Eric
said. "Let us go down to see them."

"I will go, too," Gudrid said. "Perhaps
they will have rich cloth and jewelry. It
is long since I had my eyes on a new
dress."

So they all went down and found two
large trading ships lying in the water.
A great many men were on the shore
making a fire.

"Welcome to Greenland!" called Eric.
"What are your names and your country?"

Then a fine, big man walked out from
among the men and went up to Eric.

"I am Thorfinn," he said, "a trader.
I sailed this summer from Iceland with
forty men and a shipload of goods. On[175]
the sea I met this other ship from Iceland.
The master is Biarni. Come and
look at my goods."

So he rowed Eric and Gudrid out and
they went aboard his boat. Thorfinn
opened his chests and showed Eric gleaming
swords and bracelets and axes and
farm tools. But before Gudrid he spread
beautiful cloth and gold embroidery and
golden necklaces. As they looked, he
told of doings in Iceland and asked of
Greenland.

"We never see such things as these
in this bare land," Gudrid said, as she
smoothed a beautiful dress of purple velvet.
"I envy the women of Iceland their
fair clothes."

"There is no need of that," Thorfinn
said, "for this dress is yours and anything
else from my chests that you like.
Here is a necklace that I beg you to take.
It did not have a fairer mistress in Greece
where I got it."

"You are a very generous trader,"
Gudrid said.

Then Thorfinn gave Eric a great sword
with a gold-studded scabbard. After a[176]
while he took them to Biarni's ship. He
also gave them gifts. They all talked
and laughed much while they were together.

"You are merry comrades," Eric said.
"I ask you both and all your men to spend
the winter at my house. You can put
your goods into my storehouses."

"By my sword! a generous offer,"
said Thorfinn. "As for me, I am happy
to come."

Biarni and all the rest said the same
thing. Thorfinn walked to the house
with Eric and Gudrid, while the other
men sailed to the ship-sheds and pulled
their boats under them.

Then Thorfinn saw to the unloading
and storing of his goods.

"Is this Gudrid your daughter?" he
asked of Eric one day.

"She is the widow of my son Thorstein,"
Eric said. "He died the same
winter that they were married. Her
father, too, died not long ago. So Gudrid
lives with me."

Now all that winter until Yule-time
Eric spread a good feast every night.[177]
There was laughter through his house all
the time. Often at the feasts the men
cast lots to see whether they might sit
on the cross-bench with the women.
Sometimes it was Thorfinn's luck to sit
by Gudrid. Then they talked gaily and
drank together.

At last Yule was coming near. Eric
went about the house gloomy then. One
day Thorfinn put his hand on Eric's
shoulder and said:

"Something is troubling you, Eric.
We have all noticed that you are not gay
as you used to be. Tell me what is the
matter."

"You have carried yourselves like
noble men in my house," Eric answered.
"I am proud to have you for guests.
Now I am ashamed that you should not
find a house worthy of you. I am
ashamed that when you leave me you
will have to say that you never spent a
worse Yule than you did with Eric the
Red in Greenland. For my cupboards
are empty."

"Oh, that is easily mended," Thorfinn
said. "No house could feed eighty men[178]
so long and not feel it. I never knew so
generous a host before. But I have flour
and grain and mead in my boat. You
are welcome to all of it. You have only
to open the doors of your own storehouses.
It is a little gift."

So Eric used those things, and there
was never a merrier Yule feast than in
his house that winter.

When Yule was over, Thorfinn said to
Eric:

"Gudrid is a beautiful and wise woman.
I wish to have her for my wife."

"You seem to be a man worthy of her,"
Eric said.

So that winter Gudrid and Thorfinn
were married and lived at Eric's house.

One day Thorfinn said to Eric:

"I have heard much of this wonderful
Wineland since I have been here. It
seems to me that it is worth while to go
and see more of it."

"My son Thorstein and I tried it
once," said Eric. "It was the year after
Leif came back. We set out with a fair
ship and with glad hearts, but we tossed
about all summer on the sea and got[179]
nowhere. We were wet with storm, lean
with hunger and illness, and heartsick at
our bad luck."

"And yet," Thorfinn said, "another
time we might have better weather. I
have never seen so fair a land as this
seems to be."

Then he went to Leif and talked long
with him. Leif told him in what direction
he had sailed to come home, and how
the shores looked that he had passed.

"I think I could find my way," Thorfinn
said. "My heart moves me to try
this frolic."

He spoke to Gudrid about it.

"Oh, yes!" she cried. "Let us go.
It is long since I felt a boat leaping under
me. I am tired of sitting still. I want
to feel the warm days and see the soft
grass and the high trees and taste the
grapes of this Wineland the Good."

Then he talked with his men and with
Biarni.

"We are ready," they all said. "We
are only waiting for a leader."

"Then let us go!" cried Thorfinn.

So in the spring they fitted up their[180]
two ships and put into them provisions
and a few cattle. Some of Eric's men
also got ready a boat, so that three ships
set sail from Eric's harbor carrying one
hundred and sixty men to Wineland. As
they started, Gudrid stood on the deck
and sang:


"I will feast my eyes on new things&mdash;
On mighty trees and purple grapes,
On beds of flowers and soft grass.
I will sun myself in a warm land."


They sailed on and past those shores
that Leif had spoken of. Whenever they
saw any interesting place they sailed in
and looked about and rested there.

They had gone far south, past many
fair shores with woods on them, when
Gudrid said one day:

"This is a beautiful bay with a smooth,
green field by it, and the great mountains
far back. I should like to stay there for
a little while."

So they sailed in and drew their ships
up on shore. They put up the awnings
in them.

"These shall be our houses," Thorfinn
said.[181]

They were strange-looking houses&mdash;shining
dragons with gay backs lying on
the yellow sand. Near them the Norsemen
lighted fires and cooked their supper.
That night they slept in the ships. In
the morning Gudrid said:

"I long to see what is back of that
mountain."

So they all climbed it. When they
stood on the top they could see far over
the country.

"There is a lake that we must see,"
Thorfinn said.

"I should like to sail around that bay,"
said Biarni, pointing.

"I am going to walk up that valley
yonder," one of the men said.

And everyone saw some place where
he would like to go. So for all that summer
they camped in that spot and went
about the country seeing new things.
They hunted in the woods and caught
rabbits and birds and sometimes bears
and deer. Every day some men rowed out
to sea and fished. There was an island
in the bay where thousands of birds had
their nests. The men gathered eggs here.[182]

"We have more to eat than we had in
Greenland or Iceland," Thorfinn said,
"and need not work at all. It is all play."

Near the end of summer Thorfinn
spoke to his comrades.

"Have we not seen everything here?
Let us go to a new place. We have not
yet found grapes."

Thorfinn and Biarni and all their men
sailed south again. But some of Eric's
men went off in their boat another way.
Years afterward the Greenlanders heard
that they were shipwrecked and made
slaves in Ireland.

After Thorfinn and Biarni had sailed
for many days they landed on a low,
green place. There were hills around it.
A little lake was there.

"What is growing on those hillsides?"
Thorfinn said, shading his eyes with his
hand.

He and some others ran up there. The
people on shore heard them shout. Soon
they came running back with their hands
full of something.

"Grapes! Grapes!" they were shouting.[183]

All those people sat down and ate the
grapes and then went to the hillside and
picked more.

"Now we are indeed in Wineland,"
they said. "It is as wonderful as Leif's
stories. Surely we must stay here for a
long time."

The very next day they went into the
woods and began to cut out lumber. The
huts that they built were little things.
They had no windows, and in the doorways
the men hung their cloaks instead
of doors.

"We can be out in the air so much in
this warm country," said Gudrid, "that
we do not need fine houses."

The huts were scattered all about,
some on the side of the lake, some at
the shore of the harbor, some on the hillside.
Gudrid had said:

"I want to live by the lake where I
can look into the green woods and hear
sweet bird-noises."

So Thorfinn built his hut there.

As they sat about the campfire one
night, Biarni said:

"It is strange that so good a land[184]
should be empty. I suppose that these
are the first houses that were ever built
in Wineland. It is wonderful to think
that we are alone here in this great
land."

All that winter no snow fell. The
cattle pastured on the grass.

"To think of the cold, frozen winters
in Greenland!" Gudrid said. "Oh! this
is the sun's own land."

In the beginning of that winter a little
son was born to Gudrid and Thorfinn.

"A health to the first Winelander!"
the men shouted and drank down their
wine; for they had made some from
Wineland grapes.

"Will he be the father of a great
country, as Ingolf was?" Biarni mused.

Gudrid looked at her baby and smiled.

"You will be as sunny as this good
land, I hope," she said.

They named him Snorri. He grew
fast and soon crept along the yellow sand,
and toddled among the grapevines, and
climbed into the boats and learned to
talk. The men called him the "Wineland
king."[185]

"I never knew a baby before," one of
the men said.

"No," said another. "Swords are jealous.
But when they are in their scabbards,
we can do other things, even play
with babies."

"I wonder whether I have forgotten
how to swing my sword in this quiet
land," another man said.

One spring morning when the men
got up and went out from their huts to
the fires to cook they saw a great many
canoes in the harbor. Men were in them
paddling toward shore.

"What is this?" cried the Norsemen
to one another. "Where did they come
from? Are they foes? Who ever saw such
boats before? The men's faces are brown."

"Let every man have his sword ready,"
cried Thorfinn. "But do not draw until
I command. Let us go to meet them."

So they went and stood on the shore.
Soon the men from the canoes landed
and stood looking at the Norsemen. The
strangers' skin was brown. Their faces
were broad. Their hair was black. Their
bodies were short. They wore leather[186]
clothes. One man among them seemed
to be chief. He spread out his open hands
to the Norsemen.



"The chief held them out to Thorfinn and hugged the cloak to him"

"He is showing us that he has no
weapons," Biarni said. "He comes in
peace."

Then Thorfinn showed his empty
hands and asked:

"What do you want?"

The stranger said something, but the
Norsemen could not understand. It was
some new language. Then the chief
pointed to one of the huts and walked
toward it. He and his men walked all
around it and felt of the timber and
went into it and looked at all the things
there&mdash;spades and cloaks and drinking-horns.
As they looked they talked together.
They went to all the other huts
and looked at everything there. One of
them found a red cloak. He spread it
out and showed it to the others. They
all stood about it and looked at it and
felt of it and talked fast.

"They seem to like my cloak," Biarni
said.

One of the strangers went down to[188]
their canoes and soon came back with an
armload of furs&mdash;fox-skins, otter-skins,
beaver-skins. The chief took some and
held them out to Thorfinn and hugged
the cloak to him.

"He wants to trade," Thorfinn said.
"Will you do it, Biarni?"

"Yes," Biarni answered, and took the
furs.

"If they want red stuff, I have a whole
roll of red cloth that I will trade," one of
the other men said.

He went and got it. When the strangers
saw it they quickly held out more furs
and seemed eager to trade. So Thorfinn
cut the cloth into pieces and sold every
scrap. When the strangers got it they
tied it about their heads and seemed
much pleased.

While this trading was going on and
everybody was good-natured, a bull of
Thorfinn's ran out of the woods bellowing
and came towards the crowd. When
the strangers heard it and saw it they
threw down whatever was in their hands
and ran to their canoes and paddled off
as fast as they could.[189]

The Norsemen laughed.

"We have lost our customers," Biarni
said.

"Did they never see a bull before?"
laughed one of the men.

Now after three weeks the Norsemen
saw canoes in the bay again. This time
it was black with them, there were so
many. The people in them were all making
a horrible shout.

"It is a war-cry," Thorfinn said, and he
raised a red shield. "They are surely
twenty to our one, but we must fight.
Stand in close line and give them a taste
of your swords."

Even as he spoke a great shower of
stones fell upon them. Some of the
Norsemen were hit on the head and
knocked down. Biarni got a broken
arm. Still the storm came fast. The
strangers had landed and were running
toward the Norsemen. They threw their
stones with sling-shots, and they yelled
all the time.

"Oh, this is no kind of fighting for
brave men!" Thorfinn cried angrily.

The Norsemen's swords swung fast,[190]
and many of the strangers died under
them, but still others came on, throwing
stones and swinging stone axes. The horrible
yelling and the strange things that
the savages did frightened the Norsemen.

"These are not men," some one cried.

Then those Norsemen who had never
been afraid of anything turned and ran.
But when they came to the top of a rough
hill Thorfinn cried:

"What are we doing? Shall we die
here in this empty land with no one to
bury us? We are leaving our women."

Then one of the women ran out of the
hut where they were hiding.

"Give me a sword!" she cried. "I can
drive them back. Are Norsemen not
better than these savages?"

Then those warriors stopped, ashamed,
and stood up before the wild men and
fought so fiercely that the strangers
turned and fled down to their canoes and
paddled away.

"Oh, I am glad they are gone!" Thorfinn
said. "It was an ugly fight."

"Thor would not have loved that
battle," one said.[191]

"It was no battle," another replied.
"It was like fighting against an army of
poisonous flies."

The Norsemen were all worn and
bleeding and sore. They went to their
huts and dressed their wounds, and the
women helped them. At supper that
night they talked about the fight for a
long time.

"I will not stay here," Gudrid said.
"Perhaps these wild men have gone away
to get more people and will come back
and kill us. Oh! they are ugly."

"Perhaps brown faces are looking at us
now from behind the trees in the woods
back there," said Biarni.

It was the wish of all to go home. So
after a few days they sailed back to
Greenland with good weather all the way.
The people at Eric's house were very glad
to see them.

"We were afraid you had died," they
said.

"And I thought once that we should
never leave Wineland alive," Thorfinn
answered.

Then they told all the story.[192]

"I wonder why I had no such bad
luck," Leif said. "But you have a better
shipload than I got."

He was looking at the bundles of furs
and the kegs of wine.

"Yes," said Thorfinn, "we have come
back richer than when we left. But I will
never go again for all the skins in the
woods."

The next summer Thorfinn took Gudrid
and Snorri and all his people and
sailed back to Iceland, his home. There
he lived until he died. People looked at
him in wonder.

"That is the man who went to Wineland
and fought with wild men," they
said. "Snorri is his son. He is the first
and last Winelander, for no one will ever
go there again. It will be an empty and
forgotten land."

And so it was for a long time. Some
wise men wrote down the story of those
voyages and of that land, and people read
the tale and liked it, but no one remembered
where the place was. It all seemed
like a fairy tale. Long afterwards, however,
men began to read those stories with[193]
wide-open eyes and to wonder. They
guessed and talked together, and studied
this and that land, and read the story
over and over. At last they have learned
that Wineland was in America, on the
eastern shore of the United States, and
they have called Snorri the first American,
and have put up statues of Leif
Ericsson, the first comer to America.[15]

[194]




House. In a rich Norseman's home were many
buildings. The finest and largest was the great
feast hall. Next were the bower, where the women
worked, and the guest house, where visitors slept.
Besides these were storehouses, stables, work-shops,
a kitchen, a sleeping-house for thralls. All these
buildings were made of heavy, hewn logs, covered
with tar to fill the cracks and to keep the wood from
rotting. The ends of the logs, the door-posts, the
peaks of gables, were carved into shapes of men and
animals and were painted with bright colors. These
gay buildings were close together, often set around
the four sides of a square yard. That yard was a
busy and pleasant place, with men and women running
across from one bright building to another.
Sometimes a high fence with one gate went around
all this, and only the tall, carved peaks of roofs
showed from the outside.

Names. An old Norse story says: "Most men
had two names in one, and thought it likeliest to lead
to long life and good luck to have double names."
To be called after a god was very lucky. Here are
some of those double names with their meanings:
"Thorstein" means Thor's stone; "Thorkel" means
Thor's fire; "Thorbiorn" means Thor's bear; "Gudbrand"
means Gunnr's sword (Gunnr was one of
the Valkyrias[16]); "Gunnbiorn" means Gunnr's bear;[195]
"Gudrid" means Gunnr's rider; "Gudrod" means
Gunnr's land-clearer. (Most of the land in old
Norway was covered with forests. When a man got
new land he had to clear off the trees.) In those
olden days a man did not have a surname that
belonged to everyone in his family. Sometimes
there were two or three men of the same name in a
neighborhood. That caused trouble. People thought
of two ways of making it easy to tell which man was
being spoken of. Each was given a nickname. Suppose
the name of each was Haki. One would be
called Haki the Black because he had black hair.
The other would be called Haki the Ship-chested
because his chest was broad and strong. These nicknames
were often given only for the fun of it. Most
men had them,&mdash;Eric the Red, Leif the Lucky,
Harald Hairfair, Rolf Go-afoot. The other way of
knowing one Haki from the other was to tell his
father's name. One was Haki, Eric's son. The
other was Haki, Halfdan's son. If you speak these
names quickly, they sound like Haki Ericsson and
Haki Halfdansson. After a while they were written
like that, and men handed them on to their sons and
daughters. Some names that we have nowadays
have come down to us in just that way&mdash;Swanson,
Anderson, Peterson, Jansen. There was another
reason for these last names: a man was proud to
have people know who his father was.

Drinking-horns. The Norsemen had few cups
or goblets. They used instead the horns of cattle,
polished and trimmed with gold or silver or bronze.
They were often very beautiful, and a man was[196]
almost as proud of his drinking-horn as of his
sword.

Tables. Before a meal thralls brought trestles
into the feast hall and set them before the benches.
Then they laid long boards across from trestle to
trestle. These narrow tables stretched all along both
sides of the hall. People sat at the outside edge
only. So the thralls served from the middle of the
room. They put baskets of bread and wooden platters
of meat upon these bare boards. At the end of
the meal they carried out tables and all, and the
drinking-horns went round in a clean room.

Beds. Around the sides of the feast hall were
shut-beds. They were like big boxes with doors
opening into the hall. On the floor of this box was
straw with blankets thrown over it. The people got
into these beds and closed the doors and so shut
themselves in. Olaf's men could have set heavy
things against these doors or have put props against
them. Then the people could not have got out; for on
the other side of the bed was the thick outside wall
of the feast hall, and there were no windows in it.

Feast Hall. The feast hall was long and narrow,
with a door at each end. Down the middle of the
room were flat stones in the dirt floor. Here the
fires burned. In the roof above these fires were
holes for the smoke to go out, but some of it blew
about the hall, and the walls and rafters were stained
with it. But it was pleasant wood smoke, and the
Norsemen did not dislike it. There were no large
windows in a feast hall or in any other Norse building.
High up under the eaves or in the roof itself were[197]
narrow slits that were called wind's-eyes. There was
no glass in them, for the Norsemen did not know
how to make it; but there were, instead, covers made
of thin, oiled skin. These were put into the wind's-eyes
in stormy weather. There were covers, too, for
the smoke-holes. The only light came through these
narrow holes, so on dark days the people needed the
fire as much for light as for warmth.

Foster-father. A Norse father sent his children
away from home to grow up. They went when they
were three or four years old and stayed until they
were grown. The father thought: "They will be
better so. If they stayed at home, their mother
would spoil them with much petting."

Foster-brothers. When two men loved each
other very much they said, "Let us become foster-brothers."

Then they went and cut three long pieces of turf
and put a spear into the ground so that it held up
the strips of turf like an arch. Runes were cut on
the handle of the spear, telling the duties of foster-brothers.
The two men walked under this arch, and
each made a little cut in his palm. They knelt and
clasped hands, so that the blood of the two flowed
together, and they said, "Now we are of one blood."

Then each made this vow: "I will fight for my
foster-brother whenever he shall need me. If he is
killed before I am, I will punish the man who did it.
Whatever things I own are as much my foster-brother's
as mine. I will love this man until I die.
I call Odin and Thor and all the gods to hear my
vow. May they hate me if I break it!"[198]

Ran. Ran was the wife of Aegir, who was god
of the sea. They lived in a cave at the bottom of
the ocean. Ran had a great net, and she caught in
it all men who were shipwrecked and took them to
her cave. She also caught all the gold and rich
treasures that went down in ships. So her cave was
filled with shining things.

Valkyrias. These were the maidens of Odin.
They waited on the table in Valhalla. But whenever
a battle was being fought they rode through
the air on their horses and watched to see what
warriors were brave enough to go to Valhalla. Sometimes
during the fight a man would think that he
saw the Valkyrias. Then he was glad; for he knew
that he would go to Valhalla.

An old Norse story says this about the Valkyrias:
"With lightning around them, with bloody shirts of
mail, and with shining spears they ride through the
air and the ocean. When their horses shake their
manes, dew falls on the deep valleys and hail on the
high forests."

Odin's Ravens. Odin had a great throne in his
palace in Asgard. When he sat in it he could look
all over the world. But it was so far to see that he
could not tell all of the things that were happening.
So he had two ravens to help him. An old Norse
story tells this about them: "Two ravens sit on
Odin's shoulders and whisper in his ears all that they
have heard and seen. He sends them out at dawn
of day to see over the whole world. They return at
evening near meal time. This is why Odin knows
so many things."[199]

Reykjavik. Reykjavik means "smoky sea." Ingolf
called it that because of the steaming hot-springs by
the sea. The place is still called Reykjavik. A little
city has grown up there, the only city in Iceland. It
is the capital of the country.

Peace-bands. A Norseman always carried his
sword, even at a feast; for he did not know when he
might need it. But when he went somewhere on an
errand of peace and had no quarrel he tied his sword
into its scabbard with white bands that he called
peace-bands. If all at once something happened to
make him need his sword, he broke the peace-bands
and drew it out.

Eskimos. Now, the Eskimos live in Greenland
and Alaska and on the very northern shores of
Canada. But once they lived farther south in pleasanter
lands. After a while the other Indian tribes
began to grow strong. Then they wanted the pleasant
land of the Eskimos and the seashore that the
Eskimos had. So they fought again and again with
those people and won and drove them farther north
and farther north. At last the Eskimos were on
the very shores of the cold sea, with the Indians still
pushing them on. So some of them got into their
boats and rowed across the narrow water and came
to Greenland and lived there. Some people think
that these things happened before Eric found Greenland.
In that case he found Eskimos there; and
Thorfinn saw red Indians in Wineland. Other people
think that this happened after Eric went to Greenland.
If that is true, he found an empty land, and
it was Eskimos that Thorfinn saw in Wineland.

[200]





Possibly this book seems made up of four or
five disconnected stories. They are, however,
strung upon one thread,&mdash;the westward emigration
from Norway. The story of Harald is intended
to serve in two ways towards the working out of this
plot. It gives the general setting that continues
throughout the book in costume, houses, ideals,
habits. It explains the cause of the emigration from
the mother country. It is really an introductory
chapter. As for the other stories, they are distinctly
steps in the progress of the plot. A chain of islands
loosely connects Norway with America,&mdash;Orkneys
and Shetlands, Faroes, Iceland, Greenland. It was
from link to link of this chain that the Norsemen
sailed in search of home and adventure. Discoveries
were made by accident. Ships were driven by the
wind from known island to unknown. These two
points,&mdash;the island connection that made possible
the long voyage from Norway to America, and the
contribution of storm to discovery,&mdash;I have stated in
the book only dramatically. I emphasize them here,
hoping that the teacher will make sure that the
children see them, and possibly that they state them
abstractly.

Let me speak as to the proper imaging of the
stories. I have not often interrupted incident with
special description, not because I do not consider the
getting of vivid and detailed images most necessary
to full enjoyment and to proper intellectual habits,
but because I trusted to the pictures of this book
and to the teacher to do what seemed to me inartistic
to do in the story. Some of these descriptions and
explanations I have introduced into the book in the
form of notes, hoping that the children in turning to
them might form a habit of insisting upon full[201]
understanding of a point, and might possibly, with
the teacher's encouragement, begin the habit of
reference reading.

The landscape of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland
is wonderful and will greatly assist in giving reality
and definiteness to the stories. Materials for this
study are not difficult of access. Foreign colored
photographs of Norwegian landscape are becoming
common in our art stores. There are good illustrations
in the geographical works referred to in the
book list. These could be copied upon the blackboard.
There are three books beautifully illustrated
in color that it will be possible to find only in large
libraries,&mdash;"Coast of Norway," by Walton; "Travels
in the Island of Iceland," by Mackenzie; "Voyage en
Islande et au Gr&ouml;enland," by J. P. Gaimard. If the
landscape is studied from the point of view of formation,
the images will be more accurate and more
easily gained, and the study will have a general value
that will continue past the reading of these stories
into all work in geography.

Trustworthy pictures of Norse houses and costumes
are difficult to obtain. In "Viking Age" and
"Story of Norway," by Boyesen (G. P. Putnam's
Sons, New York), are many copies of Norse antiquities
in the fashion of weapons, shield-bosses, coins,
jewelry, wood-carving. These are, of course, accurate,
but of little interest to children. Their chief
value lies in helping the teacher to piece together a
picture that she can finally give to her pupils.

Metal-working and wood-carving were the most
important arts of the Norse. If children study
products of these arts and actually do some of the
work, they will gain a quickened sympathy with the
people and an appreciation of their power. They
may, perhaps, make something to merely illustrate
Norse work; for instance, a carved ship's-head, or a
copper shield, or a wrought door-nail. But, better,
they may apply Norse ideas of form and decoration[202]
and Norse processes in making some modern thing
that they can actually use; for instance, a carved
wood pin-tray or a copper match holder. This work
should lead out into a study of these same industries
among ourselves with visits to wood-working shops
and metal foundries.

Frequent drawn or painted illustration by the
children of costumes, landscapes, houses, feast halls,
and ships will help to make these images clear. But
dramatization will do more than anything else for
the interpreting of the stories and the characters. It
would be an excellent thing if at last, through the
dramatization and the handwork, the children should
come into sufficient understanding and enthusiasm
to turn skalds and compose songs in the Norse manner.
This requires only a small vocabulary and a
rough feeling for simple rhythm, but an intensity of
emotion and a great vividness of image.

These Norse stories have, to my thinking, three
values. The men, with the crude courage and the
strange adventures that make a man interesting to
children, have at the same time the love of truth, the
hardy endurance, the faithfulness to plighted word,
that make them a child's fit companions. Again, in
form and in matter old Norse literature is well worth
our reading. I should deem it a great thing accomplished
if the children who read these stories should
so be tempted after a while to read those fine old
books, to enjoy the tales, to appreciate straightforwardness
and simplicity of style. The historical
value of the story of Leif Ericsson and the others
seems to me to be not to learn the fact that Norsemen
discovered America before Columbus did, but
to gain a conception of the conditions of early navigation,
of the length of the voyage, of the dangers of
the sea, and a consequent realization of the reason
for the fact that America was unknown to medi&aelig;val
Europe, of why the Norsemen did not travel, of
what was necessary to be done before men should[203]
strike out across the ocean. Norse story is only one
chapter in that tale of American discovery. I give
below an outline of a year's work on the subject
that was once followed by the fourth grade of the
Chicago Normal School. The idea in it is to give
importance, sequence, reasonableness, broad connections,
to the discovery of America.

The head of the history department who planned
this course says it is "in a sense a dramatization of
the development of geographical knowledge."

Following is a bare topical outline of the work:

Evolution of the forms of boats.
Viking tales.
A crusade as a tale of travel and discovery.
Monasteries as centers of work.
Printing.
Story of Marco Polo.
Columbus' discovery.
Story of Vasco da Gama.
Story of Magellan.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
