<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg001">[1]</span>PREFACE.<br />
<small>TO THE READER, OR RATHER TO THOSE WHO HESITATE
IN BUYING THIS WORK.</small></h2>

<p>"Good wine needs no bush," and, therefore,
little by way of preface is necessary to this Work.
"He who is ignorant of arithmetic," says Archimedes,
"is but half a man." Therefore, for the
sake of <em>manhood</em>, which drapers'-boys and lawyers'-clerks
attempt by means of mustachoes and penny-cigars,
read this Work,&mdash;for if the dead abstractions
of this science will make a <em>man</em>, what must the
living realities do?&mdash;Nothing less than a Phœnix
D'Orsay, which is at least 1 man ¾ and ⅝.</p>

<p>Read this book, then, my friends, young and
old. It teaches practical philosophy in every
<span class="pb" id="Pg002">[2]</span>
chapter; wisdom in every page; and common
sense in every line. Get this manual at the
fingers' ends of your mind, and your physical and
mental powers will be so expanded that you will
be able to catch a comet by the tail; take the moon
by the horns; knock down the great wall of China,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Cribb</i>; or measure the spectre of the Brocken
for a pair of breeches, and thus cut a pretty
<span class="smcap">Figure</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg003">[3]</span>FIGURES FOR THE MILLION.<br />
<small>Of Arithmetic and its Importance.</small></h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Arithmetic is the art or science of computing
by numbers. It is national, political, military,
and commercial. It is of the highest importance
to the community; because it pre-eminently
teaches us to take care of <span class="smcap">Number I</span>. Our ministers
succeed according to their knowledge of the
science of numbers. Witness the skilful management
of majorities of the lower house.</p>

<p>He who understands the true art of <em>Addition</em>,
<em>Subtraction</em>, <em>Multiplication</em>, and <em>Division</em>, as here
laid down, will not be considered a mere <em>cipher</em> in
<span class="pb" id="Pg004">[4]</span>
the world; but will, in all probability, make a
considerable <em>figure</em>: and in the figurative words of
Horace, be "Dives agris dives positis in fœnore
nummis."</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, under the guidance and protection
of that god of honest men, the light-heeled
and light-fingered Mercury, be diligent so to <em>add</em>
to our store by <em>subtracting</em> from the stores of
others, that we may <em>add</em> to our importance. Let
us so <em>multiply</em> our resources, by encouraging <em>division</em>
among our contemporaries, that we may see
their <em>reduction</em> in the perfection of our own <em>practice</em>.</p>

EXPLANATION OF ARITHMETICAL SIGNS AND
CHARACTERS.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<p class="caption">EQUALITY.</p>
<img src="images/pg005.jpg" width="450" height="455" alt="The Sign of Equality--'Who are You?'" />
<p class="caption">"WHO ARE YOU?"</p></div>

<p>= Equality. The sign of equality: as, "A
living beggar is better than a dead king;" or both
being dead, are equal to each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<span class="pb" id="Pg006">[6]</span>
<img src="images/pg006a.jpg" width="450" height="469" alt="The Sign of Subtraction" />
</div>

<p>&mdash; Minus, less. The sign of subtraction; as,
for instance, an elopement to Gretna; or, a
knocking-down argument by the way-side, &mdash; minus
ticker. Take from &mdash; from take.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg006b.jpg" width="450" height="460" alt="A Pluralist" />
<p class="caption">A PLURALIST.</p></div>

<p>+ Plus, or more. The sign of addition; as,
3 livings + to 1 = 4; or, 5 millions of new taxes
+ to 48 = 53.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<span class="pb" id="Pg007">[7]</span>
<img src="images/pg007a.jpg" width="450" height="449" alt="The Sacred Haltar" />
<p class="caption">THE SACRED HALTAR.</p></div>

<p>× Multiplied by. The sign of multiplication:
as, "The sun breeds maggots in a dead dog."&mdash;<em>See
Shakspeare.</em> Or, "Money makes money."&mdash;<em>See
Franklin.</em> Or, Anti-Malthus.&mdash;<em>See Ireland.</em></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg007b.jpg" width="450" height="462" alt="Dividing the Chinese, a cutting Joke" />
<p class="caption">DIVIDING THE CHINESE, A CUTTING JOKE.</p></div>

<p>÷ Divided by. The sign of division. Example
<span class="pb" id="Pg008">[8]</span>
1. The Whigs.&mdash;2. The Church. A house
divided against itself. Division of property; the
lion's share, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>SIGNS OF PROPORTION.</h3>

<p>Is to: so is:: As Lord B&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">is to</span> Bishop
P&mdash;&mdash;, <span class="smcap">so is</span> a blue musquito to a planter's nose.</p>

<p>As Sir R&mdash;&mdash; I&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">is to</span> J&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;, <span class="smcap">so is</span>
a pair of donkey's-ears to a barber's-block.</p>

<p>As Tommy Duncombe <span class="smcap">is to</span> Lord Stanley, <span class="smcap">so
is</span> shrimp-sauce to a boiled turbot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<span class="pb" id="Pg009">[9]</span>
<img src="images/pg009.jpg" width="450" height="272" alt="The Poor Curate--The Bishop" />
<p class="caption">THE POOR CURATE. &nbsp; THE BISHOP.</p></div>

<h2>RULE I.<br />
<small>NUMERATION.</small></h2>

<p>Numeration teaches the different value of
figures by their different <em>places</em> (see Walkinghame,
Court Guide, Law List, &amp;c.); also the value of
ciphers, or noughts, according to their relative
situations (see Intellectual Calculator, or Martin's
Arithmetical Frames). As regards the value of
figures in places, we have illustrations in sinecures
<span class="pb" id="Pg010">[10]</span>
of all grades, from the Lords of the Treasury to
the meanest underling of the Stamp-Office.</p>

<p>Place and pension make the <em>unit</em> a <em>multitude</em>,
according to the position of the noughts,&mdash;that is,
that large portion of the public called the nobodies.
The more a man is surrounded by his inferiors,
the greater he becomes. Hence the necessity of
restrictive tariffs to prevent wealth in a community,&mdash;and
of impediments to education. It is not,
therefore, <em>naughty</em> for our betters to keep us down
by any kind of mystification; as the sun always
looks larger through a fog.</p>

<p>The value of figures and of ciphers will be well
understood in the following table, which ought to
be committed faithfully to memory. It will be
seen that when the noughts, the nobodies, that is,
the people, go before the legislative units, their
value is consequently decreased; but when they
follow as good backers in good measures, the value
of the characters is increased <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.</p>

RULE II.<br />

<small>ADDITION.</small></h2>

<p>Our life is an addition sum; sometimes long,
sometimes short; and Death, with "jaws capacious,"
sums up the whole of our <em>hum</em>anity by
making the "tottle" of the whole.</p>

<p>Man is an adding animal; his instinct is, to get.
He is an illustration of the verb, to get, in all its
inflexions and conjugations; and thus we get and
beget, till we ourselves are added to our fathers.</p>

<p>There are many ways of performing addition,
as in the following: a young grab-all comes upon
the fumblers at long-taw, as Columbus did upon
the Indians; or, as every thrifty nation does upon
the weak or unsuspicious, and cries "<em>Smuggins</em>!"</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg013">[13]</span>
Addition is also performed in a less daring
manner by the save-all process, till Death, with his
extinguisher, shuts the miser up in his own smoke.</p>

<p>Addition may also be performed by <em>subtraction</em>
by other methods. It is one to make "Jim along
Josey!" the watchword, as Joey does in the pantomime.</p>

<p>Addition teaches, also, to add <em>units</em> together, and
to find their sum total, as A + B = 2. A bachelor
is a <em>unit</em>; a Benedict, <em>unitee</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrimonial Addition.</span>&mdash;By common ciphering
1 and 1 make 2. But, by the mathematics of
matrimony, 1 and 1 will produce from 1 to 20,
arranged in row, one above another, like a flight of
<span class="pb" id="Pg015">[15]</span>
stairs. They make a pretty addition to a man's
<em>effects</em>, as well as to his <em>income</em>; and, if not themselves
<em>capital</em>, are a <em>capital</em> stimulus to exertion.
Surrounded by these special pleaders, a man
becomes as sharp-set as a Lancashire ferret, and
looks as fierce as a rat-catcher's dog at a sink-hole.
Such men ought to be labelled, "Beware of this
unfortunate dog!" for he would bite at a file!</p>

of performing addition. It is not necessary to go
<span class="pb" id="Pg016">[16]</span>
to an university for this, any more than it is necessary
to go to a church to get married. The thing
can now be done without it. Schoolmasters, and
pettifoggers of all kinds, will find this an excellent
piece of practical wisdom.</p>

<p>Subtraction teaches to "take from" or to find
the difference of two numbers; having taken too
much <em>in</em>, and slept <em>out</em>; to find the difference in
sovereigns and shillings between that and sleeping
at home according to the "conventional laws of
virtuous propriety." (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vide</i> Miss Martineau.)</p>

<p>The figures are to be arranged in subtraction
one under the other; that line expressing the
<span class="pb" id="Pg024">[24]</span>
highest number, being placed above the line
expressing the smaller number. In this arrangement,
the upper line is called the <em>subtrahend</em>, and
the lower the <em>subtractor</em>; the difference is called
the <em>remainder</em>. Our readers, the million, are the
subtrahend. The following are subtractors:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Corn and sugar monopolists.</li>
<li>Tax-collector.</li>
<li>Easter dues, beadle and clerk.</li>
<li>Poor-rate.</li>
<li>Christmas-box and Christmas-piece.</li>
<li>Subscriptions for Chiggered Niggers.</li>
<li>Parson Smith and his orphans.</li>
<li>Poor relations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Rule of Subtraction is perhaps the most
useful in either national, political, or commercial
Arithmetic; "<span class="smcap">Take from</span>" being the universal
maxim of mankind from the day that Adam and
Eve stole the forbidden fruit. In sacred history
we find various exemplifications of the principle:
Jacob made use of it when he obtained his
brother's birthright and his blessing; David, when
he took the wife of Uriah. Profane or classical
history abounds with examples. It was the royal
and sacerdotal rule, in all climes, countries, and
<span class="pb" id="Pg025">[25]</span>
times. Kings have grown thrifty by it, and
conquerors invincible. "<em>Take from</em>" is, in short,
the motto of the legislators; and <em>rhetoric</em> the
soldier's <em>watchword</em>, the prince's <em>condescension</em>, the
courtezan's <em>smile</em>, the lawyer's <em>brief</em>, the priest's
<em>prayer</em>, and the tradesman's <em>craft</em>. The use of this
rule, is to enable us to "do one another," not "as
we would be done," without the contravention of
the majesty of the law.</p>

<div class="verse">That they should <em>take</em> who have the power,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And they should <em>keep</em>&mdash;who can."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have had some amusing ways of performing
this rule in "by-gone ages." Among the most
celebrated, were <em>Indulgences</em> and <em>Benevolences</em>.
They worked well for those who worked ill, and
led to a multiplication of heresies.</p>

<p>Subtraction is perhaps one of the most fashionable
of all the rules; and any one who sets himself
down for a gentleman must expect to be beset by
a swarm of hungry locusts, who make a rule to
bleed him at every pore till he becomes poor.
When Edward the First took the wealth of the
Jews and their teeth at the same time, he showed a
fatherly consideration for those who having nothing
to eat wanted neither incisores, cuspidati, bicuspidæ,
or molarii. But we are to be nipped, and
squeezed, and tapped, and leeched, and drained to
all eternity, and are still expected to&mdash;give.</p>

<p><em>To take in.</em>&mdash;This rule not only teaches us to
take from, but also to take in, which is to take

<h3>SUBTRACTION OF CHARACTER, OR <em>DE</em>-TRACTION.</h3>

<p>The rules already given for performing this
branch of arithmetic apply to money matters;
but the perfection of the art consists, not in simply
taking from another what you want yourself, but
that which does not enrich you, but makes him
poor indeed. This has been styled, by way of
eminence, the devil's subtraction, being the general
essence of the black art. It is called <em>De</em>traction.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg029">[29]</span>
Detraction may be performed in a variety of
ways, as for example:&mdash;"Oh, I know him&mdash;his
great grandfather was&mdash;but no matter, and his
mother&mdash;no better than she should be, but I hate
to speak evil of the dead. I have enough to do to
mind my own business&mdash;and yet one cannot help
knowing&mdash;but yet nobody knows what he is or
how he gets his money. He makes a show certainly,
but I like things to be paid for before they
are sported. His wife, too&mdash;what was she, do
you suppose? As I have heard, a cook in a
tradesman's family.&mdash;Well, a cook is not so bad
after all&mdash;I am sure it is better than a doctor.
But I believe he was forced to marry her.&mdash;Poor
woman, she suffered, I dare say&mdash;Well, it is well it
is no worse&mdash;It was the only amends he could
make her&mdash;It would have been a cruel thing for
the poor innocent children to be born illegitimate.&mdash;But
he is still very gay&mdash;These sort of men will
be&mdash;but there will be an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</i> some day.
Things can't go on for ever&mdash;Well, I wish them
no harm, poor creatures&mdash;But do you go to
their party to-night?&mdash;I go only for the sake
of seeing how madam cook conducts the entertainment."</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg030">[30]</span>
<span class="smcap">Rule for Ladies With Regard To Their
Rivals.</span>&mdash;Should any lady be so unfortunate as
to fear a rival in the affections of some simple-hearted
swain in the personal attractions of some
youthful beauty whom he has never seen, it must be
her method not to vilify her character or underrate
her accomplishments,&mdash;no, this is but sorry skill.
The more delicate and refined way of <em>subtracting</em>
from her merits will be to employ unbounded
panegyric, so as to raise the expectations of the
feared admirer, that the real shall fall infinitely
short of the ideal. This is another mode of performing
<em>subtraction</em> by <em>addition</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Literary Subtraction.</span>&mdash;This is of essential
service to editors, reviewers, and others, who,
having nothing good of their own with which to
amuse the public, steal the brains of others.</p>

<p><i>Rule.</i>&mdash;Take from a work published at a
guinea all its cream and quintessence, under
pretence of praising it into immortality through
the pages of your fourpenny review. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castrant
alios, ut libros suos per se graciles alieno adipe
suffarciant.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg031">[31]</span>
<span class="smcap">Mercantile Subtraction.</span>&mdash;It is well understood
in this country, that no honest man can get
a living, in consequence of the extraordinary competition
among us. It is therefore considered legal
and justifiable for the baker to "take toll" and make
"dead men;" for the licensed victualler to make
"two butts out of one;" for the wine-merchant
to "doctor" his port; for the butcher to "hang on
Jemmy;" for the printer to make "corrections;"
for the tailor to "cabbage;" for the grocer to
"sand his sugar and birch-broom his tea." The
milkman "waters his milk" by act of parliament;
and to show that all this is in the order of Providence,
the rains of heaven <em>wet the coals</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">National or Political Subtraction.</span>&mdash;There
is one part of the New Testament which all
Christian rulers have religiously observed, namely,
"Now, Cæsar issued a decree that all the world
should be taxed." The art of taxation is, therefore,
not only a religious obligation, but is the science
of sciences and the most important part of National
Arithmetic.</p>

<p>Taxation is necessary just as blood-letting is
necessary in plethora. Over-feeding produces a
<span class="pb" id="Pg032">[32]</span>
determination of the blood to the head, and then
radical rabidity breaks out into rebellion. Over-feeding
requires bleeding. There is a tendency
in every industrious nation to get on too fast.
Taxation is the fly-wheel which softens and
regulates the motion of the national machinery,
the safety valve which prevents explosion, while
that accumulation of taxation called the dead
weight is a "clogger" to keep things down.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a "rising," it is a sure sign
that taxation is too light; consequently taxation
should be so accommodated to the habits, tastes,
and feelings of the people, as to fit them at all
points, like well-made harness. If they grow too
enlightened we can double the window-tax; if
they be disposed to kick, put on the breeching in
the shape of an income-tax; if they go too much
by the head, we can raise the price of malt, and,
by way of a martingale, put a duty on spirits;
if they jib, we can touch them on the raw with
"the house duty;" if they step out too fast,
tighten the "bearing rein" by 10 per cent. on the
assessment; and should any attempt be made to
<em>bolt</em>, we can secure them with a curb, by a tax
on absentees.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg033">[33]</span>
The perfection of taxation is to make it as much
as possible like an insensible perspiration; or to
cause it to <em>subtract</em>, like the vampire when lulling
the victim to sleep, by fanning him with the
wings of patriotism and the hum-hum of a liberal
oration, on the principle of</p>

her!) which shows the transcendant powers of
arithmetical argument. The Egyptian plague of
frogs and flies exemplifies this rule. In Modern
Rome we have multiplication of fleas. In Modern
Babylon we have multiplication of bugs, particularly
humbugs. In the West Indies we have
<span class="pb" id="Pg035">[35]</span>
multiplication of musquitoes and piccaninies, and
in the East, multiplication of oneself, as in the
case of Abbas Mirza and his 1000 sons for a body
guard.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Multiplication of Laws.</span>&mdash;This is a favourite
amusement with our modern legislators. It
naturally leads to the multiplication of lawyers,
whose proper calling is to set people together by
the ears, for the multiplication of dissensions.
The original type of this order was the plague of
locusts.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Domestic Multiplication</span>, or Multiplication
of miseries. This rule is performed by taking
unto oneself a wife for <em>better</em> or <em>worse</em>; then,
multiplying as usual, and, at the end of fifteen or
twenty years, having the young "olive branches"
round about our tables.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Multiplication of Money.</span>&mdash;This is the most
universal case in the whole rule. The <em>multipliers</em>
are the <em>operatives</em>, who are placed at the bottom,
instead of the top of the arithmetical scale. They
may be ranged, in general, as in the following:&mdash;<span class="pb" id="Pg036">[36]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>A cotton spinner, 3½<i>d.</i> a-day.</li>
<li>Spitalfields weaver, 4½<i>d.</i></li>
<li>Brummagem, 5½<i>d.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>These digits are to be <em>worked</em> from fourteen to
sixteen hours a-day at the lowest possible fraction
of pay. The product is to be set down in the 3½
per cents. or invested in the first unjust war in
which this nation may be engaged; or the whole
aggregate of sums may be multiplied by monopoly.<span class="pb" id="Pg037">[37]</span></p>

<p>Division teaches how to divide a number into
two or more <em>equal</em> parts, as in the division of
prize-money.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg039">[39]</span>
Division is of great importance, whether political,
ecclesiastical, commercial, civil, or social. Nothing
is more likely to destroy your opponents than a
<em>split</em>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divide et impera</i> is the true Machiavelian
policy of all governments.</p>

<p>Numbers, that is the multitude, are to be
divided, in a variety of ways,&mdash;by mob orators, or
by mob-sneaks, or by parliamentary flounderers,
or by mystifying pulpit demagogues.</p>

<p>The divisors should generally endeavour to
work into their own hands, and the dividends
may be compared to fleeced-sheep, plucked-geese,
scraped sugar-casks, drained wine-bottles, and
squeezed lemons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Social Division.</span>&mdash;The divisions here may be a

excellent <em>divisor</em>: you may kill the adjutant by
way of a quotient, on the surgical principle of
"Mangling done here."</p>

<p>In the division of property by will, be your

<span class="pb" id="Pg040">[40]</span>
your heart's content; for, as your heirs will most
assuredly be divided amongst themselves, when
they have done fighting over your coffin for what
does not belong to them, they will call upon the
Court of Chancery to divide it&mdash;principally among
the lawyers, according to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex non scripta</i>.</p>

<p>In the division of profits, first take off the <em>cream

<p>In all kinds of "Division of Money" endeavour

have a right to the <em>first</em> part, because you are a
lion; to the <em>second</em>, because you are strong; to
the <em>third</em>, because no one dares dispute your right;
and to the <em>fourth</em>, because no one is so able as

"Old King Cole," have divided their time

<h3>LONG DIVISION.</h3>

<p>Long Division is so called when a long time is
taken for the division of various sums, as in the
case of the Deccan prize-money, or the Duke of
York's debts. In these cases, various persons are
<span class="pb" id="Pg043">[43]</span>
placed in the state of <em>longing</em>&mdash;hence the name of
the rule, which is a figurative exemplification of
"hope deferred."</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule I</span>&mdash;Teaches to work an expected legacy or
an estate in reversion, or a right of entail, with a
"post-obit bond," cent. per cent. on a stiff stamen.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule II</span>&mdash;Teaches how to <em>wait</em> for a living
instead of working for one. This is a hungry
expectancy: yourself, in a consumption, with an
interesting cough, preaching as curate to an admiring
congregation principally composed of females,
who bring jellies and jams, pitch-plasters, electuaries,
and pills, "bosom friends," and other comforters,
while the jolly incumbent, with his rosy
gills and round paunch, writes you once a quarter
to dine with him, to see how well he holds it.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <em>Chancery Long Division.</em>&mdash;This is an
exemplification of the "law's delay," and the rule
is to be worked by giving the expectants the
"benefit of a doubt," which is not quite so pleasant
in Chancery as in criminal practice. The "Bidder"
of this rule was John Lord Eldon.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg044">[44]</span>
<span class="smcap">Rule IV.</span>&mdash;Beside long annuities, there are also
long dividends. For instance, in the case of Bamboozle,
Humbug and Co. who lately declared the
third and last dividend of three-fourths of a farthing
in a pound, for the benefit of their creditors.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg045">[45]</span>
RULE VI.<br />
<small>REDUCTION.</small></h2>

<p>Reduction is properly the "art of sinking." It
teaches us, according to Martin, to bring numbers
to a lower name without altering their value.
When numbers are brought to a higher name, it
is called Reduction <em>ascending</em>, when to a lower,
Reduction <em>descending</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Reduction ascending</span> is to stand high in your
own estimation, from the convincing reason, that,
as no one thinks anything of you, you ought to
think something of yourself. The visit of the
Queen to Edinburgh raised the baillies so high in
their own estimation, that it took them three hours
to get up in a morning.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg046">[46]</span>
<em>Examples of Reduction ascending</em> are to be found
in the following cases:&mdash;When a noodle is made
a lord; 2. When Timothy Fig obtains a baronetcy;
3. When Muggins keeps his "willa;" and
when a beggar gets on horseback.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Reduction ascending</span> for Females.&mdash;Mrs.
<em>General</em> Swipes, Mrs. <em>Colonel</em> Trashee, Mrs. <em>Major</em>
Minus, Mrs. <em>Alderman</em> Bumble, Mrs. <em>Common-sergeant</em>
Sprigings, Mrs. <em>Common-councilman</em> Snigings,
Mrs. <em>Executioner</em> Ketch, Mrs. <em>Beadle</em> Blow-em-up,
Mrs. <em>Corporal</em> Casey.</p>

<p><em>Reduction ascending</em> is to be seen in the manufacturing
districts; when the body politic gets inflated,
a "rising of the lights," that is, of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illuminati</i>, may be expected. In these risings
the scum always gets uppermost, and some political
demagogue is ejected to parliament by a
revolutionary eruction&mdash;to be reduced to his own
<em>level</em> as a leveller.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Reduction descending.</span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras</div>
<div class="verse">Hic labor, hoc opus est."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg047">[47]</span>
This is the "old saw" Alderman Harmer used
when he cut the city&mdash;or Lord John in his
"finality" speech&mdash;cut his own fingers.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL REDUCTION.</h3>

<p>There have been many examples of Political
Reduction both in our last and present ministry.
The reduction of postage, so that it paid less than
the cost, was an exceedingly business-like act.
The reduction of cats'-meat in the storehouses at
Plymouth, Woolwich, Portsmouth, and Chatham,
from a penny to three farthings a-day, was also
an example of legislative wisdom, and proved the
maxim, "Sparus at the speketas letouat the
bungholeas."</p>

<p>The reduction of paupers' food to "doubly
diminutive and beautifully less" than that of the
felon, is also "wisdom wonderful;" being a new
way of offering a premium upon crime, at about
thirty and a third per cent. It is presumed to
have occurred with a view to the assistance of
Old Bailey practice, and of the Poor Law
<span class="pb" id="Pg048">[48]</span>
Commissioners, as it promotes Coroners' inquests
and saves coffins.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><i>Rule for the Reduction of Paupers.</i>&mdash;Take "an
operative," starve him in the streets till he becomes
light enough to make a shuttlecock of, then place
in his hands an order from an Edmonton magistrate,
by way of a feather; bandy him about
from parish to parish till you are tired of the
game. Let him then fall into the lock-up of the
station-house. Keep him sixteen hours in a
cold cell without food. Bring him before the
Board, put him on the refractory diet, water-gruel,
poultice dumplings, and rat roastings. Keep
him till he becomes so thin as to lose his shadow,
then turn him into the streets to look for a job,
with three yards of cord in his pocket, and a
direction to the nearest lamp-post, as an intimation
of what that job is to be.</p>

<p>A state may be <em>reduced</em> in the same way by
nip-cheese patriots. Such "save-alls," when they
lop off excrescences, bark the trunk&mdash;when they
prune redundances, let loose the sap. These
"flint-skinners" grind down professions, pare
down dignities, sweat sovereigns, purge the
<span class="pb" id="Pg049">[49]</span>
commonwealth, scour landlords, skin the army,
starve the navy, scrape religion to the backbone, sell
the honour of their country for a mess of porridge
and its glory for a bag of moonshine; till at last
John Bull becomes as lean as a country whipping-post,
and would hang himself, only he has not
<em>weight</em> enough on him to produce strangulation.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg050">[50]</span>
RULE VII.<br />
<small>PROPORTION.</small></h2>

<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE.</h3>

<p>Proportion is sometimes called the "Rule of
Three," because a certain system of conventionalisms
has its origin in that, which is called, by way
<span class="pb" id="Pg051">[51]</span>
of joke, the "Three Estates" of the realm&mdash;<em>King</em>,
<em>Lords</em>, and <em>Commons</em>; in other words, a <em>parliament</em>,
so called from its being the focus of palaver, in
which originate those splendid specimens of collective
wisdom, known by the name of Acts of
Parliament&mdash;because they "won't act."</p>

<p>The theoretic proportion is, that numbers should
be exactly balanced,&mdash;that one sovereign should
equal six hundred lords, that six hundred lords
should equal six hundred and fifty-eight commoners,
and that these should represent twenty-nine millions
of people. Now, as the interests of each of these
estates are said in theory to be opposed to each
other, and as they are all theoretically supposed to
pull three opposite ways with equal force, it must
follow that legislation would be at a stand still, by
the first law of mechanics, viz. that action and
reaction are always equal: but to prevent such
a catastrophe of stagnation, and to set in motion
this beautiful machine, a pivot-spring, in the
shape of a prime minister, or prime mover, is
superadded, and a golden supply, fly, or budget
wheel, is introduced, by which the following
subordinate, yet ruling principles are developed;
<span class="pb" id="Pg052">[52]</span>
and thus we go on from age to age, making laws
one day, and unmaking them the next, for the sake
of variety.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg052.jpg" width="450" height="804" alt="'Out of Proportion.'" />
<p class="caption">"OUT OF PROPORTION."</p></div>

<h3><span class="pb" id="Pg053">[53]</span>
THE WORKING OF THE RULE.</h3>

<p>It must not be forgotten that this rule is one of
proportionals, as its name imports. It therefore
teaches proportion in all its relations, social and
political; it is the rule of our country, and seeks
to develop that beautiful equality and justice, so
conspicuous in all our institutions, exemplified in
the following well-known legal and constitutional
maxim, viz. "One man may steal a horse, but
another must not look over the hedge."</p>

<p>It is a maxim of English law, that punishment
should be <em>proportionate</em> to the offence, and have a
relation to the moral turpitude of the offender.
Hence the seducer and adulterer only inquire,
"What's the damage?" By the same rule, it is
held highly penal to sell the only ripe fruit in
England, roasted apples; and the stock in trade
of the basket woman is confiscated. She, too, is
<span class="pb" id="Pg054">[54]</span>
sent to the <em>Counter</em>&mdash;because she is not rich enough
to keep one with a shop attached.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg054.jpg" width="450" height="415" alt="Called to Account" />
<p class="caption">CALLED TO ACCOUNT.</p></div>

<p>This brings us to the <em>rationale</em> of reward, and
shows us the policy of making a prison superior to
a poor-house. This wise arrangement of the
collective wisdom of the Rule of Three (the three
estates) is upon the principle of <em>counter-irritation</em>,
that is, the best way to administer to the miserable
is to inflict more misery, just as we put
<span class="pb" id="Pg055">[55]</span>
a blister on one part to subdue inflammation on
another, or set up a mercurial disease to cure a
liver complaint. On the other hand, we cure
villany by increased rations of beef, bread, beer,
and potatoes, in accordance with the maxim, that
"the nearest way to a man's heart is through his
stomach."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg055.jpg" width="450" height="310" alt="'The nearest Way to a Man's Heart'" />
</div>

<p>On the same principle of "Proportion," the
operative is to have for his share the pleasure of
<span class="pb" id="Pg056">[56]</span>
doing the labour; for if one man had the labour
and the gains too, it would be abominable, and
destructive to all the usages of society.</p>

<p>It is also strictly proportional, that we should
pay not only for what we have, but for that which
we have not. <em>Thus</em> church-rates ought to be
inflicted, not so much for the benefit of the church,
but as the substitute for that wholesome discipline
of flagellation, unhappily discontinued, and for the
"good of the soul;" for if the spiritual benefit
be great to those who pay for what they receive
only, how great must be the reward of those who
are content to pay for that which, they not only do
not receive, but which they will not have at any
price! Hence, it is possible that even <em>dissenters
may be saved</em>&mdash;the trouble of spending their money
in other ways.</p>

<p>The "Tax upon Incomes" affords also a striking
example of the doctrine of Proportionals. It is so
beautifully equalized, that the loss upon one branch
of trade is not to be set off against the gain of
another, the object of the act being, no doubt, to
put a stop to trade altogether, as the best means of
placing things <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</i>, the grand desideratum
of modern legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg057">[57]</span>
"Bear ye each other's burdens" is a sublime
maxim. The principle of the lever is well
brought to <em>bear</em> in the doctrine of proportionals&mdash;and
shows how to shift the weight of taxation
from the shoulders of the rich upon those of the
poor&mdash;</p>

<img src="images/pg057.jpg" width="450" height="304" alt="A Sliding Scale" />
<p class="caption">A SLIDING SCALE.</p></div>

<p>The laws and regulations for the conduct of our
civil polity and social condition being founded on
these divine principles, it is assumed as a fundamental
maxim, that "great folks will be biggest,"
and he who has not learned that this is the ideal of
<span class="pb" id="Pg058">[58]</span>
true proportion, and who does not recognise it in
his practical philosophy, will be compelled to
knock his head against a wall to the day of his
dissolution.</p>

<h2>RULE VIII.<br />
<small>FRACTIONS.</small></h2>

<p>The word Fractions is from the Latin "Fractus,"
broken. A Fraction is therefore a part or broken
piece. A broken head is a fraction; a broken
heart is a fraction; a bankrupt is a fraction&mdash;he is
<span class="pb" id="Pg060">[60]</span>
<em>broken up</em>; yet a horse is not a fraction, although
he may be <em>broken in</em>&mdash;but his rider may have a
broken neck, which is called an irreducible fraction.
Speaking generally, therefore, a fraction may be
considered as a "Tarnation Smashification."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg060.jpg" width="450" height="395" alt="Fractional Signs" />
<p class="caption">FRACTIONAL SIGNS.</p></div>

<p>Fractions are of two kinds, <em>Vulgar</em> and <em>Decimal</em>.
Vulgar fractions are used for common purposes,
and examples may be seen in the plebeian part of
our commonalty, such as coal-heavers, costermongers,
sheriff's-officers, bailiffs, bagmen, cabmen,
excisemen, lord-mayors, lady-mayoresses,
carpet-knights and auctioneers.<span class="pb" id="Pg061">[61]</span></p>

<p>Vulgar fractions may be known by the way in
which they express themselves. They are more
expressive than decimals; and the words, Go it,

<h2>RULE IX.<br />
<small>INTEREST, &amp;c.</small></h2>

<p>To think of getting on in this world without
Interest, is ridiculous. Place and Promotion are
not for Fitness or Worthiness, but to serve particular
<em>Interests</em>, private or public; and yet a
<span class="pb" id="Pg073">[73]</span>
number of very simple persons, who have as large
a green streak in them as a <em>sage</em> cheese, without
its <em>sageness</em>, are continually wondering that virtue
and talent do not get all the "good things" of a
vicious community. Punch forbid! Is not virtue
declared to be its <em>own</em> reward? and as to talent,&mdash;let
a man be content with <em>that</em>. It is a positive
monopoly to covet <em>wit</em> and <em>money</em> too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg073.jpg" width="450" height="357" alt="At a Premium and Discount" />
<p class="caption">AT A PREMIUM AND DISCOUNT.</p></div>

<p>To take care of our Interest is the great law of
Nature, and is universally followed. Every one
for himself, and Fate for us all, as the donkey said
when he danced among the chickens, is as profound
a maxim as the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">gnothi seauton</i> of Plato.
<span class="pb" id="Pg074">[74]</span>
"Take care of yourself" is of more importance
than "Know thyself." To take care of oneself is
a science which comes home to every man's business
and bosom. It is "wisdom" identified with
our personal character. It is philosophy turned
to account. It is morality above par. It is a
religion in which "every man may be his own
parson," find his Bible in his ledger, his Creed in
the "stock-list," his Psalter in the tariff, his Book
of Common Prayer in the railway and canal
shares, his Temple in the Royal Exchange, his
Altar in his counter, and his God in his money.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD AND NEW PRINCIPLE&mdash;BOTH WITH CREDIT.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg075">[75]</span>
<span class="smcap">Principle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Principal</span>, is an old term used by
our forefathers in "money matters" and commercial
transactions, but is now obsolete. It formerly
represented capital, and raised the British merchant
in the scale of nations; but it is now a
maxim of trade to discard Principle as not being
consistent with Interest. It is paradoxically
Capital to take care of our Interest, but it seldom
requires any Principle to do so.</p>

<p>"The want of money is the root of all evil."
Such is the new reading, according to the translation
of a new sect called the <em>Tin</em>ites. In the orthodox
translation, the <em>love</em> of money was unfortunately
rendered. To be without money is worse than being
without brains&mdash;for this reason we should oppose
all dangerous innovations, which in any way have
a tendency to disturb the "balance of Capital."
Right is not to usurp might. We are not, for the
sake of Quixotic experiment, to invade the <em>interests</em>
of the landed proprietor by an Anti-Corn Law
movement, nor the vested right of doing wrong,
which the various close corporations of law, physic,
and trade, &amp;c. have so long maintained, making
England the envy of the world and the glory of
surrounding nations.</p>

<p class="caption">THE TIN-DER PASSION.</p>
</div>

<p>Interest, therefore, teaches us to interest ourselves
for our own interests, and to keep them continually
in view in all our transactions. When a man
loses sight of his own interests he is morally
blind; he must, therefore, according to this rule,
walk with his eyes open, and be wide awake to
every move&mdash;keep the weather-eye open, and not
have one eye up the chimney and the other in
<span class="pb" id="Pg077">[77]</span>
the pot, but both stedfastly fixed on the <em>main
chance</em>.</p>

<p>Interest teaches us also to swear to anything and
admit nothing; to prove, by the devil's rhetoric,
that black is white and white black; to tamper,
to shuffle, to misrepresent, to falsify, to scheme,
to undervalue, to entangle, to evade, to delay,
to humbug, and to cheat in virtue of the monied
interest.</p>

<img src="images/pg077.jpg" width="450" height="395" alt="Faith and Duty" />
<p class="caption">FAITH AND DUTY.</p></div>

<p>In the days of our forefathers, we had a most
excellent compendium of Faith and Duty, called
<span class="pb" id="Pg078">[78]</span>
the "Church Catechism," which taught us not only
to "fear God and honour the King," but to be "true
and just in all our dealings." The "fast and loose,"
"free and easy" system of "liberality," shuts the
Creed and the Catechism out of half our schools;
and worldliness teaches in its place the creed of
Mammon. Instead of being taught to worship
God, we are taught to <em>worship money</em>. Instead of
honouring the Queen, we are told to bow down to
the "<em>golden image</em>" which trade has set up; we no
longer consult our <em>conscience</em>, but our <em>pocket</em>; for
<em>principle</em> we read <em>interest</em>&mdash;for <em>piety</em>, <em>pelf</em>.</p>

<p>In illustration of this, the following "cut and
dry" "'Change Catechism," which fell from the
pocket of a Latitudinarian bill-broker, is subjoined,
as affording the best examples of the Rule
of <em>Interest</em>.</p>

<p>When goods are bought or work is done, a bill
is to be made out and delivered. In some cases
the bill may be made out before the work is done,
<span class="pb" id="Pg084">[84]</span>
and work charged in <em>prospective</em>; and therefore the
making out of bills is an art and mystery known
only to the professional man or the tradesman.
It comprehends the mystery of mystification, and
<em>impudence</em> and <em>assurance</em> are its two first rules.
The milkman is not only allowed by parliament to
water his milk, but to cut a notch in his chalk and
mark <em>double</em>. The baker thinks it legitimate, and
part of his vested rights, to put in "dead uns;" the
butcher to "hang on Jemmy;" but the birds noted
for the longest bills are the carpenter woodpecker,
(who undertakes to take you under) the gallipot
<span class="pb" id="Pg085">[85]</span>
crane, the red-tape snipe, and the heron. The
bills of each of these bipeds are as long as from

lowest pit of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">A DECIMAL FIGURE.</p></div>

<h2>RULE XI.<br />
<small>DECIMALS.</small></h2>

<p>Decimal Fractions are so called because the
fractions are always tenths. They differ from
<span class="pb" id="Pg090">[90]</span>
Vulgar Fractions in this, that the denominator is
not written, but a <em>point</em> before it is used instead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg090.jpg" width="450" height="259" alt="A Strong Tithe" />
<p class="caption">A STRONG TITHE.</p></div>

<p>Decimals are best illustrated by tithes, which
are general and universal tenths extracted in every
part of "merry England." They are added, subtracted,
multiplied, and divided like any other
numbers, but to designate their value a <em>point</em> is
prefixed.</p>

<p>In tithes, as in decimals, the denominator does
not appear; that is to say, the incumbent rarely
lives at his incumbency. When tithes are to be
added, taken, or subtracted, the titho<em>decimo point</em>
<span class="pb" id="Pg091">[91]</span>
is used as his representative, namely, the <span class="smcap">POINT OF
THE BAYONET</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg091.jpg" width="450" height="494" alt="The Point of the Bayonet" />
</div>

<p>To make a point of "doing good by stealth" is
a national virtue; and among all other "points"
in this uncertain world, the "point blank" is the
most certain. This may be made with a <em>rifle</em>,
<span class="pb" id="Pg092">[92]</span>
when the pockets are to be <em>rifled</em>, either with or
without a bayonet at the end of it. The <em>charge</em>
for spiritual care is best settled by a <em>charge of
dragoons</em>; and a <em>discharge</em> of clerical arrears by a
<em>discharge of fire-arms</em>.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Whatever may be said of the mode of collecting tithes, nothing can be said against the 'right of tithe.' The clergy are the greatest sufferers, and no consummation is more devoutly to be wished than an equitable adjustment. As things are at present, the clergy do not get half their dues, and these are obtained in a manner well calculated to keep up the idea of a certain person shearing the hogs, 'great cry and little wool.'">[4]</a></p>

<h3>TO REDUCE MONEY WEIGHTS AND MEASURES TO
DECIMALS.</h3>

<p>Take a tithe-owner, a collector, a proctor's
warrant, and a constable, and go in a body to the
house of a Quaker, or the mud hovel of an Irish
Catholic. Enter the house by means of a crow-bar.
Take pigs, poultry, pots, pans, sticks, or rattletraps.
Obtain an appraiser, call in a broker, and <em>divide
the spoil</em> by means of any number of vulgar
fractions, called purchasers. Take the dividend,
called plunder, and "pocket."</p>

<h3><span class="pb" id="Pg093">[93]</span>
TO BRING DECIMALS TO THEIR PROPER VALUE IN WHOLE
NUMBERS.</h3>

<p>The proper value of a decimal is only to be ascertained
by his <em>points</em> of character, and they are to
be found of full value in many parts of the kingdom,
in the shape of worthy curates, and honest
rectors and vicars, <em>dividing</em> not their flocks, or
the produce of their flocks, but their <em>own time</em>,
<em>means</em>, and <em>money</em>, in the conscientious <em>discharge</em> of
their clerical duties.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg094">[94]</span>
RULE XII.<br />
<small>PRACTICE.</small></h2>

<p>The Rule of Practice is indispensable in all our
operations. It is in some degree the "ultimatum"
of the preceding rules, for as the proverb says,
"Practice makes perfect."</p>

<p>Nature is said to have begun the creation of
"living infinities" by this rule, for in the words of
the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"She tried her 'prentice hand on man,</div>
<div class="verse">And then she made the lasses o."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Burns.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Practice is thus divided into two kinds&mdash;the
first called <em>Practice Preliminary</em>; the second is
denominated <em>Practice in General</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg095">[95]</span>
<span class="smcap">Practice Preliminary</span> is experimental philosophy,
or asking discount for a bill at 18 months;
<span class="smcap">Practice in General</span> taking in the flats. The one
resolves itself into "<em>trying it on</em>," the other to
"<em>clapping it on</em>."</p>

<p>"Trying it on" is an universal principle, from
the old Jew salesman who asks four pounds for a
thread-bare coat and takes four shillings; or the
old cabbage woman who offers 3lbs. of "taters" for
two pence and sells 7lbs. for three farthings; to
the prime minister who asks <em>three</em> millions of
taxes, and expects <em>five</em>. The converse of this
rule is, "Don't you wish you may get it."</p>

<p>Practice is performed by taking "aliquot parts;"
to be a man of some "parts" is therefore necessary.
The application of our "parts" to the
science of L.S.D. with a view to their development
and perfection, is the aim of the rule, and the
"practice of Practice" is to show,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That the value of a thing</div>
<div class="verse">Is just the money it will bring;</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Practising for the Army.</span>&mdash;As shooting and
slaying are the legitimate objects of this profession,
<span class="pb" id="Pg100">[100]</span>
you cannot begin too early. The first instrument
to be used is a <em>pea-shooter</em>; this is for the age
P.C. previous to corderoys. The second is a <em>pop-gun</em>,
indicating the age of breeches (and breaches).
From this we arise to "sparrow-shooting," after
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i> of the salt-box has been tried
without effect. Being now grown bloody-minded,
we go to that sanguiniferous-looking house at
Battersea, called the Red House, (being of a
blood colour, from the enormous slaughter committed
near it,) and here we take lessons in pigeon-shooting.
From hence to the Shooting Gallery,
Pall Mall, we improve rapidly. A lieutenancy in
the Guards is our next step. To this succeeds a
dispute <ins>respecting</ins> the glottis of Mademoiselle
Catasquallee, and "Chalk-Farm" or "Wimbledon
Common" is the result; and here, unless courage
should ooze out of our fingers' ends, we may
stop; our courage is apparent, and for the future
we may shoot with the "long-bow" to all eternity
without fear of contradiction.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Practising for the Profession.</span>&mdash;"Cutting
up" and "Cut and <em>come</em> again," are the maxims of
the surgeon; and as no trade or profession can live
<span class="pb" id="Pg101">[101]</span>
except by the adoption of the "<em>cutting</em> system," and if
a man cannot <em>cut</em> a figure, he will assuredly <em>be cut</em>
by his acquaintance, surely the art should be thoroughly
studied. As a preliminary step, Burking
and body-snatching must be mastered; and then you
may go snacks in a "subject," and take your "loin
of pauper," "leg of pauper," or "shoulder of
beggar," or "rump of beggar," or "sirloin of
alderman," or "fore-quarter of citizen," or "hand
and spring" of beadle or bellman. Or should
your taste be fastidious, you may take a "fillet of
cherrybum;" or club for a "sucking-kid." On
these <em>practise</em> till you are perfect; and should it
so happen that any of the personages above-named
should turn out to be related by consanguinity,
be as stoical as a reviewer, and make no bones
of cutting-up (if necessary for science) your own
father.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Practising for the Ministry.</span>&mdash;The aspirant
for the "tub," "born in a garret, in a kitchen
bred," commences his spiritual career by announcing
to the elect that he is almost sure that he has
had a call (caul), for he has heard his mother
say he was <em>born with one</em>. He may next exhibit
<span class="pb" id="Pg102">[102]</span>
his buffetings with Satan by showing the marks
of the beast, in the shape of double-dealing, pettifogging,
shuffling, cutting and cheating; he may
next venture on the <em>new birth</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p>He now attempts open-air preaching on Kennington
Common, and exhibits spiritual rabidity
in good earnest. He foams at the mouth, barks
and bites, and yells in his ravings; calls himself
from a pig to a dog, and from a dog to no gentleman.
What is he? "A bundle of filthy rags,"
"a whited sepulchre," "a cancerous sore," a "sink
<span class="pb" id="Pg103">[103]</span>
of pollution," "a mass of corruption," "a cesspool,"
"a common sewer," "a worm," "a scorpion,"
"a snake," "a spider," "an adder." He may also
charge himself with murder, abomination, witchcraft,
lying, and every vice denounced in the
Decalogue, on the principle of "the greater the
sinner the greater the saint."</p>

<p>Having thus initiated himself into the spiritual
fraternity, he may write a work to prove that
the "Church damns more souls than she saves."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="A favourite maxim with a certain reverend city orator, formerly a 'grocer,' and still a 'grosser' man than his neighbours.">[6]</a>
He then mounts the rostrum as a burning and a
shining light. He deals in brimstone, wholesale,
retail, and for exportation. Now he unites his
spiritual with secular power, and mixes parliamentary
logic with divinity, electioneering squibs with
"Hymns of the Chosen;" makes Lucifer cuckold,
and swears himself his true liege man on the
cross-buttock of a radical candidate. He now
receives the degree of D.D. from a Scotch university,
for 7<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and begins to feel as "big
as bull-beef;" his lank hair curls; he has red
velvet cushions to his tub; he begowns and belappets
<span class="pb" id="Pg104">[104]</span>
himself; he looks on all sides for an half-idiot
heiress, or infatuated widow in a state of
fatuity, and marries. Thus he jumps into his
bishopric, makes religion a "good spec," till it is
found out he has had "two wives" before, and
a variety of miniature portraits of himself:&mdash;and
thus ends his <span class="smcap">Practice</span>.</p>

RULE XIII.<br />
<small>BARTER&mdash;BUYING AND SELLING&mdash;PROFIT AND
LOSS.</small></h2>

<p>Man is a "forgiving animal," and this is a better
definition of him than Plato's "biped without
feathers," which the plucked cock demonstrated.
Man is the only animal which strikes a bargain.
A dog does not exchange a bone with another dog;
and however skilful he may be at a steak, he is not
at all clever at this sort of "<em>chop</em>."</p>

<p>"Our <em>chops</em> are our masters," says Hobbes; and
it is all "a matter of wittles," says Sam Weller.
Hence arise the art and mystery of <em>swapping</em>,
<em>buying</em>, and <em>selling</em>, and the notion of <em>trade</em> and
<em>commerce</em>.</p>

<p>England is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> a nation of shopkeepers&mdash;we
do every thing upon the principle of small profits
and quick returns. To barter the national honour
<span class="pb" id="Pg106">[106]</span>
is legitimate policy; to sell up our enemies has
been a practice since the days of the Plantagenets.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Jocky of Norfolk, be not too bold,</div>
<div class="verse">For Dickon thy master is bought and sold."</div>

<p>Hence we can always buy our enemies, if we
cannot beat them. Buonaparte, according to the
radicals, was <em>sold</em> at Waterloo; we have been recently
sold to the Russians; and thus British gold
has been always more powerful than British steel.</p>

<p>The idea of trade and commerce naturally leads
us to the consideration of the sublime science of
Political Economy, which endeavours to dogmatize
that profound conundrum, that the natural <em>rate
of wages is that which barely affords the labourer the
means of subsistence</em>, and of continuing the race of
labourers&mdash;meaning thereby, the starvation point
at which a labourer can be worked. It is assumed
that the labourer has so much work in him, and the
problem is to draw it out at the least possible cost&mdash;of
whip or legal enactment&mdash;or police forces
or military expenditure.</p>

<p>Another leading doctrine of the political economists
is, the fatal necessity of starvation. It is
maintained, and that seriously, that "God, when
he made man, intended that he should be starved;"
that human fecundity tends to get the start of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg110">[110]</span>
means of subsistence; that the former moves
as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64; but the latter only as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8. The consequence drawn from this proposition
is, that poor-laws, or any efforts of charity, are
only a childish indulgence of feeling; for since
there will be a surplus number, who must at all
events be starved, if the life of one is saved by
charity, whether public or private, it is only that
another may be starved in its stead. Hence the
perishing of annual multitudes may be looked upon
as a proof of the national wealth; and the poor-law
system, and the Queen's Letter, but so much concern
utterly useless; and the only remedy for our
abundant population is for us to return to the
system of the ancients, and legalize a few Herods,
or, to go further back, to make every man a Saturn&mdash;the
eater of his own children.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg111">[111]</span>
RULE XIV.<br />
<small>DISCOUNT.</small></h2>

<p>Discount is the allowance made to a person, for
paying money <em>before it is due</em>; so says Walkinghame;
but there are now few persons who commit so
egregious a folly, the plan being not to pay until
it has been due a long time, and then get discount
as for ready money.</p>

<p>The usual manner of settling accounts in the
City is to purchase for <em>ready money</em>; to give a
bill at three months, which is to be considered as
equal to ready money; and when the bill becomes
due to give&mdash;the cash? No! but another bill at
<em>five</em> months. This is called <em>cash payments</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg112">[112]</span>
Leaving the City, as being "vulgar," let us look
at discount by the broad light of Universality.
Discount means something "taken off," or reduced
by so much, or decreased <em>in value</em>, or lessened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/pg112.jpg" width="450" height="575" alt="Discounting for a Man formerly" />
<p class="caption">"DISCOUNTING FOR A MAN FORMERLY."</p></div>

<p>A man is said to be at a discount on 'Change,
when he has no change at the Bank; when he has
no banker in the City; when "no effects" is written
on his "mandible:"&mdash;at Almack's, when he ceases
to invite dinner eaters; among the ladies, when grey
hairs and crows' feet make their appearance, and
teeth their disappearance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg113">[113]</span>
<span class="smcap">Par</span>, above <em>par</em>, below <em>par</em>. We are at par,
when in that blessed state of equanimity found in
perfection at a Quakers' meeting; above par, when
floundering about in champagne; and below par,
when cooling down on water gruel and Seidlitz.</p>

<p>Examples of discount at the present moment
are too numerous to mention. Every thing seems
at a discount; <em>radicals, dissenters, theatricals, fine
arts, scientificks, trade, commerce, manufactures</em>.
Asses' heads alone are looking up.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg114">[114]</span>
RULE XV.<br />
<small>INVOLUTION AND EVOLUTION.</small></h2>

<p>Involution and Evolution are two rules of
arithmetic which signify getting <em>in</em> and getting
<em>out</em>. Involution signifies such matters as getting
in love, getting into a lawsuit, or getting into
debt. It is the rule of entanglement, and is
represented by a fly in a spider's web.</p>

<p>Evolution comprehends all the tricks, shifts,
schemes, and stratagems, by which we get out of
our various difficulties; but it may be observed that
it is much easier to become involved in any matter,
than to get disentangled: whatever may be our
evolutions, it is a difficult matter to get out of love,
out of a law-suit, or out of debt.</p>

LAW EVOLUTION&mdash;GETTING INTO A LAW-SUIT.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">"Will you walk into my office," said the lawyer, Mr. Sly,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">"'Tis the prettiest little office that ever you did spy.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The way into my office is by a winding stair,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And I've a many funny things to show you when you're there."</div>
<div class="verse">"But I have heard," the client said, "you sport a web and chain,</div>
<div class="verse">And he who in your office gets comes not out clear again."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">"I'm sure you must be weary, friend, of everlasting dunning;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Come, rest upon my legal wit, my gammon, and my cunning.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I'll get your debt at little cost, so only let me do it;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or else perhaps the chap will break, and you will have to rue it."</div>
<div class="verse">"I'd rather not&mdash;I'd rather not," the wary client said;</div>
<div class="verse">"For I did never like to throw 'good money after bad.'"</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">"Leave all to me," the lawyer now with eloquence replied;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">"A fig for costs, your case is clear, and you have <em>me</em> beside;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I'll take the case at any odds, and rather be dependent</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Upon the issue of the whole&mdash;that is, on the defendant."</div>
<div class="verse">"Well, try it on," the client said, "you are a lad of wax;</div>
<div class="verse">So stick to him with tape and string&mdash;succeeding, we'll go snacks."</div>
</div>
<span class="pb" id="Pg116">[116]</span>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">Then in the legal mesh and web of cunning Mr. Sly,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The client now was fairly caught as any little fly;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And round him twined all legal quirks, and briefs a dozen quire,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Writ, declaration, cognovit, bail, habeas, præmunire.</div>
<div class="verse">"You've lost the cause!" the client cried&mdash;"the loss to you, not me."</div>
<div class="verse">"Hum, ha&mdash;but stop a bit," said Sly&mdash;"stop, stop, and we shall see."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">The lawyer mended now his web, and thread by thread he lengthened;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Made closer every mesh and hole, and every corner strengthened.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">"The cause is lost, and you must pay&mdash;<em>I bargained if I gained it</em>;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">You cannot think on other terms that I could have sustained it."</div>
<div class="verse">So round the hapless wretch he threw a law cord strong and good;</div>
<div class="verse">And thus he held it, hard and fast, and sucked his client's blood.</div>
</div></div></div>

<h3>GETTING INVOLVED, OR IN DEBT.</h3>

<p>The ways of getting into debt are multiform. To
be <em>involved</em> is <em>patriotic</em>, <em>fashionable</em>, <em>genteel</em>, and <em>sentimental</em>.
To pay is <em>vulgar</em>, <em>inconvenient</em>, and <em>unpopular</em>.
<span class="pb" id="Pg117">[117]</span>
The man who lives within his <em>means</em> is never
considered to have any <em>means</em>. A man in debt
possesses an interest and an importance truly
pleasurable. It is surely something to know that
in your little self a hundred are subject to hopes,
fears, anxieties, speculations, aspirations, and a
world of such like poetry. The greater the number
of creditors, the greater must be the sensation
produced; and the production of a sensation is
every thing in fashionable society.</p>

<p>The old proverb was, "Out of debt out of
danger;" but modern arithmetic teaches, "<em>In</em> debt
<em>out</em> of danger;" the law of debtor and creditor
being fashioned according to this maxim, which is
now the Lex Scripta of the courts. To be over
head and ears in debt, is the best security; "debt
is the safest helmet." To be not worth powder
and shot, or to make believe you are not, is the
best method of keeping on the wing. It requires,
however, some curious <em>evolutions</em> to enable an
empty sack to stand upright.</p>

<h3>LOVE EVOLUTION, OR GETTING IN LOVE.</h3>

<p>This is an involuntary process, and an entanglement
equally powerful with the meshes of
<span class="pb" id="Pg118">[118]</span>
the law. In this case, however, the pleasure
increases with the entanglement, as the fly
said in the honey-pot. The arms of a fair lady
are the softest bonds; the poison of a maiden's
lip the sweetest poison. To be in love is to
be entangled in a cobweb of ten thousand
ecstasies, where every string is bliss, and every
mesh is beauty. In this web, Cupid sits as an
angel in one corner, and Hymen on the other; thus
bound with sighs, tied with kisses, linked by
embraces, chained by tears, lovers disport themselves;
till Hymen, in fear that they should die of
ecstasy, tightens the web, and binds them hand and
foot in the true lover's knot of matrimony.</p>

<h3>HOW TO GET INTO PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p>Supposing yourself to be a green yokel, just raw
from school, with little wit, little money, and little
influence, act as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Marry for the sake of respectability and a
little more money.</p>

<p>2. Give away soup to the poor, flannel petticoats,
trusses, and baby linen.</p>

<p>3. Set up schools on the free system, "every
boy his own archbishop:" Free-trade in religion,
and no walloping.</p>

<p>4. Get into a squabble with your Rector, about
free grace and non-election.</p>

<p>5. Write once a week in the dissenters' "slop
pail," against clerical intolerance, tithe pigs, "red
noses," round paunches, lawn sleeves.<span class="pb" id="Pg120">[120]</span></p>

<p>6. Attend the jawy jobations of Exeter hall, as
a "flowery speaker," and advocate various Jew,
Gipsy, Voluntary Church, Anti-pseudo-baptistical
Societies, till you are black in the face.</p>

<p>7. Join the Society for the Diffusion of Useless
Knowledge, the Donkey Protecting Society, and
other congenial "Institutes."</p>

<p>8. Build a chapel, and bribe a congregation to
come to it. Become a teetotaller; be a betwixt
and betweenish, half-and-half, out-and-out radical.
Defeat the imposition of a Church rate&mdash;rave
against the taxes&mdash;pledge yourself to support
triangular parliaments, universal suffering&mdash;blindfold
voting&mdash;and confusion to all order.</p>

<h2>RULE XVI.<br />
<small>DUODECIMALS;</small><br />
<small>OR,</small><br />
<small>THE MEASURING OF PAINTING, PLASTERING, JOINING,
GLAZING, GLOZING, AND OTHER FLAT WORK.</small></h2>

<p>Duodecimals teach us to find the superficial
contents of any "thing." A thing is properly
<span class="pb" id="Pg123">[123]</span>
something, neither woman nor man; possessing all
the superficial of either, and the substantials of
neither: such as numbsculls, lordlings, quacks,
empirics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Duodecimals also teach the mensuration of plastering,
painting and glazing; which comprehend the
arts of palaver and gammon, and the science of
<em>Flattery</em> in general.</p>

<p>This is, above all others, a "superficial age,"
and the mensuration of superficies is characteristic
of the modern era&mdash;the age of meretricious
flummery. Our science is superficial thinking;
our morality, superficial blinking. Every thing is
made now-a-days for the "surface," which, like
the gilded wooden organ pipes, placed in front of
that instrument, are not made to blow, but for
the sake of show. In learning, we get a smattering
instead of the real thing; and we drop the
meat for the sake of the shadow. The deep and the
solid have long ago been discarded: in short, this
is the age of gammon, and society is like a quire
of "outsides foolscap."</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><i>Of Flat Surfaces.</i>&mdash;A plane or flat surface has
length and breadth without thickness. Flat
<span class="pb" id="Pg124">[124]</span>
surfaces are often made, by some peculiar property
of polarized light, to reflect rays which do
not belong to them. Thus, flats pass for solids,
and "shallows" for "deep-uns."</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg125">[125]</span>
RULE XVII.<br />

<small>BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTS.</small></h2>

<p>Book-keeping is not to be understood only as
the art of "Book-borrowing," a very good science
in its way, but as the highest branch of the science
of <em>leger</em>demain, invented for the express purpose of
enabling the speculative to conceal their accounts,
just as the use of speech is given to man to enable
him to conceal his thoughts.</p>

<p>We have excellent directions given us on this
head from very high authority, which is to be understood
according to the Benthamite Philosophy.
"How much owest thou my lord? And he said,
A hundred measures of oil. Take thy bill, and
sit down quickly, and write fifty." Hence the
children of the philosophers are wiser than the
children of light.</p>

<p>In "keeping books" it is not only indispensable
that you should keep <em>them</em>, but that they also
should "keep you." This is in accordance with
<span class="pb" id="Pg126">[126]</span>
the free-trade reciprocity system; and to enable
them to do it requires but little tact. For instance,
you open a shop&mdash;not for the purpose of doing
<em>business</em>, but for <em>doing some unfortunate flat</em>, in the
very spirit of a "<em>Good-will</em>;" so that when <em>your
business is done</em>, your client may find <em>his business
done too</em>, and when you have taken yourself <em>off</em>,
he may find himself taken <em>in</em>. This example may
be repeated any number of times.</p>

<p>Upon entering life, every young man must
consider that it will be quite impossible to live
without some "cash in hand;"&mdash;that he will, at
times, be inevitably called upon to "<em>fork out</em>,"
"<em>dub up</em>," or "<em>come down</em>;"&mdash;and that in all transactions,
such as swelling and dashing, cutting and
flashing, it will be necessary to keep a sharp look-out
upon the "blunt," tin, or pewter, as it is
variously termed; if not for your own satisfaction,
at least for your beloved father's, whom you are
in duty bound to bamboozle. There are certain
items which never need come into this account;
namely, board, lodging, tailor's bills, boots, shoes,
linen, horses, and such like necessaries; these
belong religiously to the <em>old boy</em>, or are fit and
proper matters for "whitewashing."</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg127">[127]</span>
To fulfil this purpose, open a cash account,
putting Dr. in the left hand corner, which signifies
Dear Father, in honour of your respected parent,
or in testimony that everything is dear; and
Cr. on the right hand, which may signify "cruel
little I have to spend." This is called the Waste
Book. The items introduced are merely hints for
the getting and disbursement of <span class="smcap">Cash</span>.</p>

Having been thus initiated in the making out of
personal accounts, the pupil must now turn his
attention to the methods of Book-keeping adopted
by "gentlemen in difficulties," connected with that
peculiar process of law which professes to put
new wind into a collapsed bladder, and enable an
empty sack to stand upright. The example is
called taking the "Benefit;" the principal part
of which is making out a Schedule, which may be

<h2>RULE XVIII.<br />
<small>SOLID MEASURE.</small></h2>

<p>We have already treated on "superficial measurement;"
we now come to "Solid Measure."
Solids are, in general, what are termed "blockheads,"
<span class="pb" id="Pg141">[141]</span>
or "thickheads," or "bumbleheads," or
"numbsculls," exemplified in "senior wranglers,"
"tripos," "professors of Greek," and teachers of
Latin. The advantages of a thick scull are great.
It was found upon the gauging of Porson's head,
by the heads of his college, that his scull was so
thick that it became the subject of marvel how
knowledge could get in&mdash;once <em>in</em>, it was held impossible
to get out. The case is the same with
most of our schoolmen.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Solid Measure</span> has been applied with great
success to the measure of blockheads by Messrs.
Gull and Spuzzy, Epps, Ham and Co. The
measure is now principally performed by a Scotch
"Combe," consisting of four "bushel-heads" in one.
This instrument, the length and breadth and
thickness of a head being given, will work out the
solid contents and capacity of the understanding,
to the fraction of a fraction.</p>

<p>The science so formed upon the measure of
wooden heads was invented by Albertus Magnus,
who flourished in the thirteenth century and made
a wooden man with a wooden head, dividing it into
<span class="pb" id="Pg142">[142]</span>
sixty-eight orders or ratios. Gull and Spuzzy,
however, finding this large number bother them,
took away thirty-three, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</i>, observing,
"Organum botheratio sive ambarum rationum
mistura fortuita effervescens, bullas <ins>gignens</ins>." But
the whole scull is now mapped out into thirty-six
compartments, and subjected to a trigonometrical
survey, and a barometrical admeasurement of comparative
heights and hollows.</p>

<p>These divisions are so delightfully situated, that
from Combativeness, the organ of fighting, we enter
Friendship, (Adhesiveness,) without a turnpike
between. Acquisitiveness, the love of money, is
next-door neighbour to Ideality, the quality of
poets, who generally show so much contempt for it.
Constructiveness, the organ of building, lies as a
foundation for that of Music, and handy for the
grating of saws, the knocking of hammers, and the
squeaking of wheelbarrows, as accompaniments
to Haydn's symphonies. Metaphysics are also
handy for wit. Ideality is a parallelopiped,
Hope is a square, Cautiousness a circle, Eventuality
a semicircle; then we have cones, rhomboids,
trapeziums, polygons, hexagons, decagons;
<span class="pb" id="Pg143">[143]</span>
while Language, like the science itself, is all
my <em>eye</em>.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Sir Walter Scott, in one of his walks, found a turnip, resembling in some degree the bumble-head of a Scotch feelosopher. He made a cast of it, and sent it to the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh, who pronounced a long dissertation upon it, and gave the moral and intellectual qualities with extraordinary correctness.">[8]</a></p>

<p>Thick-heads, block-heads, bumble-heads, or
basket-heads, which used in former days to be
symbols of obesity, and gave rise to the maxim,
"Great head, little wit," are now the indications of
intellectual superiority. "The bigger the head the
greater the genius," as the mushroom said to the
cucumber; and to have a head as big as a baker's
basket, or the bustle of a lady mayoress, is perfection.</p>

<p>To fumble these heads is the business of the
Feelosophers; so called from <em>feel</em>, to fumble, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">os</i>,
a bone, and <em>pher</em>, far from the truth. This science
being at our fingers' ends, a great advantage is felt
in all the transactions of life, as the most tender
ideas maybe expressed with mathematical certainty,
numerically, figuratively, and arithmetically, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Divine Louisa</span>,</p>

<p>I need not remind you that last night
I felt (not emotions, raptures, and soul-thrilling
transports) but your <span class="smcap">BUMPS</span>. On returning home
I also felt my own, and I hasten to inform you
that while 17 is throbbing like an earthquake,
all my 33 is insufficient to describe my state, on
finding that a kind Providence has ordained that
for every <em>bump</em> on your beloved head, there rises
a corresponding bump on mine. I 18 you do not
see them, and in 16 declare that my No. 11 only
centres in you.</p>

<p>I do not wish to give a false 26 to what
I say, but in the 30 of your becoming mine,
my No. 1 will develop No. 2, and all my No. 3
will be directed to 14 for your 13. Dearest
girl, need I say more? Nos. 2, 3, 4, are so
harmoniously protuberant in both of us, that
I can have no doubt of either a large or a happy
home. Your 23 and 24, and the 26 on your
<span class="pb" id="Pg145">[145]</span>
cheeks, are indeed divine. Sweet soul, do allow
your 13 to name as soon as possible your 31 and

<h2>RULE XIX.<br />
<small>ASSURANCE&mdash;INSURANCE.</small></h2>

<p>Assurance or Brass is a rule of the utmost
consequence in all monetary transactions; by it
miracles have been performed from the earliest
ages. A good stock of assurance, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> <em>impudence</em>,
<span class="pb" id="Pg147">[147]</span>
will carry a man further than even a stock of
money, wit, or learning. The <em>brazen</em> head of
Friar Bacon, by which he is said to have performed
such wonders, was nothing more than a typical
personification of the <em>brass</em>, <em>assurance</em>, or <em>impudence</em>
of the conjuror. The present <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> economic
method is to wear a brazen face with a wooden
head. <em>Mettle</em>, it is true, may be necessary, but
"cheek" is indispensable.</p>

<p>Modesty is an antiquated virtue, to be repudiated
above all others; and humility is only fit for
charity-school boys, who learn the "catechiz."
But even among these the notion of "humbly,
lowly and reverendly," will soon be <em>exploded</em> by
the music and dancing system; the new philosophy
of the times being, "Jack's as good as his master"
and a "tarnation sight better;" every one feels
this <em>assurance</em>.</p>

<p>Be assured, gentle readers, there is nothing like
brass; it enables a man to put his best leg forward,
and a good face upon any thing. Brass is the
true philosopher's stone, which turns all it touches
into <em>tin</em>. By it the insignificant makes himself
important, the empiric becomes a professor, the
smatterer a proficient, the mountebank a philosopher,
<span class="pb" id="Pg148">[148]</span>
and the quack an oracle; in short, by this
rule, "fools rush in where angels fear to tread."</p>

<p>The rule of Assurance is founded upon the fact,
that there are no bounds to human credulity; well
sustained assumption, with a very small amount of
<em>gumption</em>, being alone requisite for miracles in
commerce, trade, politics, or religion.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES OF "ASSURANCE."</h3>

<p>1. Calling on a friend in cold weather, make
bold to "roast the boiling piece," by placing your
fundamental basis before his parlour fire; lean
your back against his "marble," scrape your shoes
on his fender, and puff your cigar to the detriment
of his elaborate ornaments and gimcracks; as to
his wife and children being excluded from the fire,
let that be "a part of your religion," <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fieri facias</i>.</p>

<p>2. Should you be invited to dinner, when you
enter the house, walk at once into the dining-room,
and make yourself at home by pulling off your
boots, calling for a clean pair of shoes, a newspaper,
<span class="pb" id="Pg149">[149]</span>
a cigar, and the arm chair; you may nod to the
mistress of the house, and say "How do" to the
juveniles, if you do not wish to be taken for a brute.</p>

<p>3. Should you call at the house of a friend,
during his absence, do not hesitate to mount his
best horse, and take a twenty miles' ride for the
sake of exercise. When you return, you can "stop
dinner" with his wife, and afterwards take her to
the Opera.</p>

<p>4. On entering a country church, always patronise
the clergyman's or the squire's pew; should
any ladies be present, you may take out your eyeglass
and quizz them with a vacant stare,&mdash;they
will probably suppose you to be an unknown
friend;&mdash;politely hand the fair devotees the prayer
and hymn-book; you may also hum the bass in
chords to the ladies' treble; when you depart, be
sure to make a very low congee, as it will mark
you for a gentleman.</p>

<p>5. Should you, by any chance, be introduced to a
new acquaintance, you may, at the expiration of a
week, <em>jerrymediddle</em> him by the question&mdash;"You
<span class="pb" id="Pg150">[150]</span>
have not got such a thing as five pounds about
you, have you?" A person, who prefers your
society to solitude, can have no objection to a
loan; you can then make yourself as scarce as
asparagus at Christmas.</p>

<h3><span class="pb" id="Pg151">[151]</span>
ASSURANCE COMPANIES.</h3>

<p>Assurance is displayed to perfection in modern
Assurance Companies; and it only requires
<em>assurance</em> to raise a company as baseless as the
emasculated minus of No. I., and as fabrickless as
a "footless stocking without a leg," which shall
be eagerly taken by the public.</p>

It is proposed to form the company of the above
"Live Stock," the members of which are each to
possess a share in each other. The young maids'
class, No. 1, beauty, rank, and fortune, being the
highest prizes&mdash;there are supposed to be a hundred
of such prizes. The second class of prizes is rich
old widows, with short lives, of which there are
also a hundred. The third class of prizes is rich
old maids, of which there are also a hundred. The
fourth class comprehends beauty and intelligence;
the fifth, beauty only; and so on in a sliding
scale, but all prizes.</p>

<p>The male stock also comprehends a reciprocity
system of prizes:&mdash;1st class, of the whiskered; 2d,
no whiskered; 3d, monied and whiskered; and so on
to widowers, with or without families, down to
that least of all valuable of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i>, old
men-women.</p>

<h4>RULES.</h4>

<p>Each subscriber of a pound annually to have
one ticket, which shall entitle him to draw for
each of the prizes on the 1st of April in every
year, at Exeter Hall, under a commission selected
from the "Lumber Troop."</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg156">[156]</span>
The parties so fortunate as to draw a prize will
have an introduction to the subject of it, and a
match will be negotiated, if possible, without
delay. Should the parties not suit each other,
they will, upon the payment of another guinea,
be privileged to draw again. But it is assumed,
from a careful examination of matrimonial statistics
drawn up by Dr. Lardner, that the matter of
suitability will never be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>To facilitate its objects, a Normal seminary will
be attached to the society, and a registrar engaged
to marry at a reduced price, "that is, by
the score."</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg157">[157]</span>
RULE XX.<br />
<small>STOCKS, FUNDS, &amp;c.</small></h2>

<p>The monetary system of England is the ideal
philosophy of political economists, who, in the conviction
that "nothing exists," think it no "matter"
to found a variety of hypotheses to give tangibility
to the intangible, substance to accident, and reality
to the abstract; in short, to personify "nothing."</p>

<p>These intangible tangibilities bear various names,
such as <em>Consols</em>, <em>Bank Stock</em>, <em>Indian Stock</em>, <em>Long
Annuities</em>, <em>Exchequer Bills</em>, &amp;c. The aggregate of
these 0 0 0 0 0 noughts are, by a peculiar process
of national arithmetic, made to amount to <em>Stock</em>
or Funds.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg158">[158]</span>
Stocks or Funds are the true substantials.
In the golden ages of the world, cattle, corn, and
merchandise were the medium of exchange among
nations; but as men grew more enlightened, they
agreed to represent these things by pieces of conventional
metal. This at last becoming scarce,
the world would have fallen into a state of hapless
and irrecoverable ruin, but for the idea of a fictitious
representation of a representation, of a <em>non-existent</em>
which <em>might have been</em>.</p>

<p>Funds are therefore the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">to kalon</i>, the absolute,
the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">logos</i>, the never-to-be-apprehended, the inscrutable,
the supreme totality of "emptiness," the
absolute cause, the absolute effect, the absolute
concurrence of national faith; in short, the commercial
"ideal" which all men worship, in its
temples of the Bank and Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Stocks are the "heaven of this religion," an agreeable
hallucination, by which a variety of insane persons,
called Stockholders or Fundholders, are permitted
to roam at large under the conviction that
they possess <em>wealth</em>. The public are compelled
to believe in these fictitious representations,
which are the foundation of the "imaginative
system" in fiscal affairs, of the Bill and Credit
<span class="pb" id="Pg159">[159]</span>
system in commerce, and of the National
Debt.</p>

<p>In England there is nothing truly <em>national</em> but
this debt, or dead weight, which is the mighty
pendulum which makes the national clock "go
upon tick." It is the true foundation of political
economy and of social faith or trust; "'pon tick"
is the basis of the wealth and happiness of our
country, which it makes the envy of the world and
the glory of surrounding nations.</p>

<p>To be in debt argues credit, and credit respectability,
and respectability means, and means resolve
themselves into <em>the Funds</em>; here they merge into
the blessed obscurity of "nothingness," and being
absorbed by the same media, pass for a "something"
which is far more formidable than "anything."
Thus private wealth moves in a circle
continually, making the round O from 0 (nothing)
to 0 (nothing.)</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Joint Stock.</span>&mdash;Joint Stock Companies are so
called from the projectors being generally "black
legs," and their victims "raw Jemmies." The
object of such companies is to give honesty the
<span class="pb" id="Pg160">[160]</span>
"cross buttock," to have a "shind eye" with
capital, and to end in an "offal" bankruptcy.</p>

<p>From a consideration of the immediately preceding
rules, and assuming as a fact the spiritual
and ethereal nature of stock or capital, it is therefore
proposed to found a Joint-Stock Company of
unlimited capital, to be called the Boreal Pneumatic
Joint-Stock Company, for "raising the wind,"
and making "darkness visible," or the National
"Puff" Company.</p>

<p>Raising the wind has been the great problem
of all financial operations. It is of far more
importance than "raising the dead." The "wind"
is a conventional term for the "needful." It is
called wind because it is raised by various "Puffs."</p>

<p>There are various kinds of Puff; the Puff
National, the Puff Medical, the Puff Legal, the
Puff Literary, the "Puff Theatrical," and the
Puff Scholastic.</p>

<h3>THE PUFF NATIONAL&mdash;A ROYAL SPEECH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The flourishing
state of my empire having filled me with the most
intense satisfaction, I have called you together to
<span class="pb" id="Pg161">[161]</span>
inform you that we are the envy of the world and
glory of surrounding nations, and that everything
is so plentiful that pigs run about the streets
ready roasted, with carving knives and forks stuck
in their backs, crying, "Eat me, eat me!"</p>

<p>I continue to receive from foreign powers the
most friendly intercourse, and an assurance that
they have unanimously agreed to sink their own
national interests in a regard for my welfare; and
in this I am certain there is no "gammon."</p>

<p>The Commercial and Mercantile interests are
in such a state of convalescent perfection, and
gold is so plentiful, that I have ordered a commission
to consider of the propriety of paving
with it the various thoroughfares of the metropolis,
in lieu of Blockheads.</p>

<p>Owing to a great improvement in Benevolent
affairs, it is with pleasure I have to inform you
that the Public Societies have given up their
vested rights, dues, peculations, and pickings,
for the benefit of the poor, (should there be any
such,) and will henceforth "preach without
Profit."</p>

<p>Owing also to the general distribution of wealth
among all classes, I have been enabled to divest
<span class="pb" id="Pg162">[162]</span>
physic of its fees, and law of its charges; and both
these professions will for henceforth be conducted
"free gratis" and "for nothing."</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the House of Commons</span>,&mdash;Through
the practice of the most rigid economy in
every branch of my establishment, I have directed
to be laid before you an account of the sums paid
into the Exchequer, being the <em>surplus of my revenue</em>;
and I have further to inform you that taxation
being no longer necessary, the expense of a house
of <em>com</em>mons may be dispensed with, and the large
sums usually paid in "bribery at elections," I
trust will be left to fructify in the pockets of the
members.</p>

<p>This constitutional determination on my part,
for the benefit of my people, has arisen from my
being called, by Divine Providence, to a sense of
my true estate of a State pauper, which has led
me to reduce my dietary and that of my household
to that of the <em>Poor-Law Unions</em>, and to
introduce <em>teatotality</em> into every department; and I
have great gratification in being able to announce,
that as I have now lost "having a <em>shadow</em>" to my
royal personality, I may myself be shortly expected
<span class="pb" id="Pg163">[163]</span>
to evaporize, and the expense of a monarchy may
be saved for the future.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;With and by the
advice of my Privy Council, I have determined
upon putting into execution the <em>hydrostatic paradox</em>,
or <em>cold water cure</em>, in and upon that part of
my dominions called Ireland; and a commission
consisting of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal
has been issued for laying that "flower of the earth
and gem of the sea" "<em>under water</em>" for the space
of one month, as the best method of extinguishing
the torch of discord, the fire of malevolence, and
the smoke of sedition, and of allaying all ferment
upon <em>Atlantic</em> if not upon <em>pacific</em> principles.</p>

<p>I rely confidently upon the wisdom of my
Parliament to enable me to carry out my beneficent
intentions of subjecting all my people to
"live upon air," as the symbol of true freedom, and
as the most liberal and inexpensive method of
obviating the evils which have hitherto surrounded
my throne and government; and I would submit
to your serious consideration the expediency of
establishing a training school at Exeter Hall, for
teaching <em>wind instruments</em> to all my subjects, and
<span class="pb" id="Pg164">[164]</span>
for the arrangement of <em>airs</em> corresponding to the
various <em>meals</em>, <em>feasts</em>, and <em>dishes</em> of every day life;
and I indulge the anticipation that the substitution
of <em>oxygen</em> for <em>oxen</em>, and <em>gas</em> for <em>Gas</em>tronomy, will
be conducive to the health, wealth, and prosperity
of my empire.</p>

<p>This Company is established in consequence of
the lamented deficiency in the scholastic profession;
<span class="pb" id="Pg166">[166]</span>
and its object is to manufacture schoolmasters of
a very superior character, at a cheap rate, from
various "refuse" articles of all trades and professions&mdash;technically,
the "unfit" or <em>good-for-nothing</em>.</p>

<p>In consequence of a profound investigation of
the science of education, it has been discovered
that those who are unable to conduct any other
business, are the best adapted to "teach the
young idea how to shoot;" and therefore cast-off
cobblers, tailors, teachers, and drapers, shop-boys
and errand-boys, will be received into the establishment
at the rate of a guinea a-week; where,
by the aid of educational galvanism, their misdirected
faculties will be sublimed, their ideas
topsiturvied, their moral and intellectual nature
turned inside out, their understandings new
vamped, soled, and <em>welted</em>, and their minds infused
with a succedaneum of intellectual electricity,
which shall evaporate itself in the mixed mathematics,
pedagogicks, whackbackics, pancakeatics,
tickletobyatics, and all other scholastic sciences.</p>

<p>Candidates must bring personal recommendations,
of a squint, a slouch, a leer, a game leg, a
hump back, or any other accomplishments. Should
<span class="pb" id="Pg167">[167]</span>
they be unfortunately destitute of these, they may
produce testimonials of fitness from their washerwomen;
but those who do not indulge in the
luxury of a clean shirt may be recommended by
the teacher of any Social sect to which they may
belong. These certificates must certify them to
be bumble headed, addle-pated, numbsculled, good
for nothing else; that they wear dickeys and are
donkeys.</p>

<p>Upon entering the Institution the seminants
will be forced to forget everything they ever
knew, by a machine invented by Mr. Combe for
"Razing out the errors of the brain," and which
has been used with the happiest effects at the
Glasgow Normal Establishment.&mdash;A perfect Tabla
Rasa being thus produced in vacuo, on Locke's
principle, the professors will commence teaching
their pupils to know a great A from a bull's
foot, how many beans make five, and other
branches of the pure mathematics.</p>

<p>As all the seminants will be <em>naturals</em>, Natural
Philosophy will be a principal object of study, and
the mechanical system of Dr. Lardner will be the
text-book. History will be imparted through the
renowned histories of "Jack the Giant Killer,"
<span class="pb" id="Pg168">[168]</span>
"Jack and the Bean Stalk," "The Ogre and his
Seven-leagued Boots," and the "Newgate Calendar,"
under the superintendence of John Ketch,
Esq.; Morality and Esthenics through the medium
of "Ovid's Art of Love," "Basia," and "Little's
Poems;" while the Principles of Science will be
imparted through the "Boxiana," by Professor
Cribb, assisted by the celebrated Scotch terrier,
"Fudge."</p>

<p>Religion being in the highest degree essential,
it cannot be dispensed with without endangering
the safety of the Company. But as there are
so many different sects of religionists, and so many
differences in the sects, it is proposed to teach
religion by machinery, on the comprehensive accommodation
principle of expediency, by means of
one of <ins>Cobbett's</ins> cast-iron Independent parsons,
which, being constructed upon the profoundest
principles of neutrality, will satisfy all parties, by
teaching every religion at the same time, and
none in particular: thus Atheism and Methodism
may shake hands together, Mahommedanism and
Calvinism embrace, and Buddhism and every
other schism kiss each other in the true spirit of
Christian liberality and equality.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg169">[169]</span>
Degrees will be granted to those pupils who may
distinguish themselves in flagellation, or a dexterous
use of the cat or tawse, or by proficiency in the
evolutions of cane, strap, or ruler; the degree
of P.W., Professed Walloper, being equal to
that of A.M.</p>

<h3>THE PUFF NOVEL.</h3>

<p>We are requested to announce that the new
Novel, called the "<span class="smcap">Bloody-minded Costermonger</span>,
or the <span class="smcap">Donkey's Apotheosis</span>," having
experienced a sale unprecedented in the annals of
Literature, a new edition is in preparation, worked
<span class="pb" id="Pg170">[170]</span>
by steam apparatus, to supply the astounding
demand, and will be issued on Saturday next.</p>

<p>"This extraordinary work is creating a sensation
the most intense, as it completely daguerreotypes
nature, penetrates the feelings like the
electric shock, macadamises the heart, and cuts the
soul to shivers."&mdash;<em>The Censor</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p><span class="smcap">New Novel by "Snivie."</span> Written seven
months after his decease, by the aid of the galvanic
apparatus.&mdash;It having come to the ears of
an experimental philosopher, La Fontaine, that
this great author was no more, and it being
justly surmised that a very large amount of Novel
matter must remain in his <em>system</em>, La Fontaine
undertook the task of extracting it by means of
the mesmeric process, and has succeeded with
wonderful effect. In performing his numerous
experiments the flashes of wit were so intense as
to overpower the anxious publisher, who, in the
intensity of his admiration, has paid so large a
sum for the copyright as to be enabled to add to
the character of the work by charging double.</p>

<h3><span class="pb" id="Pg171">[171]</span>
THE PUFF THEATRICAL.</h3>

<p>It is with the most astounding rapture that the
Manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, has
to announce that the new tragedy of "Chandos
the Briber, or the Independent Potwalloper," which
met with the most transcendent success on its
first representation, has been recharged by the
Author with pathetic scenes and tender situations,
abounding with the most overpowering sentiment
and overwhelming pathos. The Manager regrets
that the cascades of tears which fell from the
boxes and gallery during the last representation
should have inconvenienced the "critics in the
pit," and begs to inform them that, for the future,
they shall not sit ankle deep in the "briny flood,"
he having, at a prodigious expense, and by the aid
of a distinguished engineer, succeeded in forming a
grand branch aqueduct, which will receive through
the floor of the house "Nature's gentle droppings,"
and, by an appropriate channel, transmit them to
the back of the stage to a grand reservoir. Thus,
the last scene of the tragedy, which represents the
<span class="pb" id="Pg172">[172]</span>
bombardment of Stow House by Norfolk dumplings,
will be represented on "real salt water;"
the said salt water being an accumulation of the
tears shed at the preceding scenes of the tragedy.</p>

<p>N. B. It is particularly requested that ladies or
gentlemen in the boxes will refrain from wringing
out their pocket handkerchiefs over the pit, and
that those in the front ranks will discontinue the
practice of "hoisting umbrellas," which must
obviously obstruct a view of the stage.</p>

tunic. This unique and perfect introduction, formed
of the common dock, having been patronised by
the highest authority, will be supplied to all who
value cool comfort and free motion of the limbs, at
a guinea each. To the religiously-disposed it is
<span class="pb" id="Pg173">[173]</span>
particularly eligible, being the original antique of
Adam and Eve, our first parents, the pattern of
which was found in the archives of Strawberry
Hill. It comes half way to the knee, hangs
simply and elegantly before and behind, and may
be had of various colours to suit the complexion.
It cannot fail to display the fine form of the
limbs, and imparts a degree of interest to the whole
person not to be found in common pantaloons,
and has the advantage of being adapted to both
sexes. Observe,</p>

<h3>THE PUFF CLERICAL.</h3>

<h4>VOLUNTARY CHURCH-GOING COMPANY.</h4>

<p>The lamentable neglect of public worship, which
characterises the present generation, being such as
<span class="pb" id="Pg174">[174]</span>
to call for the most rigorous methods, and it
having been discovered that fine and imprisonment
are insufficient to make the people "religiously
disposed," it is in contemplation to found a Society
or Company which, reprobating the principle of
coercion as unconstitutional in its means, futile in
its ends, shall, by the mild suavity of enticement,
induce the lower classes of this country to seek,
on the Sabbath-day, in preference to all other
places, the Conventicle.</p>

<p>But to do this effectually it will require a sum
of considerable magnitude, which it is proposed to
raise by "sequestration shares," comprising the
amount of 20 millions sterling. The proceeds to
be applied to the objects in view; namely, the
establishment of cook-shops and dining-rooms in
union with the various dissenting places of worship,
to be free, gratis, and for nothing; and it is fondly
anticipated that the savoury scents of the roast, and
the boiled, the fried and the stewed, and the relish
of pies and puddings, will be more efficacious in
inducing the poor to attend to their religious
duties than the red-hot denunciations formerly
employed.</p>

<p>It is a fact too clearly established by the concurrent
<span class="pb" id="Pg175">[175]</span>
testimony of ages, that those who are <em>bred</em> to
the chapel expect the chapel to be <em>bread</em> to them;
and it is only fair that the poor and needy should
stand in a congenial relative situation.</p>

<p>Subscribers are therefore earnestly solicited in
aid of this great national object, as one of the
best means to put a stop to the spread of infidelity,
to destroy Socialism, to promote the practice of
true <em>pie</em>ty, and thus add to the safety and security
of the nation.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Comic Arithmetic.</span>&mdash;If we wonder that
the human mind could have conceived such a
project, what must be our astonishment to find all
its beatific visions realized, in such abundant corruscations

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
