MAJ. GEN       L W.T. SHERMAN.


  
  
    Our camp fires shone bright on the mountain
That frowned on the river below,
While we stood by our guns in the morning,
And eagerly watched for the foe,
When a rider came out from the darkness
That hung over mountains and tree,
And shouted,        Boys, up and be ready,
For Sherman will march to the sea.       

When cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman
Went up from each valley and glen,
And the bugle re-echoed the music
That came from the lips of the men,
For we knew that the stars on our banner
More bright in their splendor would be,
And that blessings from Northland would greet us
As Sherman marched down to the sea.
Then forward, boys, forward, to battle,
We marched on our wearysome way,
And we strewed the wild hills of Resaca       
God bless those who fell on that day.
Then Kennesaw, dark in its glory,
Frowned down on the flag of the free;
But the East and the West bore our standard
As Sherman marched down to the sea.

Still onward we pressed till our banner
Swept out from Atlanta       s grim walls,
And the blood of the patriot dampened
The soil where traitor       s flag falls.
But we paused not to weep for the fallen
Who slept by each river and tree;
Yet we twined them wreaths of the laurel
As Sherman marched down to the sea.







  Proud, proud was our army that morning
That stood by the cypress and pine
When Sherman said,        Boys, you are weary;
This day fair Savannah is thine,       
Then sang we a song for our chieftain
That echoed o       er river and lea,
And the stars on our banner shone brighter
When Sherman marched on to the sea.

    2D CORPS.
          Bring the good old bugle, boys, we       ll sing another song,
Sing it with the spirit that will start the world along,       
Sing it as we used to sing it, fifty thousand strong,
While we were marching through Georgia.

Chorus.

       Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee!
Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that makes you free!       
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia.







How the darkies shouted when they heard the joyful sound!
How the turkeys gobbled which our commissary found!
How the sweet potatoes even started from the ground,
While we were marching through Georgia!       Chorus.

Yes, and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears
When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years;
Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers
While we were marching through Georgia.       Chorus.

       Sherman       s dashing Yankee boys will never reach the coast!       
So the saucy rebel said, and        twas a handsome boast;
Had they not forgotten, alas! to reckon with the host,
While we were marching through Georgia.       Chorus.

So we made a thoroughfare for Freedom and her train,
Sixty miles in latitude,       three hundred to the main,
Treason fled before us, for resistance was in vain,
While we were marching through Georgia.       Chorus.

    SOLID SHOT.
    Lift up your eyes, desponding freemen!
Fling to the winds your needless fears!
He who unfurled your beauteous banner
Says it shall wave a thousand years.

Chorus.

       A thousand years!        my own Columbia!
       Tis the glad day so long foretold!
       Tis the glad morn whose early twilight
Washington saw in times of old.





  
  
  What if the clouds one little moment
Hid the blue sky where morn appears
When the bright sun that tints them crimson
Rises to shine a thousand years!       Chorus.

Tell the great world these blessed tidings!
Yes, and be sure the bondman hears;
Tell the oppress       d of ev       ry nation
Jubilee lasts a thousand years.       Chorus.

Envious foes beyond the ocean!
Little we heed your threat       ning sneers;
Little will they       our children       s children
When you are gone a thousand years.       Chorus.

Rebels at home! go hide your faces       
Weep for your crimes with bitter tears;
You could not bind the blessed daylight,
Though you should strive a thousand years.       Chorus.






  
  
  Back to your dens, ye secret traitors!
Down to your own degraded spheres!
Ere the first blaze of dazzling sunshine
Shortens your lives a thousand years.       Chorus.

Haste thee along, thou glorious noonday!
Oh! for the eyes of ancient seers!
Oh! for the faith of Him who reckons
Each of His days a thousand years.       Chorus.

    Hail Columbia! happy land!
Hail, ye heroes! heaven-born band!
Who fought and bled in Freedom       s cause,
Who fought and bled in Freedom       s cause,
And when the storm of war was gone
Enjoyed the peace your valor won.
Let Independence be our boast,
Ever mindful what it cost;
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its altar reach the skies.
Firm united let us be,
Rallying round our liberty;
As a band of brothers joined,
Peace and safety we shall find.

MAJ. GEN       L JOHN A. M       CLERNAND.







Immortal patriots, rise once more,
Defend your rights, defend your shore,
Let no rude foe, with impious hand,
Let no rude foe, with impious hand,
Invade the shrine where sacred lies,
Of toil and blood the well-earned prize.
While offering peace sincere and just,
In heaven we place a manly trust,
That truth and justice will prevail,
And every scheme of bondage fail.
Firm united let us be, etc.










19TH CORPS.
Sound, sound the trump of fame!
Sound Washington       s great name,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Ring through the world with loud applause;
Let every clime to Freedom dear
Listen with a joyful ear;
With equal skill and godlike power,
He governed in the fearful hour
Of horrid war! or guides with ease
The happier times of honest peace,
Firm united let us be, etc.

    BRIG. GEN       L M.M. CROCKER.
    Just before the battle, mother,
I am thinking most of you,
While upon the field we       re watching,
With the enemy in view.
Comrades brave are round me lying,
Fill       d with tho       ts of home and God,
For well they know that on the morrow
Some will sleep beneath the sod.

Chorus.

Farewell, mother, you may never
Press me to your heart again;
But oh, you       ll not forget me, mother,
If I       m numbered with the slain.
  




  
  
  Oh, I long to see you, mother,
And the loving ones at home;
But I       ll never leave our banner
Till in honor I can come.
Tell the traitors, all around you,
That their cruel words we know
In every battle kill our soldiers
By the help they give the foe.       Chorus.
  




  
  
  Hark! I hear the bugle sounding,
       Tis the signal for the fight!
Now, may God protect me, mother,
As He ever does the right.
Hear the        Battle Cry of Freedom,       
How it swells upon the air!
Oh, yes, we       ll rally round the standard,
Or we       ll perish nobly there.       Chorus.

WE       VE DRUNK FROM THE SAME CANTEEN.

Key of C.







ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS.
There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours,
Fetters of friendship and ties of flowers,
And true lovers        knots, I ween.
The boys and the girls are bound by a kiss,
But there       s never a bond, old friend, like this:
We have drunk from the same canteen!

The same canteen, my soldier friend,
The same canteen;
There       s never a bond like this:
We have drunk from the same canteen!







It was sometimes water and sometimes milk,
Sometimes apple-jack as fine as silk;
But, whatever the tipple has been,
We shared it together in bane or in bliss,
And I warn you, friend, when I think of this:
We have drunk from the same canteen.

We       ve shared our blankets and tents together,
And marched and fought in all kinds of weather,
And hungry and full we       ve been;
Had days of battle and days of rest,
But this memory I cling to and love the best:
We       ve drunk from the same canteen.

For when wounded I lay on the outer slope,
With my blood flowing fast and but little hope
On which my faint spirit might lean,
Oh! then, I remember, you crawled to my side,
And bleeding so fast it seemed both must have died,
We have drunk from the same canteen!

THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.




[Listen] [Notation]

Key of C.




  
  
    
    Oh! say, can you see by the dawn       s early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight       s last gleaming       
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight,
O       er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!
And the rockets        red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
Oh! say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave
O       er the land of the free and the home of the brave!





  
  
On that shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe       s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o       er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses!
Now it catches the gleam of the morning       s first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;
       Tis the Star Spangled Banner, oh! long may it wave
O       er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle       s confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps        pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;
And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave
O       er the land of the free and the home of the brave.





  
  
Oh! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war       s desolation,
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto              In God is our trust              
And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave
O       er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

    Oh! Columbia, the gem of the ocean,
The home of the brave and the free,
The shrine of each patriot       s devotion,
The world offers homage to thee.
Thy mandates make heroes assemble,
When Liberty       s form stands in view;
Thy banners make tyranny tremble
When borne by the Red, White, and Blue.

Chorus.

When borne by the Red, White, and Blue,
When borne by the Red, White, and Blue,
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,
When borne by the Red, White, and Blue.

When war waged its wide desolation,
And threatened the land to deform,
The ark then of Freedom       s foundation,
Columbia, rode safe through the storm,
With her garlands of vict       ry around her,
When so proudly she bore her brave crew,
With her flag proudly floating before her,
The boast of the Red, White, and Blue.       Chorus.






  
  
That banner, that banner bring hither,
Tho        rebels and traitors look grim;
May the wreaths it has won never wither,
Nor the stars of its glory grow dim!
May the service united ne       er sever,
But they to their colors prove true!
The Army and Navy forever,
Three cheers for the Red, White, and Blue.       Chorus.

And we       ll eat as we ne       er ate before
The Army bean, nice and clean;
We will stick to our beans evermore.





  
  
  Now, the bean in its primitive state
Is a plant we have all often met,
And, when cooked in the old army style,
It has charms we can never forget.       Chorus.

The potato is loved by the Mick,
But the soldiers have long since found out
That thro        life to our beans we should stick.       Chorus.

Wild are the breezes tonight;
But        neath the roof the hours as they fly
Are happy, and calm, and bright.
Gathering round our firesides,
Tho        it be summer time,
We sit and talk of brothers abroad,
Forgetting the midnight chime.





  
  
  Chorus.

Brave boys are they!
Gone at their country       s call;
And yet, and yet we cannot forget
That many brave boys must fall.

Under the homestead roof,
Nestled so cozy and warm,
While soldiers sleep with little or naught
To shelter them from the storm.
Resting on grassy couches,
Pillow       d on hillocks damp,
Of martial fare how little we know
Till brothers are in camp.       Chorus.

Thinking no less of them,
Loving our country the more,
We sent them forth to fight for the flag
Their fathers before them bore.
Though the great teardrops started,
This was our parting trust:
       God bless you, boys! we       ll welcome you home
When rebels are in the dust.              Cho.

Our banner in triumph waves.       Chorus.

As sung by Chaplain C.C. McCabe while a prisoner in Libby,
after hearing Old Ben (the colored paper-seller in Richmond)
cry out,        Great news by the telegraph! Great battles at
Gettysburg! Union soldiers gain the day!        Upon hearing such
glorious news Chaplain McCabe sung this soul-stirring hymn,
all the prisoners joining heartily in the chorus, making the
old prison walls ring              Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

    Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible quick sword;
His truth is marching on.

Chorus.       Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

Chorus.       Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!







I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel,
       As ye deal with my contemners, so with my grace shall deal;
Let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel,
Since God is marching on.       

Chorus.       Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;
Our God is marching on.

Chorus.       Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

In the beauties of the lillies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
While God is marching on.

Chorus.       Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

       Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble, there       s no place like home;
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which, seek thro        the world, is ne       er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home; there       s no place like home
Oh, there       s no place like home.

I gaze on the moon as I tread the drear wild,
And feel that my mother now thinks of her child
As she looks on that moon from our own cottage door
Thro        the woodbine whose fragrance shall cheer me no more.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, etc.

An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain;
Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
The birds, singing gaily, that came at my call;
Give me them, and that peace of mind, dearer than all.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, etc.

See how faint my heated breath;
All around to me seems darkness;
Tell me, comrades, is this death?
Ah! how well I know your answer;
To my fate I meekly bow,
If you       ll only tell me truly
Who will care for mother now?

Chorus.

Soon with angels I       ll be marching,
With bright laurels on my brow;
I have for my country fallen;
Who will care for mother now?





  
  
  Who will comfort her in sorrow?
Who will dry the falling tear,
Gently smooth her wrinkled forehead?
Who will whisper words of cheer?
Even now I think I see her
Kneeling, praying for me! how
Can I leave her in anguish?
Who will care for mother now?       Chorus.






  
  
    Let this knapsack be my pillow,
And my mantle be the sky;
Hasten, comrades, to the battle!
I will like a soldier die.
Soon with angels I       ll be marching,
With bright laurels on my brow;
I have for my country fallen;
Who will care for mother now?       Chorus.

Oh! how proud you stood before me,

When you vowed to me and country
Ever to be true.

Hopes and fears how vain;
When this cruel war is over,

Far away from those who love you,
None to hear you call,
Who would whisper words of comfort,
Who would soothe your pain?
Ah! the many cruel fancies
Ever in my brain.       Chorus.

But our country called you, darling,
Angels cheer your way,
While our nation       s sons are fighting
We can only pray.
Nobly strike for God and liberty,
Let all nations see
How we love our starry banner,
Emblem of the free.       Chorus.

    We are coming, Father Abraham       three hundred thousand more,
From Mississippi       s winding stream and from New England       s shore;
We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear,
With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear;
We dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before       
We are coming, Father Abraham       three hundred thousand more!

    
    


  
  
If you look across the hill-tops that meet the northern sky,
Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;
And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloud veil aside,
And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride;
And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour       
We are coming, Father Abraham       three hundred thousand more!

If you look all up our valleys, where the growing harvests shine,
You may see our sturdy farmer-boys fast forming into line,
And children from their mothers        knees are pulling at the weeds,
And learning how to reap and sow, against their country       s needs;
And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door       
We are coming, Father Abraham       three hundred thousand more!






  
  
    You have called us, and we       re coming, by Richmond       s bloody tide,
To lay us down for freedom       s sake, our brothers        bones beside.
Or from foul treason       s savage grasp to wrench the murderous blade,
And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade.
Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before       
We are coming, Father Abraham       three hundred thousand more!

Thinking of days gone by,
Of loved ones at home who gave us the hand
And the tear that said good-bye.       Chorus.

We       re tired of the war on the old camp ground;
Many are dead and gone
Of the brave and true who have left their homes;
Others been wounded long.       Chorus.

Hurrah, hurrah, for the Union, boys, hurrah!
Hurrah for our forefathers        good old flag

Much patience and forbearance
The North has always shown
Toward her Southern brethren,
Who had each way their own;
But when we made our President
A man whom we desired
Their wrath was roused, they mounted guns,
And on Fort Sumter fired.       Chorus.

They forced the war upon us,
For peaceful men are we;
They steal our money, seize our forts,
And then as cowards flee;
False to their vows and to the flag
That once protected them,
They sought the Union to dissolve,
Earth       s noblest, brightest gem.       Chorus.

Joy was in his mild blue eye;
But a golden cord is severed,
And our hopes in ruin lie.

We shall meet, but we shall miss him;
There will be one vacant chair;

Often will the bosom swell
At remembrance of the story
How our noble Willie fell;
How he strove to bear our banner
Through the thickest of the fight,
And upheld our country       s honor
In the strength of manhood       s might.       Chorus.

Evermore will deck his brow;

Dirges from the pine and cypress
Mingle with the tears we shed.       Chorus.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
