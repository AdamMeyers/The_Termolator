SOUTH AFRICA AND THE TRANSVAAL WAR

PEACE



&#8220;On her knees, before the glory of the Lord,
Britannia sheathes the lightnings of her sword;
Once again, to utmost ends
Of the Red Line it defends,
She hath peace.&#8221;&mdash;Sir Edwin Arnold.


THE SITUATION&mdash;FEBRUARY 1901

The reign of His Majesty King Edward VII. began in
clouds! There was no denying that the last half-year
had been one of retrogression. In June 1900, from
the Orange River southwards, there had been comparative
quietude. The southern and eastern half of the
Orange River Colony had become fairly settled, while even in
some districts of the Transvaal&mdash;towards the south-western area
especially&mdash;the inhabitants gave indications of a willingness to
accept British rule, and of a desire to return to their agricultural
and peaceful avocations. But with the end of the year came
a deplorable change. The enemy, broken up into a large number
of desultory gangs, commenced raiding and wrecking, consequently
the British forces, in order to cope with and pursue these vagrant
bands, had to be broken up to correspond. The area of hostility
and destruction grew larger daily and the difficulty of fighting more
extreme. The lack of supplies now drove the Boers, who lived
entirely on the country through which they passed, to spend their
time in looting, in pouncing on the farms and small villages, and
in seizing everything they might need. Stores, clothing, horses,
cattle, all were grabbed at the point of the rifle, if not, as in some
cases, delivered up on demand. To frustrate the tactics of the
enemy, the British forces were compelled to denude the country of
every movable thing, and to place whatever could be conveyed there
in refuge camps which were established at points along the railway
lines. But in this operation great loss was entailed, owing to the
difficulty of finding sufficient grass for the number of collected
animals, and of keeping them alive en route.

The loss of crops and stock became a still more serious matter
than even the destruction of farm buildings&mdash;a measure which had
almost entirely been abandoned. Having regard to the inexpensive[Pg 2]
character of these structures, this measure, to quote Sir Alfred
Milner, was a &#8220;comparatively small item&#8221; in the total damage caused
by the war to the agricultural community. But, he said, the wanton
and malicious injury done to the headgear, stamps, and other apparatus
of some of the outlying mines by Boer raiders was a form of
destruction for which there was no excuse. It was a vandalism
unjustified by the requirements of military operations and outside
the scope of civilised warfare. Directly or indirectly, all South
Africa, including the agricultural population, owes its prosperity
to the mines, and, of course, especially to the mines of the Transvaal.
To money made in mining it is indebted for such progress,
even in agriculture, as it has recently made, and the same source
will have to be relied upon for the recuperation of agriculture after
the ravages of war. The damage done to the mines Lord Milner
estimated was not large &#8220;relatively to the vast total amount of the
fixed capital sunk in them. The mining area,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is excessively
difficult to guard against purely predatory attacks having no military
purpose, because it is, so to speak, &#8216;all length and no breadth&#8217;&mdash;one
long thin line, stretching across the country from east to west for
many miles. Still, garrisoned as Johannesburg now is, it was only
possible successfully to attack a few points in it. Of the raids
previously made, and they have been fairly numerous, only one has
resulted in any serious damage. In that instance the injury done
to the single mine attacked amounted to £200,000, and it is
estimated that the mine is put out of working for two years.
This mine is only one out of a hundred, and is not by any
means one of the most important. These facts may afford some
indication of the ruin which might have been inflicted, not only
on the Transvaal and all South Africa, but on many European
interests, if that general destruction of mine works which was contemplated
just before our occupation of Johannesburg had been
carried out. However serious in some respects may have been the
military consequences of our rapid advance to Johannesburg, South
Africa owes more than is commonly recognised to that brilliant
dash forward, by which the vast mining apparatus, the foundation
of all her wealth, was saved from the ruin threatening it.&#8221;

The events of the last six months promised to involve a more vast
amount of repair and a longer period of recuperation, especially for
agriculture, than would have been anticipated at the commencement
of hostilities. Still, having regard to the fact that both the Rand and
Kimberley were virtually undamaged, and that the main engines of
prosperity, when once set going again, would not take very long to
get into working order, the economic consequences of the war,
though grave, did not appear by any means appalling. The country
population it was admitted would need a good deal of help, first to[Pg 3]
preserve it from starvation, and then, probably, to supply it with a
certain amount of capital to make a fresh start. And the great
industry of the country would require some little time before it
would be able to render any assistance. But, in a young country
with great recuperative powers, many years would not elapse before
the economic ravages of the war would be effaced.

Still, the moral effect of the recrudescence of the war was lamentable.
Everywhere after the occupation of Pretoria the inhabitants
had seemed resigned to the state of affairs&mdash;the feeling in the colony
had been one of acquiescent relief. The rebellious element was glad
of the opportunity to settle down. Had these people been shut off
from communication with the enemy they would have maintained
their calm, and engaged themselves with their former peaceful
pursuits. As it was, while the great advance to Pretoria, and subsequently
to Delagoa Bay, demanded the presence of the British
troops in the north, the country was left open to raiders, who daily
grew more audacious as the small successes of their guerilla leaders
appeared to give promise of a turn of fortune&#8217;s wheel.

And now came the real tug of war. These raiders, both on the
brink of the Orange Colony and the Southern Transvaal, kept the
peaceable inhabitants of the colony in an unenviable quandary.
These, and many others, on taking the oath of neutrality, instead of
being made prisoners of war, had been permitted to return to their
farms. But under pressure from their old comrades, they now
wavered between the obligations of their oath and the calls of friendship&mdash;and
many of them fell. Men who had been exceptionally
well treated were again in arms, sometimes justifying their break of
faith by the poor apology that they had not been &#8220;preserved from
the temptation to commit it.&#8221; Naturally, on the return of the troops
to again quell a rising in the south, their conduct was not marked
by the same leniency which had characterised the original conquest.
Still, these parole breakers were not punished with the severity
which might have been meted out to them in the same circumstances
by other nations. Though we were by the rules of war entitled
to shoot men who had broken their parole, we had not availed ourselves
of the right.

We remained as humane as the exigence of discipline would
permit. Efforts were made to check the general demoralisation by
establishing refuge camps for the peaceable along the railway lines,
but these camps were mainly tenanted by the women and children
of burghers who still determined to flout us.

Lord Milner, in speaking of the situation in the new territories
and the Cape Colony, described it as possibly &#8220;the most puzzling
that we have had to confront since the beginning of the war.&#8221; On
the one hand there was the outcry for greater severity and for a[Pg 4]
stricter administration of martial law. On the other hand, there was
the expression of the fear that strict measures would only exasperate
the people. He himself was in favour of reasonable strictness as the
proper attitude in the presence of a grave national danger, and he
further affirmed that exceptional regulations for a time of invasion,
the necessity of which every man of sense could understand, if
clearly explained and firmly adhered to, were not only not incompatible
with, but actually conducive to, the avoidance of injustice
and cruelty. He went on to say:&mdash;



De Wet&#8217;s Rush in Cape Colony viâ Zand Drift, 10th February 1901



&#8220;I am satisfied by experience that the majority of those Dutch
inhabitants of the Colony who sympathise with the Republics, however
little they may be able to resist giving active expression to
that sympathy when the enemy actually appear amongst them, do
not desire to see their own districts invaded or to find themselves
personally placed in the awkward dilemma of choosing between high
treason and an unfriendly attitude to the men of their own race
from beyond the border. There are extremists who would like[Pg 5]
to see the whole of the Cape Colony overrun. But the bulk of the
farmers, especially the substantial ones, are not of this mind. They
submit readily enough even to stringent regulations having for their
object the prevention of the spread of invasion. And not a few of
them are, perhaps, secretly glad that the prohibition of seditious
speaking and writing, of political meetings, and of the free movement
of political firebrands through the country, enables them to
keep quiet, without actually themselves taking a strong line against
the propaganda, and, to do them justice, they behave reasonably
well under the pass and other regulations necessary for that purpose,
as long as care is taken not to make these regulations too irksome
to them in the conduct of their business, or in their daily lives.&#8221;

He suggested that the fact that there had been an invasion at all
was no doubt due to the weakness of some of the Dutch colonists
in tolerating, or supporting, the violent propaganda, which could not
but lead the enemy to believe that they had only to come into the
Colony in order to meet with general active support. But this had
been a miscalculation on the part of the enemy, though a very
pardonable one. They knew the vehemence of the agitation in
their favour as shown by the speeches in Parliament, the series of
public meetings culminating in the Worcester Congress, the writings
of the Dutch press, the very general wearing of the Republican
colours, the singing of the Volkslied, and so forth, and they regarded
these demonstrations as meaning more than they actually did.
Three things were forgotten. Firstly, that a great proportion of
the Afrikanders in the Colony who really meant business, had
slipped away and joined the Republican ranks long ago. Secondly,
that the abortive rebellion of a year ago had left the people of the
border districts disinclined to repeat the experiment of a revolt.
Thirdly, that owing to the precautionary measures of the Government
the amount of arms and ammunition in the hands of the
country population throughout the greater part of the Colony is not
now anything like as large as it usually was, and far smaller than
it was at the onset of the war.

In regard to the &#8220;call to arms&#8221; that took place on the 1st of
January, and the vehement response it had met, Lord Milner
stated that it had always been admitted, by their friends and
foes alike, that the bulk of the Afrikander population would never
take up arms on the side of the British Government in this quarrel,
even for local defence. The appeal therefore had been virtually
directed to the British population, mostly townspeople, and to a
small, but no doubt very strong and courageous, minority of the
Afrikanders who have always been loyalists. These classes had
been already immensely drawn on by the Cape Police, the regular
Volunteer Corps, and the numerous Irregular Mounted Corps[Pg 6]
which had been called into existence because of the war. There
must have been 12,000 Cape colonists under arms before the
recent appeal, and as things were going, as many more promised to
answer that appeal&mdash;a truly remarkable achievement under a
purely voluntary system.



Position of Troops after the Engagement of 23rd February. De Wet&#8217;s
Escape from the Enveloping Cordon, 28th February 1901


How gloriously the system worked throughout the year 1901 has
yet to be seen, for peace was still a great way off. All yearned for
it, all were fairly sick of carnage and ruin and sacrifice, but, nevertheless,
it was agreed that to endure and fight to the bitter end were
preferable to an ignoble compromise, which must inevitably bring
about a recurrence of the terrible scourge in the future. All were
determined that South Africa should become one country under
one flag, and that the British; and this once accomplished, they
would be ready to bury racial animosities for ever. But, in order to
bring about that happy, that inevitable end, all decided that a vigorous
prosecution of the war, at whatever cost, was an imperative duty.
[Pg 7]

CHAPTER I

CONTINUATION OF THE DE WET CHASE, 1st to 10th MARCH&mdash;ACROSS
THE ORANGE RIVER

On the last day of February, as we know, De Wet and
Steyn, with a bedraggled, hungry commando of some
fifteen hundred Boers, precipitately crossed the Orange
River at Lilliefontein, near Colesberg Bridge. They
were seen by some few men of Nesbitt&#8217;s Horse under
Sergeant-Major Surworth, and promptly fired upon as men and
horses strove to battle with the current. This unlooked for attack
caused considerable dismay, so much so, that many Cape carts and
some clothing were left on the south bank, while several fugitives
were seen to be galloping off in Garden of Eden attire. Many
Boers were left in the neighbourhood of the Zeekoe River, and of
these some thirty-three were captured by Captain Dallimore and
sixteen Victorian Rifles.

The retirement becoming known to General Lyttelton, who was
directing the operations, the pursuing columns were ordered to
converge on Philippolis. General Plumer, Colonels Haig and
Thorneycroft, entering Orange River by Norval&#8217;s Pont, operated
from Springfontein to the river, while General C. Knox and
Colonel Bethune at Orange River Bridge mounted guard there,
and threatened such marauders as might retire in their direction.
On the arrival of General Plumer at Philippolis, on the 3rd, he
discovered that De Wet was fleeing to Fauresmith, and Hertzog,
with 500 men, was making for Luckhoff. He therefore, with
almost inexhaustible energy, instantly pursued the great raider,
and after a rearguard action on the 4th at Zuurfontein, reached
Fauresmith on the 5th, only to find the bird flown viâ the Petrusburg
Road. On and on then went the troops, past Petrusburg&mdash;De
Wet ever twenty-four hours ahead&mdash;till they reached Abraham
Kraal Drift on the Modder River. By this time (the 7th) the
Boer flock had dispersed over the enormous track of country with
which they are so intimate, and De Wet himself vanished, as usual,
into &#8220;thin air.&#8221; The 8th was spent in recuperation, replenishing
stores, and gaining information. On the following two days the
northerly march was continued in search of De Wet, who was
reported to have crossed the line (on the night of the 8th) on the[Pg 8]
way to Senekal. But, as the redoubtable one trekked at the rate
of some five miles a day more than the best column, General Plumer
gave him up as lost, and marched to Brandfort, and thence proceeded
under orders to Winburg. The chase had been far
from stimulating, for heavy rain had fallen, causing much inconvenience
to man and beast, and hindering transport operations.
The veldt, however, soon assumed a rich green garb, which
rendered all the English horses independent of the Commissariat
Department.

Meanwhile Colonel Haig, in conjunction, had moved to Philippolis
on the 4th, only to learn that General Plumer was on the
track of De Wet. He therefore turned his attention to Hertzog,
caught him on the 5th at Grootfontein, ten miles north-west of
Philippolis, engaged him and forced him westward. He then
waited orders at Springfontein lest a more speedy movement by
rail might be directed.

Colonel Bethune, in his position near Orange River Bridge,
spent this time in fighting and dispersing large bodies of raiders,
passing at length viâ Petrusburg, on the 6th, to the line Abraham&#8217;s
Kraal, Roodewal, on the 8th. Here he halted. An empty convoy
returning from him to Bloemfontein was attacked by the Boers,
but the escort tackled the enemy, and, with the assistance of the
Prince of Wales&#8217; Light Horse, put them to flight.

General C. Knox&#8217;s columns (Colonels Pilcher and Crewe,
moving by way of Kalabas Bridge and Koffyfontein respectively),
advanced at the same time, reaching Bloemfontein on the 10th and
11th, the astute Pilcher having captured a Boer laager by the
way. He had three killed, eleven wounded, three missing, and his
captures included twenty-four prisoners, 1500 horses, and some
cattle.

Colonel Crewe engaged in a smart tussle with Brand&#8217;s commando
at Olivenberg (south-west of Petrusburg), and reached his destination
plus five prisoners, twenty-one waggons and carts with teams
complete, and 2000 horses.

During March, Major Goold-Adams, the Deputy-Administrator
of the Orange River Colony, in whom the burghers
placed much confidence, bent his mind to the organisation
of the civil administration of the colony. Mr. Conrad Linder,
an ex-official of the late Government, was provisionally appointed
registrar. A scheme of education, based on the Canadian principle,
was drawn up, and the organisation of the civil police
taken in hand. The Imperial authorities were engaged in a
scheme for restocking the country after the war by establishing
stock depots on the Government farms in both the Transvaal
and Orange River.

LYTTELTON&#8217;S SWEEPING MOVEMENT&mdash;10th to 20th MARCH&mdash;THABANCHU
LINE

The enemy, under the direction of Fourie, in many small gangs
of from two to four hundred, still hovered in the region between
the Orange River and the Thabanchu-Ladybrand line. With
the object of sweeping them up, General Lyttelton organised a
combined northward movement which began on the 10th of March.
General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s columns, under Lieutenant-Colonels
Monro, Maxwell, and White pushed up from Aliwal North,
Colonel Hickman and Lieutenant-Colonel Thorneycroft moved out
from Bethulie and Springfontein respectively, prolonging the line
on the left to the railway, while Colonel Haig&#8217;s troops advanced
from Edenburg. Later on, as the columns swept upwards, Colonel
Bethune&#8217;s Brigade took its place in the scheme, filling the gap
between Leeuw Kop and Boesman&#8217;s Kop, with its right flank
resting on the Kaffir River. While these were marching up, the
line of posts from Bloemfontein viâ Thabanchu to the Basutoland
border was temporarily reinforced by Colonel Harley, who, with
some 200 mounted men, two guns, and a battalion, had been
detached from the portion of General Rundle&#8217;s force which was
holding Ficksburg. The road still further north, near Houtnek, was
watched by Colonel Pilcher to guard against hostile movement in
that region. The combined advance, though there was little fighting,
was decidedly successful. Heavy stocks of grain were found, and such
as could not be accommodated in the British waggons were destroyed.
Though, as usual, the Boers were dispersed in driblets and most
of the farms were deserted and the property abandoned, some
of their number got caught in the meshes of the military net.
Colonel Pilcher&#8217;s men succeeded in securing some thirty-three
Boers and about 3000 horses, and the total haul of the columns
on reaching the Thabanchu line on the 20th amounted to 70
prisoners, 4300 horses, and many trek oxen. After this date
General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s force and that of Colonel Hickman
disposed themselves between Wepener and Dewetsdorp, while
Colonel Haig was ordered to keep his eye on rambling raiders
from Cape Colony, in the region of the Caledon. Colonel
Bethune&#8217;s Brigade, marching north viâ Winburg and Ventersburg,
soon swelled the mounted force of some 7000 men, being organised
at Kroonstad (under the command of General Elliot), and
Colonel Thorneycroft, now under orders of General C. Knox, took
up a position at Brandfort. This place at that time was somewhat
harassed by meandering marauders, who were in the habit
of taking up a nightly post on a hill near by. These were[Pg 10]
surprised by the mounted infantry and burgher police, and their
number considerably thinned.



Operations in the South-East of the Orange River Colony


From all points the clearance of the Colony was pursued with
vigour. On the 24th Colonel White, in the Thabanchu region,
surprised parties of Boers, capturing six waggons, thirty-four horses,
and some cattle, and on the 25th some smart work was done by a
detachment of Lancers, Yeomanry, and Rimington&#8217;s Guides, who
drove off and dispersed various portions of Fourie&#8217;s commando
without loss to themselves. At this time Fourie, Joubert, Pretorius,
and Coetzee had been all hanging about the neighbourhood of Dewetsdorp,
and on the 25th and 26th some spirited encounters took place
between them and Captain Damant, who, with some of Rimington&#8217;s
Scouts, engaged in many perilous excursions. On the 27th General
Bruce-Hamilton, with Hickman&#8217;s column and Rimington&#8217;s Scouts,[Pg 11]
moved out with a view to clearing off the snipers that fringed the
surrounding hills. The Scouts and the Lancaster Mounted Infantry
routed the Boers from one position after another, chasing them for
miles as far as Blesbokfontein, where they dispersed. Meanwhile
on the left, near Byersberg, our troops had discovered the Boer
laager, whereupon Rimington&#8217;s Scouts rode round the position,
driving the enemy, who scampered from their concealment in the
ridges, in a south-westerly direction. Owing to the exhaustion of
the horses the pursuit could not be continued, but the troops
returned to camp with a goodly show of horses, cattle, and Cape
carts as a prize for their endurance.

Concurrently with the activities in the south-east of the Orange
River Colony, in the region of Winburg and Heilbron, good work
had been going forward. Colonel Williams and Major Pine Coffin,
working in combination, had cleared the Doornberg, a supply depot,
which, owing to De Wet&#8217;s absence, was but weakly guarded. All
stock was removed, and during the operations General P. Botha and
seven Boers were killed and many were taken prisoners. Colonel
Williams and the combined forces, reinforced by Major Massy&#8217;s
column from Edenburg, now took up a position near the Vet and
Zand Rivers, in order to catch De Wet should he break northward.
But as this leader was now in hiding, &#8220;taking a breather&#8221; for fresh
nimbleness in future, it was found unnecessary to wait there, and
the column moved on towards Heilbron. Here, accompanied by
a detachment from the garrison under Major Weston, Colonel
Williams continued his work of clearance, fighting betimes, and
capturing grain, forage, foodstuffs, and ammunition in great quantities.
Colonel Williams then moved to the north of Heilbron,
performing the same task of clearance between the Wilge River
and the main line of rail. This occupation took him well into
April, of which month more anon.

During the middle of March Lord Kitchener engaged himself
with the rearrangement of the mobile columns in the Orange River
Colony, dividing the place into four military districts. Each district
was placed under the control of a General Officer, whose duty it was
to deal with any encroachments of the enemy, to prevent the concentration
of commandos, and to clear the country of horses and
cattle, and any supplies which might stimulate the marauders to
new exertion. The southern district, bounded on the south by
the Orange River, on the north by the line Petrusburg-Ladybrand,
on the west by the Kimberley Railway, on the east by
Basutoland, was entrusted to General Lyttelton, his force including
the columns of General Bruce-Hamilton and Colonels Hickman
and Haig.[Pg 12]

The central district, bounded on the south by General Lyttelton&#8217;s
command, on the north by the Bultfontein-Winburg-Ficksburg
line, extending to Boshof, was assigned to General C. Knox, with
whom were the columns of Colonels Pilcher and Thorneycroft.

The northern district, including part of Orange River Colony
north of General C. Knox&#8217;s command, bounded on the east by the
Frankfort-Reitz-Bethlehem line, was allotted to General Elliot, whose
troops consisted of Colonel Bethune&#8217;s Cavalry Brigade, Colonel de
Lisle&#8217;s Column (withdrawn from Cape Colony), and General Broadwood&#8217;s
Brigade, composed of 7th Dragoon Guards, three battalions
Imperial Yeomanry, and six guns.



Reorganisation of Troops in the Orange River Colony


The eastern district, as before, remained in charge of General
Rundle, who, with the original 8th Division and some Mounted
Infantry and Yeomanry, protected the line Frankfort-Reitz-Bethlehem-Ficksburg.

By the end of March recruiting for General Baden-Powell&#8217;s
Police ceased. The work of training, clothing, mounting, and
equipping was carried on with all speed, and the recruits who[Pg 13]
arrived from England promptly displayed their grit and their
zeal by withstanding the assaults of the Boers, who invariably
attacked such districts as they fancied were in charge of
the &#8220;raw&#8221; element. The new-comers were no fledgelings, however,
for the members of the Constabulary were mostly gentlemen
or farmers of a high class, selected with a view to making good
colonists.

CHAPTER II

CAPE COLONY&mdash;PURSUIT OF RAIDERS&mdash;MARCH AND APRIL&mdash;CHASING
KRUITZINGER

While the pursuit of De Wet was going forward,
our troops under General Settle, and subsequently
under Colonel Douglas Haig (Colonels Henniker,
Gorringe, Grenfell, Scobell, and Crewe), worked
unceasingly against the Boer raiders who were
making themselves obstreperous in various parts of the Colony.
Pearston was occupied by seven hundred of the enemy with two guns,
who captured sixty rifles and 15,000 rounds of ammunition, in spite
of the gallant defence of the tiny garrison. The invaders, a part of
Kruitzinger&#8217;s commando, were promptly swept away by Colonel
Gorringe, who reoccupied the place on the 5th, and caused the
fugitives to be pursued. Accordingly the commando broke into
three parties and fled eastward over the railway.

About the same time one hundred raiders, under Scheepers, made
a desperate attack upon the village of Aberdeen&mdash;an attack which
happily failed owing to the smartness of the garrison. This consisted
of a portion of the 4th Derbyshire Militia, Town Guard, and twenty
men of the 9th Lancers, under Colonel Priestly. The Boers, however,
succeeded in penetrating into the town, and releasing some of
their compatriots who were in gaol. They further tried to loot the
stores, but were not given the opportunity, so promptly did the
Town Guard send them to the right-about. Colonel Parsons
arrived on the scene in the afternoon, followed, the next day, by
Colonel Scobell and some Colonials, and soon, though not without
sharp fighting, the kopjes surrounding the place were purged of
the raiders. The sharpshooters of the Imperial Yeomanry under
Major Warden were untiring in the energy of their pursuit of the
enemy from hill to hill, and the detachment of the 6th Dragoons
under Captain Anstice helped in the discomfiture of the foe. These
escaped by means of the thick bush and dongas, which afforded
them timely cover.

It was now necessary to prevent Scheepers and his Boers from
entering Murraysburg. To circumvent him, Colonel Scobell&mdash;commanding
a force of Cape Mounted Rifles, Cape Police, Diamond
Fields Horse, and Brabant&#8217;s Horse, with some guns&mdash;marched hot
foot at the rate of fifty-nine miles in less than twenty-five hours.[Pg 15]
Meanwhile Captain Colenbrander, commanding the Fighting Scouts,
moved promptly from Richmond towards Murraysburg, located
Scheepers&#8217; hordes in an adjacent village, and attacked them. The
enemy were repulsed with the loss of five of their number, while the
British party had no casualties.

Kruitzinger&#8217;s commando, continuing its depredations, seized
Carlisle Bridge with a view to pressing towards Grahamstown,
but the activity of Colonels De Lisle and Gorringe frustrated all
effort to get to the sea. The invaders gave a vast amount of
trouble, however, burning farms and securing horses, and several
encounters took place. In one of these, a few miles from Adelaide,
Captain Rennie and some of the Bedford detachment of the
Colonial Defence Corps gave an excellent account of themselves.
The Boers lost one man killed, one taken prisoner, and three
wounded, together with six horses.

The raiders were routed from Maraisburg, which was reoccupied
by the British on the 8th; but in the interval the magistrate had
had a somewhat uncomfortable experience, having been imprisoned
in his own house. The enemy reaped a certain reward of their
exertions in the form of some horses, saddles, and a revolver.
They afterwards broke into small gangs, and were hunted by
Colonel Donald&#8217;s column.

The 15th found Colonels Scobell and Colenbrander&#8217;s columns
still in pursuit of Scheepers, who, having caused some commotion
by burning the house of a British scout named Meredith, was now
hiding in the mountains around Graf Reinet. Colonel Gorringe
at the same time was dodging about the neighbourhood of Kruitzinger
(who had abandoned the hope of going south, and was now
making for Blinkwater) and keeping him perpetually on the move.
Space does not admit of a detailed account of these continuous
activities, but in an engagement on the 15th some smart work was
done by Captain Stewart, assisted by Gunner Sawyer (5th Field
Battery). While the guns were being hauled up a precipitous slope,
and most of the gunners were dismounted, they were assailed by a
furious fire from the ambushed foe. With admirable presence of
mind, Sawyer took in the situation, and, with the assistance of
Captain Stewart, unlimbered one of the guns and gave the Boers a
quid pro quo. This considerably damped their ardour, and afforded
time for the rest of the guns to come into action. The position was
finally stormed by the Albany defence force under Captain Currie.
In the engagement nine Boers were killed and nine wounded. On
the 17th, after a sharp action, the Boers, abandoning seventy
excellent horses and saddles, besides losing some forty of their
number, were driven across Elands River. Kruitzinger got across
the Elands River in safety, but, while turning an angle of the main[Pg 16]
road towards Tarkastad, on the morning of the 18th, he came
suddenly in collision with Colonel de Lisle, who, by night, was
marching&mdash;a memorable march in a terrific storm!&mdash;from Magermansberg
to Tarkastad. The British force, as surprised at the
sudden encounter as that of the Boers, promptly sprang to action,
and succeeded in shelling the rearguard, while the Mounted Infantry
started off in pursuit. From ridge to ridge went hunted and
hunters, the Irish Yeomanry, under Captain Moore, with Mounted
Infantry, under Colonel Knight, doing splendid work; but at last
the wily quarry, through some of the troops having lost direction,
succeeded in getting away through the loophole of Elands Poort.
Kruitzinger, still maintaining a north-easterly direction, was next
traced across the railway at Hemming Station on the 21st.
Scheepers, Fouché, and Malan, who had growing forces, and had
been beaten, with the loss of nine killed and seven wounded, by
Major Mullins on the 15th, were proceeding east from Marais
Siding. Other detached parties gave trouble elsewhere. Some,
on the 16th, attacked at Yeefontein, near Steymburg, a patrol of
Prince Alfred&#8217;s Guards under Major Court, but left behind them
two killed, three wounded, and three prisoners, while the Guards
lost one killed and two seriously wounded. Fighting was taking
place in various other places daily. On the 20th and 21st Colonel
Scobell&#8217;s force, increased by Colonel Grenfell&#8217;s, skirmished in the
region north of Jansenville with excellent effect. Kitchener&#8217;s
Fighting Scouts, under Captain Colenbrander, Major Mullins, and
Colonel Gorringe converged from their various positions, while the
main body made for Blaankrantz. On the 20th, by 9 A.M., a
hammer-and-tongs engagement had begun, Captain Doune&#8217;s two
guns being met by a blizzard from the foe in the surrounding
ridges. The assailants were, however, rapidly silenced and forced
to retire, the British party taking up the vacated position, and
&#8220;speeding the parting guest&#8221; with a salvo from pom-poms, rifles,
and field-guns. But the enemy could not be entirely netted, for
in ones and twos they squeezed through the bushes and made
their escape. Four, however, were left on the veldt, and four
were taken prisoners, while about one hundred sound horses came in
handy at a time when they were much in demand. The British force
lost three killed and four wounded.



MAJOR-GENERAL SIR H. H. SETTLE.

Kruitzinger at this time was being gradually pressed towards the
Orange River (which was known to be unfordable) by Colonel de
Lisle&#8217;s column, which formed part of a cordon, composed of the
columns of Colonels Gorringe, Herbert, and Major Crewe on one
side, and Colonels Crabbe, Codrington, and Henniker on the
other. Nearly all the commandos which had invaded the Colony
were retracing their sorry steps after the failure of their expedition.[Pg 17]
The fact that they had been able to keep the field so long was
attributed to the persistent way in which they avoided fighting,
and their mode of hugging the sheltering kopjes and bushes,
and never emerging from those beneficent harbours of refuge.
According to good authority, the raiders succeeded in gaining certain
recruits among the Colonial Dutch, but not nearly so many as they
had expected. They were amply supplied with food from the sympathetic
rural population, however, and received on all sides timely
information of the movements of the pursuing columns, which
enabled them to double like hares at the very moment when the
pursuers seemed about to pounce on them.

Train-wrecking continued, and of necessity the running of night
trains had to be suspended. Some of the raiders began to drive
over the less known drifts of the Orange and disappear, while
certain rebels contrived to hide themselves in the mountain fastnesses
so as to escape both the Boer bands and the British pursuit.
On the 30th of March a skirmish took place between some of
Henniker&#8217;s troops (Victorian Bushmen) and a large force of Boers,
during which the Colonials again showed their tenacity and grit.
An advanced party of four only, under a splendid fellow, Sergeant
Sandford, were set upon by the foe in the vicinity of Zuurberg. The
enemy succeeded in wounding a Bushman, who fell beneath his dead
horse, and was there pinned. His companions, under a perpetual
sleet from the marauders&#8217; Mausers, with great coolness engaged in
the immensely difficult task of moving the dead animal and drawing
out their comrade from his perilous position. They then managed to
mount the rescued man on Sergeant Sandford&#8217;s horse and all got
away in safety. Reinforcements arriving now frightened off the
Boers, who had lost four of their number.

On the whole, things were progressing wonderfully. At the
headquarters of General Baden-Powell&#8217;s Constabulary at Modderfontein
2000 more recruits were now expected to join the 1000
already on duty there. Australian and Canadian drafts were to
follow. The clerical staff of the Rand Mines&#8217; Corporation was
about to proceed from the Cape to Johannesburg, a sure sign of
approaching settlement. A warning to colonists was soon published
stating that acts of rebellion committed after April 12 would not be
tried under the Special Tribunals Act of last session, but by the old
common law, the penalties under which include capital punishment
or any term of imprisonment or fine which an ordinary court may
impose.

On the 6th of April a post, ten miles north of Aberdeen,
consisting of one hundred men of the 5th Lancers, thirty-two
Imperial Yeomanry under Captain Bretherton, and Brabant&#8217;s Horse,[Pg 18]
was assailed by a horde of 400 Boers. After fighting vigorously
from dawn till 11 A.M. the force was overpowered. Twenty-five of
the number only escaped&mdash;one was killed and six were wounded.

On the 11th, Colonel Byng surprised a laager near Smithfield,
captured thirteen tatterdemalions, who were not loth to rest, and
some horses and stores.

Colonel Haig, on the 12th, reached Rosmead and took command
of all the columns operating in the midlands, and he soon began
the hunting of Scheepers&#8217; and Malan&#8217;s commandos with his flying
columns. According to Reuter&#8217;s correspondent, the Boer forces
in the midlands at this date comprised Scheepers, with 180 men,
in the Sneeuwberg; Malan, with forty men, reported to be breaking
northward; Swanepoel, with sixty men, near New Bethseda; and
Fouché, with a force estimated variously at several hundreds, in the
Zuurberg.

On the 14th of April Colonel Gorringe returned to Pretoria after
three months&#8217; of exceptionally hard work and incessant trekking
over some of the worst country in South Africa. His Colonial
column had done on an average a daily trek of some thirty-one and
a half miles. On one occasion, when rushing to the succour of
Pearston[2] when it was overpowered by raiders, these hardy troopers,
with guns and equipments, covered seventy-four miles in forty hours,
crossing the frowning heights of Coelzeeberg by a bridle path.

General MacDonald now proceeded to England in order to take
up command of an important post on the Afghan frontier, and
General Fitzroy Hart succeeded him in command of the 3rd Brigade.
Sir Alfred Milner made preparations to go home on leave.

On the 24th the Dordrecht Volunteer Guard and Wodehouse&#8217;s
Yeomanry gave an excellent account of themselves. They were
attacking raiders for the most part of the day, and sent the Dutchmen
to the right-about, capturing their horses and forcing them to
make good their escape on Shanks&#8217; pony.

On the 29th Major Du Moulin&#8217;s column, accompanied by Lovat&#8217;s
Scouts under Major Murray, arrived at Aliwal North from Orange
River Colony, bringing with it 30 prisoners, 60,000 sheep, 6000
head of cattle, 100 waggons, 800 refugees, and 300 horses.

CHAPTER III

THE OPERATIONS OF GENERAL FRENCH IN THE EASTERN
TRANSVAAL, FROM 27th JANUARY to 16th APRIL 1901

It may be remembered that at the close of 1900 the Boer
chiefs, De Wet and Botha, had invented a concerted scheme
of some magnitude. They had arranged that Hertzog should
enter Cape Colony and proceed to Lambert&#8217;s Bay to meet
a ship which was said to be bringing from Europe mercenaries,
guns, and ammunition. De Wet was to follow south viâ
De Aar, join hands with Hertzog, and together, with renewed
munitions of war and a tail of rebels at their heels, attack Cape
Town. General Botha at the same time was to keep the British
occupied in the Eastern Transvaal and prevent them drawing off
troops to the south, and, so soon as the plans of De Wet and
Hertzog were being carried out, he was to enter Natal with a
picked force of 5000 mounted men and make for Durban.

Having seen how the parent scheme, the invasion of the Cape
Colony, was frustrated, it is necessary to turn to scheme two, and
follow General French in the remarkable operations which defeated
Botha&#8217;s designs. A considerable concentration of Boers, under the
Commandants Louis Botha, Smuts, Spruyt, and Christian Botha, had
taken place in Ermelo, Carolina, and Bethel, which districts constituted
depôts for the supply of the enemy&#8217;s forces. The
Commander-in-chief therefore decided to sweep the country
between the Delagoa and Natal Railway lines, from Johannesburg
to the Swazi and Zulu frontiers, and to clear it of supplies and
families. With this object in view, on the 28th of January the following
columns were concentrated from the meridian of Springs:
Major-General Paget, Brigadier Alderson, Colonel E. Knox (18th
Hussars), Lieutenant-Colonel Allenby (6th Dragoons), Lieutenant-Colonel
Pulteney (Scots Guards), and Brigadier-General Dartnell
(Commandant of Volunteers, Natal).

The troops&mdash;the southern columns under the command of
Lieutenant-General Sir John French&mdash;were to form a north and
south line between the railway, and thus drive the enemy before
them to Ermelo. They were commanded from north to south in
the order shown above. While this line was advancing, Lieutenant-Colonel
Campbell and Lieutenant-Colonel Spens, moving a march
south from Middelburg and Wonderfontein, were to act as side[Pg 20]
stops, while Major-General Smith-Dorrien, with a force 3000
strong, was to advance from Belfast viâ Carolina to Lake Chrissie,
for the purpose of preventing the Boers from breaking north-east.
A weak column, under Lieutenant-Colonel Colville (Rifle
Brigade), was to work south of Colonel Dartnell to cover the
movement of supplies, first from Greylingstad to the north, and
then from Standerton to Ermelo.



Map showing the Operations and Dispositions of Troops in the
Eastern Transvaal


Eventually, owing to the movements of De Wet, General Paget
was recalled from this sphere of action, and his place was taken
by Colonel Campbell. General Alderson&#8217;s and Knox&#8217;s lines of
advance were slightly diverted to the north, and the line between
them was filled by Lieutenant-Colonel Pulteney, who originally was
to have been held in reserve.

The first two marches took the western troops to a line north[Pg 21]
of Greylingstad to Vangatfontein, in the valley of the Wilge River,
where there was a two days&#8217; halt till the 31st. The march was
not without excitement, for Beyers was found to be ensconced in
a strong and extended position stretching north and south, and
covering the approach to the valley of the Wilge River. Bushman&#8217;s
Kop, fourteen miles east of Springs, was strongly held,
and the advanced troops of Knox and Allenby were assailed with
fierce artillery from the surrounding heights. But when Allenby&#8217;s
mounted men had wheeled round the south of the position, the
Boers thought it high time to retreat, leaving behind them two
dead. This was on the 29th. Two days were spent in receiving
supplies from Greylingstad and sending the emptied waggons
full of Boer families to the rail and clearing the country of
supplies.

The Boers, holding a chain of sloping hills some twenty-three
miles west of Bethal, were again encountered on the 1st of February.
While Colonel Rimington (commanding Colonel Pulteney&#8217;s mounted
troops) worked round the north of the position, Colonel Allenby
and the rest of Pulteney&#8217;s troops held them in front. But the wily
Dutchmen, now rapidly becoming demoralised, instantly they found
their flank threatened, were off to the east before they could be
cut off. The commanders on the right had also met with slight
opposition.

The operations of the 2nd of February much resembled those of
the previous day, for some 2000 Boers, who had planted themselves
about ten miles west of Bethal, ceased their opposition to Colonel
Allenby, when they found Pulteney&#8217;s cavalry sweeping round to
their north, and they made such haste to depart that they left
behind them an English 15-pounder gun, with damaged breech.
The village of Bethal was reached by General French on the 4th,
all Boers, save a few women and children, having fled. The troops
were now hurriedly pushing forward with a view to surrounding
Ermelo. Their position was as follows: Allenby on the south-east;
Dartnell on the south and south-west; Pulteney on the
west; Knox on the north-west; Anderson and Campbell on the
north; and Smith-Dorrien on the north-east and east. The
enemy, seeing security at this place thus threatened, split into two
factions. Louis Botha, with a following of some 3000 men,
scurried to the north toward Komati without impediment, in
the form of families and stock, while the rest, protecting their
waggons, retreated toward Piet Retief. Botha, while scurrying
as aforesaid, discovered on the 5th that Smith-Dorrien&#8217;s force,
about 3000 strong (with a big convoy for his own, Campbell&#8217;s, and
Alderson&#8217;s columns), had reached Bothwell, north of Lake Chrissie.
Here was a fine chance! and the Boer leader speedily availed[Pg 22]
himself of it. He determined to attack the British column before
the troops of Campbell and Alderson, moving from the west, could
get in touch with it. Accordingly, dividing his force into three, and
rising betimes, in the thick mists of daybreak, on the 6th, he delivered
a vigorous semicircular attack upon the camp. This was successfully
repulsed.

The Boers lost heavily, General Spruyt and several field-cornets
being among the slain. The British had one officer and twenty-three
men killed, three officers and fifty-two men wounded. Some
300 horses were killed or stampeded during the surprise. The
Boers, owing to the heavy fog of the morning, got away to the north.
At the moment Botha was making his attack on the camp, the
officer bearing orders from General French for General Smith-Dorrien,
after an exciting and hazardous ride, reached Bothwell.
Owing to the fight these orders&mdash;to move on the 6th to a position
E.N.E. of Ermelo&mdash;could then not be executed. General Smith-Dorrien
therefore remained at Bothwell.

Meanwhile, in the south, fighting went forward. Colonel Allenby,
who had been rapidly pushing east, came on the enemy&#8217;s rearguard,
which was occupying a ridge south of Ermelo. With infantry and
artillery, and supported by Dartnell&#8217;s Brigade, he engaged them,
holding them on the west while the mounted troops endeavoured
to wheel round the southern flank and surround them. But the
Boers, who had had a long start, nimbly made good their escape
over the Vaal at Witpunt before Allenby&#8217;s troops could possibly
reach that point, and consequently the brilliant attempt to cut off
their retreat proved a failure. Ermelo was occupied on the 6th,
and thus the first phase of the operations was accomplished.

It was now necessary to sweep the country from Ermelo to
the Swazi frontier, which movement occupied from the 9th to
the 16th of February. To this end the flanks were immediately
opened out again, and the line Bothwell-Ermelo-Amersfoort taken.
From this line the force wheeled half-right, the left flank (rationed
on reduced scale up to the 20th) beginning to extend east towards
Swaziland on the 9th.

The whole force was now so ordered as to form a complete
cordon for the purpose of hemming in the enemy and their belongings
in the south-eastern corner of the Transvaal. The troops
were here to converge on Amsterdam and Piet Retief from north
and south-west, and, with the escort to the convoy from Utrecht,
were to form a line from Utrecht and the Natal frontier to the
Swazi frontier north of Piet Retief. On the 9th General Smith-Dorrien,
moving east-north-east, encountered the Boers, and
Colonel Mackenzie and his gallant men, with the assistance of[Pg 23]
the 2nd Imperial Light Horse, succeeded in capturing a convoy
and putting twenty-one Boers hors de combat by a brilliant charge.

Affairs were somewhat hampered by lack of supplies, but at
last (on the 10th) a convoy from Standerton having come in, the
right wing (Dartnell and Allenby) were provided for. On the
following day General French moved on, while Colville&#8217;s emptied
waggons started back with a pathetic load of Boer families and
prisoners and British sick.



Position of Forces Around Ermelo


On the 12th, the Boers offered some opposition to the advancing
troops of Pulteney and Allenby, and near Klipfontein they, for a
wonder, made a stand, and gave Colonel Rimington and the
Inniskilling Dragoons an opportunity for smart work. A dashing
charge, magnificently led, cleared the ground, and five dead Boers
and some wounded were left to tell the tale of the encounter.

On the 13th Dartnell, who had taken up a position at Amersfoort,
moved from thence steadily in line with the whole force,
which proceeded with insignificant opposition to clear away stock
and destroy supplies.[Pg 24]

Amsterdam was occupied by Smith-Dorrien on the 14th, and
on the 16th General French, with the troops of Knox and Pulteney,
made his entry into Piet Retief, where the landdrost at once surrendered.
Rains had now made the already almost impassable
country into one mighty morass, and the mists, fogs, and torrents
rendered the position of the troops a critical one. Great consternation
prevailed as to the fate of Colonel Burn-Murdoch, on whom all hopes
were set. He had been charged by the General Officer Commanding
in Natal with the duty of conveying, from Utrecht, food to the
force, and had apparently got lost in the mists and bog, for not
a sign of his anxiously awaited convoy could be discovered. This
convoy had left Newcastle on the 12th, but it was not till the 27th
that its welcome supplies reached the famishing troops, who, from
the 20th, had had to subsist entirely on the country, while the
horses ate grass only. The rivers had by this time become raging
torrents, and the roads, quagmires. The Boer farms had already been
cleared out, and only by offering a sovereign for a 200-lb. bag of
mealies could the natives be prevailed upon to unearth their buried
treasure. The ration during this lean period sounds distinctly
unpleasing: three-quarters of a pound of mealie meal (ground in the
steam mill at Piet Retief), and an ounce of mealie coffee (an infusion
of the same meal roasted and ground), made the sole variation to a
diet of saltless meat. The men nevertheless maintained their
health and cheeriness, their constant hauls conducing much to
their enlivenment, and the number in hospital was abnormally
low. Still there was vast annoyance in the fact that they were
unable to be up and doing.

A new line of supply was opened on the 28th, when Colonel
Bullock started from Volkrust to Piet Retief with a convoy of
ninety-one waggons. Though this reached its destination in safety
on the 5th of March, it was not till he returned with a second
load, on the 21st of March, that sufficient oats could reach Piet
Retief to enable the force to move. Despite the inconvenience of
delay a tremendous amount of work was carried on, the troops
pushing continually into Swaziland and tackling Boers who
struggled to slip through the British line, and many captures
were made both north and south of the border. The surrounding
country was thoroughly cleared, and many guns and much ammunition
were brought to light. The Engineers also worked like
Trojans, improving the roads and bridging the numerous, now
swollen, rivers and spruits that abounded in the district. As an
instance of the force of the unceasing floods between the 6th and
13th of March, it may be mentioned that the Assegai, which is
normally fordable, averaged 12 feet in depth, and on the 12th
rose to 18 feet.



A NIGHT ATTACK: DEFENDING A TRAIN DERAILED BY THE BOERS

Drawing by Frank Dadd, R.I.


[Pg 25]

The position of the forces on the 1st of March stood thus:&mdash;

General Smith-Dorrien (who had moved south from Amsterdam
on the 25th of February) was now eight miles north of Piet Retief,
while his mounted troops, under Colonel Henry, had penetrated into
Swaziland. At Piet Retief was General French, with Colonels
Knox and Pulteney, some of whose mounted troops, under Colonel
Rimington, were covering the road south-west of Luneberg as far
as Schihoek, whence Colonel Burn-Murdoch carried on the line to
Utrecht. Colonels Campbell and Allenby were twelve and seventeen
miles south-east of Piet Retief respectively, Colonel Alderson
was at Marienthal, and General Dartnell at Intombi River. Colonel
Bullock was at Wakkerstroom.

Soon the Utrecht-Luneberg line was abandoned as a line of
supply, and the troops were based on Utrecht. On the 18th of
March General Dartnell occupied the village of Paul Pietersburg,
and Colonel Rimington seized the stone bridge over the Pivaan
River running south of it, while Colonel Alderson built a pontoon
bridge over the Pongola River at Yagd Drift.

On the 21st General French, with Colonels Knox and Pulteney,
moved on, leaving General Smith-Dorrien in command north of
the Pongola. Here the latter, with the columns of Colonels
Campbell and Allenby, held a line from Langdraai Drift, in the
Lower Pongolo, by Platnek, Mahamba, Zaudbauk, and Piet Retief,
to Yagd Drift, so as to prevent Boers from breaking north and
north-west.

Colonel Knox now set about clearing the country to the east,
between the Pivaan and Pongola Rivers, to prevent the Boers
breaking back south of the Pongola, while General French, continuing
his march with the columns of General Dartnell and
Colonel Pulteney, moved on Vryheid, where he established his
headquarters on the 25th of March. Here General Hildyard had
accumulated a large reserve of supplies for the whole force, thus
materially facilitating the progress of further operations.

The movement to clear the angle between the Swazi and Zulu
frontiers began on the 27th of March and terminated on the 15th of
April. General Dartnell, with ten days&#8217; supplies, moved east from
Vryheid, with Pulteney east-south-east on his right rear, and Alderson
(who started two days later from some four miles south of the
Pivaan Bridge) on his left rear. Colonel Pulteney speedily came in
contact with Grobelaar&#8217;s commando, drove it north, where it came
in collision with General Dartnell, who, after some skirmishing,
killed and wounded some twenty Boers. The General was now
forced to push on with mounted troops and a few guns only, for the
country was impassable for wheeled transport, and therefore it had
to be left behind in charge of the infantry. He formed a depôt[Pg 26]
some thirty miles east-south-east of Vryheid, while Colonel Alderson
formed his about twenty-five miles north-east of Vryheid.

More fighting took place on the 31st between the Boers and
General Dartnell some twelve miles north of his depôt, in which
engagement four Boers were slain, ten taken prisoners, and waggons,
cattle, and sheep were captured. Their pom-pom&mdash;previously destroyed
to prevent it being of service to us&mdash;was thrown over a
precipice by the flying foe. The troops moving on east through the
low-lying bush veldt came on more Boers on the 2nd, engaged them,
cleared the country, returned to Toovernsaarsrust on the 4th, and
moved on the 5th and 6th to Vryheid, where General Dartnell for
five days took a well-earned rest.

Colonel Alderson had meanwhile taken a prodigious share in the
work. He had sped hot foot after a party of Boers that had broken
northwards, caught them on the 3rd near the junction of the Pivaan
and Pongola Rivers, and succeeded in effecting the capture of their
cattle, waggons, and mules. On the following day he rested at
Nooitgadacht, a place six miles east of Vryheid. He then (on the
6th) passed Vryheid, and proceeded, in three columns, to sweep the
country south of that place, while General Dartnell acted as a stop
on the line Vryheid-Toovernsaarsrust. By the 13th Colonel Alderson
had fulfilled his mission, and &#8220;accomplished all that was feasible.&#8221;
He then returned to Vryheid, and the difficult and fatiguing operations
were practically concluded.

The various columns now left from this part of the theatre of
war in the following order: Colonel Pulteney, being urgently
needed by the Commander-in-Chief for use in the north of Middelburg,
left Vryheid on the 1st, and entrained from Glencoe on the 4th.
General Dartnell on the 12th, from Vryheid, marched viâ Newcastle
to Volkrust, there to rest and refit. General Alderson
passed through Vryheid on the 13th, reaching the rail at Glencoe
on the 16th, and General Smith-Dorrien with his own, Colonel
Campbell&#8217;s, and Colonel Allenby&#8217;s columns, marched north from
Piet Retief on the 14th towards the Delagoa Railway.

The results of the prodigious energy of General French&#8217;s force
during the two and a half months, from the 27th of January to the
16th of April, were amazing. These zealous and untiring warriors
had entirely swept the country between the Delagoa and Natal
railway lines, from Johannesburg to the Swazi and Zulu frontiers,
travelling across the most difficult country, rendered doubly so by
tempest and flood, and living almost on starvation fare.

Nevertheless 1332 Boers had been placed hors de combat (369
killed and wounded, 233 taken prisoners, 730 surrendered), while
an incalculable amount of supplies had been removed or destroyed,
including 11 guns, 1280 rifles, 218,249 rounds of ammunition,[Pg 27]
2281 waggons and carts, and 272,752 head of stock (7303 horses,
377 mules, 7653 trek oxen, 42,328 cattle, and 215,089 sheep).
How much farther the work might have proved successful had it
not been for the negotiations between Botha and the Commander-in-Chief
which took place during the movement, cannot be stated.
Certain it is that General French was much hampered by the palaver
which ended in air, for Botha&#8217;s ruse or so-called negotiations enabled
the Boers to slip northwards unmolested. As the pacific nature of
the negotiations has been the subject of much comment, it is as well
to append the origin and substance of them.

On February 23 a telegram was received by Sir Alfred Milner
from the Commander-in-Chief, Pretoria, which stated, under date of
the 22nd February, that Mrs. Botha had come back from meeting
her husband, bringing from him an answer to a verbal message from
the Commander-in-Chief, that if he desired it, he (General Botha)
would meet him as to the means of bringing the war to an end, but
on the express understanding that the question of the independence
of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony should not be discussed
in any way. The meeting would probably take place at Middelburg.

This telegram was sent to Mr. Chamberlain, who replied,
February 23:&mdash;

&#8220;I am glad to hear of Botha&#8217;s desire to treat, and I hope that it is genuine.
He will find us most anxious, in that case, to meet him on all points affecting
individual position. We have already made clear the policy we intend to
pursue as to future government.&#8221;

On March 1 Lord Kitchener telegraphed:&mdash;

&#8220;I have had a long interview with Botha, who showed very good feeling,
and seemed anxious to bring about peace. He asked for information on a
number of subjects which he said that he should submit to his Government and
people, and if they agreed he should visit Orange River Colony and get them
to agree. They should all then hand in their arms and finish the war. He
told me that they could go on for some time, and that he was not sure of being
able to bring about peace without independence. He tried very hard for some
kind of independence, but I declined to discuss such a point, and said that a
modified form of independence would be most dangerous and likely to lead to
war in the future.&#8221;

Lord Kitchener then detailed the points upon which Botha
required information. These points were noted by the Commander-in-Chief,
and his suggestions were embodied in a telegram of
March 3 from Sir Alfred Milner to Mr. Chamberlain. The Colonial
Secretary replied on March 6, suggesting modifications which
his Majesty&#8217;s Government desired should be made in the letter to
Botha. A telegram from Sir Alfred Milner of March 9 reported
that he and Lord Kitchener were both opposed to the assistance to[Pg 28]
burghers being limited to loans, but that the amended message was
sent to the Commandant on March 7.

Lord Kitchener, in a telegram to Mr. Brodrick on March 20,
detailed the terms of his letter to Commandant Botha:&mdash;

&#8220;With reference to our conversation at Middelburg on 28th February,
I have the honour to inform you that in the event of a general and complete
cessation of hostilities and the surrender of all rifles, ammunition, cannon, and
other munitions of war in the hands of the burghers or in Government depôts
or elsewhere, his Majesty&#8217;s Government is prepared to adopt the following
measures:&mdash;

&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Government will at once grant an amnesty in the Transvaal
and Orange River Colonies for all bona fide acts of war committed during the
recent hostilities. British subjects belonging to Natal and Cape Colony, while
they will not be compelled to return to those colonies, will, if they do so, be
liable to be dealt with by the law of those colonies, specially passed to meet
the circumstances arising out of the present war. As you are doubtless aware,
the special law in the Cape Colony has greatly mitigated the ordinary
penalties for high treason in the present cases.

&#8220;All prisoners of war now in St. Helena, Ceylon, or elsewhere will, on the
completion of the surrender, be brought back to their country as quickly as
arrangements can be made for their transport.

&#8220;At the earliest practicable date military administration will cease and will
be replaced by civil administration in the form of Crown Colony Government.
There will therefore be, in the first instance, in each of the new Colonies a
Governor and an Executive Council, consisting of a certain number of official
members, to whom a nominated unofficial element will be added. But it is the
desire of his Majesty&#8217;s Government, as soon as circumstances permit, to
introduce a representative element, and ultimately to concede to the new
Colonies the privilege of self-government. Moreover, on the cessation of
hostilities a High Court will be established in each of the new Colonies to
administer the law of the land, and this court will be independent of the
Executive.

&#8220;Church property, public trusts, and orphans&#8217; funds will be respected.
Both the English and Dutch languages will be used and taught in public
schools where parents of the children desire it, and allowed in Courts of Law.

&#8220;As regards the debts of the late Republican Governments, his Majesty&#8217;s
Government cannot undertake any liability. It is, however, prepared, as an
act of grace, to set aside a sum not exceeding £1,000,000 to repay inhabitants
of the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies for goods requisitioned from them
by the late Republican Governments or, subsequent to annexation, by commandants
in the field being in a position to enforce such requisitions. But
such claims will have to be established to the satisfaction of a Judge or Judicial
Commission appointed by the Government to investigate and assess them, and
if exceeding in the aggregate £1,000,000, they will be liable to reduction
pro rata.

&#8220;I also beg to inform your Honour that the new Government will take into
immediate consideration the possibility of assisting by loan the occupants of
farms who will take the oath of allegiance to repair any injury sustained by
destruction of buildings or loss of stock during the war, and that no special
war tax will be imposed on farmers to defray the expense of the war.

&#8220;When burghers require the protection of firearms such will be allowed to[Pg 29]
them by licence and on due registration, provided they take the oath of
allegiance. Licences also will be issued for sporting rifles, guns, &amp;c., but
military firearms will only be allowed for means of protection.

&#8220;As regards the extension of the franchise to Kaffirs in the Transvaal and
Orange River Colony, it is not the intention of his Majesty&#8217;s Government to
give such franchise before representative government is granted to these
Colonies, and if then given, it will be so limited as to secure the just predominance
of the white races. The legal position of coloured persons will,
however, be similar to that which they hold in Cape Colony.

&#8220;In conclusion, I must inform your Honour that if the terms now offered
are not accepted after a reasonable delay for consideration, they must be
regarded as cancelled.&#8221;

To this Botha replied:&mdash;

&#8220;I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Excellency&#8217;s letter
stating what steps your Excellency&#8217;s Government is prepared to take in the
event of a general and total cessation of hostilities. I have advised my
Government of your Excellency&#8217;s said letter; but, after the mutual exchange of
views at our interview at Middelburg on 28th February last, it will certainly
not surprise your Excellency to know that I do not feel disposed to recommend
that the terms of the said letter shall have the earnest consideration of my
Government. I may add, also, that my Government and my chief officers here
entirely agree with my views.&#8221;

Botha&#8217;s private opinions are to be found in an address to the
burghers, which was subsequently discovered among papers captured
by Sir Bindon Blood at Roos Senekal. He said:&mdash;

&#8220;The spirit of Lord Kitchener&#8217;s letter makes it very plain to you all that
the British Government desires nothing else but the destruction of our Afrikander
people, and acceptance of the terms contained therein is absolutely out
of the question. Virtually, the letter contains nothing more, but rather less,
than what the British Government will be obliged to do should our cause go
wrong. Notice that they will give us a Legislative Council consisting of their
own officials and members nominated by themselves. The voice of the people
is thus totally unrecognised.... The more we are aggrieved by the enemy
the more steadfastly we ought to stand for our good and lawful rights. Let
us, as Daniel in the lions&#8217; den, place our trust in God alone, for in His time
and in His way He will certainly give us deliverance.&#8221;

On April 19th Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the High Commissioner
as follows:&mdash;

&#8220;As our terms have been refused by Botha, they are of course withdrawn,
and his Majesty&#8217;s Government do not think it advisable that you or Kitchener
should reopen negotiations. Should Botha or other leaders make any further
suggestions of their own accord Kitchener will, of course, forward them to us
without expressing any opinion upon them to those who make them. But
neither Mrs. Botha nor any one else should be led to suppose that we could
consider terms more favourable to the Boers than those which have been
rejected. The Secretary of State for War will send a copy of this to
Kitchener.&#8221;[Pg 30]

That the negotiations were looked upon with disfavour by all
parties concerned is undoubted. A letter written by one of Reuter&#8217;s
correspondents expresses the very general view taken by the British
in the field:&mdash;

&#8220;The Parliamentary paper giving particulars of the peace negotiations has
been eagerly read by all ranks of the Army. It is impossible to shut one&#8217;s
eyes to the fact that the British forces now operating in South Africa are
profoundly dissatisfied with them. On all hands, and from all ranks, the same
complaint is heard, that they are too lenient, and are not calculated to bring
permanent peace to South Africa. There is no bitterness against the Boers;
that feeling has long ago died out, but when the men came to read the terms
of peace proposed by the British Government, they remembered their dead
comrades whose graves mark the line of march, and asked themselves: &#8216;Is it
for this that they have died?&#8217; The Army, which has undergone countless
hardships and dangers, is less articulate than a municipal body in England, but
surely it should have its say. The regular Army, perhaps, is expected not to
think or to express its thought about politics, but to fight, and only to fight;
but the South Africans, the Canadians, and the Australians will give expression
to their sentiments. They declare that in the terms of peace offered by the
British Government there are all the elements of future rebellion and unrest.
&#8216;Give the Boers,&#8217; they say, &#8216;even more than we have promised them, but let it
be as a free gift after surrender, and not as a condition of surrender.&#8217;
Curiously enough, these sentiments are shared entirely by the Burghers who
have surrendered, and who are only waiting for the end of hostilities to take
their places as British subjects, determined to do their utmost for the peaceful
development of a country which, under British rule, will be as much theirs
as anybody else&#8217;s. One of them, speaking to me the other day, put forward
his view of the case. &#8216;If the British grant terms to those burghers now under
arms,&#8217; he said, &#8216;they at once establish for all time a confession of weakness.
We shall tell each other and our children that we have never been beaten, and,
as we increase in numbers, the tales of former prowess and invincibility will
perpetuate a national feeling. If you allow burghers to carry rifles after
surrender you will have petty revolts for the next ten years. There is no
need of a Mauser or a Lee-Metford to defend the burgher against the native.
Give him a shot-gun or a revolver, and no native will molest him. The
demand for the retention of arms is nothing more nor less than the result of a
determination on the part of the Boers to use them against you at the very
slightest provocation. To give them rifles is suicidal.&#8217;&#8221;

[Pg 31]

CHAPTER IV

IN THE WESTERN TRANSVAAL&mdash;JANUARY TO MAY

In the early part of the year we find Lord Methuen busily
occupied in dealing with an incursion of the enemy from
the south-western part of the Transvaal into Griqualand.
Operating from Vryburg and Taungs, he, with his mobile
columns, performed an incalculable amount of work. He
withdrew the garrison from Schweitzer Reneke, routed the Boers
that were surrounding Daniel&#8217;s Knil, provisioned the garrison of
Kuruman, and eventually hunted De Villiers&#8217; hordes into the
Transvaal. That done, he marched in the beginning of February,
viâ Wolmaranstad, to Klerksdorp, following up and dispersing
the aforesaid hordes as he went. At Hartebeestefontein he came
very violently into collision with them, and though they made
a stout effort to resist his advance, he forced them to give way.
His captures during these proceedings amounted to forty prisoners
and many thousand head of stock. Lord Methuen reached Klerksdorp
on the 19th of February and went on to Potchefstroom, where
he commenced co-operating with the sweeping movements of
Generals Babington and Cunningham. These officers, on General
French&#8217;s departure from the western side of the Transvaal, held a
line from Oliphant&#8217;s Nek to Ventersdorp and Potchefstroom, and
kept an eye on the machinations of Delarey and other malcontents
in these regions. In spite of their vigilance a concentration
was effected in the Gatsrand on the 31st, and a small force
at Modderfontein was overwhelmed by superior numbers before
General Cunningham could come to its relief. Two more small
columns, the one under Colonel Shekleton, South Lancashire Regiment,
the other under Colonel Benson, R.A., were now placed at the
disposal of General Cunningham to help in the work of clearing the
ground between the western railway line and the Vaal.

At the end of February Lord Methuen&#8217;s force, together with the
small column under Colonel Benson, was actively engaged in hunting
bands of marauders in the triangle&mdash;Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom,
Ventersdorp. On the 4th of March the troops marched from Klerksdorp
towards Hoopstad, thence to withdraw the garrison. En route
they, having left their convoy under strong escort on the road to
Commando Drift, made a night descent on Wolmaranstad with the[Pg 32]
intention of liberating the British and Boer State prisoners who
were known to be detained there. But at dawn when they arrived
they discovered that the place was deserted! The sole, though not
unimportant, result of their exertions was the capture of the Landdrost,
Pearson, a person who had rendered himself notorious in
connection with the cases of Messrs. M&#8217;Lachlan and Boyd, who
with three burghers were shot at Wolmaranstad. The particulars of
the dastardly murder of these men must be recorded, as they serve
to show the innate brutality of the Boers, which in the earlier part of
the war had been suppressed in hope to seduce the sympathy of the
Powers. The news of the execution of five British subjects&mdash;so-called
rebels&mdash;by Delarey&#8217;s commando was brought to Klerksdorp
by Mrs. M&#8217;Lachlan, whose husband, father, and brother-in-law
had been among the victims. Most of them were burghers who
had surrendered or left the country prior to the war, while the others
were alleged to have taken up arms. The man Boyd, a British
subject, had been detained in jail since July 1900 by the Landdrost,
who induced him, with two others, to indite a message to the English
praying them to come to their rescue. This was afterwards made
the plea for sentencing the three to death. Among others sentenced
were two burghers named Theunissen, well-known farmers of
Klerksdorp, who had surrendered with General Andreas Cronje&#8217;s
commando in June, and had taken the oath of neutrality and refused
to break it. Mrs. M&#8217;Lachlan, the daughter of the elder Theunissen,
gave an account of her loss, narrating how she had taken coffins to the
place of execution to bury the bodies of her father, brother, and husband,
to whom she had been married only two years, while another lady
made the following statement:&mdash;&#8220;The Boers have forty of our men
prisoners there. Eight or ten have been condemned to be shot.
They were tried by the late Landdrost of Klerksdorp, a man named
Heethling, in conjunction with other members of the Court. The
sentences were confirmed by Generals Smuts and Delarey, who sent
men to carry them out. The four who were shot were Mr. Theunissen,
his son, his son-in-law, Mr. M&#8217;Lachlan, and Mr. Boyd. From first
to last they were most brutally treated. The execution was a sad
spectacle. The prisoners, on being taken out of jail, grasped one
another&#8217;s hands. They were placed in a row and shot down one by
one. Mr. Boyd received three bullets, but was still alive when put
into the grave. The Boers then fired again, and all was over. It
was nearly being my husband&#8217;s fate, but, thank God, he escaped.
Mr. George Savage was also condemned to be shot, but he has been
insane since his trial. His wife has gone with Mrs. Pienaar to try
to get the sentence commuted. Mrs. Pienaar being with her may
possibly have some influence.&#8221;

From all accounts it appeared that the man Pearson, who was[Pg 33]
captured by Lord Methuen, was prime actor in the barbarous drama,
and, handcuffed, he was removed to await his trial.



CECIL J. RHODES AT GROOTE SCHUUR.

A Memory.

From &#8220;War Impressions&#8221; by Mortimer Menpes, by arrangement with Messrs A. &amp; C. Black.


The column while returning to the convoy was attacked by a
commando of some 400, under Du Tot and Potgeiter, from the hills,
who paid for their presumption by losing eleven killed and wounded
to our seven&mdash;a price seldom paid by these bands of &#8220;artful
dodgers.&#8221; Finding the river impassable at Commando Drift, the
troops marched along the right bank of the Vaal in hopes to cross
lower down. The drifts, Bloemhof and Christiana, were also not
negotiable, and finally the force moved to Fourteen Streams and
crossed by the railway bridge. Brigadier-General the Earl of
Errol now assumed command of the force, as Lord Methuen was
placed on the sick list.

Here it must be noted, that after the departure of Lord Methuen
for Hoopstad, Colonel Benson continued to operate to the south of
the railway in the Gatsrand, and along the right bank of the Vaal.
His small yet active column was ever in touch with the Boers, and
many of them had hair-breadth escapes, yet, in spite of all, they
secured many prisoners, 1090 head of cattle, and forty-five waggons.
On the 4th of April Colonel Benson left his troops to be merged
into the force of General Dixon (who had succeeded General
Cunningham in command of the column south of the Magaliesberg),
while he assumed a more important command on the eastern line.

To return to Lord Methuen&#8217;s force. As the Hoopstad garrison
had yet to be withdrawn, the troops now under Lord Errol started
thither on the 28th of March, a simultaneous movement being made by
a mobile column from Kimberley. The object of the expedition was
achieved and the garrison removed to Warrenton by the 7th of
April, but not without a skirmish on the way with Badenhorst&#8217;s
commando at Steenbokpan. Lord Methuen soon recovered, and
on the 23rd of April, resuming command, transferred his force to
Mafeking in order to move early in May on Lichtenburg.

This town, at the beginning of March, had been an object of
attention to Delarey, Smuts, Celliers, and Vermaas and their bands.
The garrison (200 Yeomanry, 300 1st Northumberland Fusiliers,
and two guns) commanded by Colonel C. G. Money, had been
vigorously attacked on the 3rd, the assault beginning at 3 A.M. and
continuing with unabated vigour till midnight. The enemy,
numbering some 1500, with one gun, found that there were two
sides in the game of annoyance, and that the defenders were
ready and willing to give as much as they got. Indeed they
gave considerably more, for while our casualties amounted to two
officers (Major W. Fletcher and Second-Lieutenant H. D. Hall)
and fourteen men killed, and twenty-six wounded, the Boers left
behind them sixty killed and wounded and seven prisoners.[Pg 34]

General Babington now marched to the rescue from the north-west
of Krugersdorp viâ Ventersdorp. Here Colonel Shekleton
was to have met him with supplies, but owing to the terrific
weather, and the difficulty of moving wheeled transport in an
incessant deluge, the arrangements of both forces were delayed
and considerable inconvenience caused, and General Babington
was unable to reach Lichtenburg till the 17th. By this time the
bands of Delarey had, of course, made good their escape. But they
were hunted to Hartebeestefontein and deprived of many waggons
and teams, while sixty-two prisoners were netted, and eight killed.

Delarey, with 500 men and three guns, on the 22nd attacked a
strong patrol of the 1st Imperial Light Horse under Major Briggs
at Geduld. The Boers made a sudden swoop on the party and
endeavoured to cut them in two, but this gallant 200, with a solitary
&#8220;pom-pom,&#8221; fought doggedly for two and a half hours till reinforcements
could arrive, when they defeated the Dutchmen absolutely,
killing eleven and wounding thirteen. Unfortunately two gallant
officers were lost. Commandant Venter was among the Boer slain,
and Field-Cornet Wolmarans among the wounded. The report of
an eye-witness was as follows:&mdash;

&#8220;The Imperial Light Horse made another fine performance some
time ago, on two successive days, when they knocked the stuffing
out of Delarey near Klerksdorp. Delarey tackled a hundred and
sixty men of the 1st Light Horse and a &#8220;pom-pom&#8221; with eight
hundred men. Our fellows had a warm time of it, but being well
handled by Major Briggs beat off the attack. The following day,
reinforcements having come up, they pushed forward, and after a
stiff engagement utterly routed Delarey, taking ten guns and his
convoy, besides killing and wounding a hundred and sixty-seven
Boers and taking a lot of prisoners. This was done almost entirely
by Volunteers and the Suffolks. The Boers in the first fight charged
right through the Imperial Light Horse, whose ammunition was
exhausted, but were driven back by the fire of about twenty-five
men who were holding the horses.&#8221;

General Babington on the 22nd commenced the task of sweeping
the enemy to the north, while Colonel Shekleton operated against
Delarey&#8217;s right flank. With mounted troops and guns only the
commander dashed after the Boers and overtook their rearguard,
which was driven in near Ventersdorp. Again Colonel Grey&#8217;s New
Zealanders and Bushmen distinguished themselves, for on the 25th,
while the enemy attempted to take up another position to cover the
withdrawal of their convoy, the dashing Colonials, under Major
O&#8217;Brien, closed in from both flanks and fairly &#8220;mopped it up.&#8221;
The result of the exciting march was the capture of 140 prisoners,
two 15-pounder guns, one pom-pom, six Maxims, 160 rifles,[Pg 35]
320 rounds 15-pounder ammunition, 15,000 rifle ammunition, 53
waggons, and 24 carts. Twenty-two dead and 32 wounded Boers
were left on the field, while General Babington&#8217;s loss was only two
killed and seven wounded. These summary actions, in which the
officers and men of the Imperial Light Horse, the 4th New Zealand
Regiment, and the 6th Imperial Bushmen played so prominent a
part, were most disconcerting to the foe, who now, owing to want
of horses, guns, and supplies, had their wings clipped, and were
unable to evade the pursuing columns. Much of the success of
the proceedings was due to the excellent service rendered by
Colonel Grey, Major Gossett (Cheshire Regiment), Major Burrows
(38th Battery R.F.A.), Major O&#8217;Brien (6th Imperial Bushmen),
Lieutenant Kinton (Royal Welsh Fusiliers), Captains Walker and
Arthur (4th New Zealand Regiment), Lieutenants Thomas and Doyle
(6th Imperial Bushmen), Captains Norman, Brierley, and Donaldson,
and Lieutenants Dryden and Holbrig (Imperial Light Horse),
Captains Stanton, R.A., and Logan, and Major Cookson (I.S.C.).

From the 2nd to the 6th of April there were more Boer-hunts
towards Tafelkop, and many small collisions with Smuts&#8217; marauders
at Rietpan and elsewhere. General Babington now returned to
Ventersdorp, and from thence made for Smuts&#8217; main laager at
Goedvooruitzicht. Marching by night across the swampy country
and over the hills, Colonel Rawlinson, with the men of Roberts&#8217;
and Kitchener&#8217;s Horse, prepared a little surprise for the slumbering
Dutchmen. At daybreak on the 14th April the laager was rushed
by the dashing British band, while the enemy in consternation took
to their heels. Five or six hundred fled, leaving six killed, ten
wounded, twenty-three prisoners, one 12-pounder gun, one pom-pom,
two ammunition waggons, eighteen rounds 12-pounder
ammunition, 500 rounds of pom-pom ammunition, 12,000 rounds
of rifle ammunition, twelve waggons and carts, and a large number
of cattle. Only three of the British party were wounded.

Operations still continued against Delarey, who had concentrated
his commando (numbering 2000) in the hilly country around Hartebeestefontein,
and from thence proceeded hungrily to pounce on a
convoy passing from General Babington&#8217;s camp at Syferkuil to
Klerksdorp. But the escort, admirably handled, succeeded in
frustrating the designs of the enemy, whose exploit cost them twelve
killed and six wounded.

Lord Methuen, who had resumed command of his force,
now marched from Mafeking to Lichtenberg to co-operate in the
movement for surrounding the aggressive commandos that were
now rendered abnormally adventurous by famine and ferocity.
General Dixon moved from the Krugersdorp district to arrest
the rush of them to north-east, while Colonel E. Williams, with[Pg 36]
a fresh column of mounted Australians, stood in readiness at
Klerksdorp to reinforce General Babington. On the 4th of May
Generals Methuen and Babington tackled the desperadoes between
Kaffir&#8217;s Kraal and Brakpan, and after a brisk engagement one
12-pounder gun, seven prisoners, and five waggons were captured.
The enemy were hunted, till, after their usual custom, they dispersed
in ones and twos into the shadow of the hills.



CHARGE OF THE BUSHMEN AND NEW ZEALANDERS ON THE BOER GUNS DURING THE ATTACK ON
BABINGTON&#8217;S CONVOY NEAR KLERKSDORP, MARCH 24, 1901

Drawing by R. Caton Woodville


An account of the interesting operations was given by a trooper
of the 10th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry, which regiment had been
over a year on service with Lord Methuen, and was now thinking
of home:&mdash;

&#8220;Lord Methuen&#8217;s advance troops left Mafeking at daybreak on
May 1, and the whole column entered Lichtenberg on the 3rd,
bringing along with it a huge convoy of supplies. Lichtenberg was
not looking so picturesque as it did four months ago. The recent
stormy times there, and in the immediate vicinity, had necessitated
the removal of a great many trees; moreover, extra trenches had
been dug and other strong barricades built. Winter is now upon
us, and the parched and worn herbage as well as the changing tints
in the foliage seemed to harmonise, so to speak, with the melancholy
surroundings. However, the cheery strains of music which greeted[Pg 37]
us as we entered the town and rode along a little avenue of weeping
willows made us forget our troubles for awhile. It was the fine
band of the Northumberland Fusiliers playing in a desolate orchard.

&#8220;At 3 A.M. the following morning two squadrons of Yeomanry
marched out as mounted escort to the convoy. The column followed
in its wake an hour or so later. It was about an hour after daylight
when four men of the 37th, who were riding in advance, had the
good fortune to capture two prominent Boers&mdash;Messrs. Lemmer and
Viljoen. One of them was riding a &#8216;jibber,&#8217; and in order to get
the animal along had tied it to that of his comrade. Consequently,
when the gentlemen were taken by surprise, their capture was easy.
We saw several Boers scampering away from some farmhouses just
before we bivouacked, but, happily, they did not molest our outposts
during the day. Next morning the general had his fighting column
well on the march quite an hour before daybreak. The convoy left
half-an-hour earlier. Smoking was strictly prohibited as long as it
was dark. As soon as it grew light the 37th Squadron were sent
out in advance. Half-an-hour later the Boers attacked our rearguard,
but were repulsed after a short though severe fight, in which
Paget&#8217;s Horse lost one killed and two wounded. Meanwhile the
37th had pushed forward and gained some kopjes in front. Here
they came in touch with General Babington&#8217;s column. Thus the
two columns practically met, and then Delarey, Smuts, and De
Camp drew up the bulk of their forces on highly advantageous
ground on Methuen&#8217;s right front and Babington&#8217;s left. Wheeling
his mounted troops round into position, Lord Methuen began to
attack the enemy without delay, but the position in front was
deemed almost impregnable. I saw swarms of mounted Boers on
the hillside, and several rode down to try to draw us on to the
attack. The general quickly ordered Colonel Meyrick, who was in
command of the Yeomanry, to execute a flank movement on the
right, leaving General Babington to take the matter in hand on the
other side. Hereabouts the 37th rejoined the main body after a
long gallop, and again took up their original position at the head of
the regiment. Colonel Meyrick led his men along at a smart pace,
and as we breasted a rise in the road we viewed several Boers
breaking away across the open. Soon afterwards the brigadier sent
the 5th out on the right, whilst he himself led the main body to the
left with the idea of driving the enemy from his positions in front.
The Boers, however, did not show much inclination to fight.

&#8220;All the time Colonel Meyrick was being seconded by Colonel
Lawson of the 10th, who now dismounted his men and led them to
the attack. A few volleys sufficed, however, for at this moment a
pom-pom made its appearance on the scene, and after waiting long
enough to receive a few well-directed shells from it the Boers gave[Pg 38]
way and galloped off in little parties as hard as they could go. In a
few minutes the Yeomanry were in hot pursuit of the enemy.
&#8216;Ware hole&#8217; was a constant cry all day long, and casualties
occurred from the treacherous state of the ground. Now before us
lay a vast plain, beyond which was a long straggling range of kopjes.
Thither the Boers had retreated in haste. The 5th were still on our
right, and I saw a body of mounted men on our left. All the troops
Colonel Meyrick had with him were Colonel Lawson and four broken
squadrons of the 10th. But there was no drawing rein. Four men
were sent forward to scout the country on the left front and four
somewhere else. The remainder galloped to the left flank. Hereabouts
some troops were detached from the main body in order to
capture some waggons; and a few minutes later two men of the
37th&mdash;Nichols and Brown&mdash;who had been sent forward to reconnoitre,
captured a gun (a twelve-pounder, O Battery, Royal Horse
Artillery, lost at Colenso). Three Boers were in charge of it, but
one immediately took to his heels and escaped, and the other two&mdash;two
beardless boys&mdash;were too much out of breath with their efforts
of whipping up and shouting at the jaded team of mules to do anything
but throw up their arms. One of the youngsters burst into
tears when he was disarmed.

&#8220;Notwithstanding all this, the two colonels still kept up the pursuit,
and came across some more waggons four miles ahead. Here,
however, the enemy were in strong numbers, and a few of our men
fell foul of some Boers in a mealie field, but miraculously escaped.
Soon afterwards the officer commanding received a message from the
General recalling him, but it was not till then that Colonel Meyrick
led back his scanty followers to escort the plunder into camp. It
was a curious procession that wended its way across the veldt.
Jolting along in front were several captured waggons with a slender
escort. Then came Colonel Meyrick, on his good dun horse, with
his injured arm still in a sling, followed by his orderlies. Next in
order a pom-pom and the captured gun, which was being driven
along by the two ragged Dutch boys; two waggons, a Cape cart,
and an ambulance waggon, the officers and the remnant of the 10th
bringing up the rear. Just before we reached camp we passed
Lord Methuen, sitting on the ground, writing his despatches. The
troops bivouacked near Paarde Plaats (where Methuen captured
Sellers&#8217;s laager a short time ago), after having been in the saddle or
on foot for twelve hours.

&#8220;Next morning the mounted troops marched as far as Hartebeestefontein,
and the men took advantage of a brief halt in the
picturesque village to loot oranges, of which there were any quantity
in the orchards and gardens, though mostly green ones. Eventually
the troops bivouacked about six miles from the village. The General[Pg 39]
ordered a rest on the next day; but afterwards the men did some
very heavy marching in order to keep in touch with the other
columns. Although Babington made another big haul and Rawlinson
shelled the Boers, Methuen did not get another chance of
having a smack at the enemy. The column reached Mafeking on
Sunday, 12th inst.&mdash;a cold, dusty morning.

&#8220;Lord Methuen&#8217;s old yeomen entrained at Mafeking en route for
the south at 1 P.M. yesterday, 14th inst. The General himself paid
his &#8216;old comrades-in-arms&#8217; the high compliment of coming down to
the station in order to see them off. He met with a splendid ovation,
and was carried shoulder-high and safely deposited on a temporary
platform amidst rounds of applause. Then every yeoman pressed
eagerly forward to shake the outstretched hand of their gallant
leader. Lord Methuen seemed deeply impressed with the enthusiastic
reception accorded him. But it was the only way we
had of expressing our gratitude and admiration. There was no
speech.&#8221;

The above letter describes not only the last operations but the
last farewell of the &#8220;Old Yeomanry.&#8221; Before parting with them,
some statistics regarding the brave and serviceable men who were
leaving the scene of their activities may not be out of place.

According to the official record of the casualties in South Africa
during the twelve months ending March 27, the Imperial Yeomanry
losses had been 185 killed, 642 wounded, 388 died of disease, 49
died of wounds, 571 invalided; deaths from accidents, 20; missing,
205; prisoners, 497&mdash;total, 2557. The majority of the missing had
reappeared, and the prisoners were released. At the end of July
1900, the strength of the Yeomanry in South Africa was: 536
officers, 10,195 men&mdash;total, 10,731; in February, before the reinforcements
had arrived, the strength had been reduced to 495
officers, 7500 men&mdash;total, 7995; on May 1 the figures read 800
officers, 22,304 men&mdash;total, 23,104. The Imperial Yeomanry
Hospitals had also done invaluable work. Both Lord Roberts
and Lord Kitchener eulogised the scheme, and the most eminent
surgeons endorsed the opinions of the military authorities. The
movement, it may be remembered, was started by Lady Georgiana
Curzon (now Countess Howe), and an influential committee was
appointed to carry out the work. The total record of patients
treated at Deelfontein, Mackenzie&#8217;s Farm (now taken over by the
Government), Pretoria, and Bloemfontein, and by the Field Hospital
up to the middle of May was 17,070. During April, May, and
June, the whole of the original force (together with the Australian
and New Zealand contingents) was withdrawn from the country
and their places, in course of time, were taken by 16,000 new
yeomen and new Colonial contingents, but these, though apt and[Pg 40]
willing, were naturally incapable of filling at once the huge gap
made by the loss of these trained and seasoned men.

To resume. During April, energetic measures were set on foot
in Namaqualand by Colonel Smith and Colonel Shelton. Colonel
Shelton had now organised a field column to work in the arid district,
Bushmanland, the first contingent of sixty men and three officers,
commanded by Captain Montagu, having started to reinforce the
advance post at Agenthuis, which was held by Lieutenant Rich
and a small patrol. These, meanwhile, were attacked by the enemy,
and fought with them for five hours. They then had to evacuate
the place.

Zeerust was still in a state of siege, but the North Lancashire
Regiment and some Yeomen engaged the raiders and gave them
a warm day, fighting being pursued with unabated zeal from
daylight till dusk. The New Zealanders next shelled the Boers&#8217;
meeting-place and disturbed their little plans, and showed them
that the inconvenience of the besieged might be shared by the
besiegers. A party of the North Lancashires surprised the Boers
and wounded three of their number, and later, on the 29th, driven
desperate by want of sufficient provisions, the scouts made a grand
sortie, and captured a plentiful supply of oxen.

Everywhere in the west there was unrest, owing to the damage
created by the desperadoes. Belmont Station was attacked and
the telegraph instruments damaged, and in the Montzani district
Captain Tupper, Liverpool Regiment, and twelve men had an
unpleasant time near Taaiboshpan, but gained the day after three
hours&#8217; fighting. Elsewhere Lieutenant Barton (Bedfordshire Regiment)
found himself surrounded in a farm. A day of tussle was
spent there, but in the night the British escaped. Colonel Walford
thereupon set himself to work to scour and purge the district.

APRIL. ORANGE RIVER COLONY&mdash;OPERATIONS OF GENERAL
BRUCE-HAMILTON AND GENERAL RUNDLE

Now that the Boers, in small bands, were being forced northward
from Cape Colony and from Kruitzinger&#8217;s hunting-ground,
preparations were made near Bethulie and along the Orange River
for their reception. To this end General Lyttelton moved the troops
of General Bruce-Hamilton and Colonel Hickman from Dewetsdorp
and Wepener, and these&mdash;in conjunction with Colonel Haig&#8217;s
columns&mdash;were so ranged by the 5th April, as to defeat any great
incursion of marauders into the Orange River Colony. But, save
for the clever capture by Colonel Munro, with 150 Bethune&#8217;s
Mounted Infantry and a pom-pom, of a convoy and eighty-[Pg 41]three
prisoners (including Commandant Bester and Lieutenant
Lindigne of the Staats Artillery), little took place, and General
Bruce-Hamilton was enabled to return to his position at Dewetsdorp.
On the 13th of April he succeeded General Lyttelton
in his command, as that officer was leaving for England, and
Colonel Haig moved to take charge of operations in Cape Colony.
On both sides of the river the sweeping up of stores and capture of
Boers proceeded apace, and the total result of General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s
April activities was the capture of ninety-five prisoners,
300 horses, and an abundance of live stock.

The raiders, ragged and starving, were continually active.
Kruitzinger made an ineffectual effort to cross on the 4th, but
was frustrated by finding the troops of General Bruce-Hamilton
in possession of the river banks. Colonel White and Colonel
Munro so actively scoured round and about Springfontein that
such Boers as there were quickly vanished till a more opportune
period. Others tried to sneak across at Oudefontein Drift,
but Major Murray&#8217;s men discovered them in the act and disposed
of them. From the region of Brandford came the news of the
capture of a laager on the 2nd by the prowess of Thorneycroft&#8217;s
Mounted Infantry, who, by night, had surrounded the camp of
Bester and caught him napping.

On the 7th of April, Colonel Thorneycroft moved towards
Winburg to deal with a minor concentration of the enemy in that
neighbourhood. The rumour of his approach served to defeat the
Boers&#8217; object and disperse them, and he consequently returned to
Brandfort.

General Sir Leslie Rundle remained indefatigable. In March he
was still firmly holding his line&mdash;Ficksburg, Harrismith, Bethlehem,
and Vrede. But he was minus the mobile column under General
Campbell, which had temporarily reinforced the troops under
General Wynne, and was furnishing an escort under Colonel
Inglefield on the Utrecht-Luneberg line, whence General French
(in the important operations which have been described) drew his
supplies. General Campbell, after trying experiences (fighting
perpetually in marsh and morass, floating waggons across rivers,
and crossing on rafts, &amp;c.) which delayed all his undertakings,
returned to Harrismith on the 10th of April. Later, General
Rundle, finding the Boers had again buzzed about Fouriesburg, left
Harrismith for Bethlehem, reaching there on the 24th. The
enemy, some 300, dogged his footsteps and hung round his flanks
till it was necessary to whisk them off, which was accomplished
after four days&#8217; fighting. He was then able to move on viâ
Retief&#8217;s Nek, which he passed on the 29th, entering Fouriesburg[Pg 42]
unopposed on the 2nd of May. He afterwards set about scouring
the country in its remotest valleys with flying columns, while
Colonel Harley from Ficksburg made similar excursions. These
united activities were fraught with considerable excitement and
corresponding success. On the 31st of May, Colonel Harley left
Fouriesburg and seized the Slaapkrantz position without serious
opposition, sending the Boers who were fleeing before him into
the arms of General Campbell. This officer was moving from the
direction of Bethlehem, and by a forced march managed to reach
Naauwpoort Nek in time to intercept the enemy&#8217;s convoy. From
this date to the 8th of June, when they joined hands at Elands
River Drift, Colonels Harley and Campbell traversed the rugged
region north and south of the Roodebergen range, while a small
column from Harrismith watched the country to the east of
Elands River Drift. The results of these difficult operations and
excursions against Prinsloo&#8217;s, Rautenhach&#8217;s, and other commandos
were as follows: 7 Boers killed, 19 wounded, 101 Krupp shells,
4800 rounds of ammunition, 21 rifles, 43 vehicles, and 1450 horses.
Foodstuffs, stores, and forage in great quantities were captured or
destroyed. The rest of June was spent in clearing the Langeberg,
the only district south of the Harrismith-Bethlehem road which
remained to be dealt with in the new scheme of operations. The
enemy hung mosquito-wise around the flanks of the scouring
columns, but they pursued their work and accounted for 15 Boers
killed or wounded, 2770 horses, 56 vehicles, 4000 rounds of
ammunition, 7 rifles, and quantities of stores and stock. On the
conclusion of these operations, General Rundle returned to
Harrismith, where he remained till he started to co-operate with
General Elliot&#8217;s march from Springfield Drift to Frankfort. Of
which anon.

During June, Generals Rundle and Campbell bade farewell to
the &#8220;Old Yeomanry.&#8221; The chief took the opportunity to express
his especial satisfaction with the excellent work done by them,
saying that when they joined he was without cavalry, and did not
know what he should have done without them.

An interesting incident, showing that the pluck and value of the
Imperial Yeomanry cannot be overrated, may here be quoted. On
the 23rd of June, the Harrismith Volunteer Light Horse and a
few of the Imperial Yeomanry visited a farm and captured 1500
horses, sheep, and goats. While these were being driven in,
Sergeant-Major Reid (11th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry), who
with two men was handling a flock, was assailed by a party of
twelve Boers. Reid promptly sent on the men with the animals
and lay down alone in the open and covered their retreat.

[Pg 43]

CHAPTER V

COMBINED MOVEMENT FOR THE CLEARANCE OF THE
NORTHERN TRANSVAAL.&mdash;MARCH AND APRIL

Lord Kitchener now engaged himself in preparing a
new and immense combined movement for the clearance
of the country to the north of Pretoria. The so-called
seat of government of the Boers had been removed from
Pietersburg to Roos Senekal, and its presence there
naturally attracted all the Boers who, in consequence of General
French&#8217;s clearance of the Swaziland border, had been forced into
the difficult country of the Tautesberg and Bothaberg. In
planning a movement against these bands from the line of
Middelburg-Belfast-Lydenburg, precautions had to be taken to
prevent the escape of the enemy into the Zoutpansberg and
Waterberg districts. It therefore became necessary to hold
Pietersburg and the drifts over Olifant&#8217;s River, and to chase the
Boers from their snug retreats in the vicinity.

Accordingly, General Plumer was moved from Orange River
Colony and directed to hold Pietersburg, and prepare to co-operate
in the combined movement just described.

At this time, 26th March, Pienaars River was the most
advanced garrison on the Pietersburg line. For this place General
Plumer started, there to be joined by the 2nd Battalion Gordon
Highlanders and &#8220;C&#8221; Section Pom-Poms.

Beyond Pienaars River repairs to the line had to be effected,
which caused delay, then the troops advanced from Warmbad,
Nylstroom, to Piet Potgietersrust over a clear line. Here the
enemy meant mischief, for they had blown up one of the smaller
railway bridges, but this was soon repaired, and on the 8th of April
the advanced troops reached Pietersburg, the average distance
covered being fifteen miles a day. The town had been evacuated
in the night. Here provisions, supplies, and remounts had to be
collected, in order that the attack, once begun, might be carried on
without a hitch, and that the Boers, chased from one quarter, might
not be sent trekking into Rhodesia, but be enveloped and swept up
en masse as they had been at Paardeberg and at Fouriesburg. The
projected advance was full of difficulties and the preliminaries were
endless. It was impossible to begin till men, horses, and supplies
had been deposited at Pietersburg by rail from Cape Town, Port[Pg 44]
Elizabeth, Durban, or Delagoa Bay. It must be remembered that
the columns were preparing to march some 150 miles across the
veldt, where the greatest of all enemies, the tsetze fly, harassed every
inch of the road. In addition to this deadly foe to horses, there
were now the wintry nights, following grilling days, to be encountered,
and chilly shocks which bring enteric and other diseases
in their train.

At Pietersburg forty-six Boers voluntarily surrendered, and the
following captures were made:&mdash;one Krupp gun, thirty rifles, 1000
rounds 7-pounder ammunition, 210,000 small-arm ammunition, 8300
lbs. gunpowder, 480 lbs. dynamite. Two truck-loads of ammunition
had been blown up by the Boers on their departure. The
occupation of the place now made the scheme for the opening of
railway communication from the Cape to Cairo (hitherto thought
to be a visionary&#8217;s dream) perfectly feasible. The line from
Warmbaths to Pietersburg was now placed in charge of
Colonel Hall, the posts being occupied by the Northamptonshire
and Wiltshire Regiments, together with the 12th Battalion Mounted
Infantry. This left General Plumer&#8217;s mounted troops free to hold
the line of the Olifant&#8217;s River. Having established an adequate
garrison at Pietersburg, General Plumer proceeded to post Major
Colvin&#8217;s column to secure the drift at Bathfontein, while to Colonel
Jeffreys was assigned the task of occupying a lower drift at Blaauwbloemje&#8217;s
Kloof. General Plumer himself was at Commissie Drift.
Schalk Burger at this time was said to have deposited himself at
Tolesburg, west of Middelburg, where he still endeavoured to
carry on the parody of government.

Colonel Jeffreys on the 18th, while operating with his mobile
column along the Olifant, came on a party of Boers east of
Druehoek. He captured eleven and seized their ammunition.
Soon after, Lieutenant Reid (Imperial Bushmen) with some
twenty Australians, who had been detached from General Plumer&#8217;s
post at Commissie Drift, performed a valiant act. While in charge
of his patrol he located a Boer laager some fifteen miles east of the
drift. Under cover of night he and his handful of Colonials crept
towards the camp, surrounded it, and at dawn on the 24th boldly
attacked it. The enemy, doubtless imagining that young Reid&#8217;s
hardihood was backed by a large reserve at his elbow, promptly
surrendered, and the gallant British band had the honour of recording
a haul of forty-one prisoners, including the commandant,
Schroeder, and one excellent Maxim, together with horses, mules,
waggons, and ammunition. The Boers, on their side, scored slightly
elsewhere. On the day following this brilliant episode, while Major
Twyford, with a small escort, was moving from Machadodorp to
Lydenburg, there to join the Royal Scots, the enemy lay in ambush[Pg 45]
near Badfontein, a valley on the Crocodile River. Their plans were
successful, for it was not difficult in this shelving and dipping
region to surprise a small party moving over a vast tract of difficult
country. The tussle that followed was a tough one, the men
fighting desperately and refusing to surrender. At last Major
Twyford was killed and his band overpowered.



DEFEAT OF A NIGHT ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE RAILWAY

Drawing by Allan Stewart


The results of General Plumer&#8217;s operations between the 14th and
28th of April were ninety-one prisoners, twenty surrendered, one
Maxim, 20,360 rounds ammunition, twenty-six waggons and carts,
and forty-six mules.

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR BINDON BLOOD&#8217;S OPERATIONS NORTH
OF THE LINE MIDDELBURG&mdash;BELFAST&mdash;LYDENBURG

On the day (14th April) that General Plumer, having garrisoned
Pietersburg, left there to seize the drifts on the Olifant River, and
thus close the avenues of escape leading towards the north-west, Sir
Bindon Blood disposed his force in the following manner. The
columns of Colonel Park and General Kitchener occupied Lydenburg,
with those of Colonel Douglas at Witklip (south of them).
Colonel Pulteney was stationed at Belfast, while at Middelburg
were Colonel Benson and General Beatson. The columns of
Colonels Pulteney and Benson were commanded by General
Fetherstonhaugh.

These columns, admirably placed for the work in hand, now
began to move, so that the enemy in this difficult region might
no longer plume himself on being secure from attack.

Column One, under Colonel Park, moving round into the
Waterval Valley, joined hands with Column Two under General
W. Kitchener near Rietfontein. In this region Colonel Park
remained, so as to check any attempt on the part of the Boers to
move north from Roosenekal, while General Kitchener continued
his advance across the Steelpoort River to Fort Weber, which was
reached on the 18th of April.

Column Three, under Colonel Douglas, moved to Dullstroom
(viâ Zwagershoek and Palmietfontein), which was reached on the
17th of April. On the following day Colonel Pulteney, with Column
Four, arrived there from Belfast, but pushed on viâ Witpoort to
occupy Roosenekal. On his approach Mr. Schalk Burger and
his Government, in hot haste, bolted to Leydsdorp, leaving papers
of the South African Republic and many banknotes behind.
Some of the documents captured at Roosenekal by the forces
under Sir Bindon Blood consisted of (1) a circular issued by the
Boer Commandant-General as to the treatment of burghers who
have surrendered; (2) a letter of representatives of the Central[Pg 46]
Peace Committee, Pretoria, urging surrender; and (3) a certificate
of the execution of M. de Kock, a member of that committee. In
the letter from the Central Peace Committee, one of the signatories
of which was M. de Kock, there occurred, after a reference to the
strong position of Lord Kitchener, the following words:&mdash;

&#8220;What is submitted to you is a well-meant offer from a powerful man, who
is sure of his case, and a person who is willing to do everything to restore
peace and prevent further bloodshed and destruction of our dear country, and
to remove the sufferings of our wives and children; and when I submit this
verbally to you, you will be convinced that this is truly the act of a strong
man, who knows his own strength and might, and can thus hold out the olive
branch. Oh, I trust that you and your fellow-burghers will accept it as such,
and not do as we Afrikanders generally do, when such representations are
made to us, to consider it a sign of weakness, because the Lord knows that he
(Lord Kitchener) is doing so from pure nobility of soul, and the wish of the
British people to prevent further bloodshed.&#8221;

The foregoing was evidently issued after M. de Kock had met
Lord Kitchener in Pretoria. Then followed a circular by Commandant
C. R. de Wet denouncing Lord Kitchener&#8217;s terms, and a
circular issued by Commandant Botha giving his account of the
negotiations. De Wet stated:&mdash;

&#8220;Finally, I wish to observe that if I and our Government were so foolish
as to accept the proposals of Lord Kitchener, I am convinced that the great
majority of our people, if not all, who are now fighting, would not agree, for
to accept those proposals means nothing less than the complete subjection of
the Afrikander people, and the subjection of a people is more bitter to think
of than the death of every single burgher.&#8221;

To Roosenekal Colonel Benson, with Column Five, also directed
his steps, marching by Bankfontein and Klupspruit and Blinkwater,
clearing the surrounding country as he went. He and Colonel
Pulteney having come in touch with each other, they now scoured
the valley around Steelpoort, unearthing Boers and capturing
burghers innumerable.

General Beatson, with Column Six, was engaged in a prodigious
task. Besides sweeping the country&mdash;Avontuur, Laatste Drift&mdash;through
which he marched, to Brakfontein, he was instructed to
hold both Wagon and Crocodile Drifts on the Olifant River, and
to push out patrols to connect with General Plumer&#8217;s troops on the
lower reaches of the river.

Later, General W. Kitchener, from Fort Weber, moved south
to Paardeplaats, in the vicinity of which place he operated for some
days making captures of prisoners and stock, and then proceeding
farther south to clear the Bothaberg before going to Middelburg.

To Middelburg viâ Blinkwater also went Colonel Pulteney from[Pg 47]
Roosenekal, while Colonels Benson and Douglas (who for some
time co-operated at Dullstroom) marched to Belfast.

Thus the country was completely weeded of the enemy, and
though some few effected their escape through the rugged region
east of the Steelpoort Valley, 1081 Boers surrendered. Other
captures included a 1-pounder quick-firing Krupp gun complete,
with one hundred rounds of ammunition, one pom-pom, 540 rifles,
204,450 rounds of ammunition, 247 horses, 611 waggons and carts.
One Long Tom, one 4.7-inch gun (captured at Helvetia), one
15-pounder gun, one 12-pounder Krupp gun, two pom-poms, and two
Maxims were blown up by the enemy to avoid capture. Unfortunately
a gallant Victorian, Lieutenant Beatty, lost his life.



Map Illustrating the Combined Movement to Clear the
Northern Transvaal


The combined operations thus satisfactorily concluded, General
Plumer concentrated his troops and marched by the line of Elands
and Kameel Rivers to Eerste Fabrieken. General Blood, still
co-operating, directed General Beatson to move his force from
Wagon Drift along the left bank of the Wilge River to Bronker&#8217;s
Spruit Station. Colonel Allenby (who had returned from assisting
General French&#8217;s operations) moved from Middelburg to Witbank,
and thence, in conjunction with General Beatson, began to clear
the angle of the Wilge and Olifant Rivers. The enemy was now
dispersing in every direction. Only one party driven westward by[Pg 48]
General Beatson was caught. This, in full flight, was overtaken
by a detachment from General Plumer&#8217;s force. Major Vialls and
the 3rd Victorian Bushmen, after an exciting chase over the rugged
wilds, brought in twenty-seven prisoners, eighteen rifles, thirty
waggons, and 1000 head of cattle.

General Plumer reached his destination (Eerste Fabrieken) on
the 4th of May.

COLONEL GRENFELL AT PIETERSBURG

Concurrently with the activities of General Plumer and Sir
Bindon Blood, events of some importance took place near Pietersburg.
No sooner had General Plumer turned his back on the place
than the Boers, some fifteen miles to the north, began to collect.
A reconnaissance conducted by Mounted Infantry scented out a
big commando, said to be under the command of Van Rensburg,
at Klipdam. Accordingly Colonel Grenfell, with his column
(Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts), was sent by rail to Pietersburg
&#8220;to clear up the situation.&#8221; The clearing up process was highly
effective. Moving by night (on the 26th of April), the troops
came on the laager at Klipdam a little before dawn, and with
the first streak of day delivered their attack. The fight was short,
sharp, and brilliant. Seven Boers were killed. Only one of our
men was wounded. Forty-one Dutchmen were captured, together
with their camp, twenty-six horses, ten mules, waggons multifarious,
and 76,000 rounds of ammunition.

This dashing exploit was soon followed by another, less showy
but decidedly practical. Report having declared that the last
Long Tom of the enemy was ensconced somewhere twenty miles
east of Pietersburg, Colonel Grenfell directed his energies towards
its capture. He marched hot foot viâ Doornhoek&mdash;which he
reached on the 30th&mdash;to Berg Plaats. But the enemy was on the
qui vive. They determined that Long Tom should show fight till
his last gasp, and opened fire at over 10,000 yards range. Still
Colonel Grenfell&#8217;s men pushed on and on, determined to capture
their prize, while the horrible weapon snorted derisively. At last,
after firing sixteen rounds, and while Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts were
steadily bearing down on them, the Boers blew it up and scudded
to the north-east to save their skins. The great object, therefore,
of the splendid rush was defeated, but ten prisoners were secured,
together with thirty-five rounds of ammunition for the defunct Long
Tom. Two of the British party were wounded. While proceeding
to search for further spoil, 100,000 rounds of Martini-Henry
ammunition were unearthed at a neighbouring farm and destroyed.
Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts, under Colonels Colenbrander and[Pg 49]
Wilson, were now ever on the move, and, working from Bergvlei
as a centre, were continually bringing in wandering Boers. A
detachment of the 12th Mounted Infantry under Major Thomson,
too, did splendid work, and succeeded, in the midst of a dense fog, in
capturing Commandant Marais and forty of his followers.

Beyers, who had fled from Pietersburg on the approach of the
British, was still at large, however, and in the Waterberg district
was doing his best to intercept such commandos as were on the
way to surrender. Munnik, a former landdrost of Pietersburg, and
somewhat of a firebrand, together with his son, an ex-state mining
engineer, had been captured during General Plumer&#8217;s march, by
Major Kirkwood and the Wiltshire Regiment.

The total &#8220;bag&#8221; made by Colonel Grenfell, during his move
from Pietersburg till his return there on the 6th of May, was
129 prisoners, fifty voluntary surrenders, and 240,000 rounds of
ammunition, which were destroyed. Seven Boers were killed.

On 10th May Botha forwarded to Lord Kitchener another
letter:&mdash;

&#8220;As I have already assured your Excellency, I am very desirous of terminating
this war and its sad consequences. It is, however, necessary, in order
to comply with the Grondwet of this Republic and otherwise, that, before any
steps are taken in that direction, the condition of our country and our cause be
brought to the notice of his Honour State President Kruger in Europe; and I
therefore wish to send two persons to him in order to acquaint him fully with
that condition. As speed in this matter is of great consequence to both contending
parties, and as such despatch without your Excellency&#8217;s assistance
would take a considerable time, I should like to hear from your Excellency
whether your Excellency is prepared to assist me in expediting this matter by
allowing such person or persons to journey there and back unhindered, if
necessary by the traffic medium within your Excellency&#8217;s control.&#8221;

On 16th May Lord Kitchener replied to the application as
follows:&mdash;

&#8220;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Honour&#8217;s letter of
the 10th instant, and, in reply, beg to state that I can only deal with you and
your superior officers in the field in regard to the cessation of hostilities, and
that I do not recognise the official status of any other persons in the late
Republics of the Orange River and Transvaal. If, however, your Honour
desires, with the object of bringing hostilities to a close, to consult with any
person in Europe I will forward any telegram your Honour desires on the
subject and let you have the reply. Should, however, your Honour still desire
to send messengers, and will inform me of their names and status, I will refer
the matter to his Majesty&#8217;s Government for decision.&#8221;

[Pg 50]

CHAPTER VI

GENERAL ELLIOT&#8217;S OPERATIONS FROM KROONSTAD

It will be remembered that during the middle of March Lord
Kitchener engaged himself with a new scheme of redistribution,
and that General Elliot&#8217;s force was arranged to operate
from Kroonstad in the northern district of the Orange River
Colony. By the 10th of April this force was ready to take
the field. In consequence of a seeming recrudescence of activity of
the enemy in the north-west of the Colony, and certain signs of a
possible junction between them and their confederates of the south-west
of the Transvaal, General Elliot directed his energies to the
sweeping of the district about Reitzburg and Parys. Here supplies
in some quantities served as an attraction to the hungry commandos.
These were satisfactorily disposed of by the 20th of April, when the
force returned to Kroonstad.

But it remained not long idle. General Elliot proceeded to
scour the districts beyond the Wilge River, where the Dutchmen
were again beginning to hoard their goods for further activity.
Lord Kitchener&#8217;s plan was as follows:&mdash;A movement was to be
made by parallel columns on a wide front eastward beyond
Heilbron; the left or northern column, when past that point, was to
halt, while the other columns wheeling to the left should clear the
country, the right passing east of Frankfort. The whole division,
moving north in line, was then to press the Boers and their stock
back on the Vaal River.

In order to drive as many dispersed Boers as possible into
General Elliot&#8217;s net, General C. Knox, concurrently with General
Elliot&#8217;s first move, was to send a column towards Reitz. A
force was also stationed on the north under Colonel Western, who
had succeeded to the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Williams&#8217;
column on the lower drifts of the Wilge River. At the same time
the columns of Colonels E. Knox and Rimington were to move
from Heidelberg and Standerton respectively towards the junction
of the Vaal and Waterval Rivers.

In accordance with this scheme, General C. Knox occupied
Senekal on the 25th of April, sending, as directed, Colonel Pilcher
(who had been doing magnificent work at Clocolan, Mequatting&#8217;s
Nek, and the Korannaberg) to Reitz on the 28th. The town
was found to have been evacuated on the previous evening, and[Pg 51]
report spoke to General Elliot&#8217;s presence on the north of it:
consequently, Colonel Pilcher&#8217;s part in the scheme being accomplished,
he rejoined General Knox at Senekal, and with him moved
to the railway.

General Elliot&#8217;s force at this time was moving east, and by the
7th of May the troops were disposed along the line Villiersdorp-Frankfort-Tafel
Kop. On the 9th the General, who was at
Cornelia, despatched a force to Vrede, and sent off forty prisoners,
5000 horses, and a large number of waggons and cattle to Standerton.
The Boers (since Colonel Western was guarding the Wilge River
Drift) were now threatened on all sides. Flying in despair to
the hilly cover south of Greylingstad, they jumped into the open
arms of Colonels E. Knox and Rimington, who were lying in wait
for them. Those who were smart enough to escape scurried across
the river, but 34 prisoners, 4000 cattle, 284 waggons and carts,
and 5400 rounds of ammunition were secured, and the haul
served as a successful finale to the first phase of these well-directed
operations.

Colonel Western&#8217;s share in the movement being completed,
he went from the Wilge River Drifts to Heilbron. Here
he became aware that Steenkamp&#8217;s laagers were situated some
seventeen miles to north of him. Quick as lightning he was off
again, marching stealthily by night in the direction of the quarry,
and rushing the camp at dawn on the 9th of May. It was a
splendidly conceived and splendidly executed affair, and thirty-two
prisoners, with horses, waggons, and carts, were the prize of the
undertaking.

June opened with more dexterous swoops, and after clearing
the ground from Vereeniging to Parys, and thoroughly sweeping
Venterskroom and Vredefort, the force returned eastward to the
rail, bringing with them nine prisoners, 16,000 rounds of ammunition,
and many waggons. After refitting at Rhenoster, Colonel Western
scoured the country between the junction of the Vaal and Rhenoster
Rivers and Coal Mine Drift, but the enemy vanished, having now
every reason to reserve their ammunition, or to spend it only on
forces inferior to their own in number. They were not in all cases
successful in their disappearance, for a convoy was caught on the
23rd of June, and the guerillas had to fight for dear life; six
prisoners and all the waggons and stock were captured. Colonel
Western then marched to Klerksdorp to replenish his supplies, after
which he co-operated with General Gilbert Hamilton and Colonel
Allenby&mdash;attacked the enemy in the mountain fastnesses of Hartebeestefontein,
and captured more prisoners, horses, and rifles. He
finished up the month by moving towards Hoopstad to meet Colonel
Henry&#8217;s column, on its way from Christiana, hustling Boers wherever[Pg 52]
he found them, and then returning to Klerksdorp, plus six prisoners,
thirteen rifles, seventy-one horses, fifteen waggons and carts. Two
Boers were killed.

GENERAL ELLIOT&#8217;S OPERATIONS&mdash;SECOND PHASE

General Elliot, his left column following the course of the Klip
River, his right extended to the south (beyond Vrede), meanwhile
marched towards the Natal border. At the same time Colonel
Colville&#8217;s force moved up the right bank of the Klip River on
General Elliot&#8217;s left, searching the country around Verzammelberg.
Troops from General Hildyard&#8217;s force were posted to close Almond&#8217;s
(or Alleman&#8217;s) Nek and guard Botha&#8217;s and Muller&#8217;s Passes. Beyond
an engagement with some 300 of the foe, who were found on his
right flank some twenty miles below Vrede, General Elliot met with
slight opposition. He reached Botha&#8217;s Pass on the 19th of May,
and forwarded to Natal some 2000 horses and stock, the fruits of
his labours since leaving the Vaal.

The Boers by this time had found for themselves a new and
naturally strong position some twenty-five miles to the south, and
from this rugged and honeycombed region it was imperative to rout
them. On the 21st they were attacked and without much difficulty
driven off, as their resistance was mainly intended to cause a diversion
while their convoy got away in safety to the cover of the
broken country along the banks of the Wilge River. General Elliot,
accompanied by Colonel De Lisle&#8217;s column, now marched to Harrismith,
collecting nearly 2000 horses on the way, and returning afterwards
to Vrede. There, at the end of the month, he was met by
Colonels Bethune and Lowe, who had remained behind to operate
north and west of Witkoppies&mdash;the position south of Botha&#8217;s Pass
whence the Boers had been dislodged.



THE CAPTURE OF DE WET&#8217;S CONVOY AT REITZ, JUNE 6, 1901: THE ATTACK UPON THE BOER WAGGONS
BY COLONEL DE LISLE&#8217;S FORCE

Drawing by R. Caton Woodville


On the 3rd of June General Elliot, having replenished his
supplies from Standerton, moved from Vrede towards Kroonstad
viâ Reitz and Lindley. It was on the way to Reitz that one of the
most exciting conflicts of the march took place. A night swoop on
Graspan had been planned for the purpose of intercepting a Boer
convoy (said to be De Wet&#8217;s), which had been located in the neighbourhood.
Accordingly, in the small hours of the 6th, Major Sladen,
with 400 Mounted Infantry of Colonel De Lisle&#8217;s force, made his way
to the laager. The movement was executed with the utmost secrecy,
and before they knew of the coming of the troops the Boers in their
slumbers found themselves surrounded. All that could get away
bolted precipitately, but forty-five prisoners were secured. Then
Major Sladen, after sending some forty of his party to communicate
with Colonel De Lisle, took up a defensive position and awaited[Pg 53]
reinforcements. During the interval the fleeing Boers had a chance
to draw breath; they calculated the smallness of the British party
by which they had been attacked, and knew that, weighted with
prisoners and waggons, it would be impossible for them to move on.
They presently came on Fouché, who was marching in this direction
with 500 men, and with him returned to the rescue of their comrades
of the laager, and made a vigorous struggle to regain the convoy.
The small and fatigued British party remained gallant as ever.
Captain Finlay (Bedford Regiment) and Captain Langley (South
African Bushmen) and their men met the attack with immense
energy, but in the course of the action the Boers succeeded in
getting away some of the waggons which were parked outside the
position.

They nevertheless (though egged on by De Wet and Delarey,
who chanced to be on their way to the Transvaal) failed to make
any impression on Major Sladen&#8217;s superb defence, which was
doggedly sustained till 3 P.M. By this time the first reinforcement
from De Lisle&#8217;s force was seen to be advancing, and the
enemy in hot haste tore off, taking with them such waggons as they
had secured. But they were swiftly pursued. Fighting recom[Pg 54]menced
with ferocity&mdash;hand-to-hand combats on all sides&mdash;and the
waggons, all but two, were recaptured. Among the deeds of valour
which were numerous on this memorable occasion, was the dashing
exploit of young Ashburner, who, at the head of a few men, plunged
into the thick of the fray, and at point of bayonet effected the
recapture of the leading waggons.

Poor Lieutenant Cameron of the Gordon Highlanders, who had
many times before been notable for conspicuous gallantry, was
killed. A gallant young officer, White of the Gordon Highlanders,
escaped by a marvel. He was taken prisoner during the first fight,
and stripped by the Boers; but when the second attack commenced
he succeeded in escaping, and, further, managed to run six miles
and bring up reinforcements.

But such hard fighting was not carried on without heavy cost&mdash;that
of 3 officers and 17 men killed, and 1 officer and 24 men
wounded. The enemy lost 14 dead, 6 wounded, and 45 taken
prisoners, in addition to a number of injured which were carried
away in carts. The captures included 10,000 rounds of ammunition,
114 waggons and carts, 4000 cattle, and a quantity of foodstuffs.

More captures were made later, near Lindley, and the force,
heavily weighted, arrived at Kroonstad on the 14th and 15th of June.
From thence, on the 22nd, they swept eastward, between Lindley
and Senekal, towards the line of the Wilge River. On the 2nd of
July, at Springfield Drift, some twenty miles north of Harrismith,
they received supplies sent out by General Rundle. This officer
was now preparing to co-operate with General Elliot, and to march
north, on his right, through the country east of the Wilge River,
while General Bullock should traverse the country from Standerton
to Frankfort viâ Villiersdorp, and thus serve as a stop for any
Boers who might be swept that way.

[Pg 55]

CHAPTER VII

GENERAL BRUCE-HAMILTON&#8217;S OPERATIONS, ORANGE RIVER
COLONY (SOUTH)

General Bruce-Hamilton, as we know, succeeded
General Lyttelton in his command on the 13th
of April, and proceeded to spend the rest of the month
in clearing the Orange River Colony, the Smithfield,
Zastron, and Rouxville districts, on the east of the
railway. Engaged in this work were Colonels Hickman, Monro,
Maxwell, and White. Hearing that the enemy was massing in the
hills round Philippolis, he directed Colonel W. Williams to move
with three columns from the railway to the western border. From
the 10th to the 19th of May was spent in marching through the
Philippolis district, mopping up Boers, horses, and stock. Thirty-three
prisoners were taken, including Commandant Bothma. About
this date a brilliant little piece of work was performed by Major
Gogarty and four squadrons of the South African Light Horse. A
gang of raiders was known to be hovering in the region of Luckhoff,
therefore this officer, with his dashing party, was ordered to
surprise and, if possible, seize them. The affair was managed with
consummate skill, the troops marching by night and surrounding
the marauders. Of these, armed, they captured thirty-one, together
with their horses.

Colonel Byng now remained behind to hold Philippolis, while
Colonel Williams returned to the railway at Prior Siding. At this
time a new system of blockhouses was inaugurated for the defence of
the railway, which had the effect of releasing for active operations
some six thousand of the troops previously required to guard it.
The whole of these blockhouses were constructed of wood and iron.
The walls consisted of two skins of corrugated iron (six inches apart)
filled with sharp sand. On the complete filling of these skins the
proof of the blockhouse against rifle fire entirely depended. The
filling was done from the inside at the eaves and through holes in
the sills of the loopholes, and was kept complete from time to time
by order of the officer in charge by working new sand through the
holes in the sill by means of a shovel and piece of wood. To
prevent blockhouses from being seen through from one loophole to
another, screens of blankets or sacking were suspended at right
angles to each other crossing the centre of the blockhouse. A[Pg 56]
barbed wire spiderwebbing and fence surrounded the blockhouse,
the entrance to which was firmly closed at night. A 200-gallon
bullet-proof cased tank for water (rain water or that brought by
water-carts) was kept outside the house, but on emergency water
could be obtained by digging a few feet deep within the wired area
round most of the houses. These preparations and precautions
were none too many, as the Boers were constantly at mischief, and
on the 18th they managed to derail a train at America Siding&mdash;an
incident which cost the life of Major Heath (3rd Battalion South
Lancashire Regiment).



A Typical Blockhouse


About the 19th of May, owing to the villainous activities of the
guerillas in the north of Cape Colony, Colonel Monro moved to join
the troops operating near Steynsburg, and subsequently Colonel
Murray crossed into the Cape Colony. Colonel Maxwell (R.E.), to
the deep regret of his colleagues and of all who knew of his distinguished
services as leader of the Colonial Division under General
Brabant, succumbed to the serious injuries received by being thrown
from his horse. Early in June Colonel White proceeded to Aliwal
North to act in combination with Colonel Haig, who was still chasing
Kruitzinger. At this time, in accordance with General Bruce-[Pg 57]Hamilton&#8217;s
plan of scouring the country towards Petrusburg, his force
was split into seven small columns. More columns, co-operating,
advanced from the line of Kaffir River, Jagersfontein Road, Luckhoff,
and Koffyfontein, so as to converge on Petrusburg; while Colonel
Henry&#8217;s force co-operated through Wolvekop (near Luckhoff), and
the Kimberley column moved near Koffyfontein. Another force,
moving from Bloemfontein, operated westward from Kaffir River
Station. To block retreat to the north, the South African Constabulary
occupied posts along the line of country between Bloemfontein
and Petrusburg; and higher up, the Modder River drifts,
between Abraham&#8217;s Kraal and Paardeberg, were guarded by
General Knox&#8217;s troops. The movement took from the 5th to the
8th of June, during which time many laagers were surprised (one
by the Burgher Police under Lieutenant Bayley), and 268 prisoners
with various stores and effects secured. These activities were
followed by others of a similar nature against roving gangs&mdash;under
the Commandants Brand, Kolbe, and Joubert&mdash;which infested
the country east of the railway, between the Caledon River on the
south, and the line Edenburg-Reddersburg-Dewetsdorp on the
north. Fights and skirmishes and snipings continued almost daily,
and the columns of Colonels Rochfort, White, and Du Moulin had
no reason to complain of lack of excitement. On the west of the
railway, Colonels Williams and Byng continued to sweep the districts
of Fauresmith, Jacobsdal, and Philippolis.

MAJOR-GENERAL C. KNOX, ORANGE RIVER COLONY (CENTRE)

General Charles Knox, in accordance with the scheme of General
Elliot&#8217;s operations, remained in the Senekal district till the 10th of
May, when he arrived on the railway. On the 13th his force was
again on the move in the direction of Bothaville, in order to frustrate
some parties of Boers who were seeking to evade the troops then
operating near Klerksdorp, and to return to the Orange Colony. It
was not long before the advance column under Colonel Pilcher
came in touch with them. At a place called Allettasdraai, on
the Valsch River, they were discovered, dealt with smartly and decisively,
and driven south-west towards Zandspruit before Colonel
Thorneycroft and his nimble band. After this period General Knox
concentrated his force, and marched back to the railway with a view
to acting in co-operation with General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s enveloping
movement before described. During this movement Colonel Pilcher
was continually engaged with either Commandants Jacob or
Erasmus, emerging from the various frays with waggons, stock,
and prisoners.[Pg 58]

Colonel Henry, who moved his force from Jacobsdal to Christiana
at the conclusion of General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s operations, was now
placed under General Knox&#8217;s orders. Together with the Kimberley
column he operated in the region between Bloemhof and Hoopstad,
with the result that between the 2nd and 7th of July 52 prisoners,
50 horses, 64 vehicles, and over 7000 cattle were captured, 2 Boers
were killed, and 55 surrendered.

Colonel Pilcher from Boshof moved to Bultfontein on the 18th
of June, Colonel Thorneycroft taking simultaneously the same
direction. During the advance Colonel Pilcher came in for hot
work. On the 19th, while watering his cattle, he was attacked by
400 Boers, who, under cover of the smoke of a veldt fire, attacked
the rearguard. These retired in good order, firing by sections.
They were then relieved by the Mounted Infantry, who sent the
guerillas flying, leaving seven of their number behind. The next
day from a small kopje the fugitives became aggressive, and were
charged by a detachment of Yeomen, who routed them, but on the
morrow they were again found in some strength near Badenhorst
Farm. The East Yorkshire Mounted Infantry, therefore, charged
their position and dispersed them.

While Colonel Thorneycroft escorted prisoners and stock to
Brandfort, Colonel Pilcher moved on in the direction of Hoopstad.
Colonel Thorneycroft then searched the bed of the Vet River (west
of Smaldeel), unearthing waggons and cattle which were hidden
there. Towards the end of June the columns of both Pilcher and
Thorneycroft were concentrated at Brandfort in order to recuperate
before fresh undertakings in the easterly direction, which began on
the 1st of July.

[Pg 59]

CHAPTER VIII

LORD METHUEN, TRANSVAAL (SOUTH-WEST)

The Boers (who had been concentrating for a month at
Hartebeestefontein), before the enveloping columns of Lord
Methuen and General Mildmay Willson, now left their
strong positions and scattered to the west. On the 8th
of May some were brought to a stand at Leeuwfontein by
General Babington with his smart New Zealanders, Bushmen, and
Imperial Light Horse, while others were driven into General Dixon&#8217;s
net at Putfontein. Thus many captures were effected. Besides
the fight of the 8th there was another near Korannafontein on the
10th with a detachment of Colonel Williams&#8217; force.

Lord Methuen and Sir Henry Rawlinson, after chasing the
enemy in the west, moved to Mafeking and Maribogo respectively.
General Babington and Colonel Williams by a southerly route returned
to Klerksdorp, and General Dixon on the 25th took up his
old position at Naauwpoort (south of the Magaliesberg). Seventy
prisoners, twenty-six surrenders, 102 vehicles, and much stock were
the results of these combined operations.

Attention next turned to Wolmaranstad, where Delarey was
reported to be, and which place was now called by the Boers their
capital. Rawlinson from the west, and Williams, accompanied by
General Fetherstonhaugh (who had relieved General Babington)
marched thither from Klerksdorp, while Lord Methuen guarded the
exits towards the north. Colonel Rawlinson entered Wolmaranstad
without opposition, joined hands with General Fetherstonhaugh,
and proceeded towards Klerksdorp, after having marched (since
the 6th of May) 387 miles. By way of interlude he captured a small
laager near Cyferkuil, thus making his haul consist of 17 prisoners,
3000 head of cattle, 29,000 sheep, and 400 horses. Forty Boers
and many families were also brought in. At the same time Lord
Methuen, working from Korannafontein, chased a roving commando
which was trekking towards Lichtenburg. The fruit of
the united activity represented 56 prisoners, 40 horses, and over
100 vehicles, besides stock in abundance. An animated fight took
place on the 23rd, over a convoy moving from Potchefstroom to
Ventersdorp. The Potchefstroom convoy got as far as Witpoortje,
where it was met by the Ventersdorp section. This section was
about to leave Witpoortje on its way to Ventersdorp when it was[Pg 60]
attacked by 300 Boers, who fought the fight of the famished.
Instantly the Potchefstroom section returned to the rescue, and
reinforced the Ventersdorp force with fifty men of the Welsh
Fusiliers and twenty of the Imperial Light Horse. The Boers
driven off, the convoy then proceeded, but again at Rietfontein
Drift the guerillas, some 400 of them under Liebenberg, made a
desperate rush upon the coveted supplies, three waggons of which
had broken down in the scrimmage.

The escort were hard pressed&mdash;losing four men killed and two
officers and thirty-one men wounded&mdash;but their endurance and
gallantry stood every test. The garrison of Ventersdorp sent out
fifty men to clear the front of the convoy, and finally brought it back
in safety. At one time it seemed as though the convoy was lost,
but it was recaptured by dint of hard fighting. Captain Purchas
(2nd Battalion South Wales Borderers) especially distinguished
himself, Captain Hay (Royal Welsh Fusiliers) was wounded, and
Lieutenant Wells (Loyal North Lancashire Regiment), Lieutenant
Bankes (Imperial Yeomanry), and Second-Lieutenant Smith (78th
Battery R.F.A.), who were in the thick of the fray, had narrow
escapes, owing to the prodigious energy with which they tackled
the marauders.

The work of clearing the right bank of the Vaal towards
Klerksdorp was next undertaken by General Fetherstonhaugh and
Colonel Williams. A successful action on the 24th against Van
Rensburg&#8217;s banditti enabled the force to march into Klerksdorp
with twenty-four prisoners, 6200 rounds of ammunition, and thirty ox
waggons. Thirty-five Burghers surrendered in course of the march.

General Dixon, veering west from Naauwpoort, made a search
for guns and ammunition, which had been buried in the neighbourhood.
From his camp at Vlakfontein[3] he moved on the 29th of
May to Waterval, where, on a farm, he found the spot where the
guns had been buried. The weapons themselves had been
removed. Near here ammunition was found, but it was too late in
the day to attempt to unearth it. The enemy was hovering all
round the region, and it was deemed advisable to return to camp
before making a lunge at them. The camp in the absence of
General Dixon was well guarded, and in a good defensible position,
and there was no reason to believe that the hovering Boers could
quickly mass in any large number.



THE ENGAGEMENT AT VLAKFONTEIN: THE DERBYSHIRES RE-TAKING THE GUNS AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET

Drawing by R. Caton Woodville


As the centre (with which was General Dixon) was crossing the
valley towards camp, the firing which had all day been going forward
in the direction of the rearguard[4] became louder and louder. Then[Pg 61]
suddenly the hilly ground on which was the rearguard became
apparently enveloped in fire, the veldt blazing and smoking, and
seeming to impose a flaming curtain between one portion of the
force and the other. The rolls of artillery now increased, and
presently a messenger from Major Chance reported that he was
hard pressed. The Boers, under cover of the smoke, had come
up in great numbers, rushed upon and surrounded the guns, killing
the gun teams and&mdash;after a desperate struggle&mdash;most of the section
in charge. According to the much-contested statement of Reuter&#8217;s
Correspondent: &#8220;A lieutenant and a sergeant-major were made
prisoners, and on their refusing to give information as to the
working of the guns they were shot. Their gallant conduct undoubtedly
saved many lives, for the enemy actually turned the
guns on our troops, but the shells failed to explode, as the pins
had not been withdrawn.&#8221; This statement could not be
corroborated, as those concerned were dead, but support for it
is found in the assertion of a private, who stated: &#8220;They asked
the officer in charge to surrender, but he replied, &#8216;A British soldier
does not know the meaning of surrender, and if you want guns
you will need to shoot me and my gunners!&#8217; Thereupon the
enemy shot the officer and gunners, and captured the two guns,
and then turned them on us.&#8221; At this juncture General Dixon,
who had sent off Colonel Duff and his troops to the succour of
Major Chance, and himself had been galloping across the valley
to the scene of action, came to the rescue. On arrival at the west
picket of the camp, he found the situation was critical in the
extreme. The two guns and howitzer which had been with him
were in action west of the picket, and these, together with the company
of the Derbys which had been on picket and the details left in
camp, were hotly engaged. Some of the enemy were within 800
yards of the picket, while others at 1600 yards range were shelling the
British camp and guns. It now became evident that the guns of the
rearguard were captured! Colonel Duff, advancing with two guns
(8th Battery), 200 Scottish Horse, and two companies of the
King&#8217;s Own Borderers with a Maxim, now hastened across the
valley, and a general advance was made. The Derbyshires were
ordered to retake the guns, and this was brilliantly accomplished.
By successive rushes they swept on and on, till the Boers,
hearing the roar and seeing the red flash of bayonets in the firelight,
took to their steeds, mounted and galloped off as hard as legs
would carry them. The guns were recaptured, but the ground was
littered with wounded and dead, some of whom had met their fate
at the hands of the Boers after they were stricken helpless on the
veldt. A trooper of the Imperial Yeomanry, writing of this, said:
&#8220;It was an awful affair; I thought every one of us was going to get[Pg 62]
killed. There were dozens of poor fellows murdered after they were
wounded. I expect the newspapers have told all about it. I hope,
please God, I shall never see anything like this again. It was an
awful sight. We had been on the trek all last month with General
Dixon&#8217;s column.... The night after the fight we had to saddle
up in quick time and do a night flit, as the Boers were surrounding
our camp. We got away quite safe without the Boers knowing it.
We left all the tents standing, so as to make them believe we were
still there, but we had to leave our wounded.&#8221;

General Dixon marched from Vlakfontein on the night of May 30
to Naauwpoort, leaving the hospital, which contained many serious
cases, to be moved by daylight on May 31 along a good road leading
to Krugersdorp.

Several notable acts of gallantry were performed, among them that
of Captain Field (Scottish Horse), who went back at the risk of his
life to extricate two men who were unable to retire from the flames.
It was a day of many heroes&mdash;McDougal, a noble fellow who gave
his life; West, another splendid officer of Field Artillery; Captain
Browne of the Border Regiment; young Manby, who charged with
the dashing &#8220;Derbys&#8221;; and Willyams of the Imperial Yeomanry,
who was among the missing&mdash;these are only some of the number
who made themselves distinguished in this bloody hour. The
officers killed besides Lieutenant McDougal (28th Battery R.F.A.)
were Captain Armstrong, 7th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry, and
Lieutenants Laing, Noke, Campbell, Campion (Imperial Yeomanry).
Among the wounded were Captain Sadler, Lieutenants Gibson,
Armstrong, Rimington (Derbyshire Regiment), Surgeon-Captain
Welford, and Lieutenant Hern (Imperial Yeomanry). Of the men,
forty-four were killed and seventeen succumbed to their injuries.
The total wounded was 115.

A trooper wrote the following description of the day&#8217;s fighting:
&#8220;About midday the Boers fired the veldt, and we were
stationed just in front and could not see. Suddenly the enemy
rushed through, after giving us a volley. Dozens of our men and
horses went down, and I had the worst two hours of my life. Just
as we had the order to retire a chap close to me was thrown from
his horse. I caught the animal with the intention of taking it back
to the owner, but a bullet passed through my coat and grazed my
horse, making the animal turn sharply, with the result that the other
horse pulled me clean out of the saddle and knocked the wind out
of me. I lay there with our men being shot down by dozens. The
sights I saw were beyond description. Boers shot our fellows down
in cold blood. Dozens of them were simply murdered. They
threw down their arms, and the Boers walked up to them and shot
them in cold blood. I lay for some time as if dead, but eventually I[Pg 63]
joined some foot soldiers and we captured our guns again. An
awful thing was that many wounded were burned to death in the
veldt fire. The devils used explosive bullets, and some of the
wounds were dreadful.&#8221;

One of the Scottish Horse said: &#8220;We rushed up the ridge and
shot down any one who came in front of us, and managed to recapture
the guns. It was a most bloodthirsty and murderous battle.
The enemy were not content with wounding our men, but they
started shooting and clubbing our wounded.&#8221; On this subject
Lieutenant Duff (Imperial Yeomanry) collected the evidence of
various officers and privates of the Yeomanry and the Derbyshire
Regiment, who were eye-witnesses to the acts of atrocity committed
by the Boers. He provided Lord Kitchener with the following information.
The day after the fight at Vlakfontein, on May 29,
he was conversing with Lieutenant Hern, also of the Imperial
Yeomanry, who had been badly wounded in that engagement
and has since been invalided home to England. Lieutenant
Hern told him that while he was lying wounded on the ground
he noticed about twenty yards from him Lieutenant Spring and
Sergeant Findlay, both of the Imperial Yeomanry. They were
both slightly wounded, and were binding up each other&#8217;s wounds,
when a young Boer, wearing a pink puggaree round his hat, came
close up to them and shot them both dead. This Lieutenant Hern
saw himself. He lay quite still, and the Boers, thinking him dead,
contented themselves with taking his spurs and leggings.

Lieutenant Hern also said that the same day others of our
wounded were deliberately shot by the Boers.

The enemy, numbering 1500, were under the command of
General Kemp.

On receipt of the news of this engagement General Fetherstonhaugh,
with the columns under Colonels Sir H. Rawlinson, Williams,
and Hickie, hurriedly pushed north from Klerksdorp so as to deal
with Commandant Kemp&#8217;s barbarians, while General Gilbert Hamilton&#8217;s
force moved by rail from Greylingstad to Krugersdorp, and
General Methuen marched from the neighbourhood of Zeerust
towards Doornkop. But on the approach of the troops the Boers
began flying westward. Subsequently it was reported that Kemp
and Beyers intended to join hands in the Waterberg district,
consequently General Dixon proceeded through Olifants Nek to
block the passes north of Rustenburg, while General Fetherstonhaugh
continued to scour the rugged region west of the Magaliesberg.
Near Roodeval on the 9th of June he caught them, seized seventeen
prisoners, thirty-three waggons and a quantity of ammunition, and
sent the rest scudding northwards. Still scouring the country he dis[Pg 64]persed
Boers right and left, and finally returned to Klerksdorp with
Colonels Rawlinson and Hickie, while Colonel Williams was directed
to Krugersdorp to refit. Curiously enough, in the course of these
operations over country which had for some months been unexplored
by the British, Boers in certain regions were discovered
peacefully ploughing and sowing on their farms. They effected
to believe the war had ended in their favour, but made no demur
on being invited to surrender. Reuter&#8217;s Correspondent gave the
following sample of a conversation which ensued when the Magistrate
announced his intention of administering the oath of allegiance to
Burghers of the conquered territories desirous of taking it.

Does taking the oath render military service against our own
people compulsory?&mdash;No; but British subjects are expected to
defend their town in case of attack.

What difference is there between the oath of neutrality and the
oath of allegiance?&mdash;The first effaces a man&#8217;s nationality; the
second renders him a British subject.

Will the oath prejudice any claim against Great Britain?&mdash;No.

Will the oath confer the full rights of a British subject?&mdash;Yes.

(Here the Boer could study the policy of the British versus that
of the late South African Government. Political equality on the
one side, and long years of apprenticeship as subject of the Republic
on the other!) The next question was:&mdash;

Will those taking the oath now have any advantages over those
taking it later?&mdash;No.

If a Burgher takes the oath now, and his property outside is
destroyed by the enemy, will he receive any compensation?&mdash;Great
Britain repudiates legal liability, but invites claims, which will be
brought before a commission.

To resume. Colonel Allenby and General G. Hamilton had
meanwhile been clearing the Hekpoort Valley and Breedts Nek in
the Magaliesberg. That work successfully accomplished, they moved
viâ Tafel Kop and Ventersdorp to Klerksdorp. The rest of June was
spent in operations against Kemp&#8217;s guerillas in this region, and the
month ended with the breaking up of a commando which had gathered
in the Hartebeestefontein Hills. Lord Methuen, after the dispersal
of the enemy, employed his troops in escorting convoys to Zeerust.[5]
Early in July he attacked, on the north-east of Zeerust, a gang of[Pg 65]
Boers, with stock and waggons, captured forty-three prisoners,
thirty-seven rifles, and forty-six waggons. His casualties were two
wounded. The Boers lost three killed, while three surrendered.



A NON-COMBATANT HERO&mdash;AN ARMY DOCTOR AT WORK IN THE FIRING LINE.


At this time, 7th July, Colonel Allenby was moved to the north
of Krugersdorp for the purpose of sweeping, in co-operation with
General Barton and Major C. Williams, the line of Crocodile
River, which was harassed by Boers, who were doing their best to
oppose the establishment of posts which were to be occupied by the
South African Constabulary.

FOOTNOTES:

Regiment 100 strong, under Major Chance, R.A.

[5] The siege ended about the 22nd of May, when Lord Methuen arrived with a large convoy
and dispersed the Boers from the neighbourhood. As an instance of the change which
was taking place may be quoted the resolutions passed by some ex-Burghers in regard to the
attitude of the leaders of the Bond and of the Dutch Reformed Church towards the peace
delegates. &#8220;Considering the magnitude of the suffering which has already occurred from
the war, the fearful loss of life and treasure, the thousands of prisoners in exile in other
lands or in bondage in South Africa, and the multitude of refugees, both British and Boer,
whose homes have been broken up and who are surely being reduced to penury, and considering
further the loss and ruin in ever-increasing measure falling on the country, this
meeting thanks the Peace Committee for its benevolent efforts, and trusts that it will
endeavour to continue them, expressing at the same time its deep regret and indignation at
the attitude of Messrs. Andrew Murray, Theron, Sauer, and Merriman towards the peace
envoys and the future of the war. Their conduct must tend powerfully in the direction of
further bloodshed and increasing misery, and this meeting urges the military necessity of
absolutely suppressing all sedition by all the force which martial law affords, and of using
the utmost firmness to end this long protracted war, believing that peace alone can bring
true prosperity.&#8221;

CHAPTER IX

OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE DELAGOA AND NATAL LINES

General Bullock, early in May, engaged in the
task of chasing Boers who had been dispersed by
the operations of General Blood. Round Ermelo and
Bethel the scattered commandos of Botha attempted
to collect, but General Bullock, advancing through
Amersfoort, attacked and drove them from Ermelo on the 9th of
May. At this time General Blood&#8217;s columns under General W.
Kitchener and Colonel W. Pulteney were approaching Ermelo from
the north, therefore General Bullock disposed his troops along the
line Ermelo-Lake Chrissie, closed the road leading north-east, and
connected his right with General Blood&#8217;s force. Simultaneously
Colonel Rimington marched to join hands with General Plumer,
who was approaching Bethel from the west.

General Plumer, who had left Silverton, near Pretoria, on the
14th of May, to work in conjunction with Colonel Allenby (from
Whitbank) and Colonel E. Knox (from Greylingstad) against Boer
laagers near the source of the Wilge River, joined hands with both
the above-named officers at Krondraai, on the 16th and 17th of
May. At the rumour of British approach, the Boer laagers at once
broke up, their occupants dispersing towards south and east.
Colonel Allenby, on his way to Springs, encountered the Boer
rabble near Leeuwkop, and drove them south-east, while General
Plumer and Colonel E. Knox proceeded to join Colonel Rimington
at Bethel. Considerable opposition was met with en route, but
large numbers of prisoners were taken, together with a goodly
amount of stock, and gradually the Boers, who had made this
district a centre for their operations, found themselves empty and
shelterless.

General Plumer now extended the three columns at his disposal
on the line Bethel-Middelplaats, for the purpose of sweeping the
country down to the Vaal, and clearing the region between
Leeuwspruit and Kaffir Spruit.

The Boers at this period managed to collect in sufficient quantity
to make a violent lunge at a convoy proceeding between Whitbank
and Mooifontein, on its way to Standerton. The escort under
Colonel Gallway, consisting of detachments of Somerset and Munster
Fusiliers, 10th Hussars, and Queenslanders, suddenly found them[Pg 67]selves
attacked by 400 desperadoes, who made violent rushes
to get to close quarters. The resistance of the British band was
fierce as it was valiant, and, after a running fight lasting six hours,
the Boers were routed, with a loss to them of six killed and thirty
wounded. One British officer lost his life, and one was wounded.
Five men were killed and twenty-four wounded.



Map Illustrating the Operations between Delagoa Bay and Natal
Lines, May and June, 1901


General Plumer and Colonel Knox halted near Standerton, and
Colonel Rimington at Platrand, their columns, since leaving Bethel,
having secured 37 prisoners and 650 horses.

General Bullock, who on the 25th of May was joined by Colonel
Grey (from Standerton), now commenced a series of night raids on
various farmhouses along the banks of the Vaal, south-east of
Ermelo&mdash;excursions which were full of dash and daring, and resulted
in the capture of many armed burghers.[Pg 68]

June found both columns at Standerton. Five days later
Colonel Grey started on an adventurous hunt for a Boer gun, said
to be with a commando at Kaffir Spruit. On the 11th the force
surprised a Boer laager at Rietvlei, and after a vigorous fight nine
prisoners were secured. One Boer was killed and two wounded.
Colonel Grey, having thoroughly searched the district between
Ermelo and Bethel without finding a trace of the required gun,
returned to Standerton. From the 10th of June to the 4th of
July, General Bullock continued his clearance of the country,
dispersing Boer gangs east of Elandsberg down to the valley of
the Assegai River. He was then called in to the railway and
returned to Standerton.

BRIGADIER-GENERAL PLUMER IN THE EASTERN TRANSVAAL

General Plumer, as soon as he had refitted his troops at
Standerton, was again off to engage in further sweeping operations
against Boer knots in the region between Amersfoort and Piet
Retief. General Plumer, with Colonel Rimington on his right flank
and Colonel Knox on his left, advanced on the 1st of June on the
line Platrand-Springbokfontein-Uitkyk. By the 8th, all three
columns had reached the line Driefontein-Breda-Waterval Drift,
and thus, on the following day, the columns of Plumer (centre) and
Knox (left) were able to swoop from the north upon Piet Retief,
while that of Rimington (right), making a night détour, wheeled
round the south of the town and blocked all southerly exits therefrom.
But, warily, the Boers had made off, and the place was
deserted. Colonel Rimington, however, contrived to cut off a Boer
convoy which was hastily lumbering along towards the Vryheid
Road, accompanied by the escaping Landdrost of Piet Retief and
William Emmett, who were forthwith taken prisoners together with
twenty-eight more of their compatriots. Twelve waggons and 100
horses were also secured. Colonel Rimington then stationed himself
south-east of the difficult peaks of the Slangapiesberg, while they
were traversed by Colonel Plumer&#8217;s troops, who, having moved from
Piet Retief towards Wakkerstroom to meet a convoy, were now
proceeding over the dangerous heights. The whole force having
cleared &#8220;as far as practicable&#8221; this gibbose and frowning region,
moved to Paul Pietersburg, which was also found deserted. Near
Elandsberg Nek, however, Colonel Gallway, with some 300 Bushmen,
two companies of Munster Fusiliers, and some Sharpshooters,
with two guns of Q Battery, were assailed by 300 Boers, who were
strongly entrenched there. The enemy were speedily dispersed,
but Lieutenant Rudkin, R.H.A., was wounded in both knees, and[Pg 69]
narrowly escaped death, as a Boer bullet passed through the litter
while the wounded man was being carried from the field of
action. The columns finally converged on Utrecht. The prize
of their labours after leaving Piet Retief amounted to 21 prisoners,
232 horses, and 100 waggons. Twenty-six Burghers surrendered.



BRIGADIER-GENERAL THE EARL OF ERROLL.

Photo Elliott &amp; Fry, London.


Action was now taken by Colonels Rimington and Wing
against the enemy to north of Utrecht, in the valley of the
Pongola River. Colonel Rimington, on the night of the 26th of
June, marched towards Tiverton, while Colonel Wing made a
détour over the Elandsberg Pass to Schuilhoek. There, the
latter attacked the wandering hordes, driving them before him
up the valley, where they soon found themselves unpleasantly
warmed and welcomed by Colonel Rimington&#8217;s guns, which took
them in the rear. Away they went helter-skelter, leaving behind
them nine vehicles, 6500 rounds of ammunition, horses and
cattle in plenty, and six dead Boers. Three were captured.
Colonel Rimington, after immense activity around Wakkerstroom,
returned independently to Platrand, while General Plumer and
Colonel Knox from Utrecht marched towards Amsterdam
and Carolina, reaching Bothwell, near Lake Chrissie, on the 7th
of July.

In the meantime, on June 20, the Boers published the
following notice, dated Waterval, Standerton District, signed S.
Burger and Steyn, which showed they were still truculent:&mdash;

&#8220;As his Honour the State President Kruger and the Deputation
in Europe have not heard anything direct from our Government
since the conference between Commandant-General Botha and
Lord Kitchener at Middelburg, and as the Government of the South
African Republic deemed it advisable that they should be acquainted
with the state of affairs here, therefore, at request of the Commandant-General,
and with the kind compliance [?] of Lord
Kitchener, a private telegram was sent to them, in which the entire
state of affairs was fully described and intentionally put in the worst
light, for the means of making the advice of his Honour and the
Deputation the more weighty. On this his Honour informed us
that he and the Deputation have still great hopes of a satisfactory
end of the long struggle, that after material and personal sacrifice we
should continue the struggle, and that on their part all steps are
already taken and will still be taken for proper provision for the
captive women and children and prisoners of war. For discussing
and considering this answer of his Honour a conference of the
Governments of both Republics was arranged, at which were present
Chief Commandant C. R. de Wet, Commandant-General L. Botha,
and Assistant-Commandant J. H. Delarey. After a full revision of
the condition of military affairs represented by these chief officers,[Pg 70]
and thorough discussion of our whole cause by both Governments,
the following resolution was taken by both Governments, with the
advice of the said chief officers:&mdash;

&#8220;The Governments of the South African Republic and Orange
Free State, with the advice of the said chief officers, and taking
into consideration the satisfactory report of his Honour State
President Kruger and the Deputation in the foreign country, and
considering the good progress of our cause in the Colonies, where
our brothers oppose the cruel injustice done to the Republics more
and more in depriving them of their independence, considering
further the invaluable personal and material sacrifices they have
made for our cause, which would all be worthless and vain with a
peace whereby the independence of the Republics is given up, and
further considering the certainty that the losing of our independence
after the destruction already done and losses suffered will drag with
it the national and material annihilation [?] of the entire people, and
especially considering the spirit of unbending persistence with which
the great majority of our men, women, and children are still
possessed, and in which we see with thankful acknowledgment the
hand of the Almighty Protector, resolve that no peace will be made
and no peace conditions accepted by which our independence and
national existence, or the interests of our colonial brothers, shall be
the price paid, and that the war will be vigorously prosecuted by
taking all measures necessary for maintenance of independence
and interests.&#8221;

MAJOR-GENERAL BEATSON&#8217;S OPERATIONS

While General Plumer was at Bethel, General Beatson, who had
been watching the Middelburg-Bronkers Spruit line, moved to
Brugspruit. He then (with Colonel Allenby&#8217;s column from
Springs) marched south, on the 25th of May, towards the junction
of Olifants River and Steenkool Spruit in order to catch such
Boers as had escaped General Plumer. (Major Garratt, with a few
of Allenby&#8217;s men, during the advance from Springs, made good use
of his time, and secured, besides rifles and ammunition, eight
prisoners and waggons, a Colt gun, and forty mules.)

General Beatson, on the right bank of Olifants River, soon
came in contact with Trichard&#8217;s commando, which was strongly
entrenched on Vaalkrans. The Boers were hard pressed, and
had to run for it, leaving behind them, as usual, waggons and
stock. After this Allenby&#8217;s column, temporarily commanded by
Colonel Hippisley, searched the region of Brugspruit, found no
signs of the foe, and consequently returned viâ Wilge River Station
to Pretoria. General Beatson continued his operations in the[Pg 71]
direction of Bethel. A small force of the enemy was reported to be
at Boschmansfontein, consequently the General, then encamped at
Van Dycks Drift, detached a force to deal with them. Major
Morris, with four companies of Victorian Mounted Rifles and two
pom-poms, marched towards the laager and found it deserted. On
the 12th of June he was instructed to combine with the General in
an attack on the marauders to be made on the 13th at Elandsfontein.
Therefore the detachment the night before bivouacked at
Wilmansrust. No sooner had darkness fallen than the enemy,
evading the outposts, crept up to the bivouac, and within very short
range poured a deadly fire in on the astonished force. A scene
of turmoil followed. Rifles blazed, horses stampeded, and soon
the guerillas had rushed the camp and captured the pom-poms.
The struggle was desperate, and two officers and sixteen men were
slain, four officers and thirty-eight men wounded, while many men
were made prisoners. Only two officers and fifty men escaped to
General Beatson&#8217;s camp, though such as had been made prisoners
were afterwards released. Promptly to the rescue rushed the
General, leaving his baggage under guard of his infantry, but
though he arrived soon after daybreak on the 13th, the desperadoes
had made off, and not a vestige of them was to be seen. He therefore
concentrated his force at Koornfontein. The column later,
sweeping east, came in touch with General Blood&#8217;s force north of
Ermelo on the 19th, and from thence proceeded, clearing the
ground as they went, to Middelburg to refit. The total result of
the operations were, 16 Boers killed and wounded; prisoners, 23;
rifles, 160; ammunition, 10,850 rounds; 58 vehicles, and some
stock.

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR BINDON BLOOD.
EASTERN TRANSVAAL

In the middle of May General Bullock, as we are aware, was holding
a line from Lake Chrissie southwards. To co-operate with him
came General Blood on the conclusion of his operations north of the
Delagoa line.

By the 17th of May the columns of General W. Kitchener and
Colonel Pulteney were in touch with General Bullock near Ermelo,
and General Blood occupied Carolina with his cavalry. Finding
the enemy had scampered, operations were set on foot to clear the
country towards the East. Colonel Benson, marching south from
Belfast, crossed the Komati Valley, while Colonel Douglas, moving
from Machadodorp, viâ Uitkomst, operated between Komati River
and the railway. To stop the guerillas from fleeing north, and also
to check them attempting to fly south from the column of Colonel[Pg 72]
Park (which was scouring from Lydenburg and the difficult
ruggedness of the Mauchberg towards Nelspruit), General Spens
kept a watchful eye at Nelspruit. General Blood at this time had
accounted for four Boers killed, eighteen captured, and nine burghers
surrendered, and the number was greatly augmented by the
combined movement which followed.

General Spens then proceeded (on the 10th of June) to operate
in the mountainous districts surrounding Machadodorp, Lydenburg,
and Nelspruit. He and Colonel Park swept north-west
of Nelspruit, while Colonels Benson and Douglas cleared the
country north-east from Machadodorp. The reward of the combined
efforts, which were quite herculean in view of the region
traversed, was 17 Boers killed, 48 prisoners captured, 107 rifles,
38,700 rounds of ammunition, 266 vehicles. Large quantities of
stock were seized.

In consequence of the attack before mentioned on Major Morris
and the Victorians at Wilmansrust on the 12th, General Blood
moved west from Carolina with all available troops. He formed
two columns, composed of General Babington&#8217;s cavalry and the 1st
King&#8217;s Royal Rifles under Colonel Campbell, and directed General
W. Kitchener and Colonel Pulteney, who by this time were at
Amsterdam, to follow in all haste.

General Blood made his headquarters a few miles north of
Ermelo, and established signalling communication with General
W. Kitchener and General Beatson. On the 19th of June General
Beatson reached headquarters, and the column, accompanied by
General Blood, from thence proceeded to Middelburg (which was
reached on the 25th) to be reorganised. Meanwhile the column of
Colonel Pulteney went to Carolina to draw supplies, following
afterwards in the wake of General Babington, Colonel Campbell,
and General W. Kitchener, who were moving west to the line
Middelkraal-Uitgedacht, north of Bethel. These columns were
soon joined by General Blood with a convoy.

On the 31st the troops moved from Middelkraal towards Springs
in the following positions: Campbell on the right marched on
Kleinkoppie, Babington on Roodepoort, and Kitchener on Grootpan.
The last officer on the 3rd of July opened up communication
with the columns of Colville and Garratt (the last had relieved
Colonel Grey), which were moving up from Standerton and Greylingstad
respectively.

Vigorous measures were being taken to prevent Viljoen and
other Boer leaders from escaping to the east. The dispersed
hordes were collecting in their numbers near Middelburg, and to
be beforehand with them Colonel Benson hurried from Machadodorp
to Dullstroom, Colonel Park from Lydenburg turned westwards so[Pg 73]
as to hem in the enemy from the north, while General Spens&#8217; column
hovered at Wonderfontein ready to pounce as circumstances might
suggest.



THE MISHAP TO THE VICTORIANS AT WILMANSRUST, JUNE 12, 1901

Drawing by R. Caton Woodville


On the north-west of Machadodorp Colonel Benson soon came
in touch with the foe; caught him at Vlakfontein, twelve miles out,
handled him vigorously, and killed six of his band. One prisoner
was taken. The British lost three men, and eight wounded. This
was on the 3rd of July. On the 7th Viljoen, with the Johannesburg
and Middelburg commandos, again attacked the column at
Dullstroom, but got the worst of it, and had to flee, followed up
hill and down dale, through ravine and bush, by the dashing little
force. General Spens from Wonderfontein now took up the chase,
but Viljoen, intimately acquainted with the country, contrived to
become as slippery an eel as De Wet, and to make off on the now
proverbial Boer principle of those who fight and run away live to
fight another day.

ACTIVITIES AROUND STANDERTON AND HEIDELBERG

May in the district between Standerton and Ermelo was opened
by a smart affair which resulted in the capture of eight prisoners, a
Maxim Nordenfeldt machine gun, fifteen rifles, twelve waggons, and
fifteen horses. The force under General Clements had for some
little time been engaged in Boer-hunting in the region north-east of
Standerton on the right bank of the Vaal. On the 4th May a laager
was located, and while troops detached from Standerton and Platrand
blocked the roads leading south from the river, Colonel Colville with
his column made a night march towards it, along the Standerton-Ermelo
road. The surprise was complete, and the Boers opened
their eyes to dawn and desperation at one and the same moment.
Those who were sufficiently nimble scattered to the four winds, the
remainder were seized. Pursuit was impossible, owing to the already
fatigued state of Colonel Colville&#8217;s men. This column, which was
composed of 2nd Division Mounted Infantry, 2nd Johannesburg
Mounted Rifles, 63rd Battery R.F.A. (4 guns), &#8220;O&#8221; Section
pom-poms, 2nd East Surrey, 1st Auxiliary Company A.S.C., 2nd
Brigade Field Hospital, and 2nd Brigade Bearer Company, was now
strengthened by four squadrons of regular cavalry. Colonel Colville,
commanding this entire force, then spent the remainder of May in
operations in conjunction with General Elliot, who was moving
through Vrede to the Natal Border. Colonel Colville&#8217;s route lay
from De Lange&#8217;s Drift up the right bank of the Klip River through the
Verzammelberg. On nearing the junction of the Klip and Ganzvlei,
Colonel Colville crossed into Orange River Colony, fought more[Pg 74]
Boers, captured more stock, and after having made an enormous
haul, retraced his steps to his starting-point, De Lange&#8217;s Drift.

The early part of June was spent in sweeping down the right
bank of the Vaal towards Villiersdorp, clearing farms and denuding
the district of supplies. On the 22nd Colonel Colville marched
north from Val Station to act on the left flank of Colonel Grey&#8217;s
column, which was operating against the enemy between Standerton
and the west of Bethel. Towards Watervalshoek the two forces
converged, and from here, on the 25th, Colonel Grey&#8217;s Queenslanders
and New Zealanders drove off some 400 of the enemy. After this
dashing exploit Colonel Grey moved to Greylingstad to fill up
with supplies, and Colonel Garratt (as has been said in the
narrative of General Blood&#8217;s movements) took over command
from Colonel Grey. Colonel Colville remained near the scene
of the fight, so as to connect with General Blood&#8217;s columns which
were due from the north-east. Colonel Garratt, keeping west
of Colonel Colville, and in communication with him, moved north
viâ Boschmankop to Springs. Colonel Colville at Watervalshoek
got in touch with General W. Kitchener, who, as we know, reached
Grootpan on the 3rd of July.

CHAPTER X

LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GRENFELL&#8217;S OPERATIONS&mdash;TRANSVAAL,
N.

While Colonel Grenfell was occupying Pietersburg
at the extreme limit of the northern line, news came
in that small hordes of Boers were moving in the
Zoutpansberg district. It was decided to head off
this northern trek, consequently Colonel Grenfell
with 600 of Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts, 12th Battalion Mounted
Infantry, two guns and four companies of the 2nd Battalion Wiltshire
Regiment, made an expedition into the bush veldt to the north
of him. His destination was a small township called Louis Trichard,
some hundred miles off. Here Colonel Colenbrander, commanding
the advance force (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts), arrived on the
9th of May. From this time, after disarming the Boers in the
town and clearing the surrounding country, Colonel Grenfell was engaged
in the pursuit of marauders who were pushing east towards
the Portuguese frontier. Yzerberg was reached on the 17th. On
the 19th the dashing Scouts, who had continued their way successfully,
skirmishing with and dispersing Boers, performed a feat more
smart even than was their wont. Colonel Colenbrander, hearing that
a laager was comfortably ensconced at Klip Spruit, planned a midnight
excursion to the locality, and surprised Field-Cornet Venter
and seventy-two burghers who imagined they were sleeping the sleep
of the just. Before they could awake from their delusion their persons,
waggons, rifles, and ammunition were at the mercy of the
adventurous British scouts. This same party on the 21st seized on
a smaller laager and swelled their number of captured vehicles.

On the 23rd, at the request of Commandant Van Rensburg and
Field-Cornet Du Preeze, Colonel Grenfell met them, accepted their
surrender, and that of some 1500 of their followers, and in a short
time marched them back to Pietersburg. With them came seventy
waggons and quantities of forage and ammunition and stock. This
was a highly satisfactory and pacific termination to the operations
in this quarter, and Colonel Colenbrander was now able to turn
his attention to roving gangs which were hiding in the direction
of Buffels. Several of these groups were encountered, and in various
skirmishes seven Boers were disposed of and a Maxim gun captured.
Major Knott, with a detachment of the Scouts, pursued and fell[Pg 76]
upon a commando under Barend Viljoen, made seventy-nine prisoners,
and secured 13,000 rounds of ammunition. Thus the work of
pacification in northern districts was progressing favourably, and
the Boers in the vicinity were learning that resistance was useless.
The grand total results of the Zoutpansberg excursion included
9 Boers killed, 150 prisoners, many hundred voluntary surrenders,
550 rifles, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, a Maxim gun, which had
belonged to the Jameson raiders, 175 waggons, and much stock.

While these activities had been going forward, General Beyers,
who had watched Colonel Grenfell&#8217;s departure for Louis Trichard,
decided that &#8220;while the cat was
away the mice could play.&#8221; He
accordingly collected his playful
burghers for purposes of mischief
around the Pietersburg line. To
frustrate him, Colonel Wilson, commanding
the 2nd Kitchener&#8217;s Scouts,
with two guns and two companies
of the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders,
concentrated at Naboom
Spruit, while from Pretoria Major
M&#8217;Micking, with 400 Mounted Infantry
and two guns, was moved to
Nylstroom. The combined operations
began on the 19th of May over
terrible country, which in some places
was without roads and in others was
seamed with ruts, obstacles, and bush.
The Boers, however, were overtaken some twenty miles north-west
of Nylstroom by Colonel Wilson, who succeeded in capturing
Field-Cornet Oosthuisen and 79 burghers, 100 rifles, 33,500 rounds
of ammunition, 66 waggons, a quantity of dynamite, and a vast
amount of cattle.



Colonel Colenbrander


Certain remnants of the Dutch gangs continued to hang about,
but these were promptly pursued to westward, and caught on the
21st. While Major M&#8217;Micking&#8217;s force demonstrated in front of the
Boer position, that of Colonel Wilson made an ingenious détour and
caught the enemy napping. The Dutchmen, however, made a stubborn
effort at combat; but finally, when Kitchener&#8217;s Scouts pressed
home the attack, they broke and fled, leaving 18 prisoners, 48 rifles,
9000 rounds of ammunition, and 44 waggons as trophies of the fight.
So much for the month of May. June began auspiciously, for a
detachment of the Scouts, moving from Warm Baths towards
Rooiberg, caught and sharply handled some 500 Boers under Nys and
Pretorius, and pressed them into the arms of Colonel Wilson, who[Pg 77]
on the following day polished them off. There was a good deal of
resistance and some warm fighting creditable to both parties, but in
the end 40 prisoners were captured, 70 rifles, 48 waggons, 8000
cattle, and ammunition in plenty. Thus the enemy was gradually
becoming bereft of transport and supplies, their capacity for conflict
becoming weaker day by day. Still Colonel Wilson and
Major M&#8217;Micking relaxed not an iota of their activity and vigilance,
and spent the remainder of June in scouring here and hunting there,
and protecting the Pietersburg line from any forces which might
congregate in the west. Meanwhile arrangements were made to
collect an additional force (Colonel Grenfell&#8217;s) at Potgieter&#8217;s Rust, so
that a combined attack on General Beyers&#8217; commando in the Zand
River Valley might be begun. On the 21st of June these arrangements
were complete. Colonel Grenfell marched south-west from
Potgieter&#8217;s Rust, menacing the enemy&#8217;s rear, while Major M&#8217;Micking
proceeded direct from Nylstroom. But owing to the terribly complicated
nature of the country which had to be traversed by Colonel
Grenfell&#8217;s force, Beyers&#8217; bandits were able hurriedly to scuttle to
cover in the north-west.

Colonel Grenfell, making Zandriverspoort into his advanced
base, then proceeded to sweep the surrounding country with his
troops. These, after numerous skirmishes and surprises, made a
magnificent march of forty miles, &#8220;rushed&#8221; a Boer laager at Hopewell
(at dawn on the 1st of July), and secured nearly 100 prisoners,
besides 2000 cattle, 2000 rounds of ammunition, and 100 horses!

SITUATION AND SKIRMISHES IN CAPE COLONY

The exciting series of chases between rushing Boer gangs,
followed or headed by small British columns, continued with undiminished
animation. The Boer leaders still in the field (if field
it can be called, while burrow would be the more appropriate term)
were Scheepers, Malan, Fouché, Kruitzinger, Lotter, Myburg,
Smits, Van Reenan, Lategan (a Colesberg rebel), Maritz, and
Conroy. Each of these was engaged in independent freebooting
excursions&mdash;the total number of their followers being now about
1200. They were unharassed by a fixed base of operations, and
lived from hand to mouth on such prizes as they could secure, or
such hospitality as they could receive from sympathetic &#8220;loyalists.&#8221;

Early in May Colonel Henniker attacked Scheepers, and drove
him north from Daggaboers Nek with considerable loss. The
remnant, however, broke back and hid in kloofs and ravines in the
difficult region around the Koetzeesberg. From their burrows they
were eventually dislodged, only to collect again on the 25th of[Pg 78]
May in the Camdeboo Mountains, situated to west of Graf Reinet.
Though their number was materially thinned in course of their hair-breadth
escapes from Henniker&#8217;s pursuing Victorians, they were
soon refreshed with new blood, some seventy raiders (Commandantless,
owing to the death of Swanepool) having flocked to Scheeper&#8217;s
banner. These now secreted themselves, offering very little fight,
and remaining cabined in their warrens, choosing a policy of
mischief rather than one of open aggression.

Meanwhile Colonel Scobell was tackling Malan and his followers,
who had remained to impede traffic west of Cradock. These
made themselves perpetually offensive, and, on the 2nd of May,
coming on Lieutenant Matthews and twelve men of the Diamond
Fields Horse, they attacked, and after having shot down their
horses, captured nearly all the party. Colonel Scobell came quickly
to their rescue, and eventually effected their release. So ingeniously
had this officer applied himself to the raider&#8217;s tactics that he now
succeeded in giving the wily ones a surprise. On the night of the
19th he marched in the direction of their laager, and before dawn
captured it, killing four marauders, and capturing the horses of forty&mdash;while
those who escaped did so on shanks&#8217; pony, or rode barebacked.
Malan himself fled to the west and amused himself for the rest of
the month in evading the chasing columns of Major Mullins and
Captain Lund. By the 25th of June he had gathered to himself
a sufficient commando to make it possible to attack Richmond, but
he met with stout resistance, and the next day, on the approach
of Captain Lund&#8217;s column, was glad to make himself scarce. On
the 27th Major Mullins, with some of Brabant&#8217;s Horse, caught
Malan&#8217;s commando between Cradock and Maraisburg, and succeeded
in wounding one of the leaders (Lieutenant Cloete) who was carried
into hospital at Cradock.

Colonel Haig at this time was busily engaged in directing
operations against Kruitzinger, Lotter, and Fouché, whose forces
were now swelled by some 500 Dutchmen who had been collected
by Kruitzinger during a hurried rush into the Orange Colony.
They occupied the neighbourhood north of Steynsburg, and so as to
enmesh them, if possible, Colonel Haig arranged a converging
movement of Cape Mounted Rifles, and the columns under Colonels
Munro, Gorringe, Crabbe, Scobell, and Murray. But the raiders
were too wily to show fight. They slowly dribbled away in the
surrounding country, most of them making towards Maraisburg.
But they were promptly headed off by the British troops, and took
refuge in the Bamboes Mountains, where&mdash;as a trooper expressed it&mdash;they
&#8220;lay doggo,&#8221; hoping to live by looting and to wear out the
vigilance of their pursuers.

In June, Kruitzinger, Lotter, Myburg, and Fouché succeeded[Pg 79]
in dashing across the Molteno railway, and moving eastward from
Cyphergat. Van Reenan broke north-west into the Steynsburg
district. The main body was followed by the British troops, but
they were not in time to save the strongly entrenched village of
Jamestown, which was captured on the 2nd of June. This contretemps
to ourselves was of splendid value to the enemy, for, in
addition to much-needed horses to the tune of 150, and ammunition
in quantities, they secured food and clothing at a time when they
were internally and externally bare, owing to the effective sweeping
operations which had denuded the country.

To pit against the Boer score came a signal success on the part
of Captain Lukin, who, with the brilliant Cape Mounted Rifles, had
been indefatigable in the work of pursuit, surprise, and skirmish,
that filled day and night during Colonel Scobell&#8217;s operations.

On the evening of the 5th, Colonel Scobell&#8217;s force (9th Lancers
and C.M.R. with three guns) moved out from Roodenek for the
purpose of hunting out a laager which was known to be somewhere
in the vicinity. With numbed fingers and quaking frames&mdash;the
thermometer stood below freezing-point&mdash;these gallant troopers
marched and clambered. Over rugged roads and precipitous paths
they went for miles and miles&mdash;on foot mainly, in order to keep
themselves warm&mdash;hunting and exploring around the north-west of
Barkly East, and ascending at last a mountain so high that it
seemed impossible to get the guns up. Then, near the summit
came the split and spurt of rifles, and the advance party knew that
the object was attained, the lair of the marauders was discovered.
The shots came from the picket, who, having made their protest,
fled. Now came the search for the laager itself, but whether it
was in the valley some 400 feet below, or whether close at hand, it
was impossible to say. A squadron of Cape Mounted Rifles,
under Captain Lukin, wheeled to the right, one under Captain
Purcell moved to the left. In the light of the moon, brilliant,
but casting deep shadows, it was impossible to detect any movement.
But the shuffle of hoofs could be heard in the valley.
On went the C.M.R., Captain Lukin ahead of them, when
suddenly this officer found himself in the thick of a volley. The
enemy, alarmed by the picket, had upsaddled and were alert. But
the heroes of Wepener were &#8220;all there,&#8221; as the saying is. A
shout from their commanding officer was enough, and with a rush
as of the wind, the C.M.R. (Captain Goldsworthy&#8217;s squadron) had
galloped on the foe. The Boers were off. Blankets, baggage,
rifles, clothing (much of the spoil captured from Jamestown), horses,
ammunition, all were left. Three wounded rebels fell into our hands,
and fourteen other Dutchmen. The enemy, from a distant hill, again
endeavoured to show fight, but their fire was eventually silenced by[Pg 80]
a few shells, and the Boers in full retreat were pursued as far as was
feasible by the Lancers.

A few days later, in the neighbourhood of Ladygrey, this
smart column came in for further triumphs. A detachment of the
C.M.R., which had been persistently sniped at by the enemy during
their moonlight march, showed that two could play at the game of
annoyance. They charged the hiding-place of the miscreants,
and surprised them by the shouts of &#8220;Hands up!&#8221; before they
were aware of their proximity. The result was that the dashing
Colonials returned to camp, after a quarter of an hour&#8217;s gallop,
plus twenty prisoners and 13,000 rounds of ammunition.

On the 9th of June, French, the magnificent, the indefatigable,
came once more to the scene of his first triumphs in the days before
the great coup made by the relief of Kimberley. He took but a
few weeks&#8217; holiday after his wholesale dispersal of Botha&#8217;s hordes
on the Swaziland border, and was again to the fore. Now, as
Lieutenant-General Sir John French, K.C.B., he directed the
operations of all the mobile columns extended over the face of
Cape Colony. Widened movements were necessitated owing to
the scattered state of the commandos which were now here,
there, and everywhere picking up rebels, and needing each to be
separately hunted by a detached column.

On the 17th, Kruitzinger and Lotter were caught in the first
instance by Colonel Munro, with Lovat&#8217;s Scouts and Bethune&#8217;s
Mounted Infantry, and later by Crabbe, some twenty-five miles
south-east of Maraisburg. Four Boers fell, twelve were wounded,
twenty-five horses were left on the field, and fifty captured alive.
Other captures included eight prisoners and a quantity of ammunition
and saddles. It was reported that Kruitzinger&#8217;s mongrel force at
the time consisted of 276 whites, 10 armed natives, and 18 armed
Hottentots, many of whom rode barebacked colts in the last stage
of emaciation. Four days later sixty of the Midland Mounted
Rifles, a Colonial corps which had done good work in the district,
were surrounded by Kruitzinger&#8217;s band and captured, after the loss
of two officers and nine men killed, and ten men wounded.



GENERAL BRUCE HAMILTON.

Photo Russell &amp; Sons, London.


Colonel Munro spent the remainder of June harassing raiders
under Myburg, north of Jamestown, and others under Erasmus,
east of Rayner Station. Colonel Scobell still chased Kruitzinger,
and strove to drive him into the arms of Colonel Crabbe, who was
engaged in hunting Van Reenan among the Bamboes Mountains.
Colonels Crewe, Doran, and Wyndham combined in operations
against Scheepers and Hugo, who were still dodging among the
Camdeboo Mountains, while Captain Lund flew after errant gangs
which had endeavoured to take Richmond and been repulsed by the
gallantry of the North Stafford Militia, under Captain Hawkshaw,[Pg 81]
and by the Town Guard. More troops were also engaged in
blocking the passes of the Drakensberg, through which Fouché had
gone east towards Maclear in the fond hope of gathering recruits
and fresh horses, and returning reinforced; but Colonel Dalgety, with
Cape Mounted Rifles and East Griqualand Rifles, frustrated him.
In the Calvinia district two gangs under Maritz and Conroy had
made themselves troublesome for some weeks, but eventually
Conroy, after being too warmly handled, particularly in an engagement
which lasted five hours, when Captain Ramsbotham and
Lieutenant Beresford of the Border Scouts tackled him near
Kenhardt, fled north across the Orange.

CHAPTER XI

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, S.&mdash;MAJOR-GENERALS BRUCE-HAMILTON
AND C. KNOX&mdash;JULY

Great success having attended the construction of the
line of defensible posts extending across the Orange
River Colony, from Jacobsdal to Ladybrand, a gradual
development of the blockhouse system was kept up in
order to maintain the security of traffic and form a
barrier to the encroachment of roving bands. A continuous line of
blockhouses at intervals of a mile apart, following the course of the
river from Aliwal North to Bethulie, and running from thence along
the railway viâ Stormberg, Rosmead, Naauwpoort Junction, de Aar,
to Kimberley was commenced in July, and another (starting northward
from Frederikstad to the source of the Mooi River, Breedt&#8217;s
Nek along the Magaliesberg) for the purpose of maintaining the
connection with the garrison at Commando Nek was begun at
the same time by two battalions under the command of Colonel
Mackenzie, Suffolk Regiment. Colonel Pilkington, with the South
African Constabulary, engaged in like activities to the east of the
Pretoria-Vereeniging line, his line of posts extending from Eerste
Fabriken, by Springs and Heidelberg, to the Vaal River. It was
thus hoped that between the Vaal and Modder Rivers, by means of
a converging number of columns, the Boers would be swept from all
sides against the British barriers and driven to surrender. To this
end the two forces of Generals Bruce-Hamilton and C. Knox were
operating in the Orange River Colony during the last half of July.

The former had thus disposed his troops. At Jacobsdal and
Luckhoff were Colonels Williams and Dawkins respectively, and
moving on Edenburg viâ Wepener, were Colonels Rochfort and
Du Moulin. Edenburg was reached on the 17th of July, after
which all the columns were moved west of the railway, to act as
a support to the barrier of police posts along the Modder from
Bloemfontein to Jacobsdal, garrisoned by South African Constabulary,
and also as stops to the enemy when pressed southward from
the Vaal River. To Colonel Rochfort was allotted the region
around Petrusburg; farther west (at Blaauwbank and Negdraai
Drifts on the Riet River) came Colonel Williams, while the line of the
Orange River (between Norval&#8217;s Pont and Ramah) was guarded by
the columns of Colonels Du Moulin and Dawkins. Colonel Roch[Pg 83]fort
very speedily reaped the reward of many days and nights of
vigilance. Rumour told of a burgher gang under Commandant
Myburg which, with a view to rushing into the Cape Colony, was
encamped on the Riet, and to defeat this programme he made
an arrangement as smart as it was successful. On the night of
the 27th of July, acting in concert with Colonel Lowry Cole (who
was under his orders in the vicinity), he marched in the small hours
to the spot&mdash;between Dassiespoort and Jagersfontein Drift&mdash;where
the laager had been located. Dawn found the enemy surrounded.
There was the usual rush, and roar, and scrimmage, in the course
of which Myburg was dangerously wounded. The commandant
was secured, together with his Field-Cornet, Kock, twenty-four of
his men, 100 of his horses, and many carts. Not less energetic
was Captain Going with a detachment of Mounted Infantry, who
at the same time was engaging Van den Bergs&#8217; gang in a laager
close by. A few days later (on the 30th) more prisoners and stock
were secured in the regions of Fauresmith by the combined efforts
of Majors Bogle Smith and Damant.

Meanwhile, from the 1st to the middle of July, General C. Knox&#8217;s
columns (Pilcher and Thorneycroft) scoured the country between
Brandfort, Senekal, and the Basutoland border, and, finding but few
of the enemy, Colonel Pilcher betook himself to Thabanchu, while
Colonel Thorneycroft went to Ladybrand. After the 17th the
troops, divided in four small columns and sprayed fan-like, were
sweeping toward the Orange, in search of straggling marauders,
Colonel Pilcher&#8217;s troops, under Major Kean and Colonel Taylor,
moving, viâ Reddersburg and Dewetsdorp, upon Bethulie (reached
26th July); while Colonel Thorneycroft&#8217;s columns (under Major
Copeman and Colonel Minchin) marched by the Smithfield Commissie
Drift, and Wepener Rouxville roads, to Aliwal North,
where they arrived on 28th. A not insignificant haul was the
result of this sweep, for, though little opposition was encountered,
some prisoners, 2300 horses, 1800 cattle, and 126 vehicles were
secured. These troops, at the end of the month, extended their
operations to the west of the line, into the area between the
railway and the Philippolis-Fauresmith Road; and, while Colonel
Thorneycroft, from Aliwal North, passed viâ Jagersfontein Road
Station and Kruger&#8217;s Siding towards Jagersfontein, Colonel Pilcher
marched West from Bethulie along the right bank of the Orange,
to Philippolis and northwards to Fauresmith. All the troops of
General Knox had reached the Fauresmith-Edenburg Road by
the 8th of August, Colonel Thorneycroft plus 28 prisoners, 1000
horses, 69 waggons, and much stock. They then were marched
south of the Riet River to act in conjunction with General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s
columns.[Pg 84]

These columns, in August (minus that of Major Damant detached
to help in General Knox&#8217;s operations of that period), continued,
in various portions of the south-west of the Orange River Colony,
to harass the commandos of Hertzog, Lategan, and Nieuwhoudt. A
brilliant surprise was prepared by Colonel Lowry Cole for Hertzog
on the night of the 24th. The enemy&mdash;his laager sheltered by a
protecting kloof&mdash;was reported to be comfortably ensconced near
Vaalhoek. Consequently the British band, marching in the small
hours and with the utmost secrecy viâ Liebenberg&#8217;s Pass, Slaghtkraals,
and Nitkomst, came at dawn to a point which commanded
the guerilla&#8217;s lair. The success of the man&oelig;uvre was complete&mdash;there
was the usual roar and rampage, the usual scurry and
hurry, the ringing of rifles and of hoofs, and, finally, 14 prisoners,
29 rifles, 54 saddles, 43 horses, and all the goods and chattels of the
foe were secured. The remainder of Hertzog&#8217;s crew of eighty
bolted towards Zootenberg.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, N.&mdash;MAJOR-GENERAL ELLIOT

While the sweeping operations were taking place in the south
of the Orange River Colony, General Elliot pursued his activities in
the north of it. From Springfield Drift on the Wilge River, his
three columns (under Brigadier-General Broadwood, Lieutenant-Colonel
De Lisle, and Colonel Bethune) moved between the Wilge
River and Liebenberg&#8217;s Vlei, while General Rundle&#8217;s force acted
in co-operation to the east of the Wilge. Beyond a rush on the
rearguard of the central column&mdash;De Lisle&#8217;s&mdash;shortly after it had
left Reitz, little opposition was met with. The troops then moved
towards Heilbron, the right column (Broadwood&#8217;s) passing through
Frankfort. During this march some brilliant episodes made the
12th of July eventful. In the first place Colonel Harrison, who had
energetically been hunting the enemy for some time past, planned
a night excursion which was so successfully carried forward that
his 300 Imperial Yeomanry returned with 12 prisoners, 9 carts,
and 60 horses! In the second, General Broadwood, warily backing
on Reitz to discover if the enemy, according to custom, had sought
refuge by closing in behind the line of march of the troops, had
some exciting and profitable adventures. He, indeed, almost landed
the big fish, Steyn, in the net which hauled in a shoal of government
officials of the late Free State. General Broadwood&#8217;s plan
was to surround the town of Reitz before daybreak, but owing to the
necessity of making a forced march of thirty miles to rear of the other
two columns and the unavoidable delay occasioned by loss of touch
by a connecting file during the night, three-quarters of an hour were
lost, and the troops, instead of approaching the town at their ease,[Pg 85]
were forced to gallop straight at it. The result was that, owing to
the fatigue of the horses, the biggest prize, Steyn, got safely away;
but his departure was ignominious. Seizing the first pony he
could find, coatless, bootless&mdash;a dilapidated picture of embarrassed
somnolence&mdash;he made off, carrying with him just his skin and his
beard, but leaving behind £11,500 (mostly in Orange Free State
notes), 800 sovereigns, and £32 in his waistcoat pocket, his official
papers (some remarkable and enlightening correspondence with the
leaders of the Transvaal Boers), his guerilla government officials,
together with Generals A. P. Cronje and T. B. Wessels, Commandant
Davel and Field-Cornet Steyn (his brother). Pursuit on
jaded horses was useless, therefore General Broadwood had to rest
content with the magnificent results he had already obtained. He
then returned to join his brigade&mdash;skirmishing by the way, but
suffering only two casualties&mdash;and took his place in General Elliot&#8217;s
line after having, during the short period of absence, covered sixty
miles of country. General Elliot, with only three of his force
wounded, reached the railway viâ Heilbron on the 16th of July
without further adventure, his total haul being 8 Boers killed and
wounded, 61 prisoners, 4000 horses, 3600 cattle, 5400 rounds of
ammunition, and many vehicles!

Before proceeding further, it is interesting to inspect the following
letters found in Steyn&#8217;s baggage, as they serve to throw light on
the situation at this time from the Boer point of view:&mdash;

From State Secretary Reitz, dated May 10, 1901, to Steyn

&#8220;Meeting held of Transvaal Government with Commandant Botha, Commandant Viljoen,
and General J. C. Smuts, considered condition of our country and following facts:&mdash;

&#8220;First.&mdash;Numbers of our Burghers are continually surrendering. This means more
and more to unsuccessful termination, as Government and officials left without Burghers
entails heavy responsibility on Government.

&#8220;Secondly.&mdash;Supply of ammunition so nearly exhausted that we shall be unable to
engage enemy in another big fight, we shall be brought to a state of helpless flight
unable to protect stock. In immediate future we shall be unable to feed our commandos.

&#8220;Thirdly.&mdash;On account of above, Government becoming weaker, losing support,
becoming disorganised.

&#8220;Fourthly.&mdash;Not only our nation will be destroyed, but it will also be considered
that leaders have erred, and all hope of continuation of national sentiment will be lost.

&#8220;Fifthly.&mdash;Hitherto nation and Government awaited result European complications
and mission of our deputation. Government feel most strongly their duty obtain
definite assurances.

&#8220;Having considered above points Government has determined&mdash;

&#8220;1. To obtain permission to send messenger to President Kruger point out terrible
condition country.

&#8220;2. If request refused we will ask for armistice to obtain opinion both nations of
future policy to put an end to present state of affairs. We leave it to you to suggest
other solutions, but you must carefully consider that this Government is convinced
that the time has passed for us to let matters drift on as at present, and that the
time has come to take the final step.&#8221; Usual ending. &nbsp; &nbsp; (Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Reitz.&#8221;

President Steyn&#8217;s reply (dated 15th May) acknowledges receipt
of letter; continues letter:[Pg 86]&mdash;

&#8220;Great blow to me. Month ago discussed matters with your Government, agreed not
to ask for armistice until things reached utmost extremity. Shall we obtain armistice?
I think nothing has happened entitle us to armistice to obtain opinion of our nations.
It is true Boksburg commando lost laager; General Viljoen was obliged to burn his,
and blow up his Long Tom; but in spite of this we have not come to last extremity.

&#8220;Free State been four months without cannon. I also know of men laying down
their arms, officers becoming cowardly. Our ammunition has long been scarce enough,
still [some] left to continue. You ask what prospect of successful termination. I ask
what chance was there for two small Republics when they declared war against mighty
power of England? You will answer, &#8216;We have trusted in God&#8217;s help and foreign
intervention. What reason have we for refusing to place further reliance on God?&#8217;
I have seen last European papers; I firmly believe complications will take place
in Europe within next few months, which will gain our good fortune. Knowing
leaders of our deputation, I cannot believe they would sit here without hope of
intervention, knowing how we struggle and strive, for I know they love their Fatherland
sufficiently to frankly ask the British to end the war if in their opinion intervention
is hopeless. The fact that these men remain in Europe convinces me that
our case is not hopeless. When armistice comes I shall ask opinion of my nation.
If they refuse to give in their determination will be mine also. I do not approve
of sending messenger to Europe, it shows our hand. I am deeply hurt you having
taken this determination without asking my advice and have acted so hurriedly. If
you have not despatched messenger do not do so until I can call my advisers. I have
sent for General De Wet; he will be here next week. I will then send you opinion.

&#8220;In your letter you say you are afraid your officers will be left alone on commando.

&#8220;Here officers may surrender, but Burghers will remain steadfast. I must point
out that the Orange Free State has not only spent blood and money, but will have lost
its freedom by trying to help the sister Republic, and all reliance of one Afrikander
on another will be destroyed for ever. It is ridiculous to think that when flooded
with scum of Europe, Afrikander spirit will remain. If we wish to remain a nation
now is the time to struggle. Hope you received Natal newspaper, stating Milner
going nominally on leave; truth being he not allowed a free hand. In later English
paper I have seen Kitchener and he cannot pull together.

&#8220;I enclose cutting Natal Witness&mdash;&#8216;Public mind in England getting very uneasy
about South Africa. There are possibilities which we are not at liberty to mention,
and would, if we were, we could not (sic).&#8217;

&#8220;All these things convince me we shall be destroying all hope for our nation if
we now surrender. Brothers, stand fast&mdash;take courage to your disheartened Burghers.
I have received verbal information that Commandant Hausbrock had engagement with
English, drove them back three times. As soon as I can call a council I will send
a reply; do not take any further steps till you have heard from me.&#8221; Usual ending
follows. &nbsp; &nbsp; (Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Steyn.&#8221;

Further activities were pursued between the 16th and 24th of
the month, when the troops were concentrated at Klerksdorp,
activities which had the twofold object of intercepting Boers who
might be fleeing before General Fetherstonhaugh&#8217;s force (which
was sweeping the area between Lichtenburg and Klerksdorp), and
of taking up assigned positions for the contemplated drive southward
from the line of the Vaal to the Modder. Here again the force
marched not empty-handed, 15 prisoners, 120 horses, 25 cases of
dynamite, stock, vehicles, and ammunition being the prizes of numerous
smartly-executed surprise visits by patrols. Viewing the
number of captures in the way of horses, it seemed difficult to comprehend
why more mobility could not be secured to the troops, but
in reality only 20 per cent. of the prizes were fit for remount
purposes, the remainder being brood mares, foals, &amp;c.

While General Elliot was placing his force in the position above[Pg 87]
described, precautionary measures had to be taken against a recrudescence
of mischief in the direction of Kimberley. Report spoke
of a contemplated reinforcement of the guerillas in the Cape Colony
by recruits from the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal.
General Smuts was associated with the movement, and the swelling
hordes were to join and pass through Hoopstad on their career of
devastation. Accordingly Colonel Henry, who was moving between
Bloemhof and Christiana, was appointed to keep an eye on the
Hoopstad district. On the 16th of July he crossed the Vaal at a
point some twenty-three miles south-west of Hoopstad, and promptly
secured some prisoners, waggons, and horses that were doubtless
about to form part of the reinforced commando. On the 24th, in
this district, he was joined by Major Paris, R.M.A., with the Kimberley
column, which he had summoned from Warrenton. This
officer on the way had come in collision with some 150 of the enemy,
and had succeeded, through the gallantry of Dennison&#8217;s Scouts, in
routing them from a strong position. The day after, effecting a juncture
with Colonel Henry&#8217;s force, he again came on the enemy under
Commandants Badenhorst and Erasmus, and Field-Cornet Van
Aswegan. The Boers were in some strength, but Major Paris&#8217;s
little force (consisting of 230 mounted men, 2 guns, a pom-pom,
and 30 infantry, carried in carts) was equal to the occasion. The
Boers were surrounded and attacked from three sides, and after a
running fight, in which the 74th Squadron Imperial Yeomanry, the
Kimberley Light Horse, and Dennison&#8217;s Scouts distinguished themselves,
the enemy dispersed with amazing celerity, leaving seven
burghers on the field and their field-cornet a prisoner. One of the
British party was killed and three were wounded.

Brigadier-General Gilbert Hamilton&#8217;s column was also on the
track of the raiders, he having moved from Klerksdorp to Wolmaranstad
(on the 21st) in order to fulfil his share of the hunt. At
Wolmaranstad he remained not long inactive, for the news of
slinking Boers in the neighbouring kopjes came to his ears, and he
quickly determined on a surprise visit to their haunts. The dawn
of the 26th found Commandant Potgieter and his hardy crew surrounded
in their laager at Blinklip, and General Hamilton, at the
cost of only two men wounded, succeeded in putting eleven Boers
out of action and securing ten more, together with waggons, horses,
and supplies.

Farther to the east on the line of the Vaal, Colonel Western&mdash;who
also had been at Klerksdorp&mdash;spent his time in reconnoitring
along both banks of the river to Venterskroom and back to Coalmine
Drift, where he was in a position to join the columns of Colonel Henry
and General Elliot, which were ranging themselves in readiness for
the main sweep south from the Vaal, on the west of the main line.[Pg 88]

General Elliot&#8217;s force was now swelled by the column&mdash;from
Klerksdorp&mdash;of Colonel Sir H. Rawlinson, and that&mdash;from
Reitzburg&mdash;of Colonel Garratt. From these three columns he organised a
fourth, consisting of 1st Dragoon Guards and two guns under
Colonel Owen.

Of Colonel Garratt&#8217;s movements prior to his operations in connection
with General Elliot at the end of July, a word must be said.
On the 9th of July he moved to the junction of the Wilge and Vaal
Rivers in order to demonstrate to the west of General Bullock, upon
the right flank of General Elliot&#8217;s troops as they marched through
Frankfort and Heilbron to the railway. Here, on the right bank
of the Vaal, he came on a Boer laager, captured it, and made several
prisoners. Later on, on the 21st, having filled up with supplies, his
mounted troops chased two Boer convoys which were trekking on
either bank of the Vaal near Lindique Drift, and succeeded in securing
twenty-five Dutchmen, together with their waggons, carts, and
cattle. Eleven of the enemy were killed and wounded in the fray.
Smuts was engaged on the following day, but he and his gang fled
to the hills, whence it was impossible to dislodge them. Finally,
with the assistance of Colonel Rawlinson from the north and General
Cunningham from Vereening, the Boers were routed from their snug
positions and forced to take to the plains. Eighteen, however,
were captured, and more waggons, horses, and cattle. Colonel
Garratt then took up his assigned position on General Elliot&#8217;s left.

To better understand the comprehensive nature of the general
sweep which followed, reference to a map is now desirable. In
General Elliot&#8217;s position on the 29th of July we have the Vaal River
at our back, the main railway line on our left, the
Kimberley-Mafeking
line on our right. The various columns were disposed
so that the right rested on the Vaal south of Wolmaranstad, and the
left (Rawlinson) at Vredefort. On the extreme right came Colonel
Henry at Hoopstad; in rear of the left on a wide front came Colonel
Garratt, for the purpose of netting fugitives who might break north.
In due time, as stops on the east (simultaneously with the advance
of Colonel Rawlinson), issued Major Pine Coffin and Colonel Barker
(from Kroonstad and Vet River Stations respectively), and as stop
on the west (to carry on and lengthen, as it were, Colonel Henry&#8217;s
right arm) came General Plumer, in the region between Boshof and
Modder River Station.

All the bristles being prepared, the great military broom commenced
operations on the 29th of July. The events of the end of
the month would make a volume of adventure of themselves. A
night march by General Broadwood to Bothaville&mdash;which was found
deserted&mdash;caused the fleeing Boers to rush helter-skelter into the[Pg 89]
net spread for them by Colonel de Lisle, who, with his smart
South Australians, had the satisfaction of taking possession of
eighteen prisoners and twelve waggons. A grand raid on a
farmhouse on the 30th of July was accomplished by Colonel Lowe
and the 7th Dragoon Guards, who, as reward of their enterprise,
secured eleven armed prisoners, together with their rifles, bandoliers,
and horses.



July 29, 1901.&mdash;General Elliot&#8217;s Sweep S. of the Vaal


Then, on the 2nd of August, followed a smart capture of a laager
near Graspan by some of Colonel Owen&#8217;s men (King&#8217;s Dragoon
Guards) under Captain Quicke. This distinguished and now
deeply lamented officer pursued the convoy for fourteen miles,
and though he had but seven men with him succeeded in capturing
it, though a large force of the enemy was at hand! His &#8220;bag&#8221;
consisted of 4000 cattle and 65 waggons. A dashing affray also
took place between 200 South Australians (under Major Shea, 15th
Bengal Lancers) and Smuts&#8217; commando near Vet River. The
Colonials, splendidly led by Major Shea, Captain Watt, and
Lieutenant M&#8217;Farlane, surrounded the farm in the dead of night,
and pressing forward on foot, with fixed bayonets, made a rush
on the commando. But the Boers had enmeshed their stronghold
with a wire network which served to delay the troops, during which
period most of the hostile gang were able to escape. But five fell,
and eleven were secured, including Field-Cornet Wolmarans of[Pg 90]
Potchefstroom, who was taken by gallant Shea himself. On the
following day (3rd) General Broadwood swept up 7 waggons and
2000 cattle, while Colonel Lowe, after undertaking an eighteen-mile
march, surprised a laager, secured 13 of its inhabitants, 86
waggons, and 56 horses. Tremendous hauls on the 6th and 7th of
August put Colonel Lisle in possession of 40 prisoners, 147 waggons,
600 horses, and 2000 cattle; and on the 8th Colonel Henry and
Lieutenant-Colonel Carr-Ellison (commanding 250 of the 4th
Imperial Yeomanry) succeeded in capturing two laagers and a
goodly knot of prisoners.

Meanwhile General Plumer, moving from the Modder River
Station on the 4th, had proceeded to effect a junction with Colonel
Henry. (How General Plumer came to be at Modder River at
this period must be explained. After his return from Carolina to
Bloemfontein in the second week of July, he had moved viâ Bains
Vlei, Kruger&#8217;s Drift, Poplar Grove, Koodoosrand, and Pandamfontein,
skirmishing often by the way, and reaching Modder River plus
11 prisoners, 200 cattle, and 62 horses.) Here his troops, divided
in two columns under Colonels Colvin and Sir John Jarvis, completed
the encircling cordon to the west. During the movement,
Sir John Jarvis, be it noted, after a twenty-five mile march, succeeded
in securing, near Botha&#8217;s Hoek, 15 Boers.

The details of General Elliot&#8217;s march are full of savour, of
heroism, and of activity; but the story of swoops, surprises, and
surrenders of raiders would outrun the limits of a volume. It is
only possible therefore to record the results, which, early in August,
showed that 17 Boers had been killed and wounded and 326 captured;
2600 horses, 20,000 cattle, 377 waggons, 371 other vehicles, and
12,500 rounds of ammunition had also been secured.

General Elliot, on the conclusion of his operations between the
Vaal and the Modder, withdrew his columns to east and west to
the railway to refit. He himself reached Truter&#8217;s Drift on the 9th
of August. General Plumer returned to Modder River Station;
Colonel Henry moved back to Boshof, and from thence to Luckhoff,
where he operated during August; and Colonels Rawlinson
and Western betook themselves to Glen and Bloemfontein respectively.
General Elliot&#8217;s programme was now to prepare at Glen
for a fresh advance to the north-east, of a line Ladybrand, Sannah&#8217;s
Post, Glen. But of this anon.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, E.&mdash;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
SIR L. RUNDLE

General Rundle, as we know, had marched north from Harrismith
simultaneously with General Elliot&#8217;s advance from Springfield Drift[Pg 91]
on the 4th of July. Till the 12th, the force, marching in three
columns, moved uneventfully to the line Tafel Kop-Maidstone-Driespruit.
But, on the 12th, the very day that Colonel Harrison in one
place and General Broadwood in another were trouncing the enemy
and putting them to flight, the Imperial Yeomanry came in for
some exciting experiences. It so happened that forty men of the
Yeomanry under Lieutenant Edgell left Colonel Harley&#8217;s (centre)
column to communicate with that of General Campbell (right).
Promptly Commandant Charles Botha got wind of the movement
of the small party and attacked them. But the plucky band, though
young Edgell, the sergeant, and four men were wounded at the first
volley, held their own, and finally the enemy was routed, leaving
their leader dead on the field.

The following account of a yeoman&#8217;s experiences serves to show
how Charles Botha met his death: it fails, however, to describe
the gallantry and resource of Corporal F. M. Grove, 53rd Company
Imperial Yeomanry, who, when the officer and sergeant were
wounded, took command, fortified a post, and kept off the Boers
till relief came:&mdash;

&#8220;The 12th of July I shall never forget. It was the worst day I have ever had. We
had reached camp and had done a good day&#8217;s work, having captured tons of mealies. It
was found that we could not heliograph to Rundle, who was sixteen miles on our right; so
they had to send a despatch, and our lieutenant with forty men had to take it. As we were
rounding Bothasberg we came face to face with fifty or sixty Boers. There was absolutely
no cover, and as it was too late to dismount there was only one thing to do&mdash;to charge.
That we did, splitting them in all directions. Had we been a cavalry regiment with swords
and known how to use them, we could have cut them to pieces. Our lieutenant, the Hon.
Wyatt Edgell, led us, whip in hand, and was the first to go down with a bullet in his leg
just above the knee. Shots were coming like hail. Charles Botha, who was at the head of
the commando, kept shouting, &#8216;Surrender! surrender!&#8217; but he was shot dead with one
bullet behind the ear and another in the shoulder. Six of his men stuck to him like glue,
but he was too big for them to get away, being about six feet one inch in height and weighing
seventeen stone. It is a marvel to me that we were not annihilated. We built a breastwork
of stones, being fired on all the time. When it was dark the guide made his way
back to camp for help, but the groans of the wounded throughout the night were horrible.
In the morning we were relieved, and the Boers came out under a flag of truce for half-an-hour
to bury their dead. We went to Vrede next, and after a day&#8217;s rest left that place in a
shocking state. We killed thousands of sheep and put them in every house. The stench
in a week will be horrible; it is to prevent the Boers from returning.&#8221;

The following day, in order to clear the line of advance from
Boers who were scurrying eastwards, General Rundle directed
Colonel Harley to close towards General Campbell in order to
strengthen the right flank, and on the 14th the hills south-east
of Vrede were occupied, and communication with Colonel Rimington
(who had marched to the latter place to catch the scattered
hordes that might be pushed towards him) was established.
General Rundle, with his own and Colonel Rimington&#8217;s prizes,
proceeded over the Klip River to Standerton and was joined by
Colonel Reay (left), who had crossed the Vaal at Robert&#8217;s Drift.[Pg 92]
His total haul, irrespective of the prisoners handed over by Colonel
Rimington, amounted to 13 prisoners, 7000 horses, 35 vehicles,
and 1000 tons of forage. Twelve Boers were killed and wounded.
The British force lost four men, while one officer and fifteen men
were wounded. From Standerton, having refilled with supplies,
General Rundle marched south on the 20th. Starting from
Bothaberg, south-west of Vrede, he moved to Witkoppies, some
thirty miles south-west of that town, and finally scoured the hilly
country lying between the Natal border and the Vrede-Harrismith
Road. The Boers, gnome-like, popped and &#8220;potted&#8221; from their
hiding-places, but cautiously kept from open battle; nevertheless,
General Rundle returned to Harrismith with 6 prisoners, 3590
horses, 679 trek oxen, and 4760 cattle. Twelve Boers during the
march had been killed and wounded.

On the 8th of August General Campbell marched with a column
(Grenadier Guards, Leinster Regiment, 1st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry,
and four guns and a pom-pom) through Retief&#8217;s Nek in
connection with a movement of General Elliot&#8217;s, which should have
driven the enemy into the Brandwater Basin, where General
Campbell would have secured them; but the Boers knowingly made
for the north, and thus General Campbell&#8217;s captures were limited to
waggons, carts, and horses. Colonel Harley meanwhile was employed
in escorting supplies from Harrismith to Bethlehem, which at
this date became the centre for a new column under Brigadier-General
Sir John Dartnell. This force consisted of two regiments
of Imperial Light Horse, specially equipped to ensure increased
mobility.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, N.&mdash;COLONEL RIMINGTON&mdash;BRIGADIER-GENERAL
BULLOCK&mdash;BRIGADIER-GENERAL SPENS

Of Colonel Rimington&#8217;s activities prior to his meeting with
General Rundle we barely know the outline. On the 13th of July
his troops displayed an immense amount of dash in a smart set-to
with some Boers who, with their convoy, were on the north-east of
Gambokshoekberg. The enemy&#8217;s rearguard covering the march was
forced from its position by the rapid rush of the mounted troops,
who scattered the band, killed six of the foe, took ten prisoners,
and 2000 head of cattle, which prizes were handed over to General
Rundle on the occasion of the meeting near Vrede, of which we
know. His hands free, Colonel Rimington then proceeded from
Vrede to Heilbron, skirmishing by the way. From this time till
August he operated in the triangle between Heilbron, Lindley,
and Kroonstad, engaging in the same energetic system of night
marching and surprise which was being everywhere vigorously[Pg 93]
carried forward, with first-rate results. Fourteen Boers killed, 36
prisoners, 24 voluntary surrenders, 68 ox-waggons, 52 vehicles,
5300 cattle was an excellent sum-total to bear witness to the work
accomplished at that time.

General Bullock meanwhile, in July, had been sweeping the
neighbourhood of Villiersdorp and Cornelia for the purpose of
brushing Boers into the arms of General Elliot during the move
of that officer from Springfield to Heilbron. But these wary Dutchmen
were wide-awake and not to be entrapped. He therefore
returned to Heidelberg, where General Spens took over command.
Flying columns under Colonel Jenner and Major Gough now went
to work with a will, and each column had the satisfaction of arriving
at Heilbron in August, having captured a convoy apiece with the
total loss of one man killed and four wounded. In the course of
General Spens&#8217; sweep from Heidelberg to Heilbron his troops
brought in 42 prisoners, 110 carts, 5600 cattle, and the supplies
before named. In August he left Heilbron and renewed his
activities in the direction of Kroonstad.

TRANSVAAL, S.W.&mdash;OPERATIONS OF GENERAL FETHERSTONHAUGH&mdash;CLEARING
THE MAGALIESBERG&mdash;JULY

In July Major-General Fetherstonhaugh&#8217;s force (in four columns,
under Brigadier-General Dixon and Colonels Sir H. Rawlinson, E.
Williams, and Hickie) operated from the Magaliesberg to Zeerust
(reached on the 10th), and from thence back to Klerksdorp. The
early part of the march was highly eventful, particularly for Colonels
Williams and Hickie, who were repeatedly assailed by the enemy
from almost inaccessible hiding-places. They nevertheless assisted
in producing excellent results, and Roberts&#8217; and Kitchener&#8217;s Horse
highly distinguished themselves. In the end 13 Boers were
killed and wounded, 26 were taken prisoners, 47 voluntarily surrendered,
and 13 burghers, who had been imprisoned by their
own men, were released. Waggons and cattle in plenty were
secured. Nearer Zeerust all seemed placid; farmsteads and agriculture
showed little sign of a state of war. On the return movement
(begun on the 12th) General Fetherstonhaugh marched his
right centre column through Lichtenburg, his own three columns
being on the right, and that of General Dixon on the left.
Thus the enemy, fighting continually, was driven day by day before
him towards the region shortly to be swept by General Elliot&#8217;s
fan of troops. Large quantities of stores (unearthed from caves
in the hills or discovered bricked up in the houses) were destroyed,
10 Boers were killed or wounded, and 22 prisoners taken.
Klerksdorp was reached on the 21st of July after a particularly[Pg 94]
hard march, in which Colonel Hickie&#8217;s column especially suffered
from the scarcity of water in the district. General Dixon ere this
had returned to Krugersdorp. General Fetherstonhaugh, after a
brief rest, set out on the 27th along the Taung-Vryburg line, where
the enemy was reported to be active. On his right now moved
Lord Methuen (from Lichtenburg), while Colonel Von Donop of
Lord Methuen&#8217;s force swept from Kraaipan and Geysdorp on the
west of the hills, and Colonel Scott with a small column co-operated
from Vryburg. The area was soon denuded of foodstuffs,
and 58 prisoners of war were taken. Six of the enemy were killed.

While these energetic movements were going forward General
Gilbert Hamilton was scouring the Klerksdorp Ventersdorp district,
and Colonel Allenby was searching some almost unassailable positions
round the Magaliesberg. His columns nevertheless scored some successes.
On the daybreak of the 9th of July they surprised some Boers
who were laagered at Zeekoehoek, and though many of them made
good their escape to the hills, their field-cornet and twelve comrades
were seized. On the 11th the enemy was again discovered in an
almost inaccessible position on the Magaliesberg, but what the mounted
men failed to accomplish the artillery achieved, and soon the mountain
heights were ablaze with the flames of the burning laager
and two waggons of dynamite and ammunition which had been
blown up.

Later, in conjunction with Colonel Kekewich (who at Krugersdorp
had taken over command of General Dixon&#8217;s column), Colonel Allenby
set about a further clearance of the Magaliesberg passes; but by the
7th of August the whole region had become too hot for the Boers&#8217;
liking, and they evacuated it, enabling the British to occupy Breedt&#8217;s
Nek and establish a post on the summit. To thoroughly protect
this favourite haunt of the Boers from their future visits two other
columns were also engaged. Major-General Barton moved with a
force from Pretoria to west of Commando Nek, clearing the country
of supplies and establishing the network of posts to be occupied by
the South African Constabulary, while Lieutenant-Colonel Lord
Basing (with the Royal Dragoons, two guns and a pom-pom)
covered the construction of the Frederikstad-Breedt Nek line of
blockhouses, and kept up communication from thence to General
Barton&#8217;s column.

TRANSVAAL, E.&mdash;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR BINDON BLOOD

General Viljoen&#8217;s commando being still to the fore, north of the
Delagoa line, the operations of July were mainly directed against
him. General Blood, taking command of General Babington&#8217;s
column, and followed by General W. Kitchener, moved on the[Pg 95]
10th of July from Springs to Middelburg. Here, later, he was
joined by Colonel Campbell, who had been engaged in conducting
a reconnaissance north of the line from Elands River Station
towards Wagen Drift. Though the utmost energy and activity
prevailed on all sides, the results were disappointing. Owing to
the vast expanse of country and the Boers&#8217; intimate acquaintance
with all its nooks and crannies, they were able to play the game
of hide-and-seek with impunity, taking care never to be caught in
the open, and to avoid every chance of a collision.

Colonel Benson in his operations, however, had better luck.
Moving from Dullstroom on the 9th of July, with Colonel Park on
his right, he soon managed to discover the whereabouts of Viljoen&#8217;s
commando. Promptly the Dutchman was routed from his position
at Middelkraal by the 2nd Scottish Horse, a glorious set of &#8220;irregulars,&#8221;
many of them hailing from Australia, who were first and
foremost in every &#8220;ticklish&#8221; exploit. Indeed there was no end of
their pluck; and on this occasion a mere handful of them, under their
smart leaders Major Murray and Captain Lindley, contrived to keep
at bay the hostile herd till the arrival of supports. Having dispersed
the guerillas, Colonel Benson dealt in an equally effective
manner with Muller&#8217;s men on the west, a party of raiders who
were now driven north from the neighbourhood of Witpoort.
Reports presently said that Viljoen was still lingering somewhere
in the west, consequently the 18th Mounted Infantry pushed off
in pursuit, and succeeded in catching and capturing the tail of his
convoy and some fifteen waggons. While the Colonel moved his
main body&mdash;on the 11th&mdash;in the direction of Paardekloop, the 2nd
Scottish Horse circled around towards the Tautesberg, unearthing
and capturing prisoners and horses by the way and discovering
vehicles hidden in the kloofs, which Viljoen had evidently deposited
there for a &#8220;rainy day.&#8221; This notable leader was discovered on
the 15th of July at Laatstedrift, on the right bank of the Olifant
River, whither Colonel Benson had moved after the arrival of a
convoy brought by General Spens from the railway to Brinkwater.
An inspiriting feature of this discovery was the wonderful tenacity
of Lieutenant Kelly of the Scottish Horse, who, though wounded
in the stomach at the onset, had no sooner located the enemy than
he crawled under heavy fire to inform the officer commanding!
A smart engagement followed&mdash;an engagement creditable to both
sides&mdash;and after some close fighting both the enemy&#8217;s flanks were
turned, and they were sent scuttling across the river into the thick
bush country on the west. In the course of these varied operations
20 Boers were captured and 17 killed or wounded; 110
horses, 64 waggons, and a large quantity of ammunition were
secured. More prisoners had also been seized by General Spens[Pg 96]
in the course of his move with the convoy to Brinkwater and back
to Middelburg, where he arrived on the 20th. Soon after this date
he proceeded to take command of another column.

General Beatson meanwhile, on the night of the 7th of July, had
done some highly effective work. His surprise visit to the laager
of Commandant Trichard, which was located some twenty-five miles
north of Middelburg, resulted in the breaking up of the marauding
gang and the dispersal of them into the rugged country round Olifant
River. The commandant himself merely escaped by &#8220;the skin of
his teeth.&#8221; Further pursuit being useless, the General returned to
Middelburg and assisted in the hunt for Viljoen, who was not to be
caught, however, for he had warily doubled back to his friendly
kopjes on the right bank of the Olifant. Returning to Bronkerspruit
Station along the Wilge River General Beatson, while searching in
all the adjacent kloofs, came on twenty-five waggons containing
ammunition and clothing. As the duties of most clearing columns
were very much alike, some quotations from an officer&#8217;s letter may
serve to show the nature of the work and of the country to be
cleared of Boers and supplies:&mdash;

&#8220;The usual proceeding is as follows: On the first day we occupy the high ridges on
each side of one of the huge valleys, or kloofs, as they are called. This the Boers, with the
exception of a few &#8216;snipers,&#8217; who wound or kill one or two of our advanced scouts, do not
attempt to oppose. Then begins the difficulty. From each side the ground slopes down
very steeply&mdash;in many places it means recourse to hands and knees&mdash;for about a mile; then
comes a sheer precipice about 100 feet deep, and at the bottom a valley about 100 to 500
yards broad, with a stream in the middle and very thickly wooded. On each side of the
main valley the cliffs are broken by smaller kloofs running up them, and they contain any
number of caves and huge boulders. On the whole, one of these valleys makes about as
difficult a bit of country to clear as any you could imagine. The Boers lie hidden among
the rocks and in caves, and &#8216;snipe&#8217; from them heavily at any man attempting to climb
down the precipitous sides. We generally spend a day or two in shelling and advancing
as far as the edges of the precipices, and then on the night before we send our infantry
down into the valley most of the Boers escape. They dispute every inch of the way until
they see that the position is untenable for them. Then off they go.&#8221;

The writer of the letter mentioned a particular instance of this kind
of work, in which the Boer women hung white flags all over their
laager, and some Boers took advantage of the fact that the British
gunners duly respected the flags to hide among the rocks round the
laager, and to &#8220;snipe&#8221; the troops as they advanced. He continued:&mdash;

&#8220;We slept out at night; it was fearfully cold; we had no blankets, and only half rations.
We were ordered on the next morning to get the guns down a long spur jutting out into the
valley. This appeared to be impossible, as the ground was fearfully steep and stony, and
there was no road. However, with the aid of 50 Highlanders and a lot of rope, we managed
to get down after two hours&#8217; hard work. The position was a beautiful one, being only 1700
yards from the place occupied by the Boers on the previous day. We would probably have
had some casualties from rifle fire, being on exposed ground, but the Boers appeared to have
left during the night. Our infantry entered the kloof from both sides, and spent two days in
collecting cattle and in blowing up 50,000 rounds of Boer rifle ammunition. The Boer
families were brought in, and made more comfortable than they had ever been before. The
Boers all say that they do not mind deserting their wives, as they know that we look after them,
and make them more comfortable at Middelburg than they were when living on the veldt.&#8221;[Pg 97]

In the course of General Beatson&#8217;s operations on the 11th of July he
had the misfortune to lose his intelligence officer, Lieutenant Anderson,
R.E., a brilliant and zealous soldier, who was shot while galloping
ahead with an advance party of Victorians and Mounted Infantry
in hot chase after a gang of Boers.



BOERS CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF CUTTING THE TELEGRAPH WIRES

Drawing by Wal Paget


With troops refitted, General Kitchener and Colonel Campbell
now sped north from Middelburg, bent on getting in touch with the
quarry. General Kitchener was successful. At Blaauwbank, on
the 29th, a brisk engagement&mdash;a brilliant chase by the 19th Hussars,
followed by the 18th in support, and a rush with fixed bayonets&mdash;resulted
in the recapture of the two pom-poms taken from the
Victorians on the 11th of June, and the seizure of 32 prisoners
and 20 waggons of Viljoen&#8217;s commando. The commandant
himself made haste to withdraw to north and north-west of the
Olifant.

On this day (29th) General Sir Bindon Blood, with Colonel
Benson&#8217;s column, moved from Wonderfontein to Carolina. The
march was not without incident, for by night, at Mooitley, the
troops of Colonel Benson made a smart swoop upon a Boer laager,
and possessed themselves of 17 prisoners, 50 horses, and 10
waggons. A few days later another descent on the marauders
in the same neighbourhood swelled the list of captures by 29
prisoners (five of whom were Botha&#8217;s despatch riders), 70 horses,
and 5 carts.

August opened with more surprises, skirmishes, and surrenders
in other directions. At Diepkloof, on the Kruis River, General
Kitchener, on the 3rd, dispersed a small commando, leaving two dead
Boers on the field, and taking 13 prisoners. Colonel Park, between
Lydenburg and Dullstroom, had also some exciting tussles, after
which he proceeded to scour the country between Roos Senekal
and the Tautesberg.

STANDERTON-HEIDELBERG&mdash;LIEUTENANT-COLONEL COLVILLE

Lieutenant-Colonel Colville, from Greylingstad, spent the end
of July in scouring the district north of the railway line between
the Waterval River and Leeuwspruit, and defeating the mischievous
activities of gangs under Alberts, Mears, and Pretorius. It must
be remembered that these guerilla chiefs were paid £25 a month
by the Boer Government for their services, and that they had this
to gain and nothing to lose by adhering to their policy of resistance.
The Boer Government, according to rumour, had now formed a new
seat (its seats were so many and so portable that it is difficult to
remember them!) at Watervalshoek, about twenty-six miles north
of Greylingstad, consequently it was decided that this hotbed of[Pg 98]
disorder must be assailed without delay. Thereupon, on the 4th of
August, three forces were moved out&mdash;Colonel Colville&#8217;s and Colonel
Stewart&#8217;s (Johannesburg Mounted Rifles) to Rooipoort (ten miles
west of Bethel), while Colonel Bewicke-Copley marched from
Springs towards Watervalshoek. From Rooipoort Colonel Stewart
searched the northern road through Drefontein and Saltpeter
Krantz, while Colonel Colville exerted his vigilance along the
southern route to Watervalshoek. He reaped his reward. At the
junction of the Waterval River and Klipspruit he suddenly spied a
Boer convoy&mdash;the convoy of General Alberts&mdash;on the march. Immediately
all was excitement. Away went his gallant men, racing and
galloping over a good seven miles, never ceasing their rush till
the convoy was hounded down, till the whole bunch of guerillas,
with 28 loaded waggons, 12 carts, 55 horses, 1400 cattle, and 2000
rounds of ammunition were seized.

Meanwhile, the Boer Government had again vanished into
thin air!

Colonels Colville and Stewart moved to Standerton, while
Colonel Bewicke-Copley hustled bands of flying Dutchmen, who
disappeared into the valley of the Wilge.

CAPE COLONY&mdash;JULY

General French, in the middle of July, organised a big combined
movement to dislodge the raiders from the Camdeboo Mountains
near Graaf Reinet. The activities of the troops, brilliant as they
had been, had not entirely purged the Cape Colony of the offensive
element, and gangs of guerillas were still popping out here and
there, in their mischief assisted by traitors, whose Janus faces it
took some time to unmask. General French&#8217;s efforts were now
directed against rebels and raiders, and in a particularly successful
series of hunts several Boers were killed and wounded, and 31
prisoners, mostly Cape rebels, were captured.

The combined commandos of Fouché and Myburg made an
unusual demonstration on the 14th of July, and actually attacked
the Connaught Rangers, under Major Moore, who, while escorting
a convoy, were camped in a position between Aliwal North and
Jamestown. It took some hours of determined fighting to beat
off the ferocious enemy, who were splendidly posted on high hills,
and were only defeated by dusk. Three officers and 17 of our
wounded were left to tell the tale of stubborn resistance. The
enemy were pursued by Colonel Munro, and caught after a wearing
chase south-west of Jamestown. Some of their number were killed
and some were forced to retreat upon the &#8220;Connaughts,&#8221; who, as
may be imagined, received them in passing with considerable warmth.[Pg 99]
By the end of the month, Fouché, owing to the incessant vigilance
of Colonel Munro and Major Moore, found the Colony too hot to
hold him. He therefore betook himself across the Orange near
Aliwal North. But Kruitzinger kept up the excitement by dodging
in the mountains south of Cradock. From thence he pounced,
on the 21st of July, upon Colonel Crabbe and his column. The
sudden outburst of musketry at close quarters, as it were from
the bowels of the hills, caused the horses to stampede, and the
loss of 200 horses at a critical moment was found to be no trifling
matter. A horrible tussle ensued, but luckily at the end of the
day Colonel Crabbe was able to withdraw to Mortimer Station
with his force, five of whom were wounded.



Concentration Camp at Norval&#8217;s Pont


Colonel Scobell&#8217;s encounter with the enemy on the 23rd was
more happy in its results. He formed part of the cordon which
was pushing the enemy towards the Orange, and during the operation
the indefatigable Colonel Lukin and 90 Cape Mounted Rifles under
Captain Cosgrove made a grand swoop upon Lategan&#8217;s laager,
fought and defeated 150 of the foe, captured 10 prisoners (including
a field-cornet, Buys by name) and 105 saddles and horses. But
it was what may be called a &#8220;touch-and-go&#8221; affair, for at one[Pg 100]
time Lieutenant Welby with only twelve men was surrounded by
forty Boers, whom he withstood for an hour till rescued. Not
less successful were the columns of Colonels Doran and Wyndham
and the energetic Captain Lund. (This officer, on the 19th, secured
a waggon containing the rifles of Smits&#8217; commando.) But such of
the enemy as got away now dispersed under cover of darkness into
the remote bridle-paths, and bided their time in their well-chosen coigns
of vantage, where in ones and twos they were unassailable. General
French was therefore obliged to arrange a backward and southward
movement of the fan of columns from a line Vlakfontein, Richmond,
Middle Mount, Middelburg, Schombie, Steynsburg, Stormberg, so
as to force the scattered bands northwards again. From the 29th
of July to the 3rd of August was passed in this man&oelig;uvre, wearing
but remunerative, for by the end of this time the raiders slipped
through the loopholes intentionally made by the columns, which had
been ordered to contract their fronts for this purpose, and once more
the troops (extended laterally on a line Beaufort West, Pearston,
Drennan Station, Cameron&#8217;s Glen, Cathcart) had the satisfaction of
pressing the enemy north towards the line of blockhouses on the
Steynsburg-De Aar line. The only big commando that remained
south was Scheepers&#8217;, which a detached force of 10th Hussars,
12th Lancers, and two guns proceeded to chase.

The process of attrition was going forward slowly and surely.
The numbers of captures were monthly increasing, but the organised
system of intimidation pursued by the Boer leaders against both
burghers, who, if left to themselves, would have surrendered, and
natives, who went in fear of their lives, and became informants, made
the work of settlement exceedingly harassing. In these circumstances,
Lord Kitchener &#8220;considered it advisable to form some
specially mobile columns for independent and rapid action in different
parts of the country, generally at some distance from the operations
of other troops.&#8221; These columns were given a free hand in respect
to their movements, and acted at any time on intelligence gained
by themselves in addition to such as might be received from
headquarters.

THE SITUATION&mdash;AUGUST

In May Sir Alfred Milner paid a visit to England, and his reception
in Great Britain left no doubt in the mind of people at home
and abroad regarding the determination of the Government to
adhere to their South African policy. The King conferred on him
the dignity of a Baron, and both in the City of London and in that
of Cape Town there were rejoicings at the honour done to one who
had served the cause of Great Britain with such skill and unswerving[Pg 101]
devotion. In August Lord Milner returned to his duties as
High Commissioner for South Africa and Administrator of the
Transvaal and Orange River Colony, much benefited by the brief
rest from his labours.

As it was found necessary to adopt sterner measures to crush the
lingering guerilla warfare, Lord Kitchener issued, on the 7th of
August, the following Proclamation:&mdash;

&#8220;Whereas the late Orange Free State and the late South African Republic have been
annexed to his Majesty&#8217;s dominions;

&#8220;And whereas his Majesty&#8217;s forces are and have for some considerable time been in
complete possession of the seats of Government of both the aforesaid territories, with their
public offices, and the whole machinery of administration, as well as of all the principal
towns and the whole of the railway lines;

&#8220;And whereas the great majority of the Burghers of the two late Republics, to the number
of thirty-five thousand, exclusive of those who have fallen in the war, are now either
prisoners or have submitted to his Majesty&#8217;s Government, and are living peaceably in towns
or camps under the control of his Majesty&#8217;s forces;

&#8220;And whereas the Burghers of the late Republics still in arms against his Majesty are
not only few in numbers, but have lost almost all their guns and munitions of war, and are
devoid of regular military organisation, and are therefore unable to carry on regular warfare
or to offer any organised resistance to his Majesty&#8217;s forces in any part of the country;

&#8220;And whereas those Burghers who are still in arms, though unable to carry on regular
warfare, continue to make isolated attacks upon small posts and detachments of his
Majesty&#8217;s forces, to plunder or destroy property, and to damage the railway and telegraph
lines, both in the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal and in other portions of his
Majesty&#8217;s South African Dominions;

&#8220;And whereas the country is thus kept in a state of disturbance, checking the resumption
of agricultural and industrial pursuits;

&#8220;And whereas his Majesty&#8217;s Government is determined to put an end to a state of
things which is aimlessly prolonging bloodshed and destruction and inflicting ruin upon the
great majority of the inhabitants, who are anxious to live in peace and to earn a livelihood
for themselves and their families;

&#8220;And whereas it is just to proceed against those still resisting, and especially against
those persons who, being in a position of authority, are responsible for the continuance of
the present state of lawlessness, and are instigating their fellow-Burghers to continue their
hopeless resistance to his Majesty&#8217;s Government;

&#8220;Now therefore I, Lord Kitchener, &amp;c., under instructions from his Majesty&#8217;s Government,
proclaim and make known as follows:

&#8220;All commandants, field cornets, and leaders of armed bands, being Burghers of the
late Republics, still engaged in resisting his Majesty&#8217;s forces, whether in the Orange River
Colony and the Transvaal or in any other portion of his Majesty&#8217;s South African Dominions,
and all members of the Governments of the late Orange Free State and the late South
African Republic, shall, unless they surrender before the 15th of September next, be permanently
banished from South Africa; the cost of the maintenance of the families of all
Burghers in the field who shall not have surrendered by 15th September shall be recoverable
from such Burghers, and shall be a charge upon their property movable and immovable
in the two Colonies.&#8221;

The Proclamation was the result of correspondence which had
taken place between Sir H. E. M&#8217;Callum, Governor of Natal, and Mr.
Chamberlain. The Governor&#8217;s telegram, dated 24th July, ran thus:&mdash;

&#8220;I sent you by last mail long minute submitted to Ministers containing following
suggestions:

&#8220;Protracted continuance of hostilities vitally affecting interests of Natal is viewed with
grave concern. Raids into the Colony frequently render it impossible for loyalists to
return to farms and avocations. Feeling of unrest among natives created by raids,
revenue suffering, trade paralysed, railways monopolised by military, towns overcrowded
with refugees and persons awaiting return to Transvaal, stock being affected with disease[Pg 102]
due to introduction of captured stock from the new Colonies, famine prices prevailing,
Colony still subject to censorship and martial law.

&#8220;Under these circumstances Ministers advocate sterner measures to crush present
guerilla warfare. They point out that Boers still fighting have little to lose, that their
women and children are protected and well treated, and that their farms are safe from
confiscation, therefore Boers free from anxiety and encouraged to continue in the field,
growing accustomed to life of pillaging and looting, and communicate frequently with
refugee camps which thus are source of danger. Those who are not rebels know that if
captured they will be treated as prisoners of war and released at the conclusion of hostilities.

&#8220;Ministers believe that excellent effect would be produced if it were made generally
known that if Burghers now in the field do not surrender by given date, say, within one
month, cost of maintenance of all women and children will be chargeable against immovable
property of Burghers in the field; also that Boer generals and leaders in the field
should be informed that unless they and their commandos surrender by date specified they
will be banished from South Africa for life when captured.

&#8220;In making these observations and recommendations Ministers disclaim intention of
appearing to reflect on military operations, of which they realise the immense difficulties.
They will continue to render the Imperial Government every assistance to secure settlement
and pacification.&#8221;

A telegram followed from Mr. Chamberlain to Lord Kitchener
containing the draft of the Proclamation, which was to be issued with
the least possible delay. Lord Kitchener was desired before issuing
it, however, to communicate its terms to the Governors of Cape
Colony and Natal, and ascertain whether their governments agreed
to them. The proposal was approved by the Colonial governors,
the document received a few emendations, and was issued as above.

There was, naturally, an outcry at all sterner measures that were
proposed, by what may be called the &#8220;Prolong-the-War Party&#8221;&mdash;the
pro-Boer orators who were daily, by their excited utterances,
betraying the Boers into the belief that their showy sympathy would
bring about practical results. But in reality the stern measure was
intended as a merciful measure to save desperate men from a suicidal
policy of resistance to the inevitable, the country from devastation,
and women and children from suffering. Their territories were
annexed, their leaders, most of them, were exiles or prisoners,
hostilities had developed from guerilla warfare to simple brigandage
and outrage, and the British were keeping up the supply of troops
with the determination of &#8220;fighting to a finish.&#8221; Indeed, by the middle
of 1901, there were 138,000 regulars, 58,000 Colonials, 23,000
yeomen, 20,000 militia, and 10,000 volunteers&mdash;a total of 250,000
men under arms in South Africa. With this ever-increasing multitude
bearing down upon them, the days of the belligerents were
numbered, but this they doggedly refused to believe, or, even if
they believed the worst, they decided&mdash;like the wasp who parts with
his sting only to die&mdash;on leaving behind them the largest legacy of
pain and trouble the circumstances would admit.

The South African Constabulary by the middle of the year had
grown into an effective force, and were operating from the vicinity
of the railways and occupying fortified posts, and thus rendering
themselves exceedingly valuable in checking the efforts of the enemy[Pg 103]
to pass through the cordon around the cleared districts. The Boers,
by the loss of their ox-waggons, were seriously impeded in regard
to their supply arrangements, and the series of captures which took
place in all parts of the country made a considerable drain on their
numbers in the field. Still, small gangs of three to four hundred
men roving loosely over the country could, in cases of emergency,
concentrate and cause vast trouble and annoyance and even danger
to the small mobile columns, broken up as they were, in order to
operate over vast areas in search of the scattered hordes.

Viewing the intense labour and increasing strain suffered by the
Commander-in-Chief at this time, it is pleasing to quote the letter of
an officer competent to speak regarding the magnificence of the
steady if slow work that was being accomplished:&mdash;

&#8220;We are eleven hours a day in the saddle on patrol duty, and good solid work is being
done by mobile columns. You will not get much of our movements through the Press, as
the policy of secrecy is really the only safe one with the Cape Colony now undermined by
rebels from north to south. It would be difficult to over-praise Lord Kitchener for his
remarkable power of self-control and ability to keep his own counsel. His ceaseless efforts
to get the right men into the higher and brigade commands are recognised by all of us who
have suffered in the past from incompetent leaders. In spite of the clap-trap that is being
talked in Parliament by ignorant and vain knights of the shires, I can assure you that a
more humane and pacific general never directed a force on active service, and this testimony
is from Boer and British alike.&#8221;

Considerable stir was created in England among the so-called
humanitarians regarding the mortality of children in the concentration
camps, where the Boer families had of necessity to be housed
and cared for. The mortality was certainly high, but on strict
inquiry it was found that mainly through the ignorance, listlessness,
and idleness of the Boer mothers the sick infants were treated
wrongly or neglected. Dr. Jane Waterston, late President of the
Women&#8217;s Rand Relief Committee, in a letter to the Cape Times,
with level-headed brevity discussed some points which the Boer
sympathisers had carefully ignored. She pointed out that&mdash;

&#8220;Ordinary colonial women who have been through the stress and strain of the last two
years are not very favourably impressed by the present stir in England over the assumed
privations of the Boer women and children. If looting, flogging, ruining, and train-wrecking
can be dignified by such a name as war, they hold that in all matters of supply our
fighting men, who, as well as fighting our battles, guard our women-folk or our sick men,
injured by wounds or disease in our service, come first and foremost; after them come our
own civilian population; and lastly come our prisoners, or those Boers who have surrendered
or been brought in.&#8221;

Again she said:&mdash;

&#8220;Large as was the sum collected in Great Britain by voluntary subscriptions, at no
time did the women and children of the loyal colonial refugees of the poorer classes receive
more than mere sustenance. Judging, however, by some of the hysterical whining going
on in England at the present time it would seem as if we might neglect or half starve our
faithful soldiers, and keep our civilian population eating their hearts out here as long as
we fed and pampered people who have not even the grace to say &#8216;thank you&#8217; for the care
bestowed on them.[Pg 104]

&#8220;As we see it, the problem before our military men is, how to manage, feed, and care
for large numbers of women and children, and yet not feed the enemy and so prolong the
war, or rather existing brigandage. If the women are left on the farms with food, that food
will be promptly handed over to the commandos, who would lightly take it all, and trust to
British soft-heartedness not to let their women and children die of starvation, but to replenish
all the empty larders by means of scattered convoys, which would give them at the same
time grand chances of loot and first-rate practice in sniping. To obviate this the military
have had to make up their minds either to let the women and children starve on their farms
or else gather them into large concentration camps. This war has been remarkable for
two things: first, the small regard that the Boers, from the highest to the lowest, have had
for their womankind; and secondly, the great care and consideration the victors have had
for the same, very often ungrateful, women.

&#8220;It is the fault of the Boer men, not ours, that their women and children are in concentration
camps. The task of our pro tem. rulers is not made easier by the fact that no consideration
of the stuff on a supply train being partly meant for their own wives and children
would hinder Boer husbands and fathers from wrecking the train and destroying the food.
They comfort themselves with the thought that the soldiers may have to go on half rations
and tighten their belts, but &#8216;these fools of English will serve out as usual the daily ration
to the refugee camps.&#8217; At present there is the danger that the Boers will waken up to have
a care for their womenfolk, and will go on fighting for some time so as to keep them in
comfortable winter quarters at our expense, and thus our women and children will lose a
few more of their husbands and fathers.&#8221;

In corroboration of Dr. Waterston&#8217;s statements it may also be
noted that the Government, while spending hundreds of thousands
of pounds monthly on the Boer refugees, had devoted
only £50,000 towards the Imperial Relief fund for helping the
loyalists.

Naturally, among the British sufferers, the continual attempts to
propitiate an irreconcilable enemy were looked upon with disgust
and even suspicion, and very rejoiced were they to find that steps
were taken to arrest and remove Boer sympathisers in Johannesburg
and elsewhere, who were known to be assisting in a widening
conspiracy to get surrendered burghers to return to their commandos,
and so reproduce a recrudescence of hostilities. On all
sides the lying tongues of the Boer party, who had declared war and
quitted the field, strove to urge the remnants towards further resistance
by declaring that Great Britain was divided against itself, and
that it had not sufficient endurance to see the matter through.

CHAPTER XII

ORANGE RIVER COLONY&mdash;AUGUST

At this time, as we know, the troops of Generals Bruce-Hamilton
and C. Knox were engaged in clearing operations
to the south of the Riet River, but, in consequence
of a recrudescence of activity in the south-eastern districts
of the Orange Colony, the operations were somewhat
curtailed, and attention was directed to the offending quarter.
The activity showed itself firstly on the 12th of August, when
some 250 Boers under Boshoff, fleeing from the trap that Elliot
had prepared for them, burst through the line of blockhouses
near Sanna&#8217;s Post. Secondly, another marauding gang of the
same size, under Kruitzinger, in evading French&#8217;s hunters, east
of Norval&#8217;s Pont, had penetrated the Springfontein-Bethulie line
near Providence Siding, on their way to Boesmans Kop&mdash;an
old and favourite haunt. Finally, a similar party under Smuts
and Dreyer, on the 15th, had succeeded in squeezing past the
line of police posts on the Modder, to the north of Petrusburg.
These three movements suggested the possible concentration of
the raiders in the now clear area between Wepener, Rouxville, and
Smithfield, and consequently General Knox at once directed his
attention to this quarter, in order to prevent any fresh junction
of forces, and the entry of swelled commandos into Cape Colony.
He therefore moved his troops from west to east of the railway, so as
to interpose them between the enemy and the river line. Major
Damant&#8217;s column was detached from General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s command,
and the Royal Dragoons, under Lord Basing, were brought by
rail from the Transvaal to Springfontein, while Colonel Western
moved from Bloemfontein to Bethulie to join General Hart, who
with Col. the Hon. H. D. Murray&#8217;s column, the Connaught Rangers,
was guarding the river west and east of Aliwal North.

Nor was this all. Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson was ordered
to pursue Boshoff&#8217;s guerillas, who were scurrying through the
Bloemfontein-Ladybrand line, but these nimble ones, bent rather
on flight than fight, knowingly avoided contact with the pursuers.
Kruitzinger, gathering the bedraggled remnants of commandos
as he went, veered towards the Basuto border, hugged
it gingerly, and stealthily crept towards the river, so that, on the
morning of the 4th of September, he succeeded with 300 men,[Pg 106]
despite the vigilance of our troops, in effecting a crossing into Cape
Colony at Kiba Drift. The Boers did not, however, escape Major
Damant, who was hunting for them in the neighbourhood of Spitzkop.
He scented them out at Oudam, to the west of Boesmanskop, and
was off with 300 mounted men, 2 guns, and a pom-pom to attack
them. The marauders were on the alert, and they, on the 14th,
galloped off as fast as their mounts would carry them. For a
good ten miles galloped hunters and hunted, till at last the quarry,
dispersing, sought almost inaccessible refuge in the Marsfontein
Hills. But 4 prisoners, 20 horses, 6 mules, 5 rifles, a heliograph,
and the Commandant&#8217;s despatch-box fell into Major
Damant&#8217;s hands. From the prisoners it was discovered that they
formed part of Delarey&#8217;s gang, who were moving under Dreyer
to reinforce Kruitzinger at the Cape. Meanwhile, Lord Basing
was hunting around Boesmanskop, and Colonel Thorneycroft&#8217;s
two columns, under Colonel Minchin and Major Copeman, were
working their way (from Reddersburg and Smithfield respectively)
towards Zandfontein, twelve miles east of Rouxville, where they met
at the end of August. The enemy, ensconced in the kloofs, crannies,
and kopjes between Zastron and the Orange River, succeeded in
evading them, not a very marvellous feat considering their intimate
acquaintanceship with the geographical features of this locality.

Colonel Pilcher&#8217;s two columns of General Knox&#8217;s force, under
Colonel Taylor and Major Lean, now marched from the west into
Bloemfontein and Edenburg, and from thence south to Bethulie,
while Colonel Pilcher pushed up the valley of the Caledon towards
Smithfield, thus freeing the troops of Colonel Thorneycroft and
Lord Basing, who were able to scour further east. About this
time, 25th of August, Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson, marching
south from Dewetsdorp, encountered a detached bunch of Smuts&#8217;
men scuttling east of Reddersburg. A brilliant chase to the
north-east followed, the mounted troops under Major Gosset
pursuing with such dash that 25 prisoners out of the party of 120
were secured, and 30 of their horses captured. In September,
after the column had obtained supplies at Edenburg, further
activities all along the Basuto border were engaged in, and, on the
8th the mischievous hordes were driven north from a position
they had taken up in the vicinity of Elandsberg. But Smuts
and his following, despite the close proximity of Colonel Thorneycroft,
were successful in finding a loophole at Kiba Drift, and
escaped into Cape Colony on the 4th. There he was quickly
&#8220;spotted&#8221; by General Hart, who pursued him towards Ladygrey.
Both General Hart and General French had now their hands
full. Kruitzinger&#8217;s and Smuts&#8217; men, who had effected a crossing,
required to be dealt with, so, in order to reinforce General French,[Pg 107]
Colonel Pilcher moved from the Caledon Valley to Burghersdorp
on the 7th of September.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, S.&mdash;BRIGADIER-GENERAL PLUMER

We left General Plumer, on the 11th of August, surrounded
by the prizes won during his expedition to block the exits
to the west during General Elliot&#8217;s sweep from the Vaal to the
Modder River (see Map, p. 89). These prizes included 32 prisoners,
346 horses, 566 cattle, 28 waggons, and 39 carts. Four days
later he was off again on fresh Boer-hunting adventures. On his
right moved Colonel Colvin, viâ Doornhoek and Roodepan to
Zoutpans Drift on the Orange River; on his left marched Colonel
Sir J. Jarvis through Koffyfontein and Luckhoff. The place
between the Kimberley-Luckhoff line was a desert. Not a Boer
showed his nose. Only some cattle, which were captured, betrayed
his recent haunts. General Plumer concentrated his force at Zoutpans
Drift on the 21st, and on the 23rd began a new move. The
Orange River Valley to the east and all its mysterious kloofs
were thoroughly searched, and the loopholes, whence the hunted
might evade the vigilance of General French&#8217;s troops on the
other side, were watched with lynx eyes. But the Boers were
not to be caught napping in this way. At last, however, a commando
under Lategan, which had been forced to run from the
Cape Colony before Colonel Byng&#8217;s men, came plump upon Plumer,
who was then on the look-out, south of Philippolis. A spirited
chase ensued, and the fugitive band was relieved of 8 comrades,
4 rifles, 46 horses, and 11 vehicles. General Plumer&#8217;s force reached
Prior&#8217;s Siding and Springfontein on the night of the 30th of August,
and, one may almost say, without waiting to draw breath, was off
again to join in the hunt for Kruitzinger.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY, E.&mdash;MAJOR-GENERAL ELLIOT&mdash;AUGUST

After a brief rest at Glen, General Elliot, on the 18th, spread
his troops on the line Glen, Sanna&#8217;s Post, Ladybrand, with the
intention of making a sweep to the north-east and a final wheel
towards the Wittebergen Mountains. The object of this wheel
was to drive such Boers as might be lurking about into the arms
of General Campbell, who, it may be remembered, was waiting at
the Brandwater Basin to mop them up. On General Elliot&#8217;s left
were Colonel Barker and Major Pine Coffin, working from Winburg
to co-operate towards the Tabaksberg and Doornberg; while in
the Senekal district was an outstretched net&mdash;composed of the
troops of General Spens, Colonel Rimington, and Colonel Wilson&mdash;ready
to haul in any interlopers that might be driven north by
General Elliot&#8217;s activities.[Pg 108]

Haasbroek, whose laager was reported to be somewhere in the
vicinity, was now the main object of the hunt. Report said that he,
with 300 men, was on the Korannaberg; consequently this eminence
was surrounded on three sides by the Mounted Infantry from Thabanchu
and Ladybrand working one way, while Colonel Baker and
Major Pine Coffin so disposed themselves that the enemy, retreating
toward Doornberg, would meet with a warm welcome. But
Haasbroek had bolted. When, after a long and weary night
march, Colonel Lowe&#8217;s doughty men scaled the ridges, they found
on the summit only some twenty Boers, two of whom were killed
and one wounded. This was especially disappointing, as on the
22nd a commando, said to be under De Wet, cropped up most
unexpectedly, and pounced upon a small party of the Black Watch
Mounted Infantry, which had been detached from Ladybrand to
Modderpoort for the purpose of driving such Boers as they might
find towards General Elliot&#8217;s right front. And this commando&mdash;their
superiors in numbers and in point of position&mdash;was not to
be overpowered, and eventually, after a fierce tussle, in which
five of the enemy were killed, including the field cornet, the
party was captured. Hearing of the disaster, General Broadwood,
who was on General Elliot&#8217;s right at Maquatlings Nek, rushed
at once to the rescue, making a forced march throughout the night
of the 22nd, but without avail. The enemy and their British prize
had disappeared. The prisoners were afterwards released&mdash;the
Boers having already too many mouths to feed and no means of
securing their haul. From this time to the 26th the Division
halted in the region of the Korannaberg, and the time spent in
awaiting supplies was occupied in completely scouring the surrounding
country. On the 26th the march towards Wittebergen was
resumed. Of course, Haasbroek and his friends Froneman, Koen,
and Hermanns Steyn were soon aware of the direction taken by
the troops, and were not slow in vacating the position that they
had taken up at Wonderkop, and moving north. By the 30th
the columns were spreading out on a line&mdash;Retief&#8217;s Nek, Commando
Nek&mdash;hunting as they went in valley and kloof, in ridge
and ravine, for signs of the marauders. Tiring and fatiguing were
the explorations, and often unremunerative; indeed, as a total, the
results of so much energy were disappointing. Horses, cattle, and
waggons were found in good quantities, but only 13 Boers were
killed, 11 wounded, and 21 prisoners taken after numerous exciting
expeditions. The rest of the guerillas were driven either in the
direction of General Campbell&#8217;s troops or towards the north.
General Elliot moved to Winburg on the 6th, where he was joined
later by Colonel Barker and Major Pine Coffin, who pursued
their investigations of the country some days longer.[Pg 109]

SWEEPING THE KROONSTAD DISTRICT&mdash;BRIGADIER-GENERAL
SPENS&mdash;AUGUST

The columns of General Spens, moving from Heilbron to Kroonstad
between the 6th and the 12th of August, performed a prodigious
amount of work, Major Gough and his Mounted Infantry alone
securing 12 prisoners, 900 cattle, 30 carts, 2 waggons, and 186 horses.

On the 16th the General again made a grand effort, which, however,
was not crowned with brilliant results such as those just
chronicled. The mounted troops of Colonel Jenner and Major Gough,
with four R.H.A. guns, made a laborious night march of 35 miles
from a farm north of Welvart, in order to surround Lindley before
dawn. The thing was splendidly managed, but to no purpose. The
town was vacated. The &#8220;slim&#8221; ones had slunk off in a manner as disappointing
to us as it was commendable in them. So, on the 18th,
General Spens was joined six miles north-west of Lindley by his worn
and disgusted band. Little rest did they get. On the 20th they
were again on the move, for it was necessary that the rolling stone
of the Boers should not be allowed anywhere to pause and gather
moss in the form of recruits and roving raiders. The country north
of the Lindley-Reitz road, as far as Lovedale, was diligently searched.
From Stryfontein on the 21st Colonel Jenner and Major Gough
were despatched in the direction of two farms on the Lindley-Bethlehem
road, which were known to be hotbeds of hostility. A
brilliant night march brought the troops to their destination, but the
Boers were on the alert, and in the grey of the morning put spurs to
their horses, and fled wildly in the direction of the valley of the Valsch
River, followed by salvoes from the pursuing force. General Spens
continued his sweep, and at last at Olievenfontein (on the Lindley-Kroonstad
road) came in touch with the enemy. Here, his left
flank guard had 200 to tackle&mdash;a desperate band who came, for a
wonder, to close quarters, and fought with dogged valour.

It was with no little difficulty that the foe were eventually driven
off, and that with the loss of gallant young Wallis (Royal Irish
Fusiliers) and 2 men, while 13 of the men were wounded. The
force neared Kroonstad by the 29th August, about which time a
splendid officer, Captain Dick (Royal Irish Fusiliers), succumbed to
wounds incurred while gallantly leading his men.

Colonel Rimington meanwhile had relaxed none of his efforts.
A smart little affair on the 15th, in which he caught a Boer convoy
trailing along near Doornkloof, some seventeen miles north-west of
Lindley, helped to swell his &#8220;bag.&#8221; Then on the 17th, at Vechtkop,
he dashed into a knot of 200 Boers under Waude, Mentz, and Boshoff,
and sent them spinning, following hot foot for full eight miles
till they dispersed in the mists of the south-east. That done he turned[Pg 110]
his attention to Trommel, near Reitz. Here he pounced on a small
laager&mdash;secured 16 prisoners and some fat cart-loads of provisions,
beside waggons and horses. He was back again at Kroonstad
by the 28th. But two days later, he was to the fore taking
his place in the scheme of General Elliot&#8217;s operations, which
have been described, and, later, co-operating with General
Spens and Colonel Wilson in their endeavours to intercept the
roving bands. His activities were unending. On the 31st of
August he &#8220;spotted&#8221; the commandos of De Vos and Lategan,
chased and dispersed them, and secured the best part of their
belongings; later, near Senekal, he made a dash on another convoy,
chased it, and, after a good ten miles&#8217;
rush and a smart fight, killed 4 Boers
and took 10 whole, together with 61
loaded waggons, 25 carts, horses,
mules, and 2000 cattle. This with
the loss of only 4 men wounded. On
the 6th of September, after reconnoitring
towards Blitzberg, Colonel
Rimington returned, heavy with the
spoils of war, to Kroonstad.



General Elliot


Here he was followed two days
later by Colonel Wilson, who had
been following an identical plan of
pounce and pursuit on the right.
He too had skirmished with good
effort, first engaging some of De
Vos&#8217; men and sending them to the
right-about, and secondly attacking Haasbroek&#8217;s commando, midway
between Senekal and Ventersburg, and handling it somewhat
roughly. Seven Boers were killed, 3 prisoners were taken,
together with carts innumerable, full and empty, and cattle to
the tune of 2000. The central column under General Spens,
which all this time was moving direct on Senekal, worked brilliantly
and scored some success, the total result being 5 Boers killed,
3 voluntarily surrendered, 11 prisoners, 34 Cape carts, and 1800
cattle captured.

OPERATIONS NEAR HONING SPRUIT AND THE LOSBERG&mdash;LIEUTENANT-COLONEL
GARRATT

In August, Colonel Garratt, who was following in rear of
General Elliot&#8217;s movement on the Modder (see p. 89), marched
from the junction of the Vet and Zand Rivers to Bultfontein.
Here, on the 12th, he encountered a band of guerillas, took two[Pg 111]
and killed two, and pursued the rest as far as the banks of the
Zand River. Here he lost them, for horse flesh could do no more.
Turning, he veered north towards Honing Spruit. In this direction,
near the junction of the Rhenoster and Honing Spruit, was said to
be the laager of Spanneberg, and consequently a force under Colonel
the Hon. H. White (300 mounted men and 30 Burgher Police) was
detached to deal with him. Through the night of the 18th the
troops marched warily yet rapidly towards their prey, fearing that at
any moment rumour of their approach might render the expedition&mdash;as
these expeditions were so likely to be&mdash;futile. But no;
by dawn the sleeping gang was surrounded; they opened their
eyes to the consciousness that a small forest of British rifles
had grown up around them, and that efforts of defence were useless.
They had to deal with men who were more than their match&mdash;Simpson
of the New Zealand Regiment, Quintal of the New
South Wales Bushmen, and other splendid fellows before whom they
were only too glad to run! One Boer lost his life in the scrimmage,
twenty-five were made prisoners, and Steyn, late Landdrost of
Vredefort, was among them. Carts, waggons, horses, cattle too,
were taken possession of, and the smart little force, after having
covered 56 miles in 36 hours, returned to headquarters, duly
elated with their prize. It was now necessary to search in the
region of the Losberg for fugitive bands, and to this end Colonel
Garratt on the 21st crossed the Vaal at Lindique Drift. The
mounted troops were eternally spying and scouring hither and
thither, and their activity was not in vain. In the distance on
the morning of the 24th loomed what appeared to be a convoy&mdash;a
convoy moving towards Buffelshoek. In an instant the trackers
were after it, and before long the hostile gang was caught,
dispersed, their precious freight taken, and with it eight prisoners,
carts, oxen, cattle, and horses. With this extra burden on their
hands, the party, fatigued after the chase, were, as may be
imagined, almost at the mercy of fate. Fate, as it happened,
was capricious. Such of the Boers as had contrived to escape
gave warning of the perilous position of the British force, and
at noon returned with a party of 300 of their fellows, who had
been collected from the skirts of the Gatsrand. A vigorous
fight ensued. The Boers, doughty always, were now grown
dashing, the spur of famine driving them to the valour of
despair. Between both was the prize&mdash;the prize to be held by
those who had won it; by now, infinitely more precious than in
the winning&mdash;the prize to be recaptured by those who had all
the calls of the flesh to prompt the spirit to battle and retaliation.
This was indeed a tug of war. Till five of the afternoon&mdash;from
noon till five&mdash;fought those men. The Boers, fresh[Pg 112]
from the hills, hungering with a mighty hunger for their precious
convoy&mdash;the British, worn with the long rush since daylight
and the previous fight, but holding on, like the never-say-die
fellows they are, till the desperadoes were at length driven off
in the direction of the Vaal. But this engagement was costly,
for one officer and one man were killed, and two men were
wounded.

This brilliant little force, which was covering the establishment
of posts by the South African Constabulary, two days
later made another successful night march from the Losberg to
Leeuwpoort. More prizes of horses, mules, cattle, and prisoners&mdash;numbering
thirteen&mdash;were the fruit of their pluck and perseverance,
and in the net they had the satisfaction of discovering
a nephew of General Delarey, a person who counted for considerably
more than the poor tramps who had joined the guerilla
proceedings for reasons of mere bellicose vagrancy.

On the 2nd of September Colonel Garratt marched to Meyerton
and Vereening, and from thence moved by rail to Paardekop
Station on the Standerton line. This was a precautionary
measure, for rumour now pointed to possible raids on the Natal
border, and to frustrate any concentration of hostile bodies
Colonel Garratt was to commence working from Paardekop towards
Wakkerstroom.

SCOURING THE MAGALIESBERG&mdash;COLONELS ALLENBY AND
KEKEWICH

We left Colonel Allenby in the occupation of Breedt&#8217;s Nek,
which the Boers had evacuated.



NIGHT ATTACK ON A BOER CONVOY BY MOUNTED INFANTRY UNDER COLONEL WILLIAMS

Drawing by John Charlton from a Sketch by a British Officer


On the 7th of August a movement was made to obtain possession
of the Damhoek and Pampoen Kraal Passes. At the latter place a
gang of forty Boers was effectively tackled by the Volunteer Service
Company and the King&#8217;s Own Scottish Borderers under Major
Mayne. The whole bunch was most skilfully surrounded and
secured, and with them Mr. F. Wolmarans, chairman of the late
Volksraad. The passes were occupied, and from the 10th to the
12th of August stray Boers were unearthed by Colonel Allenby in
the southern slopes of the Magaliesberg, between Nooitgedacht and
Grobelaar&#8217;s Pass. Nine Boers were brought in, fourteen rifles, some
waggons, carts, and dynamite. About this time Major Butler (in
command of the Carabineers) was detached from Colonel Allenby&#8217;s
column to co-operate with General Gilbert Hamilton, who had been
engaging in the incessant harrying of Liebenberg&#8217;s commando and
other raiders east of Lichtenburg. Marching by night and by
day, he had hunted and tracked, worried and pursued, but had[Pg 113]
never succeeded in bringing the enemy to open fight. Now, on his
return to Ventersdorp on the 11th, he arranged, with the assistance
of Major Butler&#8217;s men from the north, for a simultaneous attack upon
Koperfontein and Basfontein. The attack was splendidly managed,
and on the morning of the 14th, after some vigorous fighting, in
which Lieutenant Till (6th Dragoon Guards) and one man lost their
lives and 5 men were wounded, 10 prisoners, 27 waggons, and
100 cattle were captured. Three Boers were killed.

Major Butler and the Carabineers rejoined Colonel Allenby at
Damhoek, while General Hamilton reconnoitred towards Tafel Kop
and made more prisoners.

General Barton now watched the establishment of posts eastwards
over the hill from Breedt&#8217;s Nek, while Colonels Kekewich and
Allenby, having completely effected their sweeping operations, moved
to Commando Nek for supplies. But of course the dispersed Boers
were forced to hide somewhere, so, going north, they chose Zwartkopies,
whence after some skirmishing they were driven by Colonel
Allenby. Meanwhile Colonel Kekewich, moving at the same date
(19th) from Commando Nek, ferreted along the bed of the Crocodile
River and effected the capture of fourteen of the enemy together
with their horses. So vigorous were the operations of both these
officers that the Boers in the district began to feel that their days
were numbered, and that they had better surrender with a good
grace. This twenty-nine of them did at Beestekraal, where Colonel
Allenby was operating, on the 23rd, while on the 25th sixteen more
(including T. Kruger, a nephew of the ex-President) surrendered
to Colonel Kekewich, who was then at the junction of the Crocodile
and Elands Rivers. As most of the remaining raiders had now
betaken themselves to the rugged and almost inaccessible country on
the north, where pursuit would have been useless, Colonel Kekewich
veered south, while Colonel Allenby moved west, with a view to
watching the west of Magaliesberg in the direction of Rustenburg.
September found them posted at points where they might work in
combination against Kemp&#8217;s commando&mdash;Colonel Allenby at Bashoek
(a northern fringe of the Magaliesberg) and Colonel Kekewich near
Magato Pass.

At this date, owing to the unceasing exertions of General Barton,
Colonels Kekewich and Allenby, and Lord Basing, together with the
extension of the system of Constabulary posts, excellent results had
been obtained in the area bounded on the north by the Magaliesberg,
on the south by the Vaal, on the east by the Pretoria line, and
on the west by the Frederikstad-Breedt&#8217;s Nek line of blockhouses.
Scarcely a Boer was to be seen. The raiders were forced to the
extreme limits, east and west, north and south, and against their
safety in these outskirts, further operations were soon to be directed.[Pg 114]

TRANSVAAL, S.W.

Their work over in the Marokani range and the valley of the
Harts River, Lord Methuen and General Fetherstonhaugh by
parallel routes moved to Klerksdorp. General Fetherstonhaugh
marched (on the 9th) his two columns along the right bank of
the Vaal, searching in every hole and cranny for nests of marauders
and destroying such supplies as he found. Colonel Hickie
unearthed few Boers; but Colonel Williams, by a knowing dodge
worthy of De Wet himself, set a trap which enclosed a whole convoy
plus eighteen prisoners, cattle, and vehicles. His man&oelig;uvre was this.
Report spoke to the fact that the convoy of Commandant Vermaas
on the 19th was trekking towards Katdoornplaats, north of Wolmaranstad.
Accordingly, he sent off his convoy under escort towards
Leeuwfontein, thus giving the effect that he was on the march in
that direction. Meanwhile he reserved his alert Colonials (the New
South Wales Mounted Rifles and Bushmen) for an enterprise after
their own heart. In the dead of night they were ordered to proceed
towards their goal, and at early dawn when they reached Katdoornplaats
they traced the tale of Boer departure and the direction of it
by the wheel-tracks in the soil. Not a moment did they lose. Off
on a gallop of twelve miles they went, lessening, as they plunged
onward, the distance between themselves and the lumbering convoy.
At last they were even with it; the ping of bullets told the Boers
that their flight was a failure and that they had met their match.
And so it came to pass that this mettlesome force, after an expedition
during which they covered sixty miles in twenty-seven hours,
returned to headquarters with the spoil before named, every one
of the captured vehicles being brought away with them. Among
the prisoners was the late Landdrost of Bloemhof and a telegraphist
with complete tapping apparatus.

While these columns were moving on Klerksdorp, which they
reached on 22nd and 23rd of August, Lord Methuen, on the left,
had been skirmishing his way along, fighting both with the gang
of Delarey and with that of Vermaas, fights of no limp nature, for
he came into Klerksdorp on the 22nd with 13 prisoners, 23 voluntarily
surrendered Boers, 400 trek oxen, 1848 cattle, 43 waggons, 19
carts, 76 horses, and 8 mules. He had lost one man, and one officer
and eight men had been wounded in the various frays. In addition to
these commandos which were trounced on the journey, report said
that General Kemp with some 800 followers was flitting between
the kopjes and crevices on the south-west of Olifant&#8217;s Nek. An
effort therefore had to be made to meet this hostile multitude, and
to this end the various troops moved by the 1st of September to
situations which were supposed to enclose the marauders and afford
them no loopholes of escape. Unfortunately, Lord Methuen&#8217;s men[Pg 115]
were covering a wide expanse of ground, and were forced to move
to block a reported attempt to escape towards Lindley Poort; and
through the gap thus created between the columns of Lord Methuen
and those of Colonel Hickie, the Dutch leader contrived to bolt. But
in his dashing feat only his mounted men could follow him, and consequently
a large body of Boers with waggons, carts, ammunition,
indeed all his effects, were left behind, and by degrees were unearthed
from their burial-places in the kloofs and taken possession of.

Lord Methuen, on the 2nd of September, marched from Brakfontein
to Roodival (on his return journey to Zeerust), and while
proceeding to the north-west he suddenly espied a convoy in the
distance. A mad chase ensued, followed by a brisk fight, in which
6 Boers were left dead on the field. Of prisoners 22 were taken,
together with waggons, carts, cattle, and ammunition in enormous
quantities. Passing on, Lord Methuen spent the following days in
capturing more vagrants; but on the 5th his troops came in for stiff
work. They were now in the country of scrub and jungle in the
Marico Valley, and round them on their right were Delarey and
Field-Cornet Van Tonder, whose convoy had been captured, while
on the left were Commandants Botha and Liebenberg. In addition
to these was the Marico commando under Commandant Lemmer
and Field-Cornet Louw, who attacked the rearguard. A stirring
action followed, the brunt of which was sustained by the 5th
Imperial Yeomanry and the Welsh Squadrons. Eleven Boers
were killed, 8 wounded, and 11 prisoners, while 10 waggons and 5 carts
were captured. This haul was somewhat increased by the contributions
of Colonel Von Donop, who with his detached column had taken
a more southerly route through Quaggashoek and the lead mines,
where he collected 3 Boers, 39 vehicles, and some cattle. The total
British casualties on the march between Brakfontein and Zeerust were
1 officer and 12 men killed, and 2 officers and 28 men wounded.

While Lord Methuen returned to Zeerust and General Hamilton
marched to Kaffir&#8217;s Kraal (fifteen miles north-west of Klerksdorp),
General Fetherstonhaugh remained for a few days trapping the
stragglers from Kemp&#8217;s force, in which operation he was assisted
by Colonel Kekewich, who afterwards (on the 7th) retraced his
steps viâ Middelfontein towards Naauwpoort. Colonel Allenby
on the 9th got back viâ Rustenburg to Commando Nek, having
indulged, as he went, in various exciting exploits. At Schaapkraal
he scented out a Boer laager and by night surrounded it so
cautiously and so cleverly that the Boers, though they made an
effort at fight, had not the ghost of a chance. Unfortunately in
the skirmish two men of the Scots Greys fell. Of the enemy,
22 were made prisoners and 2 were killed. Rifles, carts, loaded
waggons, and ammunition swelled the total.[Pg 116]

THE PIETERSBURG LINE&mdash;LIEUT.-COLONEL GRENFELL

Colonel Grenfell spent July and the better part of August in
operating against General Beyer&#8217;s gang, which still hovered around
the west of the Pietersburg line. These marauders in small
numbers were captured occasionally, but they were more inclined
for manslaughter than for war, and seldom came out into the
open, contenting themselves merely with train-wrecking. On the
4th of July, taking advantage of the thick cover that surrounded
the line north of Naboom Spruit Station, Commandant Lys and
his party lay in wait for a train for which a mine had been previously
prepared. The mine exploded to time and the train
with its escort of Gordon Highlanders was brought to a standstill.
Then from their comfortable ambush the enemy proceeded to
fire, killing Lieutenant Best and 9 Gordon Highlanders, an artillery-man,
2 Engineers, the driver, fireman, guard, and 4 natives. The
success of this scheme so delighted the ruffians that they tried
the same game again and again, and on the 31st of August a
still more tragic affair took place. The train was travelling between
Waterval and Hamanskraal Stations, and had descended a deep
cutting when an explosion occurred. Before the victims could
recover the shock of derailment the Boers hiding on the banks
rained bullets among their number, killing and wounding at their
pleasure. Colonel Vandeleur (Irish Guards), a valuable young
officer of great promise, fell; with him among the dead lay 13
men, 1 traveller, and 2 natives. Four officers were wounded,
besides 20 men and a woman. The mail-bags were seized by
the marauders, who were well pleased with their murderous
success.

To effect their chastisement and secure the line in future
from further assaults, General Barton quickly despatched from the
Hekpoort Valley, by Zilikat&#8217;s Nek, to Waterval, a flying column.
The force (250 men and two R.H.A. guns), under Colonel Hacket
Thompson, pursued the enemy, and near Wagon Drift caught them.
A brisk fight ensued, four of the gang were killed and a portion of
the captured mails was recovered, after which the column moved
back to Eerste Fabriken, and from thence to Waterval by the 8th
of September.

THE TRANSVAAL (NORTH-EAST)&mdash;GENERAL BLOOD&#8217;S
OPERATIONS

The first exploit of General Walter Kitchener in August was the
surprise of a convoy near Diepkloof, some thirty-five miles north of[Pg 117]
Middelburg, where he was encamped. Colonel Park meanwhile
searched for the remnants of Viljoen raiders in the rugged region of
the Tautesberg, and that done, marched to Paardekloof. A week
later, as a larger and more rapid swoop upon the enemy was contemplated,
General Kitchener from his own, Colonel Campbell&#8217;s,
and Colonel Park&#8217;s columns organised a flying column consisting of
the 18th and 19th Hussars, 4th Mounted Infantry Battalion, two
guns of the 81st Battery R.F.A., a pom-pom, and sixty &#8220;Devons,&#8221;
who were to be carried in carts. With this column he left Diepkloof
at 4 A.M. on the 10th for Krokodil Drift on the Olifants River,
while Colonels Campbell and Park, with the remainder of the
infantry (in waggons), proceeded to Rooikraal and Holnek.

General Kitchener now scoured the valley of the Blood River,
and finding it clear of guerillas, and hearing that Viljoen&#8217;s horde had
betaken itself to the banks of the Moos stream, he pushed thither
with his cavalry, over the stream and on towards the valley of Elands
River, leaving the Mounted Infantry with the pom-pom to guard
Krokodil Drift. Up to this time no vestige of the quarry had been
sighted. But now from the low banks fringing Elands River, dust in
the distance, some seven miles off, seemed to hint of a moving
convoy. The vision was tantalising. But an almost impregnable
jungle stretched between the dust-cloud and the British troops, and
the General decided that a cut across country would be futile. From
his observations he calculated that this convoy moving down the left
bank of the river towards Commissie Drift might be headed off at
that point; therefore the column was soon pushing along the
right bank towards the drift in expectation of a fight. But the
Boers were wary. By the time the British force gained the
drift, they discovered to their dismay that the enemy had retraced
their steps and were off to the south-west. After this disappointment
the column moved to Uyskraal, and from thence on the
16th they pushed up the Elands Valley to Vrieskrall. The 19th
Hussars, who were in advance, soon found to their cost that the
dense jungle in that region was populated with Boers, and at
midday the officer commanding sent back word that he was being
hard pressed. The Boers, indeed, were on all sides, and as fast
as the officers advanced, they found themselves surrounded.
The predicament threatened to be disastrous, for four of the
officers and nineteen of the troopers had been seized when the
18th Hussars and guns, which had been pushed forward in support,
turned the scale of events. Fighting, fast and furious, in the thick
of a dense mass of scrub and tangle was carried on, the enemy
sticking to the bush with fierce tenacity, the Hussars steadily pushing
them back and back to the region of some kopjes where, in the
shadow of the night, they sought refuge. Fortunately, during the[Pg 118]
scrimmage the foe were forced to let loose the officers and men whom
they had captured, but five gallant troopers were lost. The Boers
made use of the darkness to effect their escape, and by the morning
the whole of their position was evacuated. General Kitchener now
rejoined Colonel Campbell at Roorikraal, the flying column was
broken up, and the 4th Mounted Infantry returned to Colonel
Park.

From this date till the end of the month the columns moved
slowly down to the railway, those of General Kitchener and Campbell
by Blinkwater to Wonderfontein (which was reached on the
4th September), and that of Colonel Park by Roosenekal and Welpoort
to Bankfontein (five miles north-east of Middelburg), which
was reached on the 8th. The combined &#8220;bag&#8221; contained 53
prisoners, 22 voluntarily surrendered burghers, 2072 cattle, 76
horses, 60 waggons, and 24 carts. Sixteen Boers were killed. A
15-pounder gun and three Maxims were found by Colonel Park,
the enemy having first taken care to destroy them.

Colonel Benson meanwhile had been untiringly sweeping the
district between Carolina and Ermelo, causing the Boers to live in a
state of sleepless anxiety lest he, in one of his midnight swoops,
should catch them snoring. On the 15th he arranged another of
these expeditions, the direction being Warmbaths, some thirty-four
miles north-east of Carolina, where he then was. He moved first to
Nooitgedacht. Here he dropped his encumbrance in the form of
waggons, &amp;c.; and thus lightened, he stole with his brilliant little
band, Colonel Wools-Sampson leading them, across the pitch-black
veldt towards the enemy&#8217;s camp. For thirty-four miles
they crept on their errand of surprise. The stratagem was successful.
A good number of Boers escaped, but they went
horseless and cattleless. Fifty-two prisoners were taken, the majority
of whom were captured in a dashing rush by the Eastern
Transvaal Scouts under Major Young. Among the captives was a
captain of scouts for the Carolina districts, and also the father-in-law
of Mr. Schalk Burger. Colonel Benson now returned to Carolina,
where he remained till the 21st of August.

Of the activities of Colonel Benson&#8217;s force the correspondent
of the Morning Post reported enthusiastically. He said:&mdash;

&#8220;The intelligence officers of the column, for some time under Colonel Wools Sampson,
did their work in a most efficient manner. By various clever tactics they would locate
bodies of the enemy, perhaps twenty and sometimes even fifty miles away from the camp.
On their information a sudden swoop would be planned, and carried out, as a rule, successfully.
On occasion the whole column would march several miles in the opposite direction
to that of the object of attack. Then after the camp was formed, the horses fed, and the
men about to turn in for the night, sudden orders would be given for the mounted men to
march. The plans were not known generally, even by the officers, till within an hour of
marching. Then the camp would be left in charge of the infantry, and the mounted men[Pg 119]
would proceed as silently as possible on their night march of from twenty to fifty miles. If
guns were taken the wheels would be muffled, and every possible precaution would be taken
to keep the movement secret. Through the intelligence officers knowing the roads
thoroughly very few mishaps have occurred. The march was usually done in column of
fours until the point was reached whence the attack was to be made. Even on the darkest
nights, when it was difficult for a trooper to see his horse&#8217;s head, only very rarely has a
man got off the road and lost the column. After a couple of months&#8217; practice the men
became adepts at the work.

&#8220;When the point was reached from which the attack was to be made the force would be
divided into several independent squadrons and sent round the position occupied by the
enemy, each squadron leader being carefully instructed about what he had to do, whether
his part in the plan was to hold a nek over which the enemy would probably attempt to
escape, or whether it was to rush the position at a given time. The usual plan was to make
the attack just as daylight began to appear. The leading squadrons detailed for the work,
as a rule with Colonel Benson at their head, would gallop for the farmhouse or laager and
be right among the Boers before they were properly awake. Latterly the Boers have been
taking greater precautions, and some of the commandants have made it a rule to be saddled
up by three o&#8217;clock every morning. The districts operated in&mdash;Carolina, Ermelo, Middelburg,
and Lydenburg&mdash;have become noted during the war for the stubborn resistance they
have made. In these districts there are still considerable numbers of the enemy about,
mostly split up into small lots of ten, twenty, or perhaps fifty men. There are many farms
which have not been visited by any column. These are situated away from the main roads,
and hidden in kloofs and valleys among the hill ranges. These contain stores of food and
serve as resting-places for the enemy. The work of destroying these food depôts is steadily
prosecuted, but is necessarily a slow process. The Boers, however, obtain abundant
supplies from the Kaffir kraals, mealies, meat, and salt being the principal food, and,
judging from the condition of the prisoners taken, the Boers thrive on it.&#8221;

While the Eastern Transvaal Scouts, under Major Young, were
making their reputation for dash in this district, the South African
Constabulary and Morley&#8217;s Scouts, under Captain Wood, had been
doing splendid service patrolling the region of Bronkers Spruit.
Boers were known to be in the valley, and the Constabulary posts
were threatened by the dangerous contiguity of snipers sheltered in
networks of dongas beyond them, but the strength of the Boers was
not determined till the 17th, when the small British force came
suddenly upon a gang of some 800 marauders which had halted at
Middelburg. There was nothing to be done but to attack, and that
with rapidity, and before the sudden and really splendid rush of
Constabulary and Scouts the great Boer mass gave way&mdash;their
horses stampeded&mdash;and many were wounded, while 11 were taken
prisoners. But alas for the tide in the affairs of men! It turned
at the most critical moment. The Boers, becoming suddenly aware
of the small number of their assailants, made haste to rally their
forces and boldly lunged back on the British party. Hand-to-hand
fighting, ferocious and sustained, followed, during which Captain
Morley of the Scouts was dangerously wounded. Back and back
went the Constabulary, on and on came the Boers, till they had
recovered the 11 prisoners that had been taken from them and
secured 14 of the British to boot. In the fierce fray five of our men
were wounded and one killed. On the following day an effort
was made by Colonel Bewicke Copley to catch the guerillas and
punish them, but without avail. He made a forced march from[Pg 120]
Springs towards Middelburg, but the commando which had wrought
such havoc among Captain Wood&#8217;s men was nowhere to be seen.
Report said it had disappeared towards the south-east, so after dispersing
such stragglers as were found hanging about the line of
march preparing to locate themselves in the comfortable sniping-places
of spruit and donga, he proceeded to Olifantsfontein, whence
he sent for further supplies from Springs. At Olifantsfontein he
stayed a week, then went to Springs for the purpose of co-operating
with Colonel Benson. This officer, owing to some misunderstanding
regarding the urgency of the orders calling him west, and being
ignorant of the Boer concentration that had been effected on the
17th, moved from Carolina only on the 21st of August. He marched
by Vaalbank to Middelkraal; from thence he veered northwards;
drew supplies from Middelburg, and again proceeded on his course
towards Brakfontein, near the sources of the Wilge River. Here
Colonel Bewicke Copley, after a twenty-mile march, had arrived, and
here at dawn on the 31st he came in collision with 450 Boers; fought
them; wounded Lieutenant Roos of the Staats Artillery and some
others; took 7 prisoners, some horses, cattle, and waggons, and sent
the rest scattering to the south.

Colonel Benson, too, was doing his share of the Boer-hunting.
Hearing that the enemy had gone south towards the upper part
of the Waterval Valley, he decided on another of his night marches
for the surprise of the foe. Leaving his waggons in charge of the
infantry, he led his mounted troops towards the laager at Kroomdraai
(west of Ermelo). The pickets were &#8220;rushed,&#8221; and before
the startled Boers could reach their horses, the gallant Scottish
Horse plunged in among them. Fourteen prisoners were taken.
The late Landdrost of Heidelberg, and Brink, a member of the
Special Government Court for the trial of prisoners, were of the
number.

At the conclusion of the adventure&mdash;in which he captured 12
waggons, 17 Cape carts, 80 horses, 514 cattle, 11 mules, and some
supplies&mdash;and in consequence of the Boers having escaped beyond
pursuit to the south-east, Colonel Benson proceeded early in
September to the Delagoa line (Witbank Station), while Colonel
Bewicke Copley returned to Springs.



BULLOCK WAGGON CROSSING A DRIFT ON THE UMBELOSI RIVER, SWAZILAND.

LIEUTENANT-COLONEL COLVILLE&#8217;S OPERATIONS

In August Colonels Colville and Stewart, who had been operating
north of Greylingstad, moved to Standerton. On the 10th
the last officer entrained for Dundee to reinforce the troops
on the north-east frontier of Natal, while Colonel Colville crossed
the Klip and established an entrenched camp at Brakpan. He[Pg 121]
now, with mounted troops and guns, scoured the Upper Klip
Valley, penetrated Natal by Muller&#8217;s Pass in the Drakensberg,
and deposited at Newcastle his stock and prisoners captured during
the march. This march was by no means a triumphal progress, for
the district was fringed with Boers who sniped by day and brewed
mischief by night. The dongas, spruits, and hills afforded them
excellent cover, and the men needed nerves of iron to play a
livelong game of hide-and-seek with death, which peeped cunningly
from every nook and cranny.

Colonel Colville returned viâ Botha&#8217;s Pass to De Lange Drift
minus many of his gallant men who were wounded in the course
of the ordeal, and proceeded to Standerton on the 6th of September.

NATAL&mdash;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR H. HILDYARD

On the Natal frontier affairs had become somewhat unsettled.
The Boers who had been swept off from the Standerton line were
dribbling across the frontier, and others round about Vryheid and
Utrecht seemed to be waiting an opportunity to effect a concentration.
At the end of July it became certain that the foe was
gathering in good numbers to the east of Nqutu, and that many
more might be creeping through the long grass to other parts
of the country which had become more or less settled. On the
28th of July things came to a climax. Major F. A. Henderson
(8th Hussars), who with 200 mounted men (8th Hussars and
Natal Volunteer Composite Regiment) was scouring the locality
around Nqutu, came on the foe and engaged them. The marauders
were more than usually strong and more than usually tenacious.
They launched themselves, in a mass of 400, with great dash
against the small British force, in the hope to intercept the troops
if possible during their retirement to Nondweni; but through
the skill of the commanding officer and the dash of 20 men of
the Natal Volunteers, who raced them for a kopje and won, the
Boers were frustrated. The fighting lasted the whole day, and
the Boers made frantic efforts to capture a gun of the 67th Battery
R.F.A., but with great energy the piece of contention was galloped
off under a brisk fusillade from the foe till it was safely out of their
range.

Doggedly both parties battled together, with the result that
Major Jervis-Edwards, a gallant officer whose loss was much
deplored, and three men were killed, and five were wounded.
Soon after this, the Boers becoming still more obstreperous, it
was arranged that Lieut.-General Sir H. Hildyard&#8217;s command
should be strengthened by the addition of the column of Colonel
Stewart, whose departure for Dundee we may remember, and[Pg 122]
another under Colonel Pulteney. This column consisted of the
Victorian Mounted Rifles (moved from the Delagoa line), a
squadron of the 8th Hussars, the Dublin Fusiliers Mounted
Infantry, and two guns. While this mobile column was sweeping
from Utrecht to Kambuladraai, Colonel Stewart was marching
from Dundee through Vryheid towards the same destination. A
junction was effected on the 23rd of August, on which date a brisk
encounter took place between Colonel Pulteney&#8217;s men and the
Boers who were sneaking in the west of the Schurveberg. In the
engagement two of the Victorians were killed and five wounded.

On the following days both columns retraced their steps to
Vryheid and then, united under the command of Colonel Blomfield,
moved to the junction of the Pivaan and Manzaan Rivers. The
march over rugged and tormenting ground was one trying to
the patience of man and beast, particularly as gangs of Boers
under Scholtz at intervals prevented any chance of monotony
by variations in the art of sniping and &#8220;potting.&#8221; The force
returned to Vryheid on the 31st, little having been accomplished
owing to the impracticable nature of the country. But two Boers
were killed. Early in September Colonel Blomfield began a
new scouring expedition, moving down the valley of the Umvalosi
on to Bethel and Brakfontein. Here again, on the 4th September,
he had a smart tussle with the enemy, and having dispersed them,
moved to Nondweni and thence to Dundee.

CAPE COLONY&mdash;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR J. FRENCH

Early in August the troops of General French were found
on the line Beaufort West, Pearston, Drennan Station-Cameron
Glen-Cathcart. They now began pushing steadily northwards,
sweeping the enemy before them. Kruitzinger, thus pressed, was
forced to retire in the direction of Middelburg and Steynsburg.
His gang&mdash;dispersed by various frays with the British columns,
and divided in desultory knots which succeeded in passing through
the line of British blockhouses&mdash;reassembled north of the Zuursberg
at Langedrift (fifteen miles north-west of Steynsburg). Here their
number was swelled by bands under Erasmus, Wessels, and Pypers.
There was now a somewhat formidable army of guerillas, and
these on the 13th were encountered by Colonel Gorringe at
Rooifontein. The gang were attacked, driven back past Venterstad
into the Orange River, and in their retreat were so
effectively hustled by Captains Nickalls and Sandeman, that
they lost many of their number, among them Commandant
Cachet, while the redoubtable Erasmus, together with Kruitzinger&#8217;s
secretary, were captured. Colonel Hunter Weston about[Pg 123]
this time had also been engaged with Theron and had driven
him and his to the right-about with characteristic despatch.
While these frays were going forward, Lategan&#8217;s raiders, who had
been pressed into the Orange River Colony, were there being
forcibly tackled by Colonel Byng and General Plumer. So far
so good. But there were other gangs that buzzed mosquito-like
in a circle; and these, under Lotter and Botha, after being
flicked northward from the
Rhenosterberg (south-west of
Middelburg), veered round
and contrived to break
through the pursuing columns
and re-establish themselves in
the hilly region of Spitzkop
(thirty miles south of Middelburg).
Smit&#8217;s gang, after
being routed from the
Rhenosterberg, scurried
across the rail towards the
north-west of Deelfontein,
afterwards infesting the
country between Carnarvon
and Fraserburg; Lotter and
Botha shifted to the Cradock
district, while another troop
of marauders under Theron
created havoc and consternation
between Aberdeen and
Willowmore. Still, though
the mosquitos continued to
draw good British blood
occasionally, they paid a fair
price for it, and in the series
of attacks which whisked them north 19 of the number were killed,
43 wounded, and 17 captured.



Lieut.-Col. Gorringe


It must here be noted that on the 17th of August, at Graaff
Reinet, three of the rebel leaders, Van Rensburg, Fourie, and
Pfeifer, who were captured at Camdeboo in July, were executed.
Ten others were sentenced to penal servitude for life in the Bermudas.
It was impossible to feel commiseration for these men, in view of
the numbers of British homes they had robbed by the insane folly
of resistance after the annexation of the Boer territories, and it
was felt that unless some severe measures were adopted the system
of lawlessness would continue for ever in the Colony.

It was now necessary to make new dispositions in order to[Pg 124]
guard against the return of the raiders who had been driven
north, and to pursue those who had succeeded in scuttling to the
south. Accordingly Colonel Wyndham followed the tracks of
Smit to the west, and Colonels Crabbe and Hunter-Weston and
Captain Lund converted themselves into a three-headed Cerberus
to guard the Zand Drift (west of Colesberg) against the reappearance
of Lategan. Colonel Gorringe&#8217;s column, with the 17th
Lancers, kept a vigilant watch on the Orange between Norval&#8217;s
Pont and Bethulie, while Colonels Doran, Scobel, and Kavanagh,
working to the south, followed the spoor of Lotter, Botha,
and Theron. So stood affairs towards the end of August.
Then a rumour came to the effect that Smit and Scheepers
were brewing mischief, the first at Fraserburg, the latter near
Laingsburg. Therefore, most promptly, the column of Colonel
Crabbe was shifted to Matjesfontein.

Two days later, on the 5th of September, Colonel Scobell,
who was chasing Lotter, scored the biggest success of the
guerilla campaign. At Petersburg, some forty miles west of
Cradock, he succeeded in surrounding his man and in capturing
not only him and his whole commando, but an additional gang under
Breedt! The whole affair was most brilliantly conceived, and
reflected credit on so many for their pluck and gallantry, that
some of the names of the heroes who contributed to the success
of the affair are scarcely known. Firstly, much of the kudos is
due to a party of Midland Mounted Rifles, who, on the 2nd
of September, held with such tenacity a pass that Lotter hoped
to push through, that the career of the Boer leader was arrested
and it became possible for Colonel Scobell to effect his checkmate!

Among the splendid supporters of the Colonel who were notable
for exceptional gallantry were Captain Lord Douglas Compton,
2nd Lieutenants Wynn and Neilson, Captain Purcell (9th Lancers),
and Lieutenant Bowers, Cape Mounted Rifles; while all the men
of the 9th Lancers so distinguished themselves that it is impossible
to cite the names and the deeds done by those glorious fellows
without devoting pages to the task. Unfortunately Lieutenant
Theobald, who had been killed earlier in the month, lost the finale,
to which he, with his comrades, had so perseveringly and so gallantly
contributed.

The list of prisoners included Commandant Lotter and Field-Cornets
J. Kruger, W. Kruger, and Schoeman, and among the
dead were two notorious rebels named Voster. The booty consisted
of 200 horses, 29,000 rounds of ammunition, and all the vehicles and
supplies of the commandos. Our casualties included Lieutenant
Burgess, Cape Mounted Rifles.

In other parts of the Colony the columns were almost equally[Pg 125]
active, if not equally successful. The remnant of Fouché&#8217;s party,
after his departure across the Orange, gathered themselves under
the banner of Myburg and took up positions in the triangle Ladygrey,
Dordrecht, and Burghersdorp. Colonel Munro spent his
time in hustling them, and on the 29th of August had a spirited
engagement some twenty miles north-east of Dordrecht, which
resulted in the defeat of the hordes, who were driven over the
Drakensberg into Transkei territory. His columns, together with
the local troops, then took up positions in the defiles and passes,
so as to block them effectually and prevent a chance of the return
of the marauders.

General Beatson, who was now assisting in General French&#8217;s
operations, was actively chasing Scheepers in the south&mdash;first below
Willowmore, then to Aventour, then to the west in the direction of
Klip Drift; thence to Oudtshoorn and Ladysmith. Here the young
Boer leader was set on by the local troops, whereupon he shifted his
course to Barrydale. This rush took him till the 31st of August,
during which time the hunt was vigorously carried on by Colonel
Alexander and the 10th Hussars. Scheepers made an attempt on
Montague, and was baulked by a detachment of the Berkshire
Regiment. He then made various plucky but futile efforts to get
across the rail, his object being to effect a junction with Smit, who
was on the other side of Matjesfontein. He came in collision several
times with the troops of Colonel Alexander, who, in the course
of their gallant efforts to frustrate the Boer designs, had 2 officers
and 10 men wounded, and lost 4 men. In the south-west, Maritz
was meanwhile being hunted by Colonel Capper, who kept the
raiders perpetually on the move, and forced them to break into an
aimless, rudderless gang, glad of hiding-places in the Roggeveld
Mountains.

While all this ferreting and hunting was going forward in the
south, some brilliant deeds were taking place in the Kimberley
district. De Villiers and Conroy, with a strong force, made a
lunge upon Griquatown, the garrison of the place being only 100
in number. The force, though small, was determined, and the
aggressors were sent to the right-about. This was on the 12th of
August. On the 24th the hostile hordes made a vigorous dash on
a convoy, for which they doubtless hungered with a hunger that lent
heroism to their attack. Certain it is that they came to very
close quarters, and that fighting between them and the escort (74th
(Irish) Squadron, Imperial Yeomanry), under Captain Humby, was
carried on more stubbornly and fiercely than usual. The Boers&mdash;400
of them&mdash;surrounded the convoy, and it seemed at one moment as
though they must inevitably annihilate the little British force; but
the men stood their ground like rocks, or, rather, like fervid volcanoes[Pg 126]
spouting fire, and fighting with such daring and determination that
eventually, at nightfall, the enemy were forced to withdraw. The
gallantry of the officers and men of the Yeomanry was superb&mdash;Lieutenant
Despard and Lieutenant Kidd (Diamond Fields
Artillery) performed splendid work, and the magnificent manner in
which Captain Humby extricated his convoy from the hellish vortex
and succeeded in getting to his destination without the loss of a
waggon is a tale that needs pages to tell. Nine men of the escort,
however, paid with their lives for their grand tenacity, and 2 officers
and 21 men were wounded.

The captures from and losses of the enemy during August were
186 killed, 75 wounded, 1384 prisoners, 529 voluntary surrenders,
930 rifles, 90,958 rounds of ammunition, 1332 waggons, 13,570
horses, and 65,879 cattle&mdash;a sum-total which makes a really wonderful
and practical testimonial to the ceaseless energy and zeal of the
British troops.

Before closing the record of the events of August 1901,
reference must be made to the visit paid by the Duke and Duchess
of Cornwall and York to the Cape. Their Royal Highnesses,
who had been on a tour round the world, landed at Simonstown
on the 19th of August, and thence proceeded to Capetown. The
demonstration made by the Cape loyalists was enthusiastic beyond
words, the weather was superb, and the scene&mdash;the brilliant decorations,
the British cheers, the massed bands, the Kaffir war-dances
and whoops&mdash;was one never to be forgotten by those who took
part in it. The Prince, in his reply to the loyal addresses, made this
memorable allusion to the heartiness of the Colony&#8217;s reception:&mdash;

&#8220;We are glad to have this opportunity to give public and grateful expression to our
feelings of profound satisfaction at the very enthusiastic and hearty welcome accorded us
on our arrival here to-day. The fact that during the last two years you have been passing
through such troublous times, and that in addition to your other trials the Colony has
suffered from an outbreak of plague, from which it is not yet entirely free, might well have
detracted from the warmth of your greeting, but, in despite of all your trials and sufferings,
you have offered us a welcome the warmth and cordiality of which we shall never forget.
I should also like to express our admiration of the appearance the city of Capetown
presents to-day. Apart from their tasteful decoration, the principal streets through which
we have passed offer an aspect very different from that which they possessed twenty years
ago when I visited your Colony. I congratulate you on the abundant evidence of the
progress achieved during that time, and notably on your trade and commerce and the
development of your harbours and railways. I greatly deplore the continuance of
the lamentable struggle which has so long prevailed within South Africa, and for the
speedy termination of which the whole community fervently prays. During this time you
have had to make grievous sacrifices. Numbers have personally suffered trials and privations,
while many of the flower of your manhood have fallen in the service of their King
and country. To all who have been bereaved of their dear ones by the war we offer our
heartfelt sympathy and condolence. May time, the great healer, bring consolation. That
South Africa may soon be delivered from the troubles which beset her is our earnest
prayer, and that ere long the only struggle she knows will be eager rivalry in the arts of
peace and in striving to promote good government and the well-being of the community.&#8221;

CHAPTER XIII

NATAL AND THE EASTERN TRANSVAAL&mdash;SEPTEMBER 1901

At this time the war entered on a new phase. The Boer generals
felt the necessity of tiding over the 15th of the month, the date
fixed by the Proclamation of the 7th August as the limit of time
within which, by voluntarily surrendering, the leaders might avoid
certain penalties threatened by that proclamation. And by dint
of unusual activity they succeeded. There were few surrenders, it
is true, but the tactics adopted by the enemy cost them, in the end, more heavily
than their previous evasive methods. They broke out in the Ermelo and
Vryheid districts about the middle of the month. Their harassing rushes and
their escape into the Ermelo district had been difficult to arrest owing to the
unfinished state of the blockhouse line then being built from Wakkerstroom to
Piet Retief by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and 2nd Battalion West
Yorkshire Regiment under General Bullock. At Belfast, on the 16th, the
garrison was attacked by Grobelaar and 100 men evidently in need of supplies.
They were handsomely repulsed, and only one of the garrison was wounded;
but bullets that fell in the refuge camp caused the death of a woman.

General Lyttelton had now assumed command in Natal in place of General
Hildyard, who, after a long spell of brilliant service, had gone home on leave.
The new chief at once turned his attention to the rumour of assembling
commandos, and to frustrate concentration Major Gough&#8217;s Mounted Infantry with
Colonel Stewart and the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles moved from Dundee
to De Jager&#8217;s Drift. Meanwhile Pulteney&#8217;s troops were at Volksrust, and those
of Garratt moving, viâ Wakkerstroom, on Utrecht.

The enemy were reported to be near Scheepers Nek. Colonel Stewart and
Major Gough, on the 17th, decided to push on towards Blood River to get in
touch with them, the last marching about an hour in advance of the first. Major
Gough, as he neared the river, sent a message requesting Colonel Stewart to
remain at Rooi Kop, in readiness to support him should he hear the sound of
guns in action. Half-an-hour later, seeing Gough&#8217;s men galloping towards
Blood River Poort, the Colonel pressed forward his mounted men in
support. It was then he heard that the Major had met with a reverse&mdash;a
serious reverse. Quickly appreciating the ticklish position in which he
himself was placed&mdash;it being imperative to protect not only his own guns but
Major Gough&#8217;s baggage at Rooi Kop&mdash;he decided to retire to De Jager&#8217;s Drift
and thus cover Dundee, which, as it turned out, was menaced by a gang of
great strength. The tale of the misfortune to so magnificent an officer as
Major Gough is hard to write, for a series of services more gallant and brilliant
than his it is scarcely possible to find. The circumstances were these. With
characteristic dash he no sooner &#8220;spotted&#8221; the enemy than he pressed
forward to seize a ridge which appeared to command their position. He had
galloped into a well-arranged ambush. Instead of 300 as he supposed, there[Pg 128]
were 1000 Boers in front of him, and these speedily overwhelmed his right
flank and assailed his guns from the rear. There was fighting of the hottest
description at very close quarters, in which Lieutenant Lambton, 1st Durham
Light Infantry, and Lieutenant Blewett, 1st Rifle Brigade, with great bravery
sacrificed their lives; but the gallant little force (consisting of two guns 69th
Battery R.F.A. and three companies of mounted infantry), terribly outnumbered,
was eventually captured. The breech-blocks and the sights of the guns were
destroyed before they fell into the enemy&#8217;s hands. The circumstances of the
capture of Second Lieutenant Stormonth-Darling (2nd Scottish Rifles) serve to
show the manner of the British repulse. He commanded the escort to the
guns, and in spite of the Boers being upon him continued to fire and encourage
his men till he was overpowered and the rifle snatched from his hands. Major
Gough and Captain Cracroft, Royal Irish Rifles, escaped during the night and
joined Colonel Stewart at De Jager&#8217;s Drift.

Captain Mildmay, 3rd Battalion King&#8217;s Royal Rifle Corps, and 14 men
were killed in action. Captain Dick, 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers,
was severely wounded.

Lieutenant Furnell, 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, Lieutenant Lambton,
Durham Light Infantry, Lieutenant Price-Davis, King&#8217;s Royal Rifle
Corps, and about 25 men were wounded, and 5 officers and 150 men made
prisoners.

Troops were at once concentrated on the threatened point, and the Boers&mdash;said
to be commanded by the Bothas, Opperman, Britz, and Henderson&mdash;finding
the line of the Buffalo bristling with British, were forced to seek access
to Natal by a wider détour to the south. This led them to the fortified posts
of Itala and Fort Prospect, north-west of Melmoth, on the Zululand frontier.
At Itala the garrison consisted of two guns of the 69th Battery R.F.A. and 300
men of the 5th Division Mounted Infantry under Colonel A. J. Chapman,
Royal Dublin Fusiliers. At midnight of the 26th, Botha, Scholtz, Opperman,
Potgieter, and their following of some 1500 men, in groups, began an attack
on this post from west, south-east, and north.

The advance post of 80 men was first rushed, and many of the party were
killed or forced to surrender, while others succeeded in escaping down the hill
to assist in the fighting that was to come. For nineteen hours without intermission
the enemy continued to assail the camp, though doggedly kept at bay
by the defenders. The whole area was swept by blasts of bullets, and the
British force at last, foodless and waterless, were confronted with the fear that
even the ammunition might not hold out. The guns, under Lieutenant Herbert,
R.F.A., which had been valuable during the night while the moon gave light
and the shadows shelter, became in the daytime targets for the foe, and
consequently when Lieutenant Herbert and four gunners were wounded the rest
were ordered to take cover. But fortunately young Trousdale, after both his
men were killed, pluckily stuck to his Maxim and worked like a Trojan. At
last under cover of dusk the enemy, repulsed on all sides, withdrew in a north-easterly
direction, taking with them, assisted by natives, their wounded and
dead in great numbers. Many deeds of gallantry were performed, and Lieutenant
Lefroy, 1st Battalion Dublin Fusiliers, who with Lieutenant Kane at
first rumour of assault was sent to occupy the highest point of the Itala a
mile from the camp, distinguished himself by shooting with his revolver Commandant
H.J. Potgieter. Commandant Scholtz and about 270 Boers were also
killed during the vigorous repulse. The British lost a smart officer, Lieutenant
Kane (South Lancashire Regiment), and 21 men killed: 5 officers and 54 men[Pg 129]
wounded. Colonel Chapman, owing to the complete exhaustion of his force
and lack of ammunition, then decided to evacuate Itala, leaving Lieutenant
Hislop and twenty unarmed men and Chief Veterinary Surgeon Probyn to look
after the wounded. Lieutenant Fielding (R.A.M.C.), who early in the day had
valiantly gone up hill to attend the wounded in the advance post, had been
captured, but was subsequently released and came into camp after the
column had marched off to M&#8217;Kandhla. This place was reached without
molestation.



&#8220;NO SURRENDER!&#8221; THE DEFENCE OF FORT ITALA ON SEPTEMBER 26, 1901

Drawing by R. Caton Woodville


At Fort Prospect the British post was equally tenaciously held by thirty-five
men of the 5th Division Mounted Infantry and fifty-one men of the Durham
Artillery Militia under the command of Captain C. A. Rowley, 2nd Battalion
Dorsetshire Regiment, who contrived with the small force at his disposal to
send the 500 attacking Boers to the right-about with considerable aplomb.

He, fortunately, was warned as to the coming commandos, and made haste
to prepare for them a warm welcome; providing also extra food, water, and
ammunition for his men in the trenches. At 4.30 A.M. the Boers made a
violent lunge on the west and north of the position, directing the main fury
of their attack at the two laagers held by the Durham Company of Artillery.
They penetrated the wire around the laagers and got to within twenty yards of
the defenders, but Lieutenant R. G. M. Johnson and his splendid companions
were too much for them, and finally the Boers were driven off. They then fought
wildly in the rear of the camp, but again met with the same dogged resistance.
The defence lasted about thirteen hours and reflected credit on all concerned,
especially on Captain Rowley, whose foresight had averted great loss of life. In
addition to the splendid work done by the Militia Artillery and the Dorsetshire
Regiment, the Zululand Native Police distinguished themselves. Gallantly led
by Sergeant Gambi, thirteen of them came four miles from their own post
to reinforce the garrison. The British loss was only 1 killed and 8 wounded,
a small total considering the thirteen hours&#8217; risk run by the little party.

The necessity of combing this difficult and at times almost impenetrable
country of Boers caused General Lyttelton to direct a movement which
occupied the tempestuous close of September and the early days of October, in
which Generals Bruce-Hamilton, Clements, and Walter Kitchener vigorously
engaged. Despite the unfavourable elements they succeeded, if not in striking
them when concentrated, at least in forcing the Boers gradually to retreat
north to Boschoek, Kromellenbog, and Leeuwnek. Here they were held for
a time by General Kitchener, but on the night of the 5th of October, at the
cost of their baggage and waggons, they succeeded in rushing round the left
flank and retreating in the direction of Piet Retief. General Kitchener followed
and had a smart engagement with the rearguard, which&mdash;in a strong position&mdash;covered
the flight of the main body.

On the 11th the enemy was moving through Swaziland by Mahamba, and
this news caused Colonel Colville adroitly to arrange a plan which resulted in
the intercepting of a convoy belonging to the Ermelo and Amsterdam commandos.
The Colonel&#8217;s column at the time was covering the construction, by
General Bullock&#8217;s troops, of the blockhouse line from Wakkerstroom. He
pushed on hurriedly from Piet Retief and pounced on the Boers&#8217; much needed
convoy, harassing Botha and his burghers, who scurried to escape before the
British advance. By now the blockhouse line was sufficiently advanced to
be a serious impediment to the enemy&#8217;s movements: it not only forced him
to abandon his waggons but also the two guns of 69th Battery which were
lost during Gough&#8217;s reverse at Blood River Poort.[Pg 130]

Brigadier-General Reeves (temporarily commanding in the absence of
General Blood, who had left for India), with Colonels Park and Benson,
continued to operate north and south of the Delagoa Railway. Colonel
Benson, on the 10th, made a splendid march on an extremely dark night and
surprised a party of Boers at Pullen&#8217;s Hope (south of Middelburg), where he
took 33 prisoners, 73 horses, together with cattle-carts and ammunition. On
the 15th he, with two squadrons of the 2nd Scottish Horse and 19th Battalion
Mounted Infantry, repeated his adventurous tactics, again surrounded and
surprised the enemy at Tweefontein, and, though some made good their escape,
added 10 Boers to his roll of prisoners and 250 oxen to his herd of cattle.
Still indefatigable, he and his doughty band on the 17th, after a forty miles&#8217;
march from Carolina, fell on the foe. The early mist was lifting round
two laagers full of slumbering Boers at Middeldrift and Busby, when with
a rush and a yell the British troops covered the scene. The usual rout, the
usual stampede, and finally 54 prisoners&mdash;among them P. Botha, late Landdrost
of Pretoria, and Commandant Nieuwhondt were captured, together with
vehicles, horses, and cattle. Colonel Benson then pushed on and on&mdash;a
triumphal progress&mdash;for he gleaned Boers wherever he went; 12 on the
28th near Bethel, and 7 early in October at Driefontein, in addition to horses,
mules, and cattle, thus compelling those who evaded him to scuttle north
denuded and demoralised. In the course of their chasing, this intrepid British
band covered over fifty miles in nineteen hours. The Boers seldom spent a
night in one place, and saddled up regularly at 3 A.M. in readiness for flight,
therefore the captures made were the result not only of alertness and dash, but
of indomitable perseverance.

Colonel Park had been engaging in like adventures, and had taken many
prisoners. With six companies of Mounted Infantry and two companies
of the Manchester Regiment, he began October by a search between Kruger&#8217;s
Post and Ohrigstad. He secured some armed burghers, and destroyed such
ammunition and forage as could not be removed. On his return journey he
came in collision with Viljoen at Rustplaats, and after an engagement covering
hours the Boers withdrew. On the 7th of October he attacked a party of
Boers at a farm at Rosenkrans, captured their ammunition, mealies, and
waggons, but not their persons.

The Constabulary posts running from Eerste Fabriken, viâ Springs and
Heidelberg, to the Vaal River were pushed forward by Colonel Pilkington
(S.A. Constabulary) to the line Wilge River Station, Greylingstad, and the
junction of Kalk Spruit with the Vaal, thus enabling a more vast tract of
country to be cleared. Sir Henry Rawlinson cleared the front of the Constabulary
between Standerton and the Vaal River with increasing vigour,
chasing Boers westward and southward before him. On the 3rd of October, at
Greylingstad, he organised a night patrol to Barnard&#8217;s Kop, which resulted
in the capture of three armed burghers, and subsequently, on the 5th, he
surprised Field-Cornet Botha at Kaffir Spruit, captured 7 of his men, 20 of his
carts, and 250 cattle. Pretorius, whose laager was near by, though followed
with zest, made good his escape. Colonels Hacket Thompson and Bewicke
Copley also engaged in the work of protecting the Constabulary, but came
in collision with few of the enemy, who were now moving south.[Pg 131]

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Lord Methuen may be said to have carried on existence to a rippling
accompaniment of Boer bullets. All along the Marico valley to Zeerust his
rearguard was followed and engagements were frequent. September was spent
in passing convoys from Lichtenburg and Zeerust and preparing for an advance
to cover the collection of ripening corn in the Marico district, the establishment
of a line of blockhouses between Zeerust and the lead mines, and the
clearance of the country of scattered bands. On the 4th of October an affair
of patrols at Witgeboom Spruit resulted in five burghers being killed.

General Fetherstonhaugh and Colonel Kekewich continued to hunt dismounted
stragglers of Kemp&#8217;s force south-west of Olifant&#8217;s Nek. Kemp
had escaped the British cordon towards the north-east, and was said to be
about to work his way south. Colonel Kekewich, after depositing his prisoners
at Naauwpoort, left there on the 13th of September to clear the northern slopes
of the Magaliesberg. He operated for some days in conjunction with Colonel
Mackenzie (1st Battalion Suffolk Regiment), who was employed in the construction
of blockhouses south of the Magaliesberg, and removed from the creeks and
crannies of the hills various impediments, in the form of Field-Cornet Klopper
and thirty-six of his countrymen. After this haul of prisoners, Colonel Kekewich
returned to Magato Nek to co-operate with General Fetherstonhaugh
against Kemp&#8217;s party, who were reported to be hanging about the Toelani
River. On the 24th, by the way, he surrounded the laager of one Van Rooijan
at Crocodile Drift (Elands River), and secured the commandant and thirty-five
of his gang. Kemp, as yet, was not to be found. But he was not long inactive.
At dawn on 29th, he and Delarey (who had evidently followed Colonel Kekewich
from the Valley of the Toelani) made a lunge at the British camp near
Moedwill. From three sides they, some 1200 of them, turned a blizzard of
lead on Colonel Kekewich&#8217;s force.

The Derbyshire Regiment, with 1&frac12; companies, held the drift to left of
the camp. The mounted troops (Imperial Yeomanry and Scottish Horse)
extended round the right and front of the camp, and joined up with the Infantry
outpost on the drift. Firing was heard at 4.40 A.M. on the north-west, and
subsequently it was found that a patrol going out from the southerly piquet,
furnished by the Devonshire Imperial Yeomanry, had been attacked. Then
closer and closer came the enemy upon the Yeomanry piquet. Every gallant
fellow dropped. Soon the Boers were established to east of the river and
commenced an attack on another Imperial Yeomanry piquet. The officer in
command fell, and nearly all his men around him. The enemy, ensconced in
the broken and bushy ground near the bed of the river, continued the aggressive,
while all in camp rushed to reinforce the piquets except a small party of the
Derbyshire Regiment, which remained to guard ammunition, &amp;c., the Boers
having annihilated two piquets. The Boers now pushed up the river, outflanking
the Derbyshire piquet holding the main drift, and, in spite of really
superb resistance, occupied the position. For this reason: but one man of
the gallant number remained whole! The camp now was flooded with bullets,
and all ranks under various officers made for the open, while the guns strove
to keep the enemy, indistinguishable from British in the dusk of the morning,
at a distance. Captain Watson, Adjutant Scottish Horse, who was mortally
wounded, announced the arrival towards the east of the enemy, whereupon Major
Watts with a strong body of the Derbyshire Regiment moved out to confront[Pg 132]
them, while Major Browne (Border Regiment) with a number of men&mdash;servants,
cooks, orderlies, and any one who came to hand&mdash;prepared with fixed bayonets
to charge the enemy in the bushes. The Boers had given up the east, however,
and continued to file from the north till the Imperial Yeomanry and Scottish
Horse, under Captains Rattray, Dick Cunyngham, and Mackenzie, joined in
the general advance and threatened to outflank them; then, seeing their
danger, they fled to their horses and galloped madly to the north, under fire of
the British guns. Colonel Duff, with two squadrons, had been prepared for
pursuit, but owing to the heavy losses sustained, especially among the horses,
the project was impossible.

This fierce, determined, carefully-planned attack lasted two hours, and the
success of the repulse was mainly due to the amazing gallantry of all ranks,
especially of the 1st Battalion Derbyshire Regiment. Some brilliant deeds
were done, notably by 2nd Lieutenant Mills, whose splendid disregard of
danger cost him his life; Lieutenant Persse (7th Imperial Yeomanry), who
fought persistently at his post though wounded in three places; and by Captains
Dick Cunyngham and Rattray, and Lieutenants Symonds, Rattray, Cameron,
Loring, and Stuart-Wortley, of the Scottish Horse. A fine officer, Captain
Laird, R.F.A., was among the killed, and Lieutenant Duval was wounded,
and Captain Wheeler escaped merely by a miracle. The medical officers,
Major Lavie (R.A.M.C.) and Mr. Kidd, Civil Surgeon, pursued their deeds
of mercy, utterly regardless of their lives and of their own wounds. The
Colonel, himself wounded, paid dearly for his triumph. Of his force 1
officer and 31 men were killed; 127 men were wounded and 26 officers,
among whom were:&mdash;

Scottish Horse.&mdash;Major Blair, Captain Field, Lieutenant Loring, Lieutenant
Stuart-Wortley, Surgeon-Captain Kidd, Lieutenant Jardine, Lieutenant
Edwards, Lieutenant Prior, Lieutenant Cameron, Lieutenant Flower.

Royal Artillery.&mdash;Captain Baldwin.

1st Derby Regiment.&mdash;Captain Keller, Captain Anley.

Imperial Yeomanry.&mdash;Captain Seymour, Lieutenant Whyte.

Out of a party of twelve of the Derbyshire Regiment which was guarding a
drift, 8 were killed and 4 wounded; and some idea of the severity of the fire
and the doggedness of the fight may be gained by the fact that three piquets
were practically annihilated, thus enabling their comrades to get under
arms.

Among others of the Scottish Horse whose persistent and gallant services
contributed to Lord Methuen&#8217;s success, may be mentioned Captains Field and
Ian Mackenzie, and young Lieutenant Jardine, who was wounded.

Command of the column was afterwards temporarily assumed by Colonel
Wylly (Derbyshire Regiment), but Colonel Kekewich, recovered, soon returned
to duty.

General Fetherstonhaugh had meanwhile driven before him many Boers.
On the 21st he captured a position at Winkelhoek, and after searching further
turned back to Waterval and thence to Kwaggafontein. On hearing of the
Moedwill fight he sent Colonel Williams to Colonel Kekewich&#8217;s support, and
followed himself with all haste. But of course the Boers had flown, scattering
among the farms in the Rustenburg Zeerust road. General Fetherstonhaugh
finally moved south, and Colonel Wylly to Rustenburg.

[Pg 133]

OPERATIONS ON THE VAAL

By October the line of blockhouses from Kopjes Station to Potchefstroom
was built by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and 1st Oxfordshire Light
Infantry, and that between Heilbron and Frankfontein occupied by the Railway
Pioneer Regiment under Colonel Capper. Meanwhile Colonels Byng and
Dawkins (from the south of Orange Colony) chased and ran down Boers
as they sought to escape the blockhouse cordon, and thus thoroughly cleared
the region. Colonel Byng made an effort to attack a concentration of 300
he had heard of at Bothaville, but on his approach they dispersed into the river
valleys. Still, in the course of their operations and the return along the Valsch
River to Kroonstad, &amp;c., Colonels Byng and Dawkins secured eighty-one
prisoners of war.

General Mildmay Willson organised a small smart force, under Colonel Hicks
(2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers), consisting of 250 mounted infantry, 2
field guns, and 5 companies of Infantry, to establish and provision constabulary
posts and hunt Boer snipers. In the course of their operations and afterwards
between Potchefstroom and Venterskroon they, with the assistance of co-operating
constabulary troops, secured 42 prisoners (including Field-Cornets
George Hall and Vander Venter), and a 7-pounder gun which had been
taken from the post at Houtkop.

OPERATIONS IN THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY, N.

Colonel Rimington&#8217;s column worked incessantly during September, and
to good purpose. On the 14th, marching from Leeufontein (six miles south
of Heilbron), they made a surprise visit to a laager, which resulted in the
capture of six Boers, waggons, carts, horses, and mules. Later, on the 22nd,
still hunting and hustling, he overtook Strydom&#8217;s commando, made a tremendous
haul of impedimenta, and secured thirteen prisoners. He then
finished the month by marching to Oploop (between the Klip and Wilge Rivers)
to watch for an opportunity to co-operate with Colonel Rawlinson, who, as we
know, was aiding the constabulary north of the Vaal, and who, by now, had
driven Buy&#8217;s commando to the south of the river. On this band Colonel
Rimington promptly pounced, and October found him enriched by 24
prisoners, 2000 cattle, 30 horses, 14 loaded waggons, 22 Cape carts, and
20 mules. Later, on the 7th, he moved from Standerton (whence he had drawn
supplies) to co-operate with General Broadwood and Colonel de Lisle from
Harrismith.

To reinforce Colonel Rimington went Colonel Wilson (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting
Scouts) from Kroonstad to Heilbron on the 1st of October, and scarcely
were they under way before they were attacked by the enemy. But the
scouts, true to the name they bear, gave such good account of themselves
that the enemy scattered, but considerably thinned in their numbers. The
troops afterwards covered the line of blockhouses from Heilbron to Frankfort.

MAJOR-GENERAL ELLIOT.&mdash;ORANGE RIVER COLONY, E.

On the 10th of September General Elliot started to again sweep and glean in
the Wittebergen district. Colonel Barker and Major Pine Coffin operated
from Winburg to west of the line of advance. General Campbell remained on[Pg 134]
the Wittebergen slopes, and General Dartnell, with the Imperial Light Horse
(from Bethlehem), assisted in blocking the Retief and Stabberts Nek passes.
The movement itself commenced in four columns, Lowe and De Lisle in the
centre, with Broadwood and Bethune to right and left respectively. In the
course of the march Colonel de Lisle brilliantly descried and ran down a
convoy then trekking towards Korannaberg, but not without infinite dash and
corresponding fatigue: 15 prisoners, 47 waggons, 22 carts, 250 horses, and 2500
cattle were the prizes of the adventure. Colonel Bethune, too, had his
innings, for on the 12th he routed seventy of the bandits from their lair near
Wonderkop, and the next night, after an exciting march to Rietolei, caught
and again engaged the foe.



Colonel Bethune and his Brigade Staff


The combined movement continued to yield good results. The mountain
kloops disgorged large quantities of supplies and vehicles, and from these
regions General Campbell ferreted out seventeen Boers. The hunters held
their lives in their hands, for the game of hide-and-seek had to be played with
desperate men sniping from every coign of vantage. In consequence of the
development of events connected with General Botha&#8217;s enterprise in Natal, some
of the troops of General Elliot pushed north from Harrismith. General Dartnell
with the 2nd Imperial Light Horse had preceded them, and he, together
with Colonel Bethune and 600 men, moved on to Eshowe in Zululand. From
Harrismith towards the frontier, near Vrede, Colonel de Lisle and General
Broadwood marched at the end of the month, and their presence soon warned
the Boers, who had been contemplating encroachments into Natal, to take
themselves off. On the 5th of October an effort was made to get in touch with
them, but they were far too knowing to be entrapped.

While these operations had been going forward, General Rundle had been[Pg 135]
doing his share, passing supplies into Bethlehem and generally blocking the
passes leading to Natal, and relieving garrisons on the line which had
hitherto been furnished by the Natal command. The 1st Imperial Light
Horse, under Colonel Briggs, acting independently from Bethlehem after
the departure of General Dartnell for Zululand, came in for some thrilling
experiences. This excellent force was well suited for exploits of a daring
kind and long-distance raids such as had to be undertaken. On the 28th
they made a circuitous night march of thirty-eight miles from Bethlehem,
and dawn found them surrounding the town of Reitz. It was a brilliantly
conceived and brilliantly carried out affair, and the prize of twenty-one
prisoners (including Landdrost Piet de Villiers), nine Cape carts, two
waggons, twenty-four horses, 250 cattle, and some ammunition, was well
deserved. The Boers, on Colonel Briggs&#8217; way back, made many night
attempts at reprisals, but the Imperial Light Horse was not to be caught
napping.

The troops in the Wepener, Dewetsdorp, Bethulie, and Zastron districts
were now sprayed out to catch the dispersed stragglers of Kruitzinger&#8217;s commando:
Colonel Thorneycroft at Quaggafontein, guarding the river south of
Zastron; Lord Basing patrolling from Jurysbaken to Commissie Bridge on the
Caledon; Sir Henry Rawlinson moving south from Elandsberg to Aliwal; and
General Plumer at Smithfield. Major Damant had returned to Springfontein.
General Plumer, from Smithfield, detached Sir John Jervis upon Wepener in
pursuit of guerillas, himself hunting with Colonel Colvin&#8217;s column along the
Basuto border. On the 15th the force reassembled at Wepener, where they
learned that Kruitzinger had doubled back towards Elandsberg. While
Colonel Colvin scurried thither to co-operate with Colonel Thorneycroft, the
General and Sir J. Jervis moved towards Smithfield. Sir John&#8217;s men, under
Captain Knight of the Buffs, had an exciting affray on the 19th, and succeeded
in landing big fish, Adjutants Brand and Joubert, and eight prisoners in all.
Colonel Smithson and the 13th Hussars engaged Boers at Lemonfontein on
the 11th. They covered eighty miles in two days, surprised the enemy, and
made a splendid haul of prisoners and effects. Colonel Colvin had also his
success, for on the 22nd a party of New Zealanders, under Major Tucker,
engaged the enemy on the Elandsberg and secured Field-Cornets Hugo and
Bothma, and several other prisoners.

Unfortunately the effect of the squeezing operations which were taking
place caused the enemy to be driven to the Thabanchu line, and here, as though
history was bound to repeat itself, the unfortunate U battery met with a
mishap. On the 19th a small force of 160 mounted men under Captain Tufnell,
and two guns of U Battery, R.H.A., under Lieut. Otter-Barry, which had been
detached by the officer commanding at the Bloemfontein Waterworks, were
surrounded and captured at Vlakfontein (eighteen miles south-west of Sanna&#8217;s
Post) by a superior force under Commandants Coetzee and Ackermann.
Lieutenant Barry, R.H.A., lost his life in the gallant defence of his guns. All
efforts were now made to hem the enemy against the Thabanchu line, and
General Plumer and Colonel Rochfort (commanding General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s
force during his absence in Natal) worked hard to this end. It was a question
of fight, fight, fight, and hustle, hustle, hustle on all sides. At the end of the
month (the 29th) Colonel Lowry Cole had the satisfaction of hauling in Commandant
Drezer and Field-Cornet Van Vunren, with their followers, whose
laager he had surprised.

At the same time some sharp fighting took place between two hundred[Pg 136]
New Zealanders[6] under Major A. W. Andrews, a smart officer of the Indian
Staff Corps, who were holding Mokari Drift on the Caledon, and some 300 or
400 Boers who were in the act of crossing. The Boers, after a severe mauling,
fled westward, leaving six dead and seven wounded on the field. Colonel
Thorneycroft also had had stiff work with a marauding gang near Corunna on
the 20th.

After this date the columns on the east of the main line of rail had each
assigned to them an area with a centre from which to work. They acted
independently, yet as required could combine against any formidable gathering
of the enemy. In the south-western portion of the Orange Colony the situation
was improving so remarkably that first the columns of Colonels Byng and
Dawkins were able to withdraw towards the Vredefort district; then those of
Major Damant were removed to Heilbron; while the rest, under Colonel
Rochfort, were transferred to the more disturbed area of the east of the railway.
Colonel Henry maintained his operations in the district, but the verb &#8220;to
blockhouse&#8221; having been so liberally conjugated throughout the region, his
duties were comparatively light.

EVENTS IN CAPE COLONY

The early part of September was spent in chasing Commandant Smuts, who
had burst from the Orange Colony into the Jamestown-Dordrecht district.
Here he was tackled on the 12th by Colonel Monro, but succeeded in evading
our columns. The raiders then rushed in the night across the line towards
Tarkastad. To the south in all haste followed Colonels Gorringe and Doran and
the 17th Lancers, while the west was guarded (at Cradock) by Colonel Scobell.
Smuts, when some eighteen miles north-west of Tarkastad, in desperation decided
to attack a squadron of the 17th Lancers under Major Sandeman. These seeing
a force dressed in kharki approaching, accepted them as comrades till too late.
The enemy was almost upon them before they discovered their mistake. But
the &#8220;Death or Glory Boys,&#8221; even in these circumstances, fought valiantly,
and though three officers and twenty men fell, and Major Sandeman and thirty
men of the squadron were wounded, all brilliantly maintained the traditions of
their regiment. The approach of Major Nickalls and another squadron of the
Lancers forced the Boers to cease fighting and continue their bolt to the south.

An interesting report of the smart engagement was published by the Midland
News. The correspondent wrote:&mdash;

&#8220;Smuts&#8217; commando rushed a squadron of the 17th Lancers, under Captain
Sandeman, on Tuesday morning, the 17th inst. The squadron was posted at
Modderfontein, guarding the southern exit from Elands River Poort, and
another pass towards the north-east, known as Evans Hoek, to prevent the
Boers from coming south-west into the Cradock district. The surprise was
due chiefly to the Boers being dressed in kharki, and being thus mistaken for
Colonel Gorringe&#8217;s men, who were expected to arrive from Soude Nek in the
course of the day. A mist which hung over the low ground till late that morn[Pg 137]ing
also favoured the approach of the enemy, as in the case of Colonel Scobell&#8217;s
capture of Lotter&#8217;s commando.

&#8220;On receipt of a report that a small picket in advance of the camp had
been rushed, a troop quickly mounted and rode towards the poort. The officer
in command saw some kharki-clad men about two miles from camp, and thinking
they were some of Colonel Gorringe&#8217;s column, rode forward to meet them.
When about two hundred yards distant, seeing them levelling their rifles, he
shouted out, &#8216;Don&#8217;t fire! we are the 17th Lancers.&#8217; The only answer was
rapid rifle fire, which emptied several saddles.

&#8220;During this time another body of the enemy had worked up the donga
running past the camp, and approached it from the rear. These men were
dressed in kharki, and were taken for friends. Major Nickalls was encamped
at Hoogstude, about three miles distant, and, having been informed of the
attack on Captain Sandeman&#8217;s camp, he was coming up to its support. Consequently
the order was given not to fire on this party.

&#8220;The camp was placed on the southern slope of a gentle rise, which is
encircled on the west by a spruit running generally north-west, and joining the
main river about two miles distant. About three hundred yards from the
spruit the ground on which the camp stood rises into a rocky kopje about a
hundred yards long at the crest. This was defended with great determination,
and most of the casualties occurred here.

&#8220;The Boers, too, suffered very severely in the attack on this position, and
it was not until the enemy attacked the hill from the rear that any impression
seemed to have been made on the defenders. A perfect hail of bullets appears
then to have been poured in from the rear, which killed or wounded all of its
defenders. Finally Captain Sandeman tried to reach the kraals in the vicinity
of the camp, but most of the men with him were shot down, and he himself
was wounded.

&#8220;The Boers then rushed the camp, but not a single man surrendered, the
enemy levelling their rifles and firing on any man they saw.

&#8220;On Major Nickalls&#8217;s squadron coming up the enemy retired quickly in the
direction in which they had come.

&#8220;The Boers, on entering the camp, went straight for the supplies, but were
able to take away only a few biscuits and hardly any ammunition, the Lancers
having emptied their bandoliers, as the hundreds of empty cartridges found on
the kopje eloquently testified.

&#8220;The enemy&#8217;s casualties were extremely heavy. The dead and wounded
were carried off by the commando when it retired.&#8221;

From Bank View to Mount Prospect, then across the Mancazana, along the
Fish River and over the Port Elizabeth line near Sheldon Station the raiders
went, followed with unrelaxing energy by Colonels Gorringe, Doran, and
Scobell. Colonel Gorringe succeeded in catching them in the Zuurberg
Mountains and caused them to split their force in two, one half fleeing south,
the other west. Early in October they reunited south of Darlington and
were again attacked and trounced by the indefatigable Colonel, who drove
them north with the loss of three of their number killed and five wounded.

Meanwhile Myburg and Fouché had been flitting around the northern
borders, while Colonels Monro, Pilcher, Western, General Hart, with Colonel
Murray&#8217;s troops and the Connaught Rangers, guarded the river line from
Bethulie to Herschel. The residency at this place was attacked on the 4th,
but Major Hook and the local police sent the foe to the right-about with considerable
celerity and the loss to them of twenty-nine horses and three men.[Pg 138]
Everywhere small gangs of Boers made themselves obstreperous, and some
made an attempt on Ladygrey, which was promptly repulsed. On the 20th
of September, however, Kruitzinger, north of Herschel, endeavoured to force a
passage over the Orange, and came into collision with some eighty of Lovat&#8217;s
Scouts under Lieutenant-Colonel Hon. A. D. Murray. The gallant Scotsmen,
small in number but large in courage, held on grimly to their post, and the
attempt to cross was fiercely resisted, but unhappily with the loss of the brilliant
commander, who had led them throughout the campaign with gallantry and
distinction. He fell shot through the heart while shouting, &#8220;Fix bayonets!&#8221;[7]
His adjutant, Captain Murray, also fell, and sixteen of his brave men, while one
officer and thirty-five men were wounded. A gun was carried off under cover
of darkness, but it was promptly followed up and recovered in a smart engagement
in which the Boers lost two killed and twenty prisoners. The end of the
month, the enemy having withdrawn into the Transkei, was spent by Colonels
Monro and Pilcher in watching the passes of the Drakensberg; but later they,
with Colonel Western&mdash;leaving Colonel Monro and local troops in charge of the
area&mdash;were recalled to the south-east of the Orange Colony. Commandant
Scheepers at this time was making himself obnoxious in the region of the line
near Matjesfontein, and to circumvent him General Beatson despatched Colonel
Crabbe&#8217;s column from Waggon Drift on a night march, which helped materially
to break down Scheepers strength. The force completely surprised the enemy
under Van der Merwe (in a place where they had outspanned some twelve miles
east of Laingsburg), killed the commandant&mdash;a sporting youth of eighteen, who
was considered by his friends as a De Wet in embryo&mdash;and one of his followers,
wounded many of the burghers, and took thirty-seven prisoners, including
Field-Cornet Du Plessis. This was on the 10th. From that time to the 20th
Scheepers was kept on the move, and finally after much veering and dodging
reached Klip Drift on the 20th. He continued to evade the pursuing columns
of Colonels Crabbe, Atherton, and Major Kavanagh till the 5th of October,
when this last officer almost captured him. He was attacked at Adams Kraal,
twenty miles south-south-west of Ladysmith, and only succeeded in saving
himself &#8220;by the skin of his teeth.&#8221;

Commandant Theron, hoping to join Scheepers, was fleeing before Colonel
Capper in the Ceres district. This officer was assisted by Colonels Alexander
and Wyndham, who, when they had driven the enemy well away to the north-west,
continued in the chase after Scheepers.

Colonel Sprot and Major Lund were persistently engaged in tussles with
Lategan&#8217;s gang, which had reappeared south of the Orange, and in a brilliant
encounter on the 23rd of September Major Lund succeeded in securing an
influential rebel, Louw by name, together with seven of his followers. Colonel
Hunter-Weston, in a smart engagement with Lategan, secured Coetzer and
other rebels and drove the rest northwards.

Sad was the fate of a gallant fellow, Lieutenant M. Gurdon Rebow, who,
with nine men of the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards, while searching a farm,[Pg 139]
was attacked by the enemy at Cyferkuil, near Riet Siding, on the 17th. Some
thirty or forty Dutchmen burst suddenly upon the small party, whose
gallant stand against this overwhelming majority was one of the most striking
episodes of desperate valour on record. A summons to surrender was refused,
and it was not till Gurdon Rebow himself had been shot down and one of his
men had been killed and two dangerously wounded that the remaining few
Grenadiers, after a fight of three hours, were captured. The sergeant of the
patrol lost his life in a gallant effort to swim the Carolus River in search of
help.

As a proof of the herculean labours of the columns during this month, in
spite of the prevalence of rinderpest among the cattle and the consequent
reduction in the efficiency of the ox transport, the sum total of achievement
may be quoted: 170 Boers killed, 114 wounded and prisoners, 1385
unwounded prisoners, 393 surrendered burghers, 11,000 horses (practically
useless), 41,500 cattle, 798 rifles, 119,000 rounds small arm ammunition, and
770 waggons.

At Pretoria the month closed with the execution of Broeksma, formerly
the Public Prosecutor of the Transvaal, whose trial, begun on the 12th of September,
lasted three days. He was charged on the four counts of breaking the
oath of neutrality, treachery, high treason, and inciting to break the oath of
neutrality, and the evidence showed that the police found in his house treasonable
pamphlets and documents, including copies of letters addressed to Mr. Steyn,
Mr. Reitz, &#8220;Dr. Williamson,&#8221; and Mr. Kruger. Other letters were produced in
court which purported to have come from Dr. Krause. On the concluding day
of the trial the Crown Prosecutor stated that &#8220;Dr. Williamson&#8221; was in reality
Dr. Leyds. Sundry other burghers and Netherlanders were tried for treachery
and on other charges, while some were found guilty of high treason and murder
and sentenced to death. This sentence in most cases was commuted to penal
servitude for life, or reduced to terms of imprisonment.

FOOTNOTES:

[6] This corps (the 6th New Zealand Mounted Rifles) greatly distinguished itself in many
ways. On one occasion (the 16th September) Lieutenant Tudor, with only twelve men,
crossed the Caledon and kept in touch with 200 Boers for three days, afterwards holding a
position for three hours against fifty Boers with exceptional gallantry. A young hero,
Lieutenant Caskey (5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen), lost his life during the dashing
exploit. Captains Findlay (The Buffs) and Knight with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles,
also performed notable service in command of detached troops during this period.

[7] Colonel the Hon. Andrew David Murray was the brother of the present Earl of
Mansfield, and was born in 1863. He entered the army in 1884 as second lieutenant in the
Queen&#8217;s Own Cameron Highlanders, became lieutenant in 1893, and brevet-major in 1898.
He served in the Nile Expedition, 1884-85, with the Soudan Field Force, 1885-86, with the
Nile Expedition, 1898, and was present at the battles of Atbara and Omdurman, for which
he was mentioned in despatches. He was appointed commander of Lovat&#8217;s Scouts last
year.

CHAPTER XIV

PROGRESS IN OCTOBER 1901

It may be remembered that on the 15th of October Colonel Colville pounced
on a convoy that was moving after the Boers in their flight towards
Swaziland. On that border he remained while General Plumer&#8217;s force
(released, as we know, from the south-east of the Orange Colony owing
to the state of quietude there) acted on the, by now, almost impassable
blockhouse line between Wakkerstroom and Colonel Colville&#8217;s column.
Meanwhile General Walter Kitchener&#8217;s troops, with those of Colonels Campbell,
Garratt, and Stewart, moved like a big broom sweeping up the stragglers south
of the line, till news came in that Botha, instead of taking the Swazi direction,
had veered north and was with a small column hanging around Amsterdam.
To catch the Boer general Colonels Rawlinson and Rimington pushed on from
Standerton on the 19th of October. They reached Amersfoort on the 21st, and
on the 25th, after a perilous night march over ground seamed with small posts
of protecting Boers, he succeeded in surrounding the farm near Schimmelhoek,
where the Boer chief was reported to be. Colonel Rimington&#8217;s men were
ordered to make for the farm, avoiding the main laager and posts, while those
of Colonel Rawlinson moved between Ermelo and the farm&mdash;but though the
movement was admirably carried out and Colonel Rimington&#8217;s troops rushed
the farm, the enemy had been forewarned and was on the alert. Botha had
but a moment to bolt in, but that moment he used. Though he and all but
four of his men got away in safety, his personal property and some papers,
very enlightening to the British, fell into their hands. The main laager having
retreated north towards Lake Chrissie, pursuit was abandoned, and Colonels
Rawlinson and Rimington returned at the end of the month to Volksrust and
Zandspruit respectively.

General G. Hamilton and Colonel Pulteney were meanwhile moving, in
continuous torrents of rain, around Utrecht and Vryheid in order to block all
Boer attempts to break through northern Natal into the Orange Colony; and
further south General Bruce-Hamilton, with the troops of General Spens and
Colonel Allenby, hunted the Vryheid and Ngomi region with incessant activity,
despite all the impediments of fog and bog and downpour. Scrimmage and
skirmish varied the monotony of the hard work, and in the end 21 killed, 11
wounded, and 160 unwounded Boers, together with carts, ammunition, cattle,
and foodstuffs, bore testimony to the pluck and endurance of the troops
engaged.



THE FIGHT AT BRAKENLAAGTE: BOERS CHARGING

Drawing by John Charlton


TRANSVAAL (EAST)

Colonel Benson was at this time continuing his system of midnight
annoyance, which was telling on the nerves of the enemy and causing Botha to
rack his brains to arrange a plan of getting quit of so ubiquitous and &#8220;slim&#8221;
an antagonist. Moving from Middelburg on the 20th&mdash;with 3rd and 25th
Mounted Infantry, three squadrons of Scottish Horse, 4 guns 84th Battery, two
pom-poms, and the Buffs&mdash;Benson began moving to the south. He surrounded[Pg 141]
a laager south of Brugspruit on the 22nd, captured 37 prisoners, and marched
next day to Bethel and on towards Rietkuil. During this march, on the
25th, the rearguard was heavily engaged by some 700 Boers under Groblaar,
Trichardt, and Erasmus, who hoped to stop the night man&oelig;uvres for a bit.
But the Dutchmen were quickly repulsed (with the loss of Civil Surgeon
Robertson and one man), and Colonel Benson moved on, impeded by many
thunderstorms, towards Brugspruit viâ Bakenlaagte. At this place there was considerable
sniping, while the enemy on all sides, in the mists and fogs and rains,
collected under Botha and Groblaar in order to effect a junction and at last bring
things to a crisis. Colonel Benson, who hoped to halt at Bakenlaagte, found the
place on the 30th already in possession of the enemy. Some fighting followed
and the Boers took themselves off, and the columns moved gradually into camp
covered by the rearguard, composed of 2 companies of Mounted Infantry, 2
squadrons 2nd Scottish Horse, 2 guns 84th Field Battery R.A., and one company
of the 2nd Battalion the Buffs, the whole under the command of Major Anley,
3rd Mounted Infantry. The guns, a company of the Buffs, and 50 Mounted
Infantry took up a position on an irregular ridge some 2500 yards from the camp,
screened by posts of Mounted Infantry and the Scottish Horse on either flank
and south of the ridge. The enemy meanwhile, in the wind and sleet and rain,
taking advantage of the fact that the storm was bursting in the face of the British
columns and of the vast expanse of rolling downs and the convenient hollows with
which they were familiar, were creeping and congregating ant-like round flanks
and rearguard. No sooner had the column and baggage got into camp and
arrangements been made for defence than they began to advance in formidable
array. Major Anley at noon, while about to carry out an order for the screen
of Mounted Infantry and Scottish Horse to fall back on the remainder of the
guard at Gun Hill, suddenly found himself in close contact with the foe. They
were continuing to advance in great numbers, galloping and shouting and firing.
He at once commenced to retire on Gun Hill, but, in the very act, the Boer force
appeared over the rise, and absolutely regardless of the British guns came on
and on and stormed through Scottish Horse and Mounted Infantry, many of whom
were killed before they had time to fire. The Boers then dismounted and formed
up on dead ground whence they could work their way to a position within close
range of the guns on the crest, while themselves in comparative safety. The
original escort, the company of Buffs posted to the front of the guns on the
south side of the ridge, was captured and the Mounted Infantry Company
of the Yorkshire Light Infantry and the squadron of Scottish Horse who
promptly formed up on the flanks of the guns, despite their gallant efforts, found
themselves unable to offer serious resistance to the terrific volleys of the foe.

With the exception of the western end of the ridge, which was held by
a party of mounted infantry till dark, the whole gradually fell into the enemy&#8217;s
hands. When Colonel Benson became aware of the nature of the attack
he ordered two more companies of the Buffs to reinforce the rearguard on the
ridge, but these could not succeed in reaching a position whence their fire
could be brought to bear. He himself was one of the first to fall, hit in three
places.[8] Referring to the death of this hero and the doings of his warlike band[Pg 142]
at the critical moment when the Boers made their fierce onslaught on the
defenders of the ridge, Mr. Bleloch of the Morning Post wrote:&mdash;

&#8220;A squadron of Scottish Horse had just gained the edge of the ridge to defend the guns
when the Boers charged. Colonel Benson and his staff were stationed near the guns.
When the Boers got to the ridge they shot down, almost in the first few minutes, the greater
number of the defenders, and it was the stubborn defence of the survivors which checked
their further advance and prevented them at the time from rushing the ridge first, and
possibly the camp afterwards. The defence of the ridge saved the column from imminent
disaster, and inflicted on the Boers a heavy penalty for their daring attack. Unfortunately
it was only done at the cost of many valuable lives.

&#8220;Shortly after Major Murray was killed several Boers approached, shouting &#8216;Hands up!&#8217;
Corporal Bell, the son of Sir James Bell, shouted back &#8216;No surrender!&#8217; and kept on firing.
He killed one Boer, and immediately afterwards another Boer shot him from a distance of
twenty paces. Other Boers then fired at him, and he was killed. A man named Bradshaw
Smith, who was found lying dead near Corporal Bell, carried on his duty in the same spirit.
He had a pile of empty cartridge cases by him, and wounded survivors state that he killed
or wounded thirty Boers with his own rifle before he received a fatal shot. Lieutenant
Kelly, who had received his commission only three weeks before the fight, fell near the same
spot. He came from Australia, and was advanced rapidly to the rank of sergeant and then
to that of lieutenant. He was one of the best fighting men in the regiment. He cheered
and rallied his men in the most fearless manner, being wounded many times before he fell
for good. When picked up he was found to be literally shot through and through.

&#8220;These are conspicuous examples among a band of heroes. To the men of the Scottish
Horse, the Yorkshire Mounted Infantry, and the artillerists is due the credit of maintaining
the defence when it appeared to be almost hopeless. Knowing full well that only a few
were left they held on, firing or selling their lives dearly, and keeping it up until almost the
last man fell. The latest accounts show that out of 92 men of the Scottish Horse on the
ridge, 88 were killed or wounded. Scotland may well be proud when at the end of a wearisome
war she can send out men who die willingly and fearlessly in the performance of their
duty.&#8221;

Colonel Guinness[9] also fell by the guns, having fired the last shot of case on
the advancing enemy before he was killed. Captain C. W. Collins (Cheshire Regiment),
who died of his wounds, Lieutenant Jackson (King&#8217;s Own Royal Lancashire
Regiment), Lieutenant Sloan (R.A.M.C.), Lieutenant Robertson (Scottish
Horse), played glorious parts in this melancholy scene, and Lieutenants
Bircham and Crichton (King&#8217;s Royal Rifle Corps) distinguished themselves
by remaining gallantly in command of their respective units though severely
wounded early in the fight. The attack on the camp itself was easily driven
off, but no further reinforcements could be sent to the ridge, nor were guns in
camp able to materially assist the defence with the rearguard. All hands
in camp worked hard to entrench the position which, before night, was rendered
so strong that no subsequent attack was made. Colonel Wools-Sampson took
command of Colonel Benson&#8217;s column, and on the 31st the columns of Colonel
Barter and General G. Hamilton went hot foot to his support. The bulk of
the enemy with the captured guns had, however, disappeared beyond the reach
of the British force. Of the losses on both sides Mr. Bleloch wrote:&mdash;

&#8220;Of Colonel Benson himself every voice proclaims him a hero. Though grievously
wounded, he sent back to Major Wools-Sampson, telling him not to send out the ambulances
because the Boers would take the opportunity of removing the guns, but to
continue bursting shrapnel just on and over the ridge to prevent any further advance of the[Pg 143]
enemy. Major Wools-Sampson acted on these orders, and it was in imminent danger from
our own gun and Maxim firers, as well as from the enemy, that some of the survivors of the
Scottish Horse and Yorkshires moved about helping their wounded and dying comrades.
Dr. Sloane, of the Scottish Horse, is praised by every one. The fire from the camp and
from the other positions commanded by Major Wools-Sampson checked any further advance
of the enemy. The Boers had paid dearly for their bravery, and their enthusiasm died
down, though they continued a heavy fire all round the position. Major Wools-Sampson
had taken every measure for the safety of the camp. He reinforced the southern positions
held by the 25th Mounted Infantry, under Major Eustace, and called up all the Transport
Commissariat officers and men to aid in defending the camp proper. When Colonel
Benson was brought in about nine o&#8217;clock at night he told Major Wools-Sampson to see to
his defences, because Botha had stated that unless he surrendered he would attack in
the morning with 1400 men. The men were put to work entrenching, and by daylight
the position was impregnable. The heroism on the ridge and the clever dispositions of the
determined soldier commanding the camp had baulked the Boers, and Botha admitted that
the fight was a failure. Between 200 to 300 Boers are known to have been killed and
wounded. Man for man the losses were about equal on each side, but we have suffered the
greater loss in the death of the gallant leader of the column and his equally brave associates.
Men like Benson, Guinness, Murray, Lindsay, and Thorold, and the other officers who fell
are difficult to replace. Lieutenant Straker, of the Scottish Horse, who was thrown from
his horse and stunned, while retiring to the ridge, was taken prisoner, and remained with the
Boers next day. Being conversant with the taal, he learned many things from the Boers
which confirm their disappointment at the result of the fight.&#8221;

Among the forty-four Boers killed was General Opperman. General Chris
Botha and 100 of his men were wounded.

The British casualties in addition to Colonel Benson were:&mdash;

Killed.

Royal Artillery&mdash;Lieut.-Col. E. Guinness, Lieut. Maclean. Scottish Horse&mdash;Major
F. D. Murray, Capt. M. W. Lindsay, Capt. Inglis, Lieut. Kelly, Lieut.
Woodman. Yorkshire Light Infantry (3rd Mounted Infantry)&mdash;Capt. F. T.
Thorold, Lieut. E. V. J. Brooke, Lieut. R. E. Shepherd. East Kent Regiment&mdash;2nd
Lieut. A. J. Corlett.

Wounded.

Coldstream Guards&mdash;Capt. Eyre Lloyd (since dead) Cheshire Regiment&mdash;Capt.
C. W. Collins, severe. Northamptonshire Regiment&mdash;Capt. A. A. Lloyd,
D.S.O., slight. King&#8217;s Royal Rifle Corps&mdash;Lieut. H. F. W. Birchan, severe;
Lieut. T. G. Dalby, severe; Lieut. R. Seymour, severe. Scottish Horse&mdash;Capt.
Murray; Lieut. W. Campbell, severe; Lieut. C. Woodman, dangerously;
Lieut. Firns, dangerously; Lieut. A. T. Wardrap, severe. East Kent Regiment&mdash;Capt.

Lieut. W. Greatwood, slight. Yorkshire Light Infantry&mdash;Lieut. L. H. Martin,
severe. Killed&mdash;Fifty-four non-commissioned officers and men. Wounded&mdash;One
hundred and sixty non-commissioned officers and men (four since dead.)

Colonel Park at this time worked in the Heidelberg district, Colonels
Hacket-Thompson and Bewicke Copley in support of the Constabulary Posts,
and Colonel Rawlinson in Heidelberg. Colonel Hacket-Thompson on the 14th
of October routed a Boer gang that threatened the Pietersburg line, and on the
way north Major Ross (Canadian Scouts) surprised and broke up Field-Cornet
Jan Visagie&#8217;s commando at Kranspoort. So much opposition did the Boers
offer in the rugged country near Tweefontein, that Colonel Williams with 600
Australians was sent from Klerksdorp to reinforce Colonel Hacket-Thompson.
On the 26th, while moving by Kameelpoort to Wolvekraal, a Boer picket was
driven in, and fifty prisoners with their effects were taken. On the 27th the[Pg 144]
difficult Witnek defile&mdash;a pass six miles long&mdash;was forced by Col. Williams,
in spite of the Boers, who held it in great strength and brought a pom-pom
to bear on the troops. The splendid advance of the Australians eventually
forced the enemy to give up his hold and take to his heels, leaving five dead
on the ground and four prisoners in our hands.

Colonel Colenbrander&#8217;s men (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts) between the
6th and 21st scoured the hitherto untraversed region between Warmbaths and
Magalapyi on the Rhodesian Railway. They visited Boer haunts which had
been carefully located beforehand and pounced on various Boer supply depots,
with the result that on return, on the 2nd of November, they showed a bag of
45 prisoners, 10 voluntary surrenders, 67 rifles, 4000 rounds of ammunition,
and a large number of waggons and cattle.

Colonel Hawkins (commanding Colonel Wood&#8217;s column) displayed rival
activity in the region west of the rail between Nylstroom and Geelhout, and his
captures amounted to 97 prisoners, among whom were Field-Cornets J. J. Van
Staden, J. P. Botha, J. Duverhage, Captain G. Coetzee, Adjutant Muller, and
C. Schutte (former Landdrost of Pretoria), besides rifles, ammunition, waggons,
cattle, and horses.

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Colonel Kekewich from Rustenburg and Lord Methuen from Zeerust
engaged in a converging movement for sweeping up Boers in the direction of
Lindley&#8217;s Poort, but Boers being shy, these officers returned to their original
posts. While Lord Methuen was marching from Zeerust towards Lindley&#8217;s
Poort, Colonel Von Donop from Zeerust moved in the direction of Tafel Kop.
On his way back, on the 24th, at Kleenfontein (between Wonderfontein and
Wilgeboom Spruit), he was confronted by over 1000 Boers under Generals
Delarey, Kemp, and Celliers. These had taken advantage of the thick scrub
through which the British were moving to gallop to close quarters and set upon
the little force.

Fighting was ferocious, particularly round the two guns (4th Battery
R.F.A.), and the heroism shown by one and all, particularly by the gunners,
it is scarcely possible to exaggerate. One officer, 17 men of the gun detachments,
26 escort of the Northumberland Fusiliers (some 60 strong), were either
killed or wounded in this desperate and successful defence. All distinguished
themselves in one way or another; notably young Lieutenant Hill (R.F.A.),
who sacrificed his life, two gunners, Neil and Murphy, and drivers Divers and
Platt. Lieutenant Hobbs (R.E.), a prodigy of valour; Captain Laing (R.A.M.C.),
5th Imperial Yeomanry, who tended the wounded regardless of the heavy fire;
Lieutenant Baldwin, who fought like a lion; and Lieutenant Caird, who was
killed, were a few of many who behaved nobly. The men were heroic as their
officers. Sapper Ryder, for instance, hearing the guns were in difficulties,
galloped alone to them and joined in their defence, subsequently fetching
reinforcements under heavy fire. Sergeant Roland (Bechuanaland Rifles), too,
in the same deadly hail, collected men and carried messages with the daredevil
courage for which he is notable. Sergeant Browning (4th Battery
R.F.A.) kept his gun in action till the Boers were upon him, when he endeavoured
to remove the breech screws and got wounded in the act. Sergeant
Miller (1st Northumberland Fusiliers), whose splendid services have been noted
on many occasions, collected men and set them to hold an important position,
and Sergeant Baily of the same regiment distinguished himself by his determination
and bravery.[Pg 145]

The Boers, repulsed on all sides, eventually drew off, leaving 40 dead and
5 wounded, including Commandant Oosthuyzen (since dead), on the field.

Colonel Kekewich had also some noteworthy adventures. On the 28th he
marched to attack a laager at Beestekraal on the Crocodile River. Having
concealed his troops in the hollows around Hartebeestspruit, he, on the
following day, resumed his march. At night his mounted troops, under Colonel
Duff, moved towards Beestekraal, while his infantry moved to Klipplatt. The
western approaches to the Boers&#8217; camp being unguarded, they fell victims to the
surprise prepared for them. Resistance they soon found to be futile, and
Colonel Kekewich marched back to Rustenburg plus 78 prisoners (including B.
A. Klopper, former chairman of the Volksraad) and many waggons and horses.

OCTOBER IN THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY

Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. J. Byng from Kroonstad spent the best part of
October pouncing on commandos. On the 13th he attacked a laager at Jackfontein
and captured 18 prisoners, and later in the month (the 25th) he
surrounded Spanneberg&#8217;s laager at Huntersolei, securing, with Field-Cornets
Spanneberg and Oosthuyzen, 20 burghers; 11 extra prisoners were captured
near Plessis Rush. On the 2nd of November he moved to Heilbron to take up
his position for combined operations in the direction of Reitz. At Heilbron
was Colonel Wilson (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts), who with Major Damant at
Frankfort continued to cover the completion of the blockhouse line in that
region. Major Damant on the 13th caught and engaged 300 Boers near
Naudesdrift on the Wilge, and two days later handled somewhat vigorously
a gang of 500 whom he drove to the Bothersberg, capturing Adjutant Theron
in the course of the operation. More prisoners were secured before the end of
the month.

General Elliot&#8217;s columns, under Broadwood, with the energetic Lowe and De
Lisle, continued to operate north of Harrismith, but they were much hampered
both by rinderpest and by incessant rains. Nevertheless Colonel De Lisle,
working independently, surprised a Boer laager on the 15th, in the neighbourhood
of the Wilge River, and made a fine haul of vehicles and cattle, in
addition to the fifteen prisoners taken. General Broadwood, with 700 of his
own men and some detachments of General Rundle&#8217;s force, made an expedition
to the eastern extremity of the Brandwater Basin, which resulted in the capture
of a few prisoners and much ammunition. General Campbell remained in the
region constructing forts, in order to baulk the enemy at important points.
From Bethlehem Colonel Briggs (1st Imperial Light Horse), with his dashing
men, carried on a series of exciting raids, thus clearing the country for twenty-eight
miles round.

Major-General C. Knox and Colonel Rochfort, under the general control of
Lieutenant-General Tucker, engaged in operations for the completion of the
clearance of the south-eastern portion of the Orange Colony, where Commandants
Brand, Ackerman, and Coetzee still struggled to make themselves
baneful. They gave considerable trouble, as their intimate acquaintance
with the country made their deft dodges for prolonging the game of hide-and-seek
highly successful. Still, in spite of their evasive tactics, 125 were taken
and seven killed or wounded.[Pg 146]

OPERATIONS IN CAPE COLONY

General French, whose headquarters were at Middelburg, by his vigorous
measures to check the invasion, had so far swept the central districts of the
Colony that a large number of troops were freed to hunt the south-western and
north-eastern areas. On the 11th Lotter was executed, and curiously enough
on the same date the arrant raider and desperate rebel Scheepers was captured
by a patrol of the 10th Hussars under Captain Shearman, at Koppie&#8217;s Kraal,
where he had been left too ill to proceed. On his recovery he was tried on
various charges, and sentenced to death. As his case aroused considerable
interest, a short report of the trial is appended.

The Court sat at Graaff Reinet on December 18, 1901, and there were
sixteen charges brought against the prisoner&mdash;seven of murder, one of attempted
murder, one of placing prisoners in firing line, one of ill-treating prisoners,
three of flogging (one being a British subject and two natives), one of destroying
railways, one of train-wrecking, and one including fifteen charges of arson.

The one charge on which the finding of &#8220;Not guilty&#8221; was returned was
the fifth, which related to the case of two scouts named John Jackspan and
Johannes Rooji, who were shot in September at Wildepaardefontein, Montagu
district. These men were shot, but the evidence went to show that it was by
the order of Commandant Van der Merwe, Scheepers being on the farm at the
time lying ill in a cart.

The first charge of murder on which a verdict of guilty was returned was
that of shooting two natives named Jacob Fillis and Kiedo, captured when
scouting in September at Secretaris Kraal; the second was a charge of shooting
a Kaffir policeman named Moycwka at Brakwater in January 1901; the
third was that of shooting a native, name unknown, at Uitkomot, in March;
the fourth was that of shooting a native scout named James at Brighton in
August; the sixth was the shooting of a native named John Kennedy in the
Worcester district in September; and the seventh the shooting of Zederas, a
native, at Kruis River, the victim being first sjamboked. This was also in
September. The other charges were fully proved. In all fifty-two witnesses
were called for the prosecution.

Apart from two witnesses whom he called, Commandant Scheepers gave
evidence himself. He said his name was Gideon Jacobus Scheepers, that he
was a Free State Burgher, and head of the Heliographic Department at
Bloemfontein.

&#8220;I surrendered on the 10th October 1901, and at that time I occupied the position of
commandant in the combined forces of the late South African Republic and Orange Free
State. I was promoted to the rank of commandant in the month of March last, but through
some cause which I do not know of the formal appointment only reached me in August last.
Previous to this I held the rank of captain. On 15th November 1900, I and the troops to
which I belong came into the Cape Colony under General De Wet&#8217;s command, but General
De Wet did not himself come into this colony at that time. While we were with Commandant
Kruitzinger he was in chief command, but as soon as the forces divided I was in
chief command of my division. Before I came into the Cape Colony, on above date, there
was a council of war held in the Free State, composed of all the chief officers in command.
At this council of war propositions were made and carried that a letter should be written to
Lord Kitchener drawing his attention to the destruction by fire and otherwise of property in
the Free State and Transvaal, saying that if this destruction did not cease the officers in
command of troops invading the Cape Colony would after a while receive instructions to
proceed with destruction in the colony of all properties belonging to persons not friendly to
the Republics. Prior to this letter, one to the same intent and conveying the same information
had been written to Lord Roberts. In March last proclamations issued by General De
Wet and signed by ex-President Steyn reached me, and the contents thereof was an in[Pg 147]struction
to the officers in the Cape Colony to treat all persons not on friendly terms with
the Republics to the same destruction of property as had been done by the British in the
Free State and Transvaal. I saw a copy of this proclamation in one of the Graaff Reinet
newspapers. My instructions and proclamations I have handed over to my successor.&#8221;

The prisoner then dealt with the various charges in detail, declaring in
respect of some that he had given no orders, as to others that the men were
shot after sentence by courts-martial, and that they were spies. As to the
destruction of railways, the train-wrecking, and the burning of farms, he
pleaded that he was only carrying out the instructions of his superior officers.
He vehemently denied having ill-treated his prisoners.

In the course of the trial the following telegram was received by the president:

&#8220;December 21st, 1901.

&#8220;Can fact that Scheepers spared my son&#8217;s life&mdash;Grant, 12th Lancers&mdash;in time of great
excitement, September twenty-third, be pleaded in mitigation of sentence if sentenced?
Please forward this to confirming office.

Grant, Monymusk.&#8221;

In reference to this telegram, Scheepers said:&mdash;

&#8220;Lieutenant Grant, 12th Lancers, as far as I have seen, has done the bravest deed ever
done by a British officer. It was south-east of Oudtshoorn, along the Commanassie River,
after having wounded two and captured eight of my men, as he was crossing the river I
came upon him with four men. I shouted to him, &#8216;Hands up!&#8217; He was in the water on[Pg 148]
the point of crossing the river, and as I shouted to him &#8216;Hands up!&#8217; he paid no attention.
When I shouted to him a second time, &#8216;Surrender, or I&#8217;ll shoot you down,&#8217; the four men
with me pointed their guns at him, when he dropped his gun and revolver and surrendered.
The men with me wanted to shoot him down, as he had wounded two of my men; I ordered
them not to do so. I ultimately captured him and took him to a house and gave him a bed,
and liberated him.&#8221; He also claimed that the one thousand three hundred prisoners he had
taken had been treated well.

Scheepers was found guilty, after five days&#8217; trial, on all charges except the
one of murder mentioned, and sentenced to death. The sentence was confirmed
by Lord Kitchener about a fortnight later, on January 14, 1902, and
the prisoner was shot at Graaff Reinet on January 18, 1902.

Colonels Crabbe and Kavanagh hunted from Oudtshoorn to the north-west
Smuts&#8217;, Bonwer&#8217;s, and Pyper&#8217;s rovers. Colonels Haig and Lukin engaged in an
animated chase, here, there, and everywhere, after Van der Venter and his
band of marauders, and at last the vigilant Lukin, on the 21st of October, had
the happiness of surprising the quarry six miles south-west of New Bethesda.
Fourteen prisoners were taken, and one Boer lost his life in the affray. The
rest of the party, as they escaped westward on the 24th, were engaged by
Colonel Scobell, who had been chasing Smuts out of the Aberdeen district.

The month ended with combined operations for purging the place of the
commandos of Maritz, Smit, and Theron, and driving these undesirable elements
into the remote districts beyond Calvinia. In these lively proceedings
Colonels Capper and Wyndham and Captain Wormald were engaged, and by
the end of October they had reached the line Lambert&#8217;s Bay, Clanwilliam.

Colonel Monro&#8217;s column, after covering the construction of a line of blockhouses
from Stormberg to Queenstown, commenced, in conjunction with a force
under Colonel Scobell, to hunt the enemy north of Dordrecht. Meanwhile another
line of blockhouses from De Aar to Beaufort West was concluded, thus adding
materially to the security of the main line. The Proclamation of Martial Law
at Cape ports was now deemed necessary, and regulations were made by the
Colonial Government and the Commander-in-Chief with a view to minimising
interference with legitimate trade, preventing inconvenience to law-abiding
persons; adequate powers were secured for the military authorities to enable
them to deal with the plots and intrigues of Boer spies, sympathisers at seaport
towns, and to close to them this source of supply of munitions of war. The
previous non-existence of Martial Law had enabled the enemy and his agents to
carry on in security the introduction of foreign recruits and communications
with Europe.

CHAPTER XV

THE CLOSE OF 1901&mdash;PROGRESS IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER

The establishment of constabulary posts from the Valley of the Modder
towards Bultfontein and Boshof was being carried out simultaneously
with the completion of a blockhouse line from Kroonstad to Coal
Mine Drift on the Vaal. A blockhouse line from Kroonstad by Lindley,
Bethlehem to Harrismith, and another by Heilbron and Frankfort
towards Tafel Kop (a favourite Boer haunt and signalling station)
and beyond it by Botha&#8217;s Pass, promised to curtail the enemy&#8217;s scheme of
operations and push him into remote corners whence he would be unable to
interfere either with the proposed extension of the rail from Harrismith to
Bethlehem, or with another line working from Bloemfontein to the Waterworks
and thence to Ladybrand.

TRANSVAAL (EAST)

General Bruce-Hamilton at the end of October assumed the direction of
operations in the Eastern Transvaal, and the columns under his command were
those of Colonels Allenby and Campbell at Standerton, of Colonel Barter at
Leeukop (forty-six miles west of Bethel), of Colonel Mackenzie (late Benson&#8217;s)
at Brugspruit. Colonels Williams and the Hon. C. G. Fortescue were moving
west of Middelburg. Under the auspices of these troops and of those of
General Spens, the Standerton-Ermelo line of blockhouses was constructed,
and the constabulary posts to the line Brugspruit Station, Waterful Station,
were established. At the conclusion of these useful operations General Bruce-Hamilton,
having forced the enemy in a corner as it were and prepared for the
further advance of his columns to the east, made Bethel his headquarters.

A concentration was afterwards arranged for the purpose of hemming
the guerillas against the Eastern Transvaal Frontier, and consequently some
of these struggled to break through the sweeping columns and the constabulary
posts, while others, in knots, returned and pervaded the Delagoa
Railway. They had of course to be dealt with, and Colonel Wools-Sampson,
whose services had been invaluable to the lamented Colonel Benson, again
applied himself to the locating of the offensive intruders. His information was
brief and to the point. General B. Hamilton, with portions of General Spens&#8217;
and Colonel Sir H. Rawlinson&#8217;s columns, surprised the marauders at dawn on
the 4th of December at Oshoek, twenty miles south-west of Ermelo. Owing to
the dash and enterprise with which the 8th Battalion Mounted Infantry closed
with the enemy and prevented their escape, the captures amounted to 93
prisoners, 116 horses, 26 waggons, 29 Cape carts, besides ammunition and
telegraph and signalling apparatus.

While this exciting affair was going forward between Ermelo and Carolina,
Colonel Williams was chasing some Boer banditti under Viljoen, Prinsloo, and
Erasmus, who were fleeing westwards in the direction of Knapdaar. The
pursuit was carried to Welte-Vreden, where the enemy (in a strong position[Pg 150]
and numbering some 500) commanded the passages over the Olifants River.
Colonel Williams&#8217; small force was unequal to a decisive engagement, therefore
he drew off, having killed 5 and taken 12 Boers, 8 waggons, and 3500 rounds of
ammunition in the course of his westerly pursuit. On the 7th, Colonel Rawlinson
made a grand night march from Ermelo (General B. Hamilton&#8217;s headquarters),
and took 8 prisoners, while at the same time Colonel C. Mackenzie,
moving from Carolina to Waterval, vigorously chased the enemy towards the
Komati Valley, capturing 16, together with their horses, mules, and cattle.

While Botha&#8217;s bands were kept in hourly dread of being driven east against
the Swazi border, or west between the troops and constabulary posts, where
they would have been more than ever isolated and doomed to destruction,
Colonel Urmston, with a small column, played the Cerberus, watching the line
of constabulary posts in case of attack by such desperate Boers as might have
become wedged between the posts and the columns, and keeping General B.
Hamilton well informed as to their whereabouts.

Viljoen, hovering between Pilgrims&#8217; Rest and Dullstroom, engaged the
attentions of Colonel Park, while on the northern line Colonels Dawkins and
Colenbrander hunted and hustled the enemy. By the 13th of November
Dawkins had secured 124 prisoners, and by the 19th (when he had returned
to Warmbaths by the Mafeking-Rhodesia route) Colenbrander had captured
54 prisoners of Beyer&#8217;s commando, including Field-Cornets Ross and Louw
and Adjutant Pretorius, with their horses, waggons, and stock.

Colonel Colenbrander then devoted himself to the chase of Badenhorst&#8217;s
commando, a spirited and an exhausting affair which lasted some days, during
which Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts pushed perseveringly, through an almost
waterless and decidedly uninviting region, on the tracks of the enemy. Eventually
the column, almost spent with their prodigious activities, came suddenly
on the quarry, and the 3rd of December found them in possession of all the
waggons of the commando, and fifteen prisoners. Badenhorst and sixty followers
tore into the jungle fringing the Poer Zyn Loop River, and thus escaped;
but not for long. A large quantity of stragglers were driven up into the hills,
and there seized by the 12th Mounted Infantry of Colonel Dawkins&#8217; column,
who displayed considerable prowess in the achievement. The total results of
these &#8220;well-planned and carefully-executed operations were 104 prisoners, 50
horses, 50 mules, 500 cattle, 6 waggons, 6000 rounds of small arm ammunition,
and the serious discomfiture of the enemy in a district in which he had long
considered himself immune.&#8221;

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Lord Methuen and Colonel Kekewich continued with unabating zeal their
co-operations in the Rustenberg-Zeerust region, capturing many prisoners
during their various marches. On the 13th of November, owing to a squadron
of Imperial Yeomanry of Colonel Hickie&#8217;s force having been surrounded near
Brakspruit, both officers moved by different routes to Klerksdorp to disperse
the commandos threatening Colonel Hickie. But these rovers had quickly made
off to the west. Still hunting them, Lord Methuen, with Hickie and Kekewich
on his right, left Klerksdorp to operate to west of Hartebeestefontein and Kaffirs
Kraal. He got in touch with the foe, chased him towards Wolmaranstad, and
&#8220;doubled him up&#8221; at Rooiport. Liebenberg&#8217;s adjutant, his horses, stock,
waggons, and twenty-six prisoners were the rewards of a fatiguing excursion.
Lord Methuen returned to Klerksdorp on the 4th of December. Thus Colonel
Hickie, whose column was covering the construction of the Schoonspruit[Pg 151]
blockhouse line, was relieved of the unwelcome attentions of the Boers, and the
work on hand terminated without further interruption.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY

A magnificent programme for the sweeping up of infesting marauders in the
region of Vrede and Reitz was planned out early in November. The difficulty
and the extent of its plan may be gauged by the fact that the rendezvous and
starting-points of the outermost columns engaged upon it were roughly at the
angles of a parallelogram, whose diagonal was 175 miles in length, and of which
no side was less than 100 miles, marked by the points Standerton, Harrismith,
Winburg, and Heilbron; but of the details of this enormous movement, the
energy and precision with which it was carried forth, nothing can here be said.
It was arranged like an enormous and intricate game of chess, with tortuous and
well-designed curves to keep the enemy from detecting the object of the man&oelig;uvres,
but the whole thing was a failure. The weather, firstly, was atrocious,
and highly favourable to such Boers who might wish to straggle and draggle to
cover; secondly, the immensity of the converging movement rendered it impossible
to entirely fill all gaps, and these gaps the Boers were naturally &#8220;slim&#8221;
enough to discover and to make use of. Thus, when all the splendidly[Pg 152]
managed and patiently executed marches concluded by the arrival of the
columns at their objective, they found most of the birds flown. But the Boer
stock and transport had to be left behind, and there was some consolation in
knowing that the machinations of the marauders would be hampered for want
of supplies for some time to come. Ninety-eight prisoners were taken and
twenty-two of the enemy were killed, and horses and cattle in large quantities
were secured. The troops returned to their original points of departure without
incident, save in the case of Colonels Byng and Wilson. On the 14th of November
a party of 400 Boers, who had evaded the cordon before it was drawn,
attacked the troops near Heilbron. Two hours of stiff fighting ensued, and
the enemy, said to be commanded by De Wet, was successfully repulsed on
all sides by Colonel Byng&#8217;s rearguard, which was brilliantly handled by
Colonel Wilson of Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts. The Boers left eight dead
on the field. Lieutenant Hughes was killed and three other officers of
Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts were wounded.

Colonel Rimington and Major Damant continued to pursue their special
guerilla tactics from Frankfort to the Valley of the Vaal with a diamond-cut-diamond
agility which was highly disconcerting to the Boers. Many captures
they made, the most satisfactory of all being that of Commandant Buys, who,
wounded in a skirmish with the &#8220;Railway Pioneers,&#8221; fell afterwards into the
hands of Colonel Rimington, who had gone to their assistance. The skirmish
took place near Villiersdorp. Major Fisher&#8217;s small patrol was attacked north
and south by some 350 of the enemy. The British were overpowered; Major
Fisher was killed, and Captain Langmore was dangerously wounded.

General Dartnell and the Imperial Light Horse Brigade&mdash;real veterans by
now&mdash;were perpetually on the move in the Bethlehem and Harrismith region,
but the Boers were wary, and, at the rumour of their coming, seemed to
evaporate! The 2nd Imperial Light Horse, however, caught them napping on
the 24th of November between Elands River Bridge and Bethlehem. In the
attack they killed two of the enemy and captured twelve more. The bag was
furthered replenished on the 27th by the addition of 24 prisoners, 150 horses,
and 800 cattle, which were the prizes of a dashing raid of the combined force
of the 1st and 2nd Imperial Light Horse under Colonel Mackenzie.

The end of November was spent in sweeping and hunting, surprising and
night-raiding by General Elliot, who with three columns (Broadwood, De Lisle,
and Lowe) moved gradually upward from Harrismith to Kroonstad. Here he
arrived on the 1st of December with 15 prisoners, 89 carts, 2470 cattle, and 1280
horses (most of them worn-out). Colonel Barker from Bethlehem engaged
the enemy frequently, thus protecting Broadwood&#8217;s left flank and inflicting
considerable damage. Colonel Rimington having effected a junction
with Colonel Wilson (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts), south-west of Frankfort,
on the 28th had some exciting experiences with the enemy, who pursued
certain buzzing tactics for the purpose of drawing off attention to a proposed
lunge by De Wet on the baggage and rearguard. The attack when delivered
was brilliantly repulsed. The troops made a dashing charge on the enemy,
during which Lieutenant Oliver (Inniskilling Dragoons) lost his life. Field-Cornet
Klopper and 2 burghers were killed and 4 wounded, and 13 prisoners
captured. Colonel Rimington then returned to Heilbron.

Various groups of columns under General Knox and Colonel Rochfort
harassed and hunted the remnants of the commandos of Brand, Ackerman,
and Loetzee, which still hung and clung to their ancient haunts. The
work was fatiguing and monotonous in the extreme, but the clearance of that[Pg 153]
part of the country was accomplished. One hundred and seventy prisoners
were swept up in the course of the month.

West of the rail the establishment of constabulary posts between Boshof
and Bultfontein went on apace, while Colonel Henry watched the country and
kept the Boers at a distance.

THE SWAZI BORDER

The troops clearing the east in the Piet Retief region and on the Swazi
border were hard at work to press back the desperate and almost refugeless
Boers. Major Wiggin, with a detached force of the 26th Mounted Infantry
Battalion (Colville&#8217;s column), surrounded a laager at a farm eight miles south
of Mahamba (near Piet Retief), and captured Landdrost Kelly and Field-Cornet
Van Rooijen, with fourteen of their party; and then this same officer,
with another detached force, proceeded on the 16th to repeat his success. At
Plat Nek (within the Swazi border) he pounced again on the foe, caught twelve
of them, and secured nineteen waggons with teams and a number of Krupp
cartridges.

General Plumer meanwhile worked considerable havoc among the scattered
bands that hung south of the Wakkerstroom-Piet Retief blockhouses. After
the 20th he was joined by Colonel Pulteney, and together they scoured the
Randberg neighbourhood till the torrents should subside, and General Bruce-Hamilton,
in his advance on Ermelo, could be assisted by them.

NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER

As before said, General French&#8217;s operations in Cape Colony were making
substantial progress, and small commandos only continued to rove about
the south-east and south-west fringe of the colony. These were harried and
worried by the troops, but their presence was now described as a serious
inconvenience rather than as a menace of vital consequence. They confined
their annoyance to the Barkley East district and the country to the west
and north of the Cape Town-De Aar line. In the former area Monro and
Scobell continued their hunts after Myburg, Fouché, and Wessels, who now
and then skirmished, but who, owing to their losses, preferred to give the
British a wide berth. The astute and indefatigable Hunter-Weston spent his
time in chasing a gang of Boers under Naude, who, after shifting and doubling,
finally burrowed into the Karee Kloof hills north-west of Philipstown.

More columns under General Stephenson had the wearisome task of chasing
dispersed gangs over a vast tract of country; and December found Colonel
Crabbe at Lambert&#8217;s Bay, General Stephenson with Colonel Kavanagh at Clanwilliam,
Colonel Capper at Piquetberg, Captain Wormald at Wagon Drift
(north of Ceres), Major Lund south of Sutherland, and Colonel Doran between
the last place and Matjesfontein. As a result of the month&#8217;s united operations
of these forces, 29 of the enemy were killed, 21 wounded, and 45 captured.
The rinderpest continued to work havoc, but the process of inoculation and the
care taken to prevent the spread of the disease prevented the movements of the
troops from being seriously impeded. As regards the troops, despite the
heavy rains, the incessant marching, the harassing and ticklish nature of
outpost work in exposed and isolated positions, the perpetual calls on their[Pg 154]
patience, their pluck, their sagacity, and their cheerfulness; despite the wet
bivouacs and the monotonous food, and sometimes the scarcity of it, the dangers
they ran and the meagre amount of publicity their heroism received&mdash;despite
all these inconveniences, they remained true as steel and full of grim
determination &#8220;to see the thing through,&#8221; or, as the Commander-in-Chief
expressed it, &#8220;to relax no effort until the campaign had been brought to a
successful issue.&#8221;

The Boers now, at the end of 1901, found themselves cooped by blockhouse
lines into four definite areas: Botha&#8217;s attenuated force hovered on the borders
of Swaziland and the Brugspruit-Waterval line. Delarey and Kemp hung
around the difficult country between the Mafeking Railway line and the
Magaliesberg range. Steyn and De Wet with some dauntless desperadoes
did their worst in the north-east districts of Orange River Colony, and various
bands of rebels and adventurers clung to the north-west regions of the Cape
Colony. Elsewhere were only insignificant knots of worn-out and listless
stragglers. There was a gratifying increase of voluntary surrenders, and
during the month three of the most trusted leaders&mdash;Kruitzinger, Opperman,
and Haasbroek&mdash;disappeared from the fighting scene.

TRANSVAAL (EAST)&mdash;DECEMBER

General Bruce-Hamilton, for the purpose of protecting the constabulary
posts, was now operating in the country that had been so effectively cleared by
General French in the beginning of the year. On the 9th of December he
engaged in a brilliant converging movement over the old ground (see map, p. 20),
with the result that 130 prisoners, 4000 cattle, and a large convoy fell into his
hands. Briefly the tale is this: the General discovered that a large force of
Boers had collected north of Bethel, and were moving south with a view to
escaping round his left flank. Quickly, he summoned Colonels Wing and
Williams (who were moving upon Kalabasfontein) to join him at Spioenkop,
and by night the whole force made a secret march on the lair of the enemy at
Trigaardtsfontein. The movement was magnificently carried out, and the laager
was rushed by the troops at dawn. In the scrimmage seven Boers were killed,
and many who escaped pursuit were mopped up by Colonel Allenby, who was
moving from Middelkraal to Onverwacht. General Hamilton&#8217;s force after
this successful action marched into Bethel, having covered sixty miles in the
previous forty-eight hours.

His repose was short-lived. The Boers who had escaped from the pursuit
of his force gathered now, under Viljoen, twenty-five miles north-east of Bethel.
He determined to secure them. With the troops under Colonels Sir H.
Rawlinson, Wing, and Williams, he started on the 12th on another exciting
march. He neared his destination in darkness, and then in the dim dusk of
the morn galloped upon the objective. It was a splendid achievement, and
seventy Boers, including Field-Cornets Badenhorst and Swanepool, closed their
military career. Sixteen were killed in the engagement, and one of the two
15-pounder guns taken from Benson&#8217;s force at Brakenlaagte was recovered.
The other gun had been disabled by the enemy. The scattered remnants of
this commando fled north, and were tackled by Colonels Mackenzie and Fortescue,
who were operating in that direction. These officers captured more
prisoners and stock.

On the 19th of December General Bruce-Hamilton left Ermelo, marching
towards the east, while Colonel Mackenzie simultaneously moved from Carolina[Pg 155]
upon Lake Banagher (twenty-two miles north-east of Ermelo). Colonel Mackenzie
on the night of the 19th made a forced march and attacked, at Schalk
Meyer&#8217;s farm, Smits&#8217; laager, and inflicted upon the enemy a loss of six killed.
He took sixteen prisoners. He afterwards moved on Bothwell, and pursued
for thirty miles a convoy which turned out to be Smits, and after a stiff engagement
(on the 21st) secured 17 prisoners, 44 vehicles, and 2000 cattle. General
Plumer and Colonel Pulteney co-operated in the vicinity of Spitzkop, and near
there at dawn on the 23rd these officers engaged a gang of 500, and captured
6 prisoners.

On the same day General Bruce-Hamilton&#8217;s troops attacked Grobelaar&#8217;s
laager at Maryvale (fifteen miles north of Amsterdam). Owing to the denseness
of the morning mist the majority of the Boers got off scot free, and only four
were killed and eleven captured, but 700 cattle and a number of waggons fell
into British hands. The captures were mainly due to the leading of
Lieutenants Rendall and Huddleston, who, in spite of every obstruction,
dashed in among the enemy before they could gather themselves together for
more than flight. General Hamilton returned to Ermelo, and on the 29th
pushed again to Maryvale. Again he repeated his man&oelig;uvres, again he
pounced on the Boers and thinned their numbers by twenty-two (taken
prisoners), capturing also their waggons and cattle. This was on the 1st of
January. On the following day, with the columns under Colonels Simpson and
Scott, General Hamilton followed the spoor of the Pretoria commando up hill
and down dale, over circuitous bridle-paths and into deep kloofs in the sides
of the hills north-east of Amsterdam, hunting, and chasing, and burrowing.
As reward of his dogged patience and perseverance forty-nine Boers were
hemmed in and taken (among this number General Erasmus and Mr. Custer,
late J.P. of Amsterdam). Colonel Wing, who was at the same time engaged
in identical exploits, brought in twenty prisoners and five waggons.

While these activities were going forward in the east, Generals Spens and
Plumer, and Colonel Colville, on a line Beginderlyn-Rotterdam-Derby,
watched the surrounding districts, and here on the 3rd of January Plumer&#8217;s
New Zealanders encountered the enemy at Twyfelaar. Fighting fast and
furious, during which the commanding officer and twenty Colonials were
wounded, resulted in the discomfiture of the foe and a loss to them of 300
cattle and a waggon-load of ammunition.

Another fierce engagement took place on the following day, when Major
Vallentin with fifty mounted men were following up the band which had
attacked the New Zealanders. Suddenly, upon the small party rushed some
hundreds of the enemy, galloping at full speed. There were about a hundred
in the first line, while about fifty were thrown back on each flank, the movement
being covered by heavy fire from a crowd of dismounted riflemen in the background.
Thus outnumbered, the British band realised that there was nothing
for it but to sell life dearly, and in the desperate hand-to-hand conflict Major
Vallentin and 18 men fell, 5 officers and 28 men were wounded, and indeed the
small company would have been utterly annihilated but for the timely arrival
of reinforcements under Colonel Pulteney, who forced the enemy to retire.
But the Boer loss was considerable, for General Opperman, the leader of
the eastern group of commandos, perished, together with nine others. Three
wounded were left on our hands.

The enemy also had given considerable trouble to General Spens, who
spent December working between Standerton and Ermelo. On the night of
the 18th, the General detached the 14th Mounted Infantry under Major Bridg[Pg 156]ford
to search the farms dotted around the junction of the Vaal with the Kaffir
Spruit. After a long night&#8217;s march he encountered at dawn a gang of Boers.
These he chased with the utmost zeal, but while, as result of the pursuit, the
troops were scattered on a wide front, they were assailed by a vastly superior
force under Commandant Britz. The engagement was desperate and our losses
were lamentable, many men being taken prisoners. These were fortunately
recovered later, but the enemy escaped punishment. Lieutenant Stirling, Dublin
Fusiliers, and the remainder of the party fought their way doggedly through
the enemy, and returned to the nearest point on the Standerton-Ermelo blockhouse
line. Among the wounded were Captain G. F. W. Brindley, 2nd
Manchester Regiment (since dead); Captain B. H. H. Cooke, Rifle Brigade;
Lieutenant P. S. Fryer, 2nd West Yorks Regiment; Lieutenant B. A. W. C.
Moeller, 2nd Middlesex Regiment; Second Lieutenant L. P. Russell, 2nd
West Yorks Regiment (since dead).

At the end of the month combined action was taken to dispose of Commandant
Britz&#8217;s guerillas, and to commence the pursuit the troops of General
Plumer, Spens, and Colonel Pulteney assembled at Amersfoort on the 28th.
Promptly some seven prisoners were captured near Schuilplaats, and Britz
sent scurrying towards Platrand. Here General Spens came upon him again,
and relieved him of twenty-four of his followers. The rest broke up into small
knots running the gauntlet of the blockhouses, and some of them dropping[Pg 157]
wounded from their fire, while others sought shelter in the north along the
Vaal River.

Some Boers at this time had succeeded in bursting into the protected area to
the east of Springs, and the pursuit of them occupied Colonel Allenby&#8217;s troops
and General G. Hamilton&#8217;s Cavalry Brigade. These succeeded in capturing sixty,
while others surrendered to the Constabulary. In the securing of these interlopers
some very exciting and interesting adventures are related. Major Butler
and the Carabineers on the 18th accounted for thirty-four who were running
riot south-west of Brugspruit, and on the 5th of January, north of Bethel, the
13th Hussars, under Major Williams, brilliantly effected the surprise of Breytenbach&#8217;s
laager, taking 11 prisoners, 200 horses, 600 cattle, 50 mules, and 6
carts. The Commandant himself in the midst of the scrimmage made off with
true Boer velocity, but Captain Tremayne (13th Hussars), who was better
mounted than his men, spied the fugitive and engaged in a neck and neck race
with the Dutchman and, single-handed, secured him.

Colonels Park and Urmston, in the midst of atrocious weather, made
vigorous efforts to locate the so-called Boer Government, which was reported
to be hidden north of the Delagoa line. Colonel Park on the night of the 19th
was attacked in his camp at Elandspruit by a strong force under Muller,
Trichardt, and Krieger. A tremendous amount of hard fighting took place
before the guerillas were repulsed, and the losses on both sides were heavy.
Of the British one officer and seven men were killed, and five officers and
twenty-four non-commissioned officers and men were wounded. Of the Boers
eight dead and three wounded were left on the ground. The number of those
removed could not be ascertained. Among the slain were Commandant
Krieger and Field-Cornet Malan. From the 21st to Christmas Day the two
columns co-operated, skirmishing with and chasing the foe, who in small bodies
flitted hither and thither in the dense mists that hung around Dullstroom. On
the 22nd Colonel Urmston&#8217;s efforts were almost crowned with success. He
occupied a Boer laager some miles north of Dullstroom from whence the Boer
Government in a Cape cart some hours previously had fled.

IN THE NORTHERN TRANSVAAL

To west of the Pietersburg line Colonels Colenbrander and Dawkins&#8217;
co-operative system worked splendidly. Boers who evaded the one fled into
the open arms of the other! In this way Commandant Badenhorst with
twenty-two of his party was secured on the 11th December. Fleeing hot foot
from the Fighting Scouts he dropped into the maw of the Mounted Infantry,
who had been vigilantly preparing to &#8220;welcome the coming guest.&#8221; Later in
the month Colonel Dawkins started for Harrismith to reinforce General Rundle&#8217;s
command, while Colonel Colenbrander moved to Rooiberg, and from thence
pursued Boers to Jericho, a place near the Crocodile River, where sixty
prisoners and much stock were secured. Early in the year he passed on
towards the neighbourhood of Waterval, made a brilliant night march on the
Magato&#8217;s Nek in the small hours of the 4th of January, and surprised the enemy
at dawn. A stiff engagement ensued, in which five of the enemy were killed
and twenty-nine made prisoners. Not many days after Colonel Colenbrander
was fortunate enough in delivering from the hand of the native Chief,
Linchwe, a number of Boer women and children. The Chief with a following
of 2000 had started forth vowing vengeance on the Boers for having stolen his
stock, and determining to recapture his property. He was prevailed on by the[Pg 158]
Colonel, however, to retire to Pilansberg, and thus, much to the relief of the
families of the enemy throughout the district, an awkward and probably
disastrous complication was averted.

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Lord Methuen and Colonel Kekewich continued operations from Klerksdorp.
The former on the 13th December sighted a Boer convoy, gave chase
with all available mounted troops, and after covering seven miles as hard as
they could go, secured all the waggons. These were the property of Van
Rensburg&#8217;s men, and there was grim satisfaction in the knowledge that for a
few days at least the marauders would be on short commons. A dash was
made on the 16th for Potgieter&#8217;s laager, which was comfortably posted on the
southern slopes of the Makwassie range (near Wolmaranstad). The night
march was splendidly managed, and dawn found Lord Methuen in possession
of a tremendous haul of prisoners, horses, and cattle. His success was materially
assisted by the operations of Colonel Kekewich at Korannafontein, who
kept the commandos of Celliers and Vermaas engaged, prevented them going
to the assistance of the captured laager, and blocked the roads to the north.

Further operations were continued south-west of Klerksdorp at the end of
the month. Early in the year Lord Methuen&#8217;s force engaged in an animated
chase westwards after a convoy which unfortunately had had a long start of
them. The chase appeared to be a failure, but subsequently it was discovered
that Lord Methuen&#8217;s tactics had caused the convoy to seek safety by a sudden
double to the south, with the result that it ran straight upon the Kimberley
column of Major Paris, who joyously took possession of 40 waggons and over
1000 head of cattle. Thus did one man sow and another reap!

Colonel Kekewich ended the month in keen pursuit of Potgieter&#8217;s men.
He had some exciting adventures, and made many small but useful captures.
Colonel Hickie&#8217;s column covered the extension of the new blockhouse line from
Ventersdorp to Tafelkop, which point was occupied, much to the discomfiture of
the Boers, who had made it a pied-à-terre for some time past.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY

The Orange Colony was gradually becoming too peaceable for De Wet&#8217;s
liking. The great chief, after some deliberations at a Kriegsraad held on the
11th December, determined on a new plan. Finding that the system of scattering
his forces resolved itself into a steady decrease of their numbers in consequence
of the energy of our mobile columns, and discovering also that evasive
and defensive tactics ended in his gang becoming hemmed in by the advancing
blockhouse lines, he decided on concentration. He meant with his force to
avoid direct collision with British columns, but decided to choose his own
times and seasons for pouncing on and overpowering odd detachments on duty
bound, whom he might chance to entrap. This new system brought about
some unfortunate surprises and defeats of the British, but as our small but
gallant little parties were not overpowered without deadly cost, there was every
chance that the system would ensure an earlier collapse of the enemy&#8217;s power
to prolong the struggle.

A clever combined movement of the division under General Elliot, with the
columns of Rimington, Byng, Damant, and Wilson, began on the 8th Decem[Pg 159]ber.
The enemy were given the impression that the six columns were bound
for the east, consequently they made an attempt to break back through the
columns in small parties to the west. But a complete countermarch of the
British troops on a given date (the 11th) ended in their being driven to the
west quicker than they intended, and hemmed into the angle marked by the
main line of railway and the Wolvenhoek-Frankfort line of blockhouses. Of
course many of them were &#8220;slim&#8221; enough to see in time the threatened danger
and evade the bristles of the British broom, but the troops captured 43 prisoners,
780 horses, 3000 cattle, and 187 vehicles.

It was now evident that a concentration of Boers was taking place at
Kaffir Kop, north-west of Bethlehem. General Elliot&#8217;s division from Kroonstad,
General Dartnell&#8217;s men from Elands River Bridge, and Colonel Barker&#8217;s
men from Winburg co-operated so as to close in on the Kop from west, north-west,
and north-east. But unfortunately the Boers, smelling menace in the
air, dispersed even as the troops approached. Still the action was not without
results, for Colonel Barker at Vaalbank, in an engagement with 500 Boers on
the 16th (Dingaan&#8217;s Day), killed the Boer leader Haasbroek, and disposed of a
formidable foe.

General Dartnell on the 18th, in the last stage of his return journey to
Elands River Bridge, came into collision with De Wet, who, from a strong
position along the Tygerkloop Spruit, disputed his further advance. Furious
fighting followed, the Boers assailing General Dartnell&#8217;s flank and rearguard,
the Imperial Light Horse, spirited as ever, holding their own gloriously.
Finally to their succour came General B. Campbell from Bethlehem (he had
established signalling communication during the fight), and the Boers were
forced to beat a hurried retreat in the direction of Reitz.

Nothing daunted, De Wet made a new effort, and, alas! a successful one.
On the 25th, in the direction of Tweefontein (nine miles west of Elands River
Bridge), he turned up again where a covering force was watching the construction
of the Harrismith-Bethlehem blockhouse line.

This force, temporarily commanded by Major G. A. Williams, 1st South
Staffordshire Regiment, consisted of the 34th, 35th, 36th, and 53rd Companies
Imperial Yeomanry, and one gun of the 79th Battery and a pom-pom. It lay
that night on the slope of a lonely kopje; the outpost line held the crest, the
camp being situated on a gentle slope to north. The south side was steep.
From this steep and apparently unprotected side the Boers by night, at 2 A.M.
on the 25th, delivered their attack, scrambling up the heights exactly in the
swift and silent way they had mounted Wagon Hill on the 6th of January
1900, and rushed the piquets in overwhelming numbers. The ridge secured,
there followed a dash through the camp, and so swift was the movement that
many of our officers and men were shot down before they had become aware
of what had happened. It was a deplorable affair, and Major Williams paid
for what mistakes he may have made with his life. Five other officers were
killed and also 51 men; 8 officers and 81 men were wounded. Lieutenant
Harwich himself fired with the pom-pom, and was shot through the heart in
the act. Lieutenant Watney (Imperial Yeomanry) was killed as he headed
the gallant charge on the enemy. A Boer prisoner gave the following account
of the fight: Commandant Mears on the previous day spied round the camp,
noting the exact positions of the guns. After sunset De Wet assembled over
six hundred men and moved on Colonel Firman&#8217;s camp, arriving within a
thousand yards at two o&#8217;clock on Christmas morning unobserved. The Boers
marched to the foot of the hill on which the camp was. There they left their[Pg 160]
horses, and scaled the precipitous height. When the sentry challenged them
the Boers yelled madly, hoping thus to create confusion, and rushed into the
British camp, shooting our men down point-blank as they came out of their
tents. Our gunners, who were firing the guns at a range of forty yards, were
overpowered, and the camp was captured after a fierce hand-to-hand conflict.
Some Boers who lagged behind when the enemy charged the hill were
sjamboked along by De Wet and Brand. The official casualty list of the
Boers was fourteen killed, including Commandant Oliver, of Bethlehem, and
Field-Cornet Lawrence, and thirty-two wounded.

At this time General Rundle, with a small column, was encamped some 2&frac12;
miles to the east of this lonely hill. Hearing the firing he despatched Colonel
Tudway, D.A.A.G., and his Mounted Infantry to ascertain the cause, and at
the same time summoned two regiments of Imperial Light Horse from the
neighbourhood of Elands River Bridge. Quickly the Boers discovered their
peril, and made off into the Langeberg, carrying with them the gun and pom-pom
they had captured in their attack on the camp.

General Elliot, on hearing of this unfortunate affair, promptly started off on
a series of chases after De Wet, which chases were fraught with much fatigue
and considerable danger; but they failed in their main object, though many
captures of more insignificant kind were made. As an idea of the distances
covered in a week by General Elliot&#8217;s columns, the following table was given
by Lord Kitchener:&mdash;On December 29, marched seventy miles in close pursuit
of De Wet; on 31st December, twenty miles; on 4th January, sixty miles.

Before De Wet enjoyed the short-lived triumph of Christmas day, Wessels,
in the neighbourhood of Tafel Kop, had distinguished himself on the 19th.
The troops of Colonels Rimington and Damant were moving by night in a
fierce thunderstorm by parallel roads three miles apart to cover an extension
of the blockhouse line. Damant&#8217;s advance guard beheld suddenly a force
approaching. This force was kharki clad, and affected the formation usual
with regular mounted troops. They also, as they advanced, fired volleys in
the direction of some Boers who were escaping across the front of two
British forces. Naturally our men were deceived, and this clever ruse
enabled the Dutchmen to seize the crest of a kopje which commanded the
whole field and also the guns and the main body of our troops. But even
in their inferior position Damant&#8217;s gallant fellows fought nobly and
tenaciously to save the guns which accompanied the advance guard&mdash;so
nobly, indeed, that every officer and man, except four, of the leading troops
were shot down before reinforcements from the main body and Colonel
Rimington&#8217;s column came to the rescue. When these loomed in the distance
the Boers wisely relinquished their attack, and fled over the Wilge pursued for
many miles by Colonel Rimington&#8217;s troops. Colonel Damant himself was
wounded in four places, and many of his staff were killed and wounded as
they fought gallantly with their revolvers till shot down. The casualties
among officers were: Lieutenant R. G. Maturin, 39th Battery Royal Field
Artillery (wounded); Captain H. J. P. Jeffcoat, Royal Field Artillery Pompoms
(killed); Captain C. L. Gaussen, 91st Company Imperial Yeomanry
(killed); Captain G. A. C. Webb, Royal Munster Fusiliers (attached Damant&#8217;s
Horse) (wounded); Lieutenant C. H. A. Wilson, Damant&#8217;s Horse (wounded);
Lieutenant W. J. Shand, Cameron Highlanders (attached Damant&#8217;s Horse)
(wounded, since dead); Lieutenant L. W. Armstrong, 91st Company Imperial
Yeomanry (wounded). Out of a total force of ninety-five in action, we had
seventy-five killed and wounded, while of three officers and forty-two men of[Pg 161]
the 91st Yeomanry, one officer and fourteen men were killed, and one officer
and sixteen men wounded. Some truly heroic deeds were performed. Captain
Jeffcoat, D.S.O., continued gallantly to work his gun under close and heavy
fire till he dropped dead. Lieutenant Maturin, although wounded, collected
some men and got the limbers out of fire; while Captain Webb and Lieutenant
Shand charged boldly forward to a ridge, which they held till all save two of
their men were killed or wounded. Captain Gaussen (91st Company Imperial
Yeomanry) and Lieutenant Diving, who commanded the escort to the guns,
displayed almost reckless gallantry, and the same may be said of Lieutenant
Clive Wilson. Dr. Wedderburn pursued his deeds of mercy to the wounded,
regardless of the rain of bullets that overtook him.



DE WET&#8217;S ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE RAILWAY.

Blockhouse and Armoured Train at work.


The following particulars of this gallant fight were obtained from the men
engaged in it by the correspondent of the Central News:&mdash;

&#8220;The columns under Colonel Damant and Colonel Rimington left Frankfort on the 19th
inst. and proceeded in the direction of Vrede. The force trekked all night through a most
severe thunderstorm, during which three of our men were struck by lightning and killed.

&#8220;On reaching the neighbourhood of Tafelkop, Damant rushed a Boer piquet, killing
one man and capturing Commandant Gyter.

&#8220;At daybreak the transport waggons were laagered, and were left behind in charge of
a small escort, while Damant with two guns of the 39th Battery, and one pom-pom and
ninety-five men all told, rushed forward. The little force deviated on the left flank, where
a number of Boers had been located.

&#8220;On reaching a ridge Colonel Damant observed a party of seventy men dressed in
British uniform busily engaged driving cattle in his direction. The strangers were at first
taken to be a part of Rimington&#8217;s column which had gone out on the right flank. The
mistake was soon discovered, however, and almost immediately another body of the enemy
was located further to the left of the British laager.

&#8220;Our guns were speedily unlimbered, and quickly came into action. We had only been
able to fire two shots when the Boers in charge of the cattle abandoned them and galloped
boldly forward towards the British position.

&#8220;The enemy opened a galling fire on the gunners at a range of two hundred yards, and
simultaneously another party of 150 Boers who had remained carefully concealed in ambush
in the long grass at the foot of the ridge enfiladed the position.

&#8220;A large number of the gallant defenders fell at the first few volleys, but the survivors
fought tenaciously, and the enemy were only able to rush and capture the position after all
the men on the ridge had been either killed or wounded except three.

&#8220;Previous to this, however, some of the gallant gunners and the escort had succeeded
in getting away the limbers of the guns, notwithstanding the heavy fire. The only gunner
who had escaped the bullets then effectually destroyed the breech-blocks of the guns and
rendered them utterly useless to the enemy. Out of a total force of 95 in action we had 75
killed and wounded, while of the 91st Yeomanry, one officer and 14 men were killed and
one officer and 10 men wounded.

&#8220;The Boers, who were under Commandants Wessels, Ross, and M. Botha&mdash;the latter
the son of the Commandant-General&mdash;also lost heavily. They had Commandant Vandermerwe
and 30 men killed. Three of the Boer dead were buried by our men, and the
remainder were carried away.

&#8220;Later in the day a Boer came in under a flag of truce and asked for an armistice in
order to allow the enemy to attend to their wounded and bury their dead.

&#8220;The survivors on our side state that the Boers behaved badly to our wounded on the
ridge after the position had been rushed. Every one who made a movement while lying on
the ground was fired at. An officer of the Yeomanry asked permission from a Boer dressed
in kharki to get water for our wounded. For reply the Boer discharged his Mauser point
blank at the officer&#8217;s head, but fortunately missed him.

&#8220;Several more of the enemy robbed and stripped our wounded and dead, and were only
restrained from perpetrating further outrages by their commandants, who used sjamboks
freely.

&#8220;The Boers were terribly angry when they discovered they were unable to move or use
the guns which they had captured.

&#8220;Meanwhile Captain Scott had got together a small force and came up to the assistance
of Damant&#8217;s men.[Pg 162]

&#8220;Scott prepared to charge the position, when the enemy, mistaking his men for
Rimington&#8217;s column, hastily retreated. The fleeing Boers, however, fell right into the arms
of Rimington&#8217;s force, which was coming up to Damant&#8217;s support. Rimington opened fire,
and the enemy lost a few killed, while five were captured.

&#8220;Rimington, with the remainder of Damant&#8217;s force, chased the flying enemy across the
Wilge River.

&#8220;There appears to have been lately a large concentration of the enemy under De Wet
at Tafelkop. Large parties of determined fighters under the immediate command of M.
Botha, Meintjes, Tallvaard, Steenkamp, and Bucknill are now laying in ambush about the
district, waiting to attack small columns.&#8221;

In the south-western parts of the Orange Colony the process of clearance
continued, the troops bringing to the monotonous labour the utmost patience
and cheeriness. In the north-western portion the troops under Major Pack
Beresford (South African Constabulary) did a remarkable amount of work. At
the end of December they made a dashing raid on Bothaville, which led to the
capture of 36 prisoners, 80 horses, and 29 vehicles; and early in the new
year, in Ukenaimer, they secured the whole of Field-Cornet Theron&#8217;s laager
and transport, with 35 prisoners, among them Field-Cornet Le Roux.

CAPE COLONY

In the Cape Colony Major-General Sir H. H. Settle assumed command in
succession to Major-General Wynne, who returned to England. Affairs otherwise
remained as before, though the bands of Fouché and Myburg were
disorganised and broken up by the excellent and continuous work of Colonel
Munro and Scobell, and Lovat&#8217;s invaluable Scouts. The guerillas were now
fewer and farther between, spending their time lurking in the hills around
Dordrecht, Jamestown, and Ladygrey, and indulging in acts of brigandage
according to the state of their appetites. The great incident of the month was
the capture of Kruitzinger. This was effected on the 16th of December. The
raider, returning to the Cape Colony with an escort of one hundred men, came
into contact near Hanover with the blockhouses held by the Grenadier Guards
on the Naauwpoort-De Aar line of railway. The collision was sharp and
short, and the commander and twelve of his men were wounded and finally
captured. The rest of the escort escaped to the south, and were pursued into
the Aberdeen district by troops under Colonel B. Doran and Major Lord W.
Cavendish Bentinck.

A gradually widening line of blockhouses running 200 miles (from Lambert&#8217;s
Bay to Calvinia and Victoria West) threatened shortly to limit the
raiders&#8217; sphere of operation, but till this was complete the chases continued.
Colonel Doran, on the 9th, surprised and buffeted Nesser&#8217;s rebels near Brandwagt,
thirty miles east-north-east of Calvinia. One Boer was killed and eight
were captured. The rest scuttled in small parties to the Clanwilliam district, in
hope to reassemble and pounce on the next convoy coming their way. This
much-desired prize at last appeared, and was attacked with intense energy at
dawn on the 22nd. It was escorted by columns under Colonels Crabbe and
Wyndham, who, despite the strength and desperate determination of the foe,
managed to repulse them. But the next day the enemy, hungering after the
tantalising supplies, betook themselves to a high ridge commanding the line of
advance and there lay ensconced awaiting the precious convoy. But after all
they went empty away, for the 16th Lancers, with tremendous dash, rushed
the entrenchments and drove them at full gallop into space.[Pg 163]

THE SITUATION&mdash;JANUARY 1902



The Blockhouse System


Over a year had passed since Lord Kitchener had embarked on the duties of
Commander-in-Chief, and it was now possible to examine the system on which
the war had been conducted, and the extent of progress made. The great and
most important part of the work, which was still continuing, was the dividing
of the settled from the unsettled portions of the country. The development[Pg 164]
of the blockhouse system, which effectually blocked the inroads of the
marauders, went on apace, and already some 14,700 square miles of the
Transvaal, and 17,000 square miles of the Orange River Colony were entirely
shut off from their incursions. The area protected in the Transvaal was
bounded on the north by a line from Zeerust to Middelburg, on the east from
Middelburg to Standerton, on the south from Standerton to Klerksdorp, on
the west from Klerksdorp to Zeerust. The Orange River Colony protected
area went right across the colony south of the line from Kimberley to Winburg,
Winburg to Bloemfontein, and Bloemfontein to Ladybrand. Within these
boundaries the Boer could not exist, and beyond them the task of clearing the
country and hunting down the enemy was pursued by means of small mobile
columns.

The work and activity of these columns throughout the year had been
enormous. Though about 10,000 Boers remained sprinkled in the field, some
53,000 (half of which number had been accounted for during the last year) had
been either killed, wounded, imprisoned, or protected in concentration camps. In
regard to these camps a great deal had been said by the enemies of the Government
for the purpose of raising a cry of inhumanity against the Ministers, but
in a speech made by Mr. Brodrick he lucidly and concisely examined and
disposed of these charges. &#8220;So long,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as every house in the Transvaal
and Orange River Colony was used at once as a telegraph station, a
recruiting office, and a refectory for the enemy, it became impossible for Lord
Kitchener to ignore the necessity of relieving the country of the population
which was rendering futile the exertions of our troops. Under these circumstances
you have to consider not what their condition is now as compared with
what it would be in time of peace, but what their condition is now as compared
with what it would have been if they had been left on their farms. You have
not got to consider the difference between luxury and privation, but between
starvation and great suffering, and the less suffering we can arrange for.&#8221; He
further showed that to a large extent the disease in the camp was due to the fact
that the majority of persons who came in (some compulsorily, but the greater
number voluntarily) were already half-starved, their resources being at an
end, and half-clothed, with their bodies in a condition fitted for the reception
of disease. Under those circumstances a large death-rate was certain.

But, he asked, what nation engaged in war has at any time, in any country,
or under any conditions, endeavoured to feed, clothe, house, nurse, doctor, and
educate 150,000 persons, who have been left on their hands by the enemy,
whom they had called on&mdash;as Lord Roberts did on two occasions&mdash;to take
over and maintain their own belongings, but who said they would leave them
on our hands. And again, he explained that far from any inhumanity being
shown the enemy, many of the troubles had been prolonged by excessive
leniency to men who, on many occasions, had violated the rules of civilised
warfare. For the last year and before it there had been instances of firing on
ambulances, professing to surrender and opening fire again, or firing on the
wounded, breaches of parole and treachery, which had provoked no retaliation,
no deviation from the usages of the civilised warfare on our part. He put
forth reasons which accounted for the abnormal death-rate in the concentration
camps, showing in the first place that a death-rate in a camp whence all the
healthy males have been removed, cannot be looked on as an ordinary death-rate.
He said: &#8220;If you look only at infants, it has been pointed out that in
the thirty-three great towns of the Kingdom the mortality is 248 per 1000.
Birkenhead goes up even to 362 per 1000. Therefore, those who compare the[Pg 165]
death-rate in these camps with the ordinary death-rate of the great towns are,
of course, speaking wrongly. I have heard of people who think that measles
cannot have much effect on the death-rate. But what of the gardes mobiles of
Paris during the siege, whose death-rate was 40 per cent. in measles cases?&#8221;
The critics who had discussed the camps had not taken the trouble to acquaint
themselves with the ordinary statistics of Boer farm life, for, had they done so,
they might have taken into consideration the fact that though many Boers had
families of twenty children, as a rule, owing to the neglect, ignorance, or
apathy of the parents, only two to a family survived. For this reason their
population has not been equal to that of other nations in the same conditions.
It is only by a study of the habits of life of these people prior to the English
rule that it is possible to judge whether they had in the camps the comfort they
were accustomed to. Luxury is but comparative, and, as has been shown, the
luxury of soap and other sanitary precautions were ignored by the lower
classes of Boers from earliest times. In regard to the matter of diet, that these
persons received food at all was a marvel, considering that every convoy had
to be protected from their marauding relatives by the lives of our own valiant
men, men who themselves were not without anxiety as to how their own wives,
mothers, and babes were faring at home in their absence, and who themselves,
after a long career of hazard and usefulness, might share a less enviable fate.

In addition to the accusations regarding the concentration camps, invented
by traitors to the country that housed and sheltered them, there were other
arguments to be met. &#8220;How is it, if you send this vast number of horses&mdash;if
you have your columns&mdash;if you have good leaders who are well equipped&mdash;that
our men cannot catch the enemy? Is your intelligence defective; is
your system at fault?&#8221; The explanation given by Mr. Brodrick, one which
showed a serious development of the war, was this: &#8220;The system of our
country and people with regard to the Kaffir is different from the Boer system.
The Boer columns have only too frequently in the last few months eluded our
columns by hiding their tracks, by murdering the Kaffirs behind them. It is a
serious charge, and I make it only for this reason, that I had occasion to notice
that in the secret intelligence reports so many cases were mentioned of the
murder of Kaffirs that I telegraphed to Lord Kitchener to ask whether this was
a general practice, or whether it was the occasion of isolated persons. His reply
was: &#8216;Cold-blooded murders by the Boers have been frequent of late. It was
only on the 10th inst. two dead infants were found with their hands tied behind
them down a main shaft at Freylingstadt.&#8217; The leader of a column, whose
letter I saw not long ago, mentioned that he was within two or three hours of a
column of the enemy whom he had been pursuing for a considerable number of
hours&mdash;that was at a Kaffir kraal&mdash;and he found the place deserted, but in one
of the houses he found four little Kaffir boys, all under twelve, all with their
heads battered in two or three hours before.&#8221; Mr. Brodrick proceeded to
explain that he did not bring this forward with the intention of making an
impeachment against the whole Boer nation. Indeed, the statement was forced
from him by friends of the enemy who at one time jeered at the Government
and our Military Commanders for not beating the Boers, and at another complained
that negotiations and blandishments were not substituted for the slow
system of physical pressure that was found by the Commander-in-Chief to be
the surest means to the end&mdash;the peaceable end.

Both Lord Kitchener and Lord Milner decided that it was of no use either
to threaten or to wheedle, the one and only thing was imperturbably to squeeze,
reserving the policy of clemency for the proper season, when the surrendered[Pg 166]
Boers should have become our fellow-subjects. Accordingly we still continued
to pour fresh regiments into the country. Four thousand trained mounted troops
were now on their way out to replace those that needed rest, and India was
providing four battalions and two more cavalry regiments in return for other
troops which would take their place there. Some militia regiments were also
being sent to the front, and further Colonial contingents, so that thus reinforced
the tired veterans would receive a fillip for future operations.

For reference in the future, when the resources of the Empire are studied,
the following return of troops and horses sent out to South Africa between
January 1, 1900, and December 31, 1901, may be found interesting:&mdash;

[Pg 168]

Owing to the efficacy of Lord Kitchener&#8217;s slow but sure efforts the railway
disasters became fewer. In October 1900 the railway was cut thirty-two
times, or more than once per day. In November thirty times, in December
twenty-one times, in January sixteen, in February (after De Wet&#8217;s incursion
into Cape Colony) thirty, in March eighteen, in April eighteen, in May twelve,
in June eight, in July four, in August four, in September two, and in October
not at all. Thus it became possible for more than a hundred refugees per week
to resume work at Johannesburg.

The supreme authority throughout the Transvaal rested with Lord Kitchener.
Civil considerations had of necessity to give way to military exigency. The
work of the civil authorities was naturally restricted and subject to limitations
from which on the return to normal conditions it would be freed. Nevertheless
they acted with foresight, preparing such seeds as would ensure a good harvest
in time to come. In a report made to Mr. Chamberlain in December, Lord
Milner spoke hopefully of this happy era: &#8220;We have come into possession
of a magnificent estate, which has been woefully mismanaged. As far as local
administration is concerned&mdash;I am not speaking of the political development of
South Africa as a whole&mdash;it requires no extraordinary statesmanship, it simply
requires ordinary decent government and reasonable liberality in public finance
to ensure not only a great advance in material prosperity, but in all the
essentials of civilisation.&#8221; Lord Milner also expressed the opinion that,
terrible as had been the ravages of the war, the great fact remained that the
Transvaal possesses an amount of mineral wealth virtually unaffected by the
war which will ensure the prosperity of South Africa for the next fifty years,
and other resources, both industrial and agricultural, which, properly developed,
should make it a rich country, humanly speaking, for ever.

Before constructing the blockhouse lines Lord Kitchener determined that the
enemy must be deprived of his guns. His efforts in that direction were speedily
rewarded. By June 1901 nearly the whole Boer artillery was captured or had
been destroyed by the Boers themselves. General French was responsible for
the capture of guns in the Eastern Transvaal, and we know how effectively his
work was carried out. General Babington deprived Delarey of nine guns, two
were taken by Rawlinson and more by Dartnell and others. In all twenty-seven
guns were reported to have been taken during the year; twenty-six
of them during the months of February, March, April, and May. They included
half-a-dozen pom-poms, seven or eight Maxims, several 15-pounders, Krupp
guns of varying calibre, Creusot, Hotchkiss, and quick-firing guns. In addition
to these armaments, more than half-a-dozen of our own guns taken from British
positions at various times were recovered. Of rifles 7993 were captured, and
during the year it was estimated that 8589 vehicles had been taken by the
British. In fact the process of the gradual depletion of the enemy&#8217;s resources
had been most effective. The number of prisoners taken was about 27,000.
The surrenders prior to Lord Kitchener&#8217;s proclamation in August had averaged
about 500 a month. During the later months the surrenders decreased, while
the number of prisoners captured increased. Naturally at the close of the year
there was a decline in the number of Boer casualties, for the continued
attrition of the Boer resistance necessarily reduced the number of antagonists
accounted for.



GENERAL BABINGTON.

In an intercepted letter from Mr. Schalk Burger to Mr. Steyn, dated
Tautesberg, March 21, 1901, stating that the condition of the Boers at that
time was becoming very serious, the Acting President said:&mdash;

&#8220;The question is, what must we, what shall we do? May we, can we,[Pg 169]
continue the struggle further? I pray the Lord day and night to give us
wisdom and light hereon, and cause us not to sin against His will, but also not
to fall into disbelief. If we are convinced that our last resources are exhausted,
our last strength broken, we must bow down and surrender ourselves to the
power of the enemy, no matter how bitter this cup may be to us. I can, however,
not yet decide upon this latter course. My hope and trust is still that
we shall be delivered and saved; the sacrifices of lives, prayers, and misery, are
too great not to be crowned with our hopes and expectations, according to our
belief. As you will see for yourself, from the correspondence between Lord
Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, there is no mention of terms which
meet us in any way, therefore I keep to the decision to surrender unconditionally
if this must happen, which I trust God forbid. No, let us keep our nation
unsullied, to receive no favour from our enemy, that the gulf which exists through
former years and this cruel war remains and still widens. &#8216;Where there is
a will there&#8217;s a way,&#8217; and if we are not exiled, we can, by exerting our strength,
form committees, and supported by loving gifts from Europe, again build up
our country and people, to advance our language and religion, to educate our
children, and to keep alive our oppressed national spirit and cause it to come to
life again. This is my ideal.&#8221;

Many months had now elapsed since the penning of that letter, and the condition
of the Boers had gone from bad to worse. Their hitherto stubborn
resistance was now little more than suicidal lunacy. A rough estimate of their
losses for the year, so far as could be judged, is shown in the following table:&mdash;

Lord Milner, in reviewing the situation at the end of the year, commended
the marked change which had come to pass:&mdash;

&#8220;Six months ago the enemy were everywhere, outside the principal towns.
It is true they held nothing, but they raided wherever they pleased, and, though
mostly in small bodies, which made little or no attempt at resistance when
seriously pressed, they almost invariably returned to their old haunts when the
pressure was over. It looked as though the process might go on indefinitely. I
had every opportunity of watching it, for during the first two months of my
residence here it was in full swing in the immediate neighbourhood. There
were half-a-dozen Boer strongholds, or rather trysting-places, quite close to
Pretoria and Johannesburg, and the country round was quite useless to us for
any purpose but that of marching through it, while the enemy seemed to find[Pg 170]
no difficulty in subsisting there. To-day, on the other hand, a great quadrilateral,
bounded roughly as follows: on the east by the Wilge River and a line
drawn from its head-waters to Villiersdorp on the Vaal River; on the south, by
the Vaal River from Villiersdorp to about Klerksdorp; on the west, by an
irregular line drawn from Klerksdorp to the centre of the Magaliesberg Range;
and on the north, by that range and the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay Railway, is
virtually denied to the enemy. This area is more important, economically,
politically, and strategically than all the rest of the Transvaal. It contains not
only Pretoria and the whole of the Rand mining area, but one of the most important
coalfields and a large extent of the best agricultural land. Similarly, a
great improvement is manifest in the southern part of the Orange River
Colony&mdash;the districts lying south of a line drawn from Ladybrand to Bloemfontein,
and thence westward through Boshof to the colonial border. It would
not be true to say that this region is entirely clear of the enemy, but great
progress has recently been made in clearing it. Strategically this is a
very important region owing to its central position, and to the fact that it
connects the northern states with the &#8216;friendly and allied&#8217; districts of Cape
Colony.&#8221;

In discussing the Cape rebels he declared that&mdash;

&#8220;If the enemy now find this region difficult to live in, and impossible to
traverse in any considerable numbers, the circumstance is both militarily and
politically important, for it means that their dwindling numbers in the late
Republics are now deprived of that reinforcement from the south, which has
all along been of such immense assistance to them. For even holding, as I do
(though competent opinions differ on the subject), that the number of colonial
rebels who have actually crossed the border during the past twelve months has
not been large, it would be hard to overestimate the moral support which
Colonial information, sympathy, and encouragement, and the touch with the
outside world maintained by free communication with Cape Colony, has hitherto
afforded to the enemy. Such communication is now greatly hampered, and
may soon become absolutely impossible.&#8221;

On the 25th of January a Peace Movement was made by the Dutch
Government, in which it was proposed that the British Government should
give safe conducts to three Boer delegates in order that they might go from
Europe to induce their fighting compatriots to conclude a treaty of peace.
Since a treaty is a compact between two Governments, and since one of the
Governments&mdash;the Boer Government&mdash;ceased, with the annexation of the
Boer territories, to exist, there was only one reply possible to the British
Government, and this reply was given. The following is the text of the
document:&mdash;


&#8220;The Marquess of Lansdowne to Baron Gericke.

&#8220;Foreign Office, January 29, 1902.

&#8220;Sir,&mdash;You were good enough to lay before me on the 25th instant a communication
from the Netherland Government, in which it was proposed that, with the object of
bringing the war to an end, his Majesty&#8217;s Government might grant a safe conduct to the
Boer delegates now in Holland for the purpose of enabling them to confer with the Boer
leaders in South Africa. It is suggested that after the conference the delegates might
return to Europe with power to conclude a Treaty of Peace with this country, and the
Netherland Government intimate that, in this event, they might at a later stage be
instrumental in placing the Boer Plenipotentiaries in relation with the Plenipotentiaries
who might be appointed by his Majesty&#8217;s Government.

&#8220;The Netherland Government intimate that if this project commends itself to his[Pg 171]
Majesty&#8217;s Government, they will inquire of the delegates whether they are prepared to
make the suggested visit to South Africa.

&#8220;It may therefore be inferred that the communication which I received from you was
made on the responsibility of the Netherland Government alone, and without authority
from the Boer delegates or leaders.

&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Government have given it their best consideration, and, whilst they
entirely appreciate the motives of humanity which have led the Netherland Government
to make this proposal, they feel that they must adhere to the decision, adopted and
publicly announced by them some months after the commencement of hostilities by the
Boers, that it is not their intention to accept the intervention of any foreign Power in the
South African War.

&#8220;Should the Boer delegates themselves desire to lay a request for safe conduct before
his Majesty&#8217;s Government, there is no reason why they should not do so. But his
Majesty&#8217;s Government are obviously not in a position to express an opinion on any such
application until they have received it and are aware of its precise nature, and the grounds
on which the request is made.

&#8220;I may, however, point out that it is not at present clear to his Majesty&#8217;s Government
that the delegates retain any influence over the representatives of the Boers in South
Africa, or have any voice in their councils. They are stated by the Netherland Government
to have no letters of credence or instructions later in date than March 1900. His
Majesty&#8217;s Government had, on the other hand, understood that all powers of government,
including those of negotiation, were now completely vested in Mr. Steyn for the Boers of
the Orange River Colony, and in Mr. Schalk Burger for those of the Transvaal.

&#8220;If this be so, it is evident that the quickest and most satisfactory means of arranging a
settlement would be by direct communication between the leaders of the Boer forces in
South Africa and the Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty&#8217;s forces, who has already been
instructed to forward immediately any offers he may receive for the consideration of his
Majesty&#8217;s Government.

&#8220;In these circumstances his Majesty&#8217;s Government have decided that if the Boer leaders
should desire to enter into negotiations for the purpose of bringing the war to an end, those
negotiations must take place, not in Europe, but in South Africa.

&#8220;It should, moreover, be borne in mind that if the Boer delegates are to occupy time in
visiting South Africa, in consulting with the Boer leaders in the field, and in returning to
Europe for the purpose of making known the results of their errand, a period of at least
three months would elapse, during which hostilities would be prolonged, and much human
suffering, perhaps needlessly, occasioned.

&#8220;I have, &amp;c.,

(Signed) &#8220;Lansdowne.&#8221;

Thus the situation remained much the same as before, save that the British
more than ever realised the necessity of bringing home to the Boers the
fact that the death-blow to their independence had been struck by Kruger&#8217;s
insolent ultimatum of October 1899.

THE LOYALISTS OF THE CAPE COLONY



Map of the Western Portion of Cape Colony


Regarding this remarkable and long-suffering set of men, it would be possible
to write a volume. Space limits us to a few lines. Yet, after all, deeds like
theirs are best sung in the finest song of all&mdash;the song that has no sound.
Some one has asked, What constitutes a State? The answer applies to
those, the loyal and true, who have fought and suffered in the cause of home
and country.


&#8220;Men who their duties know
But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain,
Prevent the long-aimed blow
And crush the Tyrant while they rend the chain:
These constitute a State.&#8221;


And these bulwarks of Great Britain&#8217;s might were to be found in great strength
in South Africa. Other colonies had contributed most generously in men and[Pg 172]
money, but no other colony had been called on to endure what the Cape
Colony had endured, and thus enduring, to act and to pay as this colony had
acted and paid. Almost from the commencement of hostilities the Colonial
forces&mdash;the Cape Mounted Rifles, Cape Police, South Rhodesian Volunteers,
and others[10]&mdash;had shown their grit and usefulness in the field and covered
themselves with imperishable glory. If the burden of their maintenance had
fallen hard on the resources of the country, the laurels they had won had clothed
the harshness with an evergreen beauty, for the country must be eternally
proud of the men who saved Wepener and of those who struggled and
helped to save Mafeking. The outlines of Wepener&#8217;s story have been given,
and a little has been said of the Rhodesia Regiment that was raised by Colonel
Plumer to protect the border in case of war, and in looking back over their
operations it is difficult to say whether by their usefulness or their dash the
Colonial &#8220;Irregulars&#8221; rendered themselves most conspicuous. During the war,
of the Rhodesians Colonel Spreckley, Captain Crewe, Captain Butters, and
Lieutenant Anderson lost their lives, but the borders of Rhodesia were[Pg 173]
protected. During the siege of Wepener the Cape Mounted Rifles fought in
more engagements than an ordinary General will count in a lifetime&mdash;yet
they saved the place and came out of it to fight a renewed set of battles!

It must be admitted that all the Colonial troops entered into their work with
the same cheeriness and military ardour, though all had not the same chance to
win fame. The Tabaksberg engagement on 29th January afforded the Kaffrarian
Rifles an opportunity of distinguishing themselves, and the following quotation
from a letter from Colonel Crewe (commanding the Colonial Division in the
Field) to the Mayor of East London serves to show how they availed themselves
of it:&mdash;

&#8220;I am sure you will be pleased to hear of the gallant conduct of the
Kaffrarian Rifles at the recent engagement at Tabaksberg on 29th January last,
when the force under my command, some 700 in all, were engaged by the
forces of De Wet and Steyn. With odds of 2500 to 700 against us, we were
able to successfully maintain our position owing to the extreme bravery of the
men I have the honour to command. Where all did well, the Kaffrarian Rifles
did especially fine service. To Major Price and Captain Fairweather much of this
success is due, and amongst the non-commissioned officers and men it is difficult
to pick out names for special mention where all did so well. I am sure East
London will be prouder than ever of her gallant sons. Both General C. Knox
and Lord Kitchener have expressed their admiration of the behaviour of all
ranks on that day.&#8221;

It seems unfair to make special mention of any single branch of the Colonial
Volunteer Service, when all the Cape loyalists behaved in some way like
&#8220;trumps&#8221; or veterans. The permanent forces of the Cape Government
were grandly supported almost from the very first by the Cape Garrison
Artillery, the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s Own, and the Cape Town Highlanders,
and these, when the &#8220;call to arms&#8221; came, were finally backed up by
the Town Guards, the Peninsula Horse, and other irregular forces that had
been raised practically at a moment&#8217;s notice&mdash;drawn straight from the hearth
and home to throw in their lot with the soldiers in the field. It was thanks
to these that the colony was saved, and thanks to the Town Guard
that the regular and irregular forces and volunteers were freed to push
on to the front. Indeed, at one period of the war, the Cape Town Guard
(which enrolled for three months and hung on to the end) were left almost
entirely alone for the protection of the towns.

Lord Milner, who was greatly impressed by the conduct of the volunteers,
thus expressed himself on the subject: &#8220;It is indeed calculated to exercise a
most important and, I believe, beneficial influence upon the South African
politics of the future. Among the principal causes of the trouble of the past
and present was the contempt felt by the Africander countryman, used to riding
and shooting, and generally in possession of a good rifle and plenty of cartridges,
for other white men less habituated to arms than he was himself. That feeling
can hardly survive the experience of the past twelve months, and especially
of the last six weeks. The splendid fighting of the despised Johannesburgers,
of the Imperial Light Horse, and of the other South African Colonial Corps has
become a matter of history, and the present levee en masse of the British
people, including the townsmen, of this Colony, is proof positive that when the
necessity is really felt they are equal to the best in courage and public spirit.
In this respect the events of the past few months, unfortunate as they have
been in many ways, have undoubtedly their brighter side. The mutual
respect of the two principal white races is the first condition of a healthy[Pg 174]
political life in the South Africa of the future. It is possible that if the extreme
strain of the most recent developments of the war had never been felt throughout
Cape Colony the British inhabitants would never have had the opportunity
of showing that they were inferior to none in their willingness to bear all the
burdens of citizenship, including that of personal service.&#8221;

It may be remembered that on the 6th of February 1901 Brigadier-General
Brabant was appointed to the command of the force which was then being raised
for the defence of the Cape Colony, with Colonel Girouard as his chief staff
officer. His headquarters were at East London, where the organisation proceeded,
expanding eventually northward and westward, taking in district after
district, so as to enable the Imperial military forces ultimately to concentrate in
the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies. Colonel H. Cooper, C.M.G., A.D.C.,
commanded the Cape Town District, and Major Coke took a prominent part
in the organisation of the irregular corps. The towns which provided guards
were mentioned in a previous volume, but particulars were not then available.

The Stellenbosch Town Guard contained some of the smartest members of
the Colonial Defence Force. Like one man they enrolled themselves, only
too proud to assist in the national cause. Very soon there were collected
over a hundred of them under the following officers: Captain Harry Beyers,
Lieutenant H. P. Shepherd, Lieutenant J. L. Scott, Hon. Surgeon-Captain
J. W. C. Macpherson.

On the 15th January 1901 the Commandant read the proclamation of
Martial Law in the Stellenbosch Court-house. From that date, thirty
members of the Town Guard were called out to do permanent duty. At
first some difficulty arose as to where the men were to be housed, &amp;c., but
eventually the Masonic Building was placed at the disposal of the Permanent
Guard. &#8220;In this building,&#8221; wrote a colonial correspondent, &#8220;Captain Harry
Beyers, the officer in command of the Guard, has his office, where all permits
and passes are issued; the Commandant of the District, who, by the way, lives
at the Remount Station about five miles out of the town, comes in three times
a week to transact any military business. The barrack-room is a fine and
large hall where the men have their meals and also sleep. The rifles are all
in racks at the further end of the hall; these racks are all numbered, and every
man knows his number. The place and its surroundings are kept scrupulously
clean, and a sentry, who is always to be seen at the gate, stops any loiterer
from entering the parade ground, where every morning at seven o&#8217;clock and
every afternoon at six o&#8217;clock the men are properly drilled by the popular
&#8216;Jimmy&#8217; Hills, the Colour-Sergeant Major, who is, like his captain, an old hand
at the game.&#8221;

In the beginning of July, when the Commandant of No. 7 Area, Colonel
Helme, inspected the Guards, he was surprised to note the efficiency and
smartness of the men. In an address to them he complimented the commanding
officer for the work done; he also mentioned that the Stellenbosch
Town Guard was the best turned out Guard in his area.

A brief description of the Civil Service Company of the Cape Town Guards
serves to give a general idea of the nature of these valuable protectors of the
city. The Company was under the command of Captain Callcott Stevens, of
the Civil Commissioner&#8217;s Office, Cape Town, who had previously seen active
service with the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s Own Volunteer Rifles in the Basuto
Campaign of 1880-81. The section commanders of the Company were Lieutenant
Frank W. Waldron, A.M.I.C.E., of the Department of the Commissioner for
Public Works; Lieutenant William A. Collard, Deputy-Assistant Treasurer,[Pg 175]
Treasury Department; Lieutenant Arthur A. Beck, of the Colonial Secretary&#8217;s
Department; Lieutenant Bertram E. Shepperson, of the Treasury; and Lieutenant
Charles Murray, of the Department of Public Education. The nominal
strength of the Company was 142 members. It was raised in one afternoon&mdash;immediately
the ministerial authority for its enrolment was obtained. A similar
degree of rapidity was manifested in many other companies of the Guards at
the time of the crisis, and this martial impetuosity reflected immense credit on
the manhood of the city&mdash;on its patriotism, its disinterestedness, and its pluck.

The Civil Service Company consisted of five sections, and was fully representative
of the Departments of the Prime Minister, the Commissioner for
Public Works, the Treasury, the Colonial Office, and the Attorney-General,
together with all the offices and sub-departments controlled by these ministerial
divisions. An excellent spirit was manifested throughout by all ranks; and
much laborious work was done in the way of guards mounted over important
arsenals, magazines, and valuable stores. The original period of three months
for which the Guards enrolled passed only too quickly, but their services were
still urgently required, and they continued to be called upon for further periods
of service, to which an excellent response was made&mdash;thus the military authorities
were enabled to release many men of the regular forces for service in the
fighting line, where they were much needed.

Among the various companies of the Town Guard were many prominent
Government officials and business and professional men, whose names are
familiar in the colony. It would be impossible to reprint the rolls of all the
companies, but a list of names of some of the well-known persons who
appeared in the new character of defenders of the Empire is here quoted:&mdash;

A. Allen, G. T. Amphlett, Kitchener Andersen, H. J. Andrews, H. Arderne, Robert
Armour, R. H. Atwell, R. J. Austin, R. E. Ball, F. C. Berrangé, F. L. Bishop, J. J. Bisset,
G. Bolus, W. H. Bond, J. Brydone, W. P. Buchanan, J. C. Carstens, J. D. Cartwright,
M.L.A., J. H. Clark, Wm. Cleghorn, W. F. Colman, Sydney Cowper, C.M.G., Peter
Davidson, A. Dawson, Theo. De Marillac, R. Dickson, Dennis Edwards, E. J. Edwards,
W. A. Fairbridge, Dr. E. B. Fuller, J. Garlick, C. M. Gibbs, J. Gillett, C. G. Goodison, C.

Alf. S. Hosking, J. W. Irwin, W. H. Johnstone, Howel Jones, Sir H. H. Juta, K.C., J. M.
King, J. R. Lancaster, R. A. Lambart, H. G. Legg, E. B. Lewis, Alex. Lipp, J. E. Lloyd,
W. B. Low, D. A. MacDonald, Walter Marshall, A. H. Mathew, Rob. M. Maxwell, D. E.
McConnell, A. M&#8217;Corkindale, D. McKee, C. S. Meechan, Donald Menzies, Stavros Mitchel,
R. H. C. Montague, E. J. Moore, W. E. Moore, J. Barry Munnik, C. S. Neave, E. T. M.
Notcutt, A. Palmer, D. S. Pargiter, J. Parker, Dr. T. L. Parry, J. O. Paterson, W. I. Perrott,
F. Plant, A. Plint, R. H. Pritchard, A. Ransome, P. Raphael, A. B. Reid, J. Richards,
H. P. B. Rigby, A. J. Robb, H. D. Robertson, G. Crosland Robinson, D. D. Ross, Pierce
Ryan, J. Sandersen, P. J. Savage, A. D. Scott, G. Scott, M. W. Searle, K.C., Fred. Wm.
Smith, J. H. Smithers, C. E. Solomon, Will. G. Sprigg, W. Stableford, James M. Stephen,
Calcott M. Stevens, P. Stewart, F. L. St. Leger, R. Stultaford, D. Tennant, N. P. Thesen,
A. W. Townshend, Geo. Trill, T. Upington, E. H. Von Witt, Joseph Walker, G. B. Williams,
J. Wilson, G. Lavibond Windsor, M. Woodhead, T. J. Woodhead, J. Wyllie, R. O. Wynne-Roberts,
J. A. Yallop.

Among the number were many men of independent means who were contented
to fill any place assigned to them, to take their share of duty as
mere privates, and go through the same drudgery of drill as the ordinary raw
recruit.

In February 1901 it was computed that 11,000 South African irregulars
had been raised during the foregoing three months, and that of these Cape
Town itself had contributed 5000, but finally, when, owing to the extension of
the area of rebellion and the invasion of the Boers, a large augmentation of[Pg 176]
the defence force became necessary, further assistance was cheerfully given,
the number of District Mounted troops and Town Guards amounting in a short
time to over 18,000 men. This number out of a male (white) population of
114,000 speaks for itself.

It is impossible in a few lines to do justice to all the 18,000 members of this
remarkable Colonial army, this goodly band of loyalists, English and Dutch,
who stood at attention, ready, every man of them, to shed his heart&#8217;s blood in
the defence of his home and the maintenance of the prestige of the Empire.
Noble work was done by them in various districts, work sometimes of the quiet
and unostentatious kind that looks for and meets with no reward. But for these
men various small towns in different parts of the Colony must have fallen into
the enemy&#8217;s hands, and have made stepping-stones to still further conquest:
but for them the country might have become chaos&mdash;looting and ruin would
have spread wider and wider afield&mdash;but for them the idea of driving the
British into the sea might have been more than an empty boast. They helped
to turn the scale at a critical moment&mdash;the weight of their unanimous loyalty
proved to the Boers the vanity of their dream!

British supremacy has been well maintained. The period of warfare
is nearing an end, and all are thankful that a policy of generosity will be
extended to the Boers. But there is an old proverb which advises us to &#8220;be
just before we are generous,&#8221; and it is hoped that in the coming by-and-by
the great debt that the Empire owes her Cape loyalists may not only be ever
remembered but adequately rewarded.

THE SOLDIERS&#8217; CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

The work done by the Soldiers&#8217; Christian Association in South Africa has
been so incessant and far-reaching that it deserves special recognition. In no
previous war has so much interest and sympathy been manifested in its multifarious
operations, and it is difficult to define exactly how far the ramifications of
this commendable undertaking extended. Innumerable War Funds, Comforts&#8217;
Committees, Soldiers&#8217; Work Committees, Soldiers&#8217; Home Committees, and
various bodies of a similar nature were organised and set to work with the best
results, whilst officers and men were united in their praise and gratitude for
the splendid efforts which were made in order to ameliorate their lot in the
field, in camp, and in hospital.

The Soldiers&#8217; Christian Association&mdash;the Military Department of the Young
Men&#8217;s Christian Association&mdash;was one of the first organisations in the field, and
on the 9th of November 1899 the following notice appeared in &#8220;Orders&#8221;:&mdash;

Lines of Communications.

Notice.

Permission has been given to the Soldiers&#8217; Christian Association to send
out tents and writing materials for the troops.

Facilities are to be accorded to the Association to put up tents at fixed
stations as far as military requirement will permit.

The Castle, Cape Town,

November 9, 1899.

About the middle of December 1899 a fully-equipped and specially-qualified
band of eight workers was sent to South Africa from the head office in London,[Pg 177]
Mr. A. H. Wheeler (who has since died) being in charge, and during the
campaign thirty workers were employed on the staff of the Association, many
of these signing on in South Africa.



A DUTCH VILLAGE NEAR EDENBURG.

From &#8220;War Impressions&#8221; by Mortimer Menpes, by arrangement with Messrs A. &amp; C. Black.


As far as was possible and practicable, workers were attached to the main
columns, having with them large green canvas marquees, each capable of
seating 250 men. In the daytime the marquees were utilised for reading,
correspondence, and recreative purposes, and in the evening gospel meetings
were conducted by the representatives of the Association, many of the soldiers
taking an active part in the proceedings. Reading matter and stationery, and
goods of that nature, were at all times freely supplied to the troops, it being an
object of the Association to grant everything to the men free of cost. In
addition to the eight marquees in the country, there were also four wood and
iron buildings, with a seating capacity for 300 men. These were placed at fixed
camps along the lines of communication. The building at the Woodstock
Hospital Camp proved of immense benefit to the multitudes of invalided troops
at that large and well-known military depot.

During the campaign several thousands of pounds sterling were contributed
towards the work, whilst the Soldiers&#8217; Christian Association was directly
represented at the following camps:&mdash;Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Orange River,
Enslin, Kimberley, Dronfield, Sterkstroom, Dordrecht, Arundel, Boshof,
Hoopstad, Bloemfontein, Kroonstad, Pretoria, Eerste Fabriken, Estcourt,
Frere, Dewdrop, Ladysmith, Elandslaagte, Ingagane, and Newcastle, where
active operations were carried on by the staff of thirty workers. The main
base of operations was Cape Town, whence supplies to the numerous representatives
were despatched all over South Africa by the officials at headquarters,
supplies being sent from the London office at Exeter Hall at
regular intervals to the Cape Town depot, and thus throughout the many
months of the Association&#8217;s work in the field every camp where the work
has been conducted was kept fully supplied with goods for the troops.
Gratifying expressions of appreciation were received from several of the
Generals and many of the officers regarding the good work of the Association,
while the men were at all times profoundly grateful for all the pains expended
for their comfort and welfare by Mr. W. Gordon Sprigg and his devoted
colleagues.

Before leaving South Africa for England, the Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal
Earl Roberts, sent the following letter to Mr. Will Gordon Sprigg,
F.R.G.S., General Secretary of the Cape Town Young Men&#8217;s Christian
Association, and Honorary Secretary in South Africa of the Soldiers&#8217; Christian
Association, expressive of his lordship&#8217;s interest in, and appreciation of, the
work:&mdash;

&#8220;Cape Town, 11th December 1900.

&#8220;I am desired by Field-Marshal Lord Roberts to assure you of his lordship&#8217;s
high appreciation of the good work done by the Soldiers&#8217; Christian Association
in South Africa. Lord Roberts has watched your work with much
interest, and feels sure that the success which has attended your efforts in the
past will continue in the future.

&#8220;His lordship wishes me to ask you to tender to all the members of your
staff and co-workers his best thanks for their excellent services, and, in leaving
South Africa to-day, he wishes you all good-bye and God-speed.

(Signed) &#8220;W. V. Cowan, Lieut.-Colonel,
Military Secretary.&#8221;

CHAPTER XVI

THE NEW YEAR&mdash;JANUARY 1902

TRANSVAAL (EAST)

The troops of General Botha, weakened and disintegrated, still continued
a species of opposition which was met by the persistent
activity of the British commanders. The blockhouse system developed,
enclosing vast areas which were first carefully swept by the
British troops, and subsequently occupied by a network of Constabulary
Posts. With the continued extension of the blockhouse
lines, the strain of night duty, and the arduous labours of constructing fences,
trenches, and ramparts, fell heavily on the lessening garrisons of individual
blockhouses. Yet these overworked, fatigued troops never failed to respond
with spirit and cheerfulness to every fresh call made upon them.

General B. Hamilton, after the capture of General Erasmus, returned to
Ermelo. Knowing that a Boer laager was located in his vicinity, he directed
Colonel Wing to make a night raid upon Witbank, some twenty-two miles to north-west
of him. Simultaneously Colonel Mackenzie arranged a descent on the
same objective from the neighbourhood of Carolina&mdash;a co-operative movement
which acted splendidly and resulted in the capture of 42 prisoners, including
Major Wolmarans, Captain Wolmarans, and Lieutenant Malan (all of the
Staats Artillery), together with ammunition and camp equipment. Not completely
satisfied with the haul, and suspecting that the Boers, scattered for the
nonce, would return to their old haunt, General Hamilton, with great wiliness,
planned a second night raid in the same locality. His surmises proved correct.
The stragglers had returned, but, luckily for them, their outlying pickets gave
the alarm in time, and enabled them to escape in hot haste. They secured a
fair start, and though a spirited chase after flying burghers was carried on for
seven miles, some of them managed to get off. Others were ridden down, and
32 prisoners were secured. Mules, cattle, and vehicles swelled the bag. On
the 18th General Hamilton made a third night expedition in deplorable weather
and over atrocious ground, and captured 27 prisoners. And yet another dash
(on the 24th) from Ermelo towards Boschmansfontein put him in possession
of twelve more of the enemy. The greatest triumph was achieved on the 26th,
Colonel Wools-Sampson and his Intelligence Staff being mainly instrumental
in procuring the success of the affair. Picked men and horses were drawn from
the columns under General Spens, Colonels Allenby, Mackenzie, and Stewart.
These, in ignorance till the last moment of the nature of their mission, were
suddenly directed on Tafel Kop (ten miles north-west of Ermelo). It was now
found that the Boer tracks forked in two, and therefore the force divided.
General B. Hamilton&#8217;s party proceeded one way in the pouring rain, and sure
enough found a huge laager at Nelspan. This they charged grandly, and in a
few moments a swarm of Boers fled through the tempest, followed for miles by
the troops with ardour little damped by the nature of the weather. The other
way was taken by a party under Major Pratt (Durham Light Infantry), who drove[Pg 179]
the Boers towards the Ermelo-Standerton line of blockhouses, where the luckless
Dutchmen were forced to surrender. Other bands were also run to earth, and
in all 82 prisoners&mdash;among them Field-Cornet de Villiers, Corporal de Jager
(Staats Artillery), and Mr. de Jager, formerly of the First Volksraad&mdash;were the
reward of this brilliant enterprise. General Hamilton by these dashing exploits
(during the last his troops covered fifty-two miles in twenty-four hours) had
considerably unnerved the enemy, who now, both by night and by day, lived on
tenter-hooks, and consequently evaded as much as possible all contact with the
British troops. In his operations the General was materially assisted by the
activities of the columns under General Plumer, Colonels Pulteney and Colville,
who effectually barred all exits to the south, and kept the enemy within range
of General B. Hamilton&#8217;s schemes. General Plumer scored on the 25th.
Then, 24 prisoners were hemmed in and taken in the kloofs between Spitz
Kop and Castrols Nek. Colonel Fry (West Yorkshire Regiment) seized thirty
more straggling burghers who had run their heads against the Piet Retief-Wakkerstroom
blockhouse line. Colonel Mackenzie was meanwhile guarding
the northern avenues of escape leading across the Delagoa Railway in order to
frustrate plans for a junction between Botha and Viljoen, but the last ruffian
remained north of the railway at a farm between Boschoek and Kruger&#8217;s Post,
where, on the 25th, he was cleverly captured by a detachment of the Royal
Irish under Major Orr. Thus the enemy lost one of his most prominent and
trusted leaders, one who nursed a supreme hatred for the British. The
weather continued deplorable&mdash;fogs, mist, and incessant rain baulked the best
enterprises of the troops&mdash;but on the 21st 300 Boers were encountered by
Colonels Park and Urmston, and in spite of the elements some captures were
made. On the 24th, near Houtenbek, another guerilla gang, with whom the
Boer Government was said to be, was encountered. But this will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
disappeared at the first shot into the broken country north of Roosenekal.
January closed with the departure from Lydenburg of Colonel Urmston, who
escorted General B. Viljoen and other prisoners to the railway at Machadodorp.

Early in February, east of Springs, the columns under General G. Hamilton
and Colonel Wing made an important haul. The Boers had broken back
to the west of the constabulary posts, and clung tenaciously to their ground&mdash;most
probably in fear of facing, in their efforts to escape, the fire-swept region
of the blockhouse lines. They were exceedingly wary, and the reward of very
hard labour on the part of the British columns was meagre until the 3rd February,
when, at Grootpan, 31 burghers with their transport were captured,
and 3 killed.

TRANSVAAL (NORTH)

Operations here were handicapped by horse sickness. Colonel Colenbrander,
having moved to the south, gave General Beyers the leisure to conceive
a neat little plan for an attack on Pietersburg, and the simultaneous
removal of such peaceably-minded burghers as occupied the refuge camp there.
The attack on the town began at 4.20 A.M. on the 24th January, and continued
hotly for some twenty minutes, after which Beyers was repulsed with the loss
of three of his band, while three others lay dangerously wounded within 300
yards of the defence. The Dutchman succeeded under cover of darkness,
however, in getting away a certain number of &#8220;neutral&#8221; burghers, who
doubtless were acting in collusion with him. In the engagement the Volunteer
Town Guard, who had turned out to the assistance of the troops, displayed[Pg 180]
grit and steadiness of a remarkable order. His attack having failed, Beyers
retired to the south-east, but some eleven of his band were caught on the 6th
of February by Major Vallancey and a small force, hunting from Pietersburg.

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Colonel Colenbrander was now assisting (with Lord Methuen and Colonel
Hickie) in the clearance of the western regions. Of Lord Methuen&#8217;s raids and
repeated successes it would be tedious to write, though each was carried out
at the risk of life and limb, and with consummate dash and endurance. On
the 16th of January a Free State laager, with twenty-four burghers, and
mules, horses, carts, cattle, and waggons, was captured on the way from
Vryburg to Lichtenburg. Near here, while a detachment of Yeomanry were
reconnoitring, the Boers got their revenge. Celliers, with 200 men, pounced on
the small British party, who, though they fought bravely, had 40 of their number
captured: 8 were killed and 5 wounded. On the 30th, after a brisk engagement,
Celliers was sent flying to the west by Lord Methuen, who returned
to Klerksdorp on the 1st of February. His troops after a rest proceeded,
under Colonel Von Donop, towards Wolmaranstad. On the way they effected
the capture of 36 prisoners, 49 horses, 25 waggons, and 15 Cape carts by
means of a neatly-contrived surprise for Potgieter, who narrowly escaped falling
into their hands. By night they surrounded his laager, which was found
at Rhenoster Spruit, and also an adjacent farm, and at dawn on the 8th came
into possession of the prizes already enumerated.

Colonel Kekewich spent his time in night raids of the same nature, some
profitable, some disappointing. Boers were growing scarce as a natural
consequence of the effective operations for netting them. In February a
smart expedition was arranged for the capture of Delarey, which failed in
its main object, but was yet highly successful in other ways. Starting from
Leeuwfontein on the 4th of February, Major Leader, with mounted men (from
Kekewich&#8217;s and Hickie&#8217;s columns), proceeded north by night, taking a circuitous
route towards Roodepan (fifteen miles north-east of Lichtenburg), where Delarey
was reported to be. After the capture of a Boer piquet, he learnt that the
Dutch general had moved his camp, but the laager of Commandant Sarel Albert
was in the vicinity. A bird in the hand being worth two in the bush, this
laager was surrounded just before daybreak. With a rush and a roar the
Scottish Horse dashed on the Dutchmen, causing a scene of dire tumult, which
was enhanced by the stampeding of the Boer horses, who had become alarmed
at the fire of the British pom-pom. Brilliantly the attacking force, inspired by
the gallant major and his spirited subalterns, Lawless, Selby, and Wallace,
fought for their prize, and in the end they had the satisfaction of securing
Sarel himself, with his adjutant, Landdrost Potgieter, Field-Cornets Jan du
Plessis and Jan du Toit, two assistant Field-Cornets, and ten corporals. They
took in all 132 prisoners (11 wounded), 130 rifles, 2800 rounds of ammunition,
with horses, mules, and cattle in great number. Unhappily the gallant Scottish
Horse paid for its triumph. Two officers and six men were wounded.

ORANGE RIVER COLONY

General Elliot and his troops spent the early part of the new year in chases
around Reitz after De Wet, but that skilful personage smartly evaded them.
In spite of all efforts it was impossible to wedge him against either the Drakens[Pg 181]berg
or the Harrismith-Bethlehem blockhouses. Colonel de Lisle, at Kaffir
Kop, to the west of Lindley and Bethlehem, kept an eye on Prinsloo, who
threatened the safety of the blockhouses in course of construction. Colonel
Byng&#8217;s force was constantly engaged with parties of the enemy between
Lindley and Reitz, while Colonel Rimington operated in the country south
of Frankfort. (At Groothoop, on the 31st of January, he performed useful
work by capturing a convoy and twenty-two prisoners, with their &#8220;effects.&#8221;)
Colonel Dawkins, with his own column and two regiments of Imperial Light
Horse, joined Colonel Rawlinson (who had moved from Standerton after De
Wet), and marched south on the left of Colonel Rimington&#8217;s line of advance.
On the 29th Colonel Rawlinson, with a portion of his force, doubled back from
near Kaffirstad to Achalia (near the junction of Cornelis and Wilge Rivers),
and at dawn on the 30th pounced on one of Mamie Botha&#8217;s laagers. This night
march and raid was a feat of remarkable endurance and dash, for the fighting
force in the previous thirty-four hours had marched sixty-seven miles, the
2nd Battalion Mounted Infantry doing eighty-two miles in the same interval
of time! The captures amounted to 11 prisoners, 120 horses, 2900 cattle,
20 waggons, and 25 carts.

A BIG TRAP FOR DE WET

Meanwhile wheels within wheels of the military machine were revolving, and
preparing a carefully arranged plan for the enclosing of De Wet should he, on
approach of the columns, which were pressing him towards the Harrismith
blockhouses, endeavour to break back to the west. Troops were quietly
being passed to east and south-east of him in readiness for a general sweep
to the west. It was hoped by the maintenance of perpetual close contact,
with patrols and outposts along the whole front of the British line, to drive the
smart Dutchman into the strongly held angle formed by the Wolvehoek-Kroonstad
railway and the Wolvehoek-Heilbron-Frankfort blockhouse line. De Wet,
as was expected, did break back. He ran within the cordon. He appeared
to be doomed. He was first promptly pursued on the night of the 2nd of
February by Colonel Byng, who on Liebenberg&#8217;s Vlei (west of Reitz) had lain in
waiting for him. Quickly flew the British troops in pursuit, and some fifteen
miles to the east they came upon a convoy of De Wet&#8217;s commando. The New
Zealand and Queensland Imperial Bushmen brilliantly dashed into the rearguard,
while the South African Light Horse as gallantly charged the centre, and
with complete success. Such of the enemy as escaped tore off westwards, but
twenty-six prisoners (among them Captain Muller, O.F.S. Artillery, Captain
Villiers, and Field-Cornet Wessels, who was mortally wounded) fell into our
hands. Many vehicles, cattle, horses, and mules were secured, and also a 15-pounder
gun and two pom-poms. Nine Boers were killed and eight wounded in
this brilliant engagement, which was a tug-of-war creditable to the stamina of
both parties. De Wet himself had yet to be dealt with. Now began the working
of the great plan for his capture. By the 5th of February our columns formed a
continuous line of men (a movable chain of outposts in fact) extending along the
west bank of Leibenberg&#8217;s Vlei from Frankfort as far south as Fanny&#8217;s Home
and thence to Kaffir Kop (west of Lindley). Rawlinson&#8217;s men on the right were
flanked along the Frankfort-Heilbron blockhouse line by the troops under
Wilson (Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts) and Keir (Royal Artillery), and thence, in
order from right to left, came columns under Rimington, De Lisle, and Major
Fanshawe. From the south, Marshall and Holmes (detached from Colonel[Pg 182]
Knox&#8217;s command) moved up to the Lindley-Kroonstad line, gradually connecting
General Elliot&#8217;s left with the Kroonstad railway line. This, from Kroonstad to
Wolvehoek, had been specially strengthened for the occasion. In addition to
the normal garrisons, the 2nd Battalion Seaforths were distributed along the line.
Four armoured trains were also in readiness. The Wolvehoek-Heilbron branch
line had, moreover, been reinforced by the 2nd Battalion Leinster Regiment
and three armoured trains. At Wolvehoek itself General Cunningham held
the 28th Mounted Infantry in readiness to pursue such marauders as might be
driven across the railway!

Here was a gigantic chain&mdash;every link firmly united to its fellow! On the 6th
it began to move west. By night a British line was held from Holland, on the
Heilbron-Frankfort blockhouse line, to Doornkloop, on the Kroonstad-Lindley
line. This gigantic line was held by entrenched outposts fifty yards apart.
Fires were lit in advance, to give the effect of a double position. Men were
pushed along the flanking blockhouse line to watch for attempts to break
through. Nothing could be more complete, and at every post were British
eyes on the alert and British hearts beating with anxiety lest their part in the
programme should be weakly performed.

At daybreak a further general advance was made. The line now reached
the Heilbron-Kroonstad road, the left moving up, joined at America Siding on
to the Kroonstad-Wolvehoek blockhouse line. The last night&#8217;s arrangements
were repeated, and every officer and man in the force remained on outpost
duty. The piquets were constantly attacked, and Boers, struggling to
escape and caught in the toils, caused a perpetual ripple of bullets to break the
stillness of the night. In one case there was a desperate rush at the Heilbron
line of blockhouses, which was bravely repulsed. The Boers lost ten killed and
several wounded. At this time De Wet&mdash;finding himself cornered as it were&mdash;ordered
his men in small parties to make each, independently, his dash for
safety, leaving him and a few others to trust to their native wit for a means of
escape. His well-known sagacity came to his aid. Riding with an immense
herd of cattle, he made for Kroonstad-Lindley blockhouse line. Here, in the
intense darkness, he gathered himself together for a desperate plunge. Racing
full speed in the midst of the herd, he charged the line, breaking the wire
entanglements and simply sweeping every obstacle before him by sheer weight
of the impact! Thus he got away. Three of his followers were killed, and
the mob of horses and cattle that had shielded him was shot&mdash;but his end was
achieved! He had outwitted the British. He was free.

But though his freedom as an individual was maintained, the loss to his
party and the wreck of his hopes were considerable. Two hundred and eighty-five
of his band were either killed, wounded, or prisoners, the last having been
gleaned from among the rushes and reeds in the bed of the Rhenoster, where
they had sought refuge after carefully divesting themselves of compromising
articles of kharki uniform. These were found lying on the banks!

To the west of the railway, Colonel Rochfort spent January and February
in tussling with commandos under Nieuwhoudt and Pretorius. On the 26th
of January, Major Driscoll came in touch with the former leader. He pursued
him to the Boshof road, about eight miles north of the Modder, and in a short,
sharp engagement secured seventeen prisoners (including Field-Cornets Venter
and Grobelaar), some waggons, carts, and riding horses. Nieuwhoudt, however,
doubled back and joined Pretorius and 150 burghers, and then prepared
to attack Colonel Du Moulin&#8217;s column, which had been searching for him in the
Jagersfontein region. On the 27th, Du Moulin&#8217;s force was bivouacked on the[Pg 183]
south bank of the Riet, at Abraham&#8217;s Kraal. The Dutchmen crossed the Riet
from the north and rushed the piquet that was holding a kopje, behind which
the camp was sheltered. Once in possession of this commanding point their
success seemed assured. At the first sound of alarm Du Moulin, a brilliant
leader who had done incessant and excellent service, dashed to repel the attack,
and was instantly shot. Many of his men dropped by his side. Major Gilbert
(Sussex Regiment) assuming command, set to work to repulse the enemy, and
by 1.45 A.M. had so effectively reoccupied the defences that a second bold
attempt on the part of the guerillas to carry a position held by one of the
piquets proved a complete failure. But, besides the valiant Colonel, ten of our
men were killed and six wounded in the hardly-fought engagement.

Colonel Sitwell spent January in covering the passage of convoys in the
Kimberley district. This, always a risky undertaking, on the 13th of January
became more exciting than pleasant. De Villiers with 400 rebels held an
entrenched position midway between Campbell and Griquatown, completely
commanding the line of advance. Despite the energy and dash of the 22nd
Battalion Mounted Infantry, who managed to establish themselves within a
comparatively short distance of the defences, the foe was not to be routed.
Finally on the scene came a small detachment of the Munster Fusiliers, and
these, by a well-executed bayonet charge, carried the position. The engagement
cost us 1 officer and 5 men killed, and 6 men wounded. The Boer loss
was great, but they succeeded in removing their wounded, leaving 50 dead
horses and 18 live ones behind them.

CAPE COLONY

The operations of the raiders were gradually becoming confined to the
comparatively waterless and inaccessible districts where, though politically less
menacing, they were, in matters of transport and supply, decidedly obnoxious.
The columns at this time were chiefly employed in covering the Lambert&#8217;s Bay-Victoria
Road blockhouse line, and in escorting convoys to supply depots now
being established at Calvinia, Williston, Fraserburg, and Carnarvon.

CHAPTER XVII

THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1902

TRANSVAAL (EAST)

General B. Hamilton&#8217;s three months&#8217; effective efforts
resulted in the departure of Botha, and the complete clearance
of the enemy from the district. It was now impossible to
locate bodies of Boers in any part of that region. Rumour
said that Botha had betaken himself to Vryheid to seek rest
and change of scene for himself and his hunted horde. So, on
his track went the British sleuth-hounds. The movement began on the 25th,
and early in March they located their man in the neighbourhood of Vryheid.

Meanwhile General Plumer, Colonel Pulteney, and Colonel Wing, in the
angle formed by the upper waters of the Vaal River and the Standerton-Volksrust
Railway, gleaned remnants from Botha&#8217;s sheaf of Boers, Plumer&#8217;s
Queenslanders bringing in twelve, and Wing&#8217;s men eight. General Gilbert
Hamilton, during his operations east of Springs, was sharply attacked on the
18th of February, and a lamentable incident occurred. Boers, estimated to
number 500, had been hanging around Klippan (twenty miles S.E. of Springs),
seeking an opportunity to take vengeance. A portion of the Scots Greys,
detached to one flank, was cut off, surrounded, and partially captured. They
made a gallant fight for it, during which Major Feilden and Captain Ussher
were mortally wounded, while Lieutenant Rhodes and two men were killed,
and six men wounded. The Boers lost eight killed, and Commandant Van
Niekerk was shot in the knee.

After this sorry affair General Gilbert Hamilton was joined by the 28th
Mounted Infantry, and from Springs he proceeded to hunt down the commando
which had caused the trouble.

To make up for the mishap two successes were reported during the operations
of General Fetherstonhaugh north of the Delagoa line. On the 20th
February Colonel Park&#8217;s column with 300 National Scouts, after a tedious
night march, swooped down on two laagers at Nooitgedacht and Grootrievlei.
Among the prisoners taken&mdash;164 in all&mdash;were Field-Cornets Du Toit, G.
Joubert, H. de Jager, Lieutenant A. J. Vilgoen. Hinton and Trichardt, two
pernicious guerillas, succeeded in escaping. But there was a goodly haul of
horses, waggons, mules, cattle, &amp;c.

Colonel E. Williams&#8217; men on the southern slopes of the Bothaberg secured
some more prisoners, and on the 21st they surprised a laager at Buffelskloof
and captured twenty more.



MISHAP TO THE SCOTS GREYS AT KLIPPAN, FEBRUARY 18, 1902

Drawing by H. W. Koekkoek


A co-operative movement was now organised for the purpose of making
a descent on Langkloof (near the junction of the Olifant and Wilge Rivers),
where the Boer Government was shortly expected to arrive, but owing to the
nature of the rocky and intersected country, the arrangements were impeded.
The said Government, by the time the troops surrounded the place, had got
some hours&#8217; start and were well on their way to Pietersburg. Colonel Park,[Pg 185]
who was unavoidably prevented from reaching his assigned position in time,
proceeded to investigate the kloofs on the western side of Rhenoster Kop, and
unearthed seventeen prisoners and many oxen, horses, and vehicles.

TRANSVAAL (WEST)

Operations continued in February as before, save that Colonel Von Donop
at Wolmaranstad had succeeded temporarily to the command of Lord Methuen&#8217;s
mobile troops. On the 23rd an empty convoy of over one hundred waggons
was despatched to refill at Klerksdorp and bring back supplies to Wolmaranstad.
The escort was composed of 5th Imperial Yeomanry, three companies
1st Northumberland Fusiliers, two guns and a pom-pom, under Colonel W. C.
Anderson (Imperial Yeomanry). Till the 25th all went well. Then, before
dawn, as the convoy was moving from its bivouac ground ten miles south-east
of Klerksdorp, a furious attack was made on the advance guard from the
darkness of dense bush on the left. Flashes and forks of flame only showed
where the enemy plied his rifles, but on this point the guns and pom-pom at
once opened fire. The waggons of the convoy, which had stampeded back to
the old camping-ground in the midst of the first shock of attack, were again
closed up as rapidly as possible from the rear. A second and a third attack
upon the rearguard were boldly and indeed brilliantly repulsed. Then Colonel
Anderson, fearing the increased pressure on his rearguard, ordered the convoy
to proceed towards Klerksdorp, instructing his transport officer to try and trot
the waggons clear of the fire. He then made noble efforts to extricate his force,
supporting the hard pressed rearguard, as it struggled to cover the retirement,
with his guns and such troops as could be collected from the front. But without
avail. The enemy under Delarey and Kemp, old and accomplished hands,
kept the advantage. They had had the first word in the darkness; they were
superior in numbers; they pressed triumphantly forward and caught the convoy
where they had expected to catch it&mdash;in crossing the Jagd Spruit. The
difficulty of the operation, the terror and stampede of natives and beasts in
the hail of bullets that fell on them, contributed to the disaster. The convoy
was lost. The escort, gallant and stubborn, was overpowered; 5 officers and
53 men fell, 6 officers and 123 men were wounded. The remainder, with the
exception of 3 officers and 106 men, who reached Klerksdorp, were captured.
They were subsequently released. Though the pursuit of the Boers was at
once taken up, little could be done. The empty waggons were burnt, and the
captors had dispersed as rapidly as they had assembled.

In order to intercept, if possible, the captured guns, and prevent Delarey
from moving to the Marico district, Lord Methuen resumed the vigorous
pursuit of him in which he had for sometime previously been engaged. To
this end the column started from Vryburg on the 2nd of March. Colonel
Kekewich was directed to send a column from Wolmaranstad towards
Rooirantjesfontein, there to meet the column under Major Paris (R.M.A.),
from Vryburg, while Colonel Rochefort was directed to cross the Vaal from
Orange River Colony and drive Delarey towards the columns heading for
Rooirantjesfontein.



LORD METHUEN RALLYING HIS BROKEN FORCES AT TWEEBOSCH

Drawing by C. M. Sheldon


The movement seemed excellently planned, and every precaution to avert
surprise taken, but nevertheless Delarey and Kemp made an overwhelming
and successful attack on Lord Methuen, with the result that this commander,
who has worked with indefatigable zeal throughout the war, was dangerously
wounded and taken prisoner. Since the details of this unfortunate affair have[Pg 186]
not yet been fully sifted, it is best to satisfy ourselves with reading Lord
Methuen&#8217;s own report of the events connected with the Tweebosch disaster:&mdash;

From Lieutenant-General Lord Methuen to the Chief of Staff.

&#8220;Klerksdorp, 13th March 1902.

&#8220;Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you that, with the object of preventing the force
under General Delarey from moving northwards to the Marico district through the gap
between Lichtenburg and Mafeking, I sent orders to Colonel Kekewich, C.B., at Wolmaranstad,
to send a column towards Rooirantjesfontein, where he would meet a column under
Major Paris, Royal Marine Artillery, from Vryburg.

I, at the same time, directed Colonel Rochefort to cross the Vaal from Orange River
Colony, and to move northwards by the Bamboo Spruit, or the Harts River, and thus drive
General Delarey towards the columns which were heading for Rooirantjesfontein.

2. Colonel Kekewich informed me, on the 2nd March, that he was sending a column,
consisting of 1600 mounted men, lightly equipped; while Colonel Rochefort wired that the
command would contain about 1000 mounted men.

3. The column, under Major Paris, which I accompanied, consisted of the following
units:&mdash;5th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry, 184 men, under Captain Jennings; Cape Police
(including Special Police), 233 men, under Major Berangé; Cullinan&#8217;s Horse, 64 men, under
Captain Cullinan; British South African Police, 24 men, attached to Cullinan&#8217;s Horse;
4th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, one section, under Lieutenant Venning, D.S.O.; one
pom-pom &#8216;GG&#8217; Section, under Captain Geoghegan, Royal Field Artillery. These
units did not belong to Major Paris&#8217;s column, but were an addition, placed under his
command.

Major Paris&#8217;s column before the fresh units were placed under his command at
Vryburg:&mdash;86th Company Imperial Yeomanry, 110 men; Diamond Fields Horse, 92 men;
Dennison&#8217;s Scouts, 58 men, under Captain Browne; Ashburner&#8217;s Light Horse, 126 men,
under Captain Ashburner; 38th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, one section, under Lieutenant
Nesham; one pom-pom, &#8216;D&#8217; Field Artillery; 1st Battalion Northumberland
Fusiliers, 200 men, under Captain Montagu; 1st Battalion Royal North Lancashire
Regiment, 100 men, under Lieutenant Paul. The infantry were attached to the columns at
Vryburg.

4. My written instructions to Major Paris were that I should give him daily the
direction of the march, and the time of starting for the following day; in case of any
fighting, that he should look after the mounted brigade, and that I would stand by the
guns and infantry, and give him general instructions.

The mounted troops were the best horsed force that I have yet had under me, added to
which the Cape Police, under Major Berangé, held an exceptionally high reputation, as did
also the local corps. I remarked to Major Paris, on leaving Vryburg, that I could not
believe in the numbers given to me. He again made inquiries, and satisfied himself that
the numbers were correct.

5. I informed Colonel Kekewich, by wire, that I should reach Rooirantjesfontein on
7th March.

6. 2nd March.&mdash;The column under Major Paris left Vryburg at 5 A.M.; the Supply
column consisting of 39 ox waggons, and the baggage of 46 mule waggons; owing to
heavy rains which had fallen during the night the last waggon did not reach O&#8217;Reiley&#8217;s
Pan, a distance of thirteen miles, till 5 P.M. I therefore at once sent a message to
Colonel Kekewich to inform him that I should be one or perhaps two days late at
Rooirantjesfontein. I had previously informed him that the position of the enemy had
rendered it necessary for Major Paris&#8217;s column to bear more to the north-west towards
Polfontein (254).

7. 3rd March.&mdash;Owing to the animals being exhausted by the previous day&#8217;s trek, the
column was only able to reach Grootpan (Bestersfarm), a distance of six miles. During
the march the Police, forming the advance guard under Major Berangé, killed three local
rebel Boers, by name Steyn, Bester, and &#8216;Janson.&#8217;

8. 4th March.&mdash;At Grootpan I heard that large droves of cattle and Van Zyl&#8217;s (rebel)
commando had moved eastwards towards Doornbult (197). That morning Major Paris&#8217;s
column marched to Graspan, two miles beyond Mooiplatz (244 B), a distance of thirteen
miles, where there was plenty of water. As there had been no rain in these parts it was
very doubtful whether, if I trekked by Klipdrift (188), as I had told Colonel Kekewich I
intended to do, I should find water at Vaalkop (183), or Rietvlei (279).[Pg 187]

9. 5th March.&mdash;I therefore moved to Boschpan (68) in the morning, which I found all
but dry, and in the afternoon to Barberspan, a distance of twenty-one miles, where there
was plenty of water. Here I was informed that there had been rain at Leeuwkuil (95), and
that there certainly was water at Leeuwkuil (23).

10. 6th March.&mdash;The column moved off at 5 A.M., the ox convoy having moved at 4 A.M.
The whole force reached Leeuwspruit (232) about 7.30 A.M. Here I sent on a detachment
of Cape Police to Leeuwkuil (95) to make certain of the existence of water.

There had been some sniping at the rearguard by about 100 of Van Zyl&#8217;s commando,
and seeing some confusion, I went back myself, sending at the same time for a section of
the 38th Battery.

I found the men forming the rear screen, which consisted of the 86th Company Imperial
Yeomanry, very much out of hand and lacking both fire discipline and knowledge of how
to act. There seemed to be a want of instructed officers and non-commissioned officers.
Van Zyl&#8217;s commando being accurately shelled by the section Royal Artillery, eventually
retired and moved round our right flank to Tweebosch (247), while the column halted at
Leeuwspruit (232).

On receiving information that there was no water at Leeuwkuil (95), I decided to move
to Tweebosch (247), where Van Zyl&#8217;s commando had taken up a good position in the bed
of the Klein Harts River.

Major Berangé with the Police, the section 4th Battery, and the pom-pom &#8216;GG&#8217;
Section, were ordered to move straight on Tweebosch (247), while Dennison&#8217;s Scouts,
supported by Cullinan&#8217;s Horse, were to move round the enemy&#8217;s left flank.

The commando retired rapidly, the Police under Major Berangé working with the
greatest quickness.

Much praise is due to Major Berangé for the way in which he handled his men.

Our casualties were one killed and two wounded.

As the day was hot, and it was then 11.30 A.M., I decided to remain at Tweebosch
(247).

11. 7th March.&mdash;At 3 A.M. the ox convoy moved off towards Leeuwkuil (23) with an
escort of 1 squadron Cape Police; 86th Company Imperial Yeomanry; 200 men 1st
Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers; 100 men 1st Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment;
1 section 4th Battery Royal Field Artillery; 1 pom-pom &#8216;GG&#8217; Section. The whole
was under command of Captain Montagu, 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers.

The main column moved off at 4 A.M. as follows:&mdash;Advance guard:&mdash;1 squadron Cape
Police; Ashburner&#8217;s Light Horse; 1 pom-pom Diamond Fields Artillery. Main body:&mdash;Cullinan&#8217;s
Horse; British South Africa Police; Detachment 5th Regiment, Imperial
Yeomanry; 1 section 38th Battery, Royal Field Artillery. Rearguard:&mdash;Diamond Fields
Horse; Dennison&#8217;s Scouts.

Thinking there was a likelihood of an attack in rear, I had called Major Paris&#8217;s attention
to the necessity of putting thoroughly reliable troops in the rearguard.

The country through which we passed was flat and without brush.
At daybreak (about 5 A.M.) a heavy fire was opened on the rearguard. The fire was so
intense that the rear screen was at once reinforced by the section of the 38th Battery, and
one pom-pom Diamond Fields Artillery. A portion of Ashburner&#8217;s Light Horse, and the
detachment of the 5th Imperial Yeomanry, were extended on either flank, round which the
enemy seemed intent on galloping.

At this time (5.30 A.M.) the ox convoy was about a mile in front of the baggage, which
was moving in four lines well closed up. I therefore ordered the ox convoy to halt, and the
baggage to join it. Major Berangé was directed to move, with the police that were with
him, towards a fresh body of the enemy, who now appeared on our right rear. The time
was about 6 A.M.

I joined the ox convoy about this time, and found Captain Tilney, D.A.A.G., assisting
Captain Montagu, 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers, Commanding the Infantry, to
extend the men to meet the attack on our right flank.

The section 4th Battery Royal Field Artillery and the pom-pom &#8216;GG&#8217; Section had
already taken up a position to meet this attack.

I could see no mounted men available, and could only assume that they had all gone to
reinforce the rear screen, so I ordered the baggage to continue to advance, it being
impossible to move the ox convoy, as the native drivers were lying under the waggons and
refused to move.

I would here like to draw attention to the orderly manner and complete control exercised
by Lieutenant Hartley, Transport Officer to Major Paris&#8217;s column, over the mule
waggons during the fight.

The Boers, attacking the rearguard, had come on with great determination right[Pg 188]
amongst the rear screen, but the support to the screen having been reinforced by Ashburner&#8217;s
Light Horse, Cullinan&#8217;s Horse, and some of the 5th Imperial Yeomanry, held them in check
till about 6.30 A.M. A heavy attack then developed on our rear and right flank, which
caused, as far as I could see, all mounted troops then in rear (some of them which had
originally been there had moved off towards the flanks to meet threatened attacks) to
break, and they galloped in complete confusion past our left flank. The section 38th
Battery was thus left unprotected, but continued in action until every man, with the exception
of Lieutenant Nesham, was hit. I am informed that this officer was called upon to
surrender, and on refusing to do so was killed.

The attack on our right flank was pressed home to within six hundred yards of the gun
of the 4th Battery.

I then gave orders for a kraal about one mile along the road to Leeuwkuil to be occupied,
and sent orders to rally the mounted men on the rising ground beyond the kraal. The
kraal was occupied by Major Paris and Major Berangé with some forty men. The mounted
troops in the meantime continued their retirement. I remained with the guns, 4th Battery,
and Infantry until my horse was killed, and my thigh fractured by a bullet.

They held out in a most splendid manner until about 9.30 A.M., when all the men round
the guns had been shot down and Lieutenant Venning, commanding the section, had been
killed. In the meantime the two guns and a pom-pom with Commandant Cellier&#8217;s commando
had rendered the kraal untenable, when the men at the kraal and those remaining
with the baggage surrendered.

The Boer Commandants present were&mdash;Delarey, Vermaas, Cellier, Kemp, Van Zyl,
D. Botha, and Lemmer. It is difficult to estimate the number of Boers on the field, but I
should say about 1500. General Delarey treated myself and the prisoners with the greatest
kindness, and left General Cellier to look after our wounded on the ground; they buried
eleven of their own men at Kareelaagte, and, from what I can learn, their losses were heavy.

I beg to draw attention to the good work done by Major Paris in endeavouring to keep
the mounted troops in hand, and to the promptitude with which Captain Tilney, 17th
Lancers, D.A.A.G., assisted in placing the Infantry round the convoy.

I would also call attention to the gallant manner in which Lieutenants Nesham and
Venning, Royal Field Artillery, stuck to their guns.

Captain Montagu, commanding detachment 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers,
and Lieutenant Paul, commanding detachment 1st Battalion Loyal North Lancashire
Regiment, held on until further resistance was impossible. Civil Surgeon Prentice, with the
rearguard, and Captain Thurston, Royal Army Medical Corps, with the guns, continued
bandaging the wounded throughout the engagement.

Colonel Townsend, C.B., my Principal Medical Officer, remained in the fighting line
until he had received three wounds; he has, from the commencement of the campaign,
always acted most gallantly.

Captain Fernyhough did good work with the rearguard during the action. He has
been of very great value to me ever since he has served under me.

A large number of the Boers were dressed in khaki, many of them wearing the chevrons
of non-commissioned officers. This, in several instances, led to misapprehension by our
troops, and to losses by death, wounds, and capture among us. Owing to having been
wounded and taken prisoner, I am unable to give any list of casualties. This report is, for
the same reason, based solely on what came under my own observation and what I have
been able to gather from the few officers with whom I have had the opportunity of speaking
on the subject.&#8221;

Lord Methuen concluded by saying that should he have omitted to bring to
notice some who had distinguished themselves during the action Major Paris
would supply the deficiency.

Of the General&#8217;s staff of six, five were wounded. Lieutenants Venning
and Nesham, Royal Field Artillery, were killed while gallantly serving
their guns with case. Lieutenant Hartley, Steinacker&#8217;s Horse, also lost
his life. Among the wounded were Colonel Wilson, 3rd York and Lancashire
Regiment, Captain Outram, 3rd Highland Light Infantry, Lieutenant Dennis,
Yeomanry, Lieutenant Nash, Cape Police, and Lieutenant Logan, Yeomanry.
Lord Methuen was taken to the Boer laager, but was subsequently allowed
by Delarey to proceed with Colonel Townsend, who was also wounded, to
the hospital at Klerksdorp.



BRILLIANT DEFENCE BY NEW ZEALANDERS AT HOLSPRUIT, FEBRUARY 23, 1902

Drawing by Allan Stewart from Sketches supplied by a New Zealand Officer


[Pg 189]

ORANGE RIVER COLONY&mdash;MAJUBA DAY

After some days&#8217; rest, the troops which had formed the cordon to enclose
De Wet&#8217;s force were engaged in a new and far-reaching scheme of operations.
This was divided into two phases, in the first of which two simultaneous movements
were to be made to the east, one between the Heidelberg-Standerton
Railway and the Wolvehoek-Frankfort-Tafel Kop blockhouse line; the other,
from the line Kroonstad-Ventersburg-Doornberg up to the blockhouses between
Lindley and Bethlehem. For the second phase, it was arranged that
whilst the northern columns, then on a line between Standerton and Tafel
Kop, made a right wheel on to Botha&#8217;s Pass-Tafel Kop blockhouses, with Tafel
Kop as a pivot, the southern columns should move east to the Wilge, and in
conjunction with the troops at Harrismith, hold the line of the Wilge between
Strydpoort and Majoor&#8217;s Drift. Finally, with the line of the Wilge so held
to the west, and the passes of the Drakensberg closed to the enemy from the
east by the troops from the Natal command, the northern line of columns was
to move south from the Tafel Kop-Botha&#8217;s Pass position, right down to the
blockhouses between the Van Reenan&#8217;s Pass and Elands River Bridge, near
Harrismith. These brilliant operations, on the principle of previous &#8220;drives,&#8221;
began about the middle of the month, and culminated on Majuba Day in the
capture of 728 Boers, 25,000 cattle, 2000 horses, 200 waggons, and 50,000
rounds of ammunition. Various efforts were, of course, made to break through
the encircling cordon, but none so violent as that which took place at the last
stage of these proceedings. At dawn on the 23rd a general advance to the
south was made towards the Van Reenan&#8217;s Pass-Elands River Bridge blockhouses.
It was timed to take four days. At night, at the close of the first
day&#8217;s march, another dashing attempt on the same principle as the last was
made by De Wet to escape the net into which he had been driven by the
advancing columns. In darkness, eighteen miles south of Vrede, at the point
where Byng&#8217;s right and Rimington&#8217;s left joined, the noted chief, with his mob
of cattle rapidly driven by natives, attempted his gallant rush. The New
Zealanders of Garratt&#8217;s column, commanded by Major Bauchop, with characteristic
dash, gallantly resisted and repelled the attack made, and the 3rd New
South Wales Mounted Rifles brought heavy fire to bear on the enemy, but De
Wet and Steyn themselves succeeded in breaking through the toils. Still, the
whole of the Boer cattle and vehicles were captured, and thirty-one Boers, while
160 horses were killed at the place where the gallant Colonials made their
notable resistance. Our own casualties were severe, two officers and eighteen
men were killed, five officers and thirty-three wounded, the majority of whom
belonged to the New Zealand contingent. On the 26th Colonel Nixon repulsed
a like attack made upon the line of the Cornelis River, but on the
27th the sweep down to Harrismith closed with the surrender to Colonel Sir
H. Rawlinson of Commandant Truter and 650 men.

Colonel Lawley and Major Du Cane made more captures in the vicinity of
the Doornberg, and Colonel Barker&#8217;s troops groped for Boers in the kloofs and
caves of the western slopes of the Wittebergen. Before the 25th, owing to
Colonel Barker&#8217;s various activities, he collected 30 prisoners, 725 cattle, and
280 horses. The Boers, as may be imagined, began to accept these convincing
proofs that further resistance to the British was little else than suicide.[Pg 190]

THE CAPE COLONY

On the 2nd of February the general disposition of troops in the Cape
Colony stood thus: Those under Crabbe, from Beaufort West, and those
under Capper and Lund, from Sutherland, converging towards Fraserburg,
where a concentration of the enemy had taken place; those under Haig and
under Kavanagh and Wyndham moving from Clanwilliam upon Calvinia; the
intervening space watched by Doran, forty miles north-east of Clanwilliam,
and by Callwell near Sutherland. Crewe&#8217;s Colonial troops occupied both the
Elandsvlei and Sutherland.

On the 30th January Colonel Crabbe&#8217;s column (acting as a screen to a
convoy of donkey waggons which, under its own escort, was some distance
in the rear) was suddenly menaced by a swarm of Boers. Their attitude
and their numbers warned the Colonel to take up a defensive position at
Rietfontein (twenty-five miles east of Fraserburg). That done, he there fought
tenaciously, determined to hold his own till Colonel Capper and Major Lund could
arrive from Sutherland to his support. Foiled in their effort to overpower
Crabbe&#8217;s men, the Boers promptly decided to assail the convoy. This, guarded
by 60 District Mounted Rifles and 100 men of the 4th Battalion West Yorkshire
Regiment, under Major Crofton, was halted on the night of the 4th some
forty miles south-east of Fraserburg. The Boers in great strength rushed
on the British prize. All through the night fighting was fierce and sustained,
and in the end the Boers were triumphant. They secured and destroyed
the waggons. Though Colonel Crabbe promptly rushed to the scene he was
unable to act. The waggons were wrecked, and the assailants too strong
to be handled by his column unaided. He awaited the troops under Colonel
Capper and Major Lund, and with them proceeded to trounce and disperse
the rebels, and hunt them north-east of Fraserburg. The losses during these
engagements were considerable, Major Crofton, another officer, and 11 men
being killed, and 1 officer and 47 men wounded. On the 5th of February
there was a tussle at Calvinia between Theron&#8217;s men and Colonel Haig&#8217;s,
when the Boers were driven north with the loss of two killed and two wounded.
Considerable loss on our side was sustained on the 6th. Colonel Doran, with
100 men, then on the hunt for Gelhenhuis, a rebel leader, was assailed by
the enemy during his return march to Calvinia. In the pitch darkness his
little band had to fight a prolonged rearguard action to cover their withdrawal
over the mountains. This conflict led to the loss of 3 officers and 7 men
killed, 17 men being wounded.

The main body of rebels&mdash;some 600 of them&mdash;heartened by their capture
of the convoy on the night of the 4th, assembled on the 16th thirty miles east-north-east
of Fraserburg, with a view to earning fresh laurels. But their hopes
were nipped in the bud. General French had his eye on them. The congregating
evil must be arrested, and the columns under General Stephenson were
disposed upon a general line from Nelspoort Station, by Beaufort West, to
Rhenosterfontein (fifteen miles north-west of Beaufort West), Colonel Doran
on the right, Colonel Capper and Major Nickalls in the centre, and Colonel
Crabbe and Major Lund on the left. An advance to north-west towards
Williston was begun on the 17th&mdash;but the Boers were shy. No sooner did
they come in contact with our troops than they dispersed. Some were
wounded and some captured on the 18th, among them being Judge Hugo, who
subsequently died of his injuries; but the rest got off. Malan&#8217;s group doubled
round Doran&#8217;s right flank and scuttled over the rail towards the midlands,[Pg 191]
another gang fled north-west, and one J. T. Smith, with a rebel crew, broke
through the blockhouse line, with some loss, to the north and then to the
north-east of Victoria West.

The pursuit of Malan to the east now occupied the column under Major
Wormald and two squadrons of the 9th Lancers. This force had already
chased the remnants of Kruitzinger&#8217;s band, under Wessels, out of the midlands
well to the west. Colonel Haig, with Colonels Kavanagh and Williams,
skirmished and hunted in the Calvinia and Van Rhynsdorp districts, and on
the 13th Bouwer&#8217;s laager was rushed by Kavanagh&#8217;s braves, and eleven
prisoners, with horses, rifles, and ammunition, &amp;c., were secured.

In the midlands the enemy straggled about on the hills for the most part of
the month. The rebels daily found an increasing difficulty in procuring food
and necessaries from their quondam sympathisers, and their diminished popularity
served somewhat to damp their activities; but early in March Fouché
and Myburg made a dash across the East London Railway, whither they were
chased to the south of Steynsburg by Colonels Price and Baillie.

CHAPTER XVIII

THE CLOSE OF HOSTILITIES&mdash;MARCH, APRIL, AND MAY 1902

TRANSVAAL (EAST)

General B. Hamilton, as we know, over mountainous country
followed Botha to the neighbourhood of Vryheid. The Boer
force consisted of a concentration of some 800 men who had
been hustled from other districts of the Eastern Transvaal. A
laager was located east of Vryheid on the 10th of March, and
General Bruce-Hamilton having blocked all exits in the Ngotsi
valley, proceeded to attack it. The man&oelig;uvre was rewarded. General Cherry
Emmett, Botha&#8217;s brother-in-law, and seventeen prisoners were taken, and
Botha merely escaped by concealing himself in a kloof near the spot where his
relative was seized. Eighteen more prisoners, some of importance in the
fighting roll, were secured on the 18th.

On the 1st day of April, near Springs, a laager was suddenly discovered
by a party of Queen&#8217;s Bays and some National Scouts under Colonel
Fanshawe of Colonel Lawley&#8217;s column. Immediately the Boers in great
strength attacked the small British force, and in the close and spirited
fighting, which lasted from dawn till dusk, Major Walker was killed, and
Captains Herron, Ward, and Lieutenant Hill were wounded. As an instance
of the hand-to-hand nature of the combat it may be mentioned that the butt-ends
of rifles as well as the blades of swords came into play. Two squadron
leaders and ten non-commissioned officers and men were killed and five officers
and fifty-nine men were wounded. This concentrated body of the enemy was
commanded by Alberts and Pretorius. Commandant Prinsloo, who was with
them, was wounded. The Boers lost twelve killed and forty wounded.

The middle of the month was spent by General B. Hamilton in sweeping
from Middelburg to Standerton between the blockhouse lines. The hard-worked
columns of Park and Williams and Spens were engaged in the undertaking,
which was, though always hazardous, fatiguing as it was monotonous.
One hundred and forty-five Boers were killed, wounded, or captured in the
course of the operations.

Beyers, a troublesome personage, had betaken himself to a fertile valley in
the region of Pietersburg. He then proceeded to invest Fort Edward, a fortified
post near Louis Trichardt, placing the small garrison of fifty souls in an
unenviable quandary. To their rescue went Colonel Denny (Northamptonshire
Regiment) with some 500 men, but he was so strongly opposed at various
points that he had to fall back on Dwars River without effecting his purpose.
Colonel Colenbrander, hurrying from Klerksdorp however, succeeded. He completely
surprised the enemy on the 29th and effected the relief of the Fort. Then
Beyers himself had to be dealt with, and on the 8th of April Colonel Colenbrander
and his warlike scouts, with the Inniskilling Fusiliers under Colonel
Murray, started to ferret him out and attack him. Through the difficult and
exhausting country, a wilderness of crags and steeps, the troops moved[Pg 193]
carefully, exercising the utmost perseverance and sagacity in stopping up all
poorts or points of exit. They then secured a commanding position&mdash;one
which the Boers had imagined to be inaccessible&mdash;and systematically delivered
the attack. Their determination and dash and dexterity were marvellous. By
night the Boers were driven out of their mountain stronghold, but only with
great loss on both sides. Colonel Murray was seriously, Lieutenant Thompson
slightly, wounded. Lieutenant Lincoln was killed. The enemy&#8217;s loss in killed,
wounded, and prisoners was 106. But Beyers himself escaped. Operations
against him were continued in this region till May with excellent results, for
though the Boer leader was not caught, his following was considerably reduced,
and thus his power to be mischievous crippled.

FINISHING CLEARANCE OF THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY



Captain H. T. Lukin

After the Majuba Day successes the lower part of the Orange Colony
remained clear. Colonels Du Cane and Rimington in the region of Tafel Kop
made some important captures. Among the prisoners were Adjutant Labuschaque
and Viemann. Elsewhere, in the caves of the river bed, a large Boer
supply depot was discovered by Major Ross (Canadian Scouts). A Krupp, a
pom-pom, a Nordenfeldt, ammunition, heliographs, and other valuable supplies
were taken possession of or burnt. Another of Lord Kitchener&#8217;s big drives
took place, the troops and tactics being the same as before. The columns were
encamped in the neighbourhood of Harrismith, and the impression was given
that they would sweep towards the northern blockhouses. De Wet, finding
that Elliot and Rimington pushed him north, consequently flew west round
Elliot, and in the very direction desired. By the night of the 9th there was a
complete line of troops from Lindley to Frankfort, De Wet and Steyn being[Pg 194]
enclosed. Stray parties made rushes at Dunlop&#8217;s and Scott&#8217;s lines but were repulsed,
and some Boers were made prisoners. On the 10th, all keeping touch,
the advance continued. It was scorching weather, but the British stalwarts,
under the blazing sun, maintained splendid courage and cheeriness. As an
example of their endurance, it may be noted that Rawlinson&#8217;s men on the
10th and 11th covered sixty miles. On the 11th the drive concluded, but not
with the capture of the redoubtable one.

De Wet and Steyn, it appeared, had escaped west of the main Orange
Colony Railway by crossing the Heilbron-Frankfort line at night at an hour
when some of the British troops were expected to cross. Mentz, to escape
Colonel Cox and Rimington&#8217;s Australians, adopted the same tactics as
De Wet&#8217;s former ones. He rushed the Heilbron-Wolvehoek line on the night
of the 10th of March by furiously driving a herd of horses against the line held
by the Leinsters near Gothenburg. Though these leaders got off, in the
course of the operations, 127 Boers were taken and Commandant Celliers was
wounded.

De Wet and Steyn remained west of the railway line endeavouring, it was
presumed, to get into communication with Delarey. That some Boers had
evaded the big drive was evident by the fact that a convoy was attacked
between Kronspruit and Frankfort. The enemy was, however, beaten off by
the Mounted Infantry, who had some of their number wounded.

The members of the so-called Acting Transvaal Government&mdash;Messrs.
Schalk Burger, Reitz, Lucas Meyer, Krogh, and Vanderwalt&mdash;proceeded on
the 22nd of March, under flag of truce, from Balmoral to Kroonstad to interview
Mr. Steyn, with Lord Kitchener&#8217;s consent. The interview had reference to
possible peace proposals. The delegates travelled by special train accompanied
by Captain Marker, A.D.C. to Lord Kitchener, Major Leggett, Assistant
Director of Railways, and four other staff officers. The meeting concluded a few
days later, apparently without practical results. The commandos in the district
were now much scattered and reduced, but on the last day of April, near Frankfort,
Colonel Barker had the good fortune to capture Mamie Botha (a smart and
resourceful ally of De Wet), his adjutant, and eleven Boers.

Early in May (the 6th) another rapid drive took place. A continuous line
of columns left Frankfort-Heilbron-Vredefort Road line quite unimpeded by
wheel transport, and drove swiftly to Kroonstad-Liebenberg-Vlei line, which
was reached in the afternoon. The British casualties were nil. The prisoners
taken were 208. Ten Boers were killed. From opinions drawn from
prisoners it was obvious that these &#8220;drives&#8221; were heartily dreaded, and the
fact of being thus chased from their own district was a fruitful source of
surrender.

TRANSVAAL (WEST)&mdash;MARCH

A new and original combined movement against Delarey was now conceived
by Lord Kitchener. The Boers were dotted about recuperating in farms near
Hartebeestefontein, and these had to be mopped up somehow before they had
time to concert or to concentrate. The district was too vast for the usual cordon
process, and there was great difficulty in arranging a plan which would dispose
sufficient troops on the west. There, there were no blockhouse lines, but a
line ran from the Vaal to Klerksdorp and thence up the Schoenspruit till it
joined the Lichtenburg-Ventersdorp line. The programme was most concise.
No wheeled transport and no guns were to be taken. The thing was to be[Pg 195]
accomplished &#8220;in the blink of an eye,&#8221; so to say, at the rate of nearly eighty miles
in twenty-four hours at most. On the night of the 23rd of March every one
was to be under way, silent and secret as burglars, bold and resolute as
lions. Kekewich, from Vaalbank, was to march west. Rawlinson, from Klerksdorp,
with columns of Scott, Briggs, and Dawkins, was to march south of
Hartebeestefontein straight through the enemy&#8217;s lines&mdash;a thing the enemy
would be at a loss till too late to understand&mdash;and arrive at dawn at a point
thirty-nine miles to west. General W. Kitchener (with Keir, Lowe, and
Cookson&#8217;s columns) was to continue the line and march south of Rawlinson
to a point some forty miles distant. Lord Basing, from south of the Vaal, was
to fill in the more southerly place, and Colonel Rochfort was to form up to the
south of him with his right resting on the Vaal. Thus working on the 24th in
a line drawn from north to south, the columns were to start forth and then
drive back the enemy against the Schoenspruit blockhouse line.... The
midnight march was admirably executed under the brilliant rays of the moon,
and a Boer convoy was even chased and captured by Dawkins&#8217; men by
way of interlude! By dawn on the 24th, after a forty-mile march, the
machinery was set in the appointed position. With sunrise the required
revolution took place. The whole force turned right-about face and marched
swiftly back again. It was not till 10 A.M. that Boers were discerned. Then,
preparations were promptly made to welcome them, and Rawlinson&#8217;s men,
in spite of their sore and aching frames, advanced with alacrity. But
the Dutchmen made haste to retreat. By arrangement a signal was fired
to inform the British line that the quarry in force was sighted. Excitement
prevailed. All got into the semi-crescent position&mdash;the military equivalent
for &#8220;open arms.&#8221; There were necessary gaps, however, before the troops
could extend into touch on so vast an area, and these the Boers made for.
But owing to the splendid activity of our men, the 2nd and 8th Mounted
Infantry, the Scottish Horse, and others, the enemy failed to get away
either their waggons or their guns. Lieutenant Herd (2nd Mounted Infantry),
with the remnant of his company, pursued the fleeing band and expedited
their race for the north, forcing them also to leave their valuables behind.
They were now in the position of the traditional Derby dog&mdash;rushing helter-skelter,
first north then south, not knowing where to find a loophole of
escape. Finally, however, some of them abandoning everything did find it,
and scurried towards Klerksdorp. The total results of this cleverly arranged
movement, which concluded on the 25th, were 185 prisoners, 12 Boers
killed; two 15-pounders, one 12-pounder, two pom-poms, a quantity of
ammunition, over 1000 head of cattle, about 60 vehicles, and a lot of horses
and mules captured.

That more of the enemy were not taken was accounted for by Reuter&#8217;s
correspondent, who stated:&mdash;

&#8220;One commando was disturbed very early near a spot where two columns had not yet
extended into touch. One of these columns saw what appeared to be the next column
getting into position on its flank, and pressed on in order not to be outdistanced, but the
column on its right acted strangely, and soon it was discovered that the strange column
was a Boer commando seeking to escape. As a pursuit would have resulted in making a
larger loophole the enemy got away.

&#8220;In another place a large body was observed passing along our front, and it was
greeted with a volley, whereon an officer in British uniform, complete in every detail, with
&#8216;K.F.S.&#8217; on the shoulder-straps, rode up and reported that it was a British column
passing along to take up its allotted place in the line. The force was accordingly allowed
to proceed on its way. The &#8216;K.F.S.&#8217; officer, however, was a Boer and the column a Boer
commando.&#8221;

[Pg 196]

It was discovered after all that Delarey had not been within the radius
of the big movement, and therefore General W. Kitchener, in hope still to
entrap him, set to work to reconnoitre towards the Hart River. On the 31st
of March Cookson and Keir struck track of guns, and presently they were
attacked with great determination. A long running fight was continued for
eight miles through the bush and scrub of the region. A position in the
open was taken, and both parties set to work. Delarey, Kemp, and some 1500
Boers fought brilliantly, but were outmatched by the dogged courage of the
newly raised R.H.A. Rifles, who let them advance within 200 yards, and then
repelled them with steady gusts of rifle fire; by the staunchness of Colonel
Evans&#8217; Canadian Rifles, of which one party under young Bruce-Carruthers
held their ground till every man was either killed or wounded; and by the dash
of the 28th Mounted Infantry, Damant&#8217;s Horse, Kitchener&#8217;s Fighting Scouts,
and the 17th and 27th Mounted Infantry. The enemy after losing tremendously
refused to continue the conflict, in spite of being frantically urged forward by
their leaders.

The columns of Von Donop and Grenfell under General Kekewich on the
11th of April, in the region of Rooival, had a hot fight with the enemy. These
eventually were repulsed by the Yeomanry, Scottish Horse, and South Africa
Constabulary, who fought with their accustomed coolness and brilliancy.
Forty-four Boers were left dead on the field and thirty-four wounded. Twenty
prisoners were taken. Captain Salter (7th Imperial Yeomanry) and five men
were killed and fifty-two wounded. Lieutenant Bull, 3rd Inniskilling
Fusiliers, died of wounds. The pursuit of the band was vigorously taken up,
and General Kekewich had the satisfaction of securing two guns, a pom-pom,
ammunition, and waggons. Among the Boer dead was Commandant Potgieter
of Wolmaranstad, one of Delarey&#8217;s right-hand men. About this time Colonel
Rochfort&#8217;s column made a night raid on a laager at Schweizerreneke, and
secured fifty-five prisoners, with waggons and stock.

The columns under General Ian Hamilton continued their systematic
sweeping of the Western Transvaal, and after clearing the central area to east
of Harts River they formed a line, and in conjunction with Colonel Rochfort
from Bloemhof, moved west on the 7th of May. They reached the railway on
the 11th plus 357 prisoners and practically all the waggons and stock of the
commandos in the district. The total reduction, therefore, in Delarey&#8217;s forces
since his success at Tweebosch amounted to 860 men. The process of exhaustion
had been steady and sure.

CAPE COLONY&mdash;MARCH

A spirited engagement took place at Buffelshoek between Fouché&#8217;s commando
and Colonel Price&#8217;s men, with the result that Commander Odendaal and
Captain Vanderwalt were killed and two Boers wounded. Major Wormald&#8217;s
and other columns meanwhile hunted Malan and Fouché in the region of the
Camdeboos Mountains, where pursuit is difficult, sometimes impossible.



THE TRAIN CONVEYING THE REMAINS OF MR. RHODES SALUTED BY THE BLOCKHOUSE GUARDS
ON ITS WAY TO THE MATOPPO HILLS

Drawing by Ernest Prater


And then, when negotiations for peace were being made between the two
nations, while all the sad events of the last three years were apparently coming
to a happy conclusion, the British nation lost a man whose like, one may safely
say, will never be found again. On the 26th of March, at Muizenburg, Mr.
Cecil Rhodes breathed his last. He had long been ailing, therefore this misfortune
was not unexpected, and the effect of his loss on public affairs was
minimised by the fact that with characteristic foresight he had arranged all his[Pg 197]
business matters, so that in his absence they might proceed without a hitch.
His Will, when opened, proved to be a document for all time, one which might
be studied with advantage by every British boy whose hope it is to leave his
country greater than he found it. To this man&#8217;s life-work we have already
alluded. Of his influence in the future it is impossible at present to write.
Certain it is that his name is writ large wherever the glory of Great Britain&#8217;s
greatest finds a place. He gave minute directions regarding his last resting-place.
Neither St. Paul&#8217;s nor Westminster Abbey were wide enough for his
free spirit.

&#8220;I admire the grandeur and loneliness of the Matoppos in Rhodesia, and I therefore
desire to be buried in the Matoppos, on the hill which I used to visit and which I called the
&#8216;View of the World,&#8217; in a square to be cut out in the rock on the top of the hill, covered with
a plain brass plate with these words thereon, &#8216;Here lie the remains of Cecil John Rhodes,&#8217;
and accordingly I direct my executors at the expense of my estate to take all steps and do
all things necessary or proper to give effect to this my desire, and afterwards to keep my
grave in order at the expense of the Matoppos and Buluwayo fund hereinafter mentioned.
I direct my trustees, on the hill aforesaid, to erect or complete the monument to the men
who fell in the first Matabele War at Shangani in Rhodesia, the bas-reliefs for which are
being made by Mr. John Tweed, and I desire the said hill to be preserved as a burial-place;
but no person is to be buried there unless the Government for the time being of Rhodesia,
until the various states of South Africa, or any of them, shall have been federated, and after
such federation the Federal Government, by a vote of two-thirds of its governing body, says
that he or she has deserved well of his or her country.&#8221;

His wishes were carried out with reverence and to the letter. His body was
conveyed to Groote Schuur, where it lay in state till it was removed to the
Houses of Parliament in Cape Town, where it lay all night. Next day the
procession started for the Cathedral. All business was suspended. The
streets were draped with black&mdash;the thoroughfares were lined with troops and
sorrowing crowds. A more wonderful service, a more impressive ceremony, has
never been seen in South Africa. Finally the remains started on their last
voyage. Of this melancholy journey the correspondent of the Standard
wrote:&mdash;

&#8220;Not the least striking feature was the reception given to the train by the garrisons of
the blockhouses as we passed them in succession. As we glided slowly out of a station
away ahead of us would stretch the long vista of the line, dotted here and there with the
little fortresses. We would gather speed, and the sun glinted on steel as the garrison of the
nearest blockhouse began to fix bayonets and fall in. Then as we swept swiftly forward the
little squad of men came abreast of us, and the bayonets rose and fell symmetrically amid
the solemn solitude. Then the blockhouse was whirled away behind us and lost to sight. So
it went on for mile after mile, the fireman busy at his duties and the driver, one of the oldest
servants of the railway department, steady and watchful at his post. Down into De Aar we
swept at such speed that as we passed the blockhouses the saluting rifles seemed to rise and
fall mechanically and without intermission.&#8221;

Buluwayo was reached on April 8th, and the coffin placed in the Drill Hall
and guarded by two Rhodesian volunteers with drawn swords. Finally it was
borne, on the 10th, to its lonely bed in the almost inaccessible steeps that
he loved.

Early in April the trial of Kruitzinger was concluded, and the prisoner was
acquitted of the charges of murder or train-wrecking that were brought against
him. He therefore fell into the category of prisoners of war. From intercepted
despatches forwarded by the commandant to Scheepers it was discovered
that he had seriously condemned the inhuman practices of his countrymen.
The raiders continued their mischievous activities, the columns their incessant
chases and hunts. Lovat&#8217;s Scouts engaged Bezuidenhout at Kaal River on[Pg 198]
the 26th of April, and in the scrimmage two of the rebels were wounded. On
the 1st of May the town of Ookiep (in north-west of Cape Colony), which for
some time had been invested by the Boers, was practically relieved by the
appearance of reinforcements from Namaqualand under Colonels Cooper and
Caldwell. These relieved the column at Klipfontein (fifty miles from Ookiep),
and thus took the pressure off the neighbouring places.

Further particulars were given in the Morning Post:&mdash;&#8220;General Smuts
demanded the surrender of Ookiep on 4th April. Colonel W. Shelton refused
to entertain any terms whatever, saying that he would hold out to the bitter end.
He must, however,&#8221; the letter proceeded, &#8220;have a relief column if the place is
to be saved, as he has 6000 people to feed and provisions for only three weeks.
Colonel Shelton brought in the Mesklip and Nababeep garrisons with all their
arms and ammunition successfully. Nababeep has since been looted. Springbokfontein
made a gallant fight, but had to surrender to overwhelming numbers,
our casualties being four killed and six wounded. It is reported that Concordia
surrendered without firing a shot. Colonel Shelton ordered the Concordia
Town Guard to Ookiep, but they refused to go. The Boers seem to be bent
on doing as much damage as they possibly can. They have destroyed miles of
railway and are burning the sleepers as they take them up. The dynamite
which they seized at Garrakop, eight miles from Ookiep, they are now using to
destroy the blockhouses by dropping charges on the roofs from the kopjes
above. Colonel White and his column are at or entrenched near Gassies, and
cannot get out. Anenous, Kookfontein, Steinkop, Ooboop, and all outlying
stations are deserted. Two trains of refugees arrived at Port Nolloth this
morning during a heavy shower of rain. Lilliesfontein refugees are also here,
making the number over fifteen hundred. The inhabitants of Port Nolloth are
feeling very uneasy, for they greatly fear that an attack will be made on the
port; but our defences are perfect, and with the assistance of his Majesty&#8217;s
ship Barracouta we mean to give the Boers a warm reception. During a thunderstorm
that broke over Ookiep a few days ago a party of Boers was seen on
the mountain to the east of Ookiep making a blockhouse in good position, but
Major Edwards with a small patrol soon put them to flight.&#8221;

A member of the garrison of the Springbokfontein blockhouse, commanded
by Lieutenant Dorrington, reported as follows: &#8220;The Boers were gallantly kept
at bay for twenty-four hours, when they succeeded in making a rush on the
village. They first made a raid on the Civil Commissioner&#8217;s house, which they
found locked, the magistrate, Mr. J. A. Van Renen, being at Ookiep at the time
on his way back from Port Nolloth, where he had been to fetch his family. Lieutenant
Dorrington, seeing a fire at the Residency from the blockhouse, thought
the Boers were setting fire to the house. He ordered his men to open fire on
them, whereupon the Boers rushed the kopje on the top of which the blockhouse
was built, and demanded its immediate surrender. When Lieutenant Dorrington
refused to surrender he was greeted with charges of dynamite. The Boers
then crept under the hill, making it quite impossible for our men to fire on
them, and began to place dynamite underneath the blockhouse. They again
sent to tell the officer in command that if he did not surrender he and his men
would be blown up. A message was sent back to them to say that he would
surrender on condition that they did not harm his men. This was agreed to,
and the men came out. They were all promptly lodged in prison. The same
informant states that Mr. Stuart, the resident magistrate&#8217;s clerk, Mr. Van
Coernden&#8217;s son, and two others were killed by charges of dynamite thrown on
the top of the blockhouse from a kopje.[Pg 199]&#8221;

A second letter, which was dated 12th April, announced that transports had
arrived at Port Nolloth and that reinforcements were pouring into the town.
A third letter was written on the following day, and it said: &#8220;Lieutenant
Meyrick, with his party of N.B.S., has so far gallantly defended the viaducts
and the mountain pass above Anenous. A native who has just come in reports
that the Boers have, however, come round the mountain and destroyed the
railway on this side of Anenous as far as the 37th mile. Mr. F. Phillips, of
Concordia, son of the superintendent, arrived at Port Nolloth yesterday, having
obtained a pass from the Boer Commandant Smuts. He states that the Boers
who have got possession of Concordia are mostly Transvaal men. Ookiep is
evidently giving the Boers a warm time, for many wounded are brought into
Concordia, others going back to take their place. They say that they are quite
determined to take Ookiep at any cost, and seem to have quietly settled down
at Concordia. They have their doctor and chaplain, and hold services twice
daily. The Commandant Smuts lives in the doctor&#8217;s house, the doctor being
absent in Cape Town. He has his secretary with him, a Frenchman, whom
they have nicknamed &#8216;Roberts,&#8217; and who has a great reputation for ability
among them.&#8221;

On the 27th of May Major Collett, with the Jansenville District Mounted
Horse, encountered the Boers, who thought this a fine opportunity for attacking
raw material. But the local force was tougher than they thought, and moreover
Lovat&#8217;s Scouts, who had been pursuing Malan for a long time, were at
hand. These promptly came to the rescue, upon which the enemy fled, leaving
Malan&mdash;one of the best of the Boer leaders&mdash;in their hands. Malan was one of
the &#8220;irreconcilables,&#8221; and he had rejected the offer of a safe conduct to attend
the Vereeniging conference, which at this time was taking place with a view
to the signing of peace.

THE SITUATION&mdash;APRIL AND MAY

It was officially computed that by May 1902 the British forces had been
reduced through the South African war by 1055 officers and 20,520 men who
died in South Africa, 1 officer and 131 men returned as missing and prisoners,
7 officers and 487 men who died after having been sent home as invalids, and
5531 invalided men who left the Service as unfit. These figures represent a
total of 27,732. The following figures, taken from a table published by
Colonel Henderson, Professor of Military Art and History at the Staff College,
in his &#8220;Life of Stonewall Jackson,&#8221; may be found interesting for purposes
of comparison with the British losses:&mdash;

[Pg 200]

Of the Boer losses no exact total could be arrived at.

In April, a careful computation of the strength of the enemy in the field
put it at about 10,000 men. The commando of Delarey and Kemp was the
largest, their following being about 900 men; but concentration was marvellously
quickly accomplished, and near at hand on the west were odd bands of
perhaps a hundred, commanded by Potgieter, Klassen, and Cronje. Beyers,
with less than four hundred, hung about Zoutpansberg, and other leaders near
Lydenburg were practically dependent on fragments from their master&#8217;s table,
otherwise the escaped ones and twos from Botha&#8217;s and De Wet&#8217;s hunted forces.
In the Eastern Transvaal, east of Springs, were Alberto, Opperman, and Van
Niekirk, with small yet enterprising gangs. Klassen and Badenhorst were
fairly well supported at Ermelo, and 200 Boers hung occupationless about
Piet Retief. Minor leaders were sprinkled about the Orange Colony, clinging
mostly to the sheltering region of the Brandwater Basin.

In the Cape Colony they were equally scattered. Malan and Fouché north
of Murraysburg, Maritz and Bowers near Garees, Theron north of Calvinia,
Van Reenan north-east, near Fraserburg, had each a small trail of troublesome
rebels at his heels. Raking and combing was taking place everywhere. Since
the 22nd of March, when the question of peace came to be discussed, the
Boer forces had been reduced by about 860 in killed, wounded, and prisoners.
A conference between Lord Kitchener and Lord Milner was held in Pretoria,
the result of which was digested on the 20th by the Boer leaders, who then
took themselves off to rejoin their commandos. Meanwhile Lord Kitchener
maintained his vigilant tactics, knowing that the wily ones if given an inch
would take an ell, and General Ian Hamilton in the west, General Bruce-Hamilton
in the east, and Colonel Colenbrander in the north, continued their
sweeping operations.

It was now decided that the Boer leaders, who had again met together at
Klerksdorp on the 11th of April, were to reassemble on the 15th of May
to deliberate among themselves and arrive at a decision as to the terms of
surrender they would be prepared to accept. The conference, which opened
at Vereeniging in due course, included the representatives of all the bodies of
Boers throughout the two colonies. The delegates chosen by the conference
at Vereeniging arrived at Pretoria on the 20th May. They were six in number,
consisting of members of the two &#8220;Governments,&#8221; with Generals Delarey and
De Wet, accompanied by their secretaries. They were lodged in the house next
to that occupied by Lord Kitchener. Lord Milner also arrived.

There was an interval of great suspense, which was shared by the whole
civilised world. All parties watched the telegraph wires with bated breath,
then on Saturday, May 31st, the great Boer War came to an end. The conference
at Vereeniging had brought forth good results! The Peace Agreement,
long anxiously looked forward to by both belligerents, was signed!

[Pg 201]

APPENDIX

THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS&mdash;COMMENCED MARCH 12, 1902&mdash;CONCLUDED
MAY 31, 1902

The following is the text of the draft agreement signed by the Boer
representatives in Pretoria on the 31st of May after it had been
approved by his Majesty&#8217;s Government:&mdash;

His Excellency General Lord Kitchener and his Excellency Lord
Milner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. M. T. Steyn,
J. Brebner, General C. R. De Wet, General C. Olivier, and Judge
J. B. M. Hertzog, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, and
Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Generals Louis Botha, J. H. Delarey,
Lucas Meyer, Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic,
on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present
hostilities, agree on the following articles:&mdash;

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms,
handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war in their possession or under
their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of his
Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.
The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord
Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General
Delarey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. All Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal or Orange
River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are
Burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of
his Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as
soon as transports can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The Burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of
their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the
Burghers surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the
prosecution of the war. The benefit of this clause will not extend to certain
acts contrary to usages of war which have been notified by Commander-in-Chief
to the Boer generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately
after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal
and Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will
be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual
administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange
River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection on taking out a
licence according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will
at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as
circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government,
will be introduced.[Pg 202]

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until
after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and
Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a commission, on which the local
inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the
Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or
other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their
homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide
themselves with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock,
implements, &amp;c., indispensable to the resumption of their normal occupations.

His Majesty&#8217;s Government will place at the disposal of these commissions a
sum of £3,000,000 for the above purposes, and will allow all notes issued under
Law 1 of 1900 of the South African Republic and all receipts given by officers
in the field of the late Republics, or under their orders, to be presented to a
judicial commission, which will be appointed by the Government, and if such
notes and receipts are found by this commission to have been duly issued in
return for valuable considerations, they will be received by the first-named
commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they
were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of £3,000,000,
his Majesty&#8217;s Government will be prepared to make advances on loan for the
same purposes free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a
period of years with 3 per cent. interest.

No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this clause.

The correspondence relating to the last stage of the South African War was published
as a Parliamentary Paper. As the future policy of South Africa will be directed by the
considerations which influenced the wording of the final agreement, the important part of
the correspondence is quoted in its entirety. A series of brief despatches passed between
Lord Kitchener and the Secretary of State for War between March 12 and April 11. The
first despatch announced the desire of Mr. Schalk Burger, after receiving from Lord
Kitchener a copy of the correspondence connected with the Dutch Government&#8217;s negotiations,
to obtain safe conduct in order to meet Mr. Steyn with a view to making peace
proposals. The meeting of the Boer commanders, as is known, was arranged, and it took
place at Klerksdorp. On April 11 Lord Kitchener received permission from the Secretary
of State for War to accede to a request from the Boer representatives for permission
to lay certain proposals before him. This Boer request was addressed to Lord Kitchener
in the following terms:&mdash;

&#8220;After quoting at length the correspondence between his Majesty&#8217;s Government and
the Netherlands, they are of opinion that it is a suitable moment to do everything possible
to put a stop to the war, and therefore decide to make certain propositions to Lord
Kitchener which can serve as a base for further negotiations in order to bring about the
desired end. They further decide that, in their opinion, in order to accelerate the desired
aim and prevent misunderstanding, Lord Kitchener be requested to meet them personally,
time and place to be appointed by him, in order to lay before him direct peace proposals,
which they are prepared to submit, and in order to settle at once, by direct communication
with him, all questions that may present themselves, and thereby to make sure that this
meeting will have the desired result.&#8221;

PRELIMINARY OVERTURES.

Then followed the succeeding telegraphic correspondence.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, April 12, 1902, 9.22 P.M.

All Boer representatives met to-day and wished the following telegram sent:&mdash;

&#8220;The Boer representatives wish to lay before his Majesty&#8217;s Government that they have
an earnest desire for peace, and that they consequently decided to ask the British Govern[Pg 203]ment
to end hostilities, and to enter into an agreement by which, in their opinion, all future
war between them and the British Government in South Africa will be prevented. They
consider this object may be attained by providing for following points:&mdash;

&#8220;1. Franchise.

&#8220;2. Equal rights for Dutch and English languages in education matters.

&#8220;3. Customs Union.

&#8220;4. Dismantling of all forts in Transvaal and Orange River Colony.

&#8220;5. Post, Telegraph, and Railways Union.

&#8220;6. Arbitration in case of future differences, and only subjects of the parties to be the
arbitrators.

&#8220;7. Mutual amnesty.

&#8220;But if these terms are not satisfactory they desire to know what terms the British
Government would give them in order to secure the end they all desire.&#8221;

I have assured them that his Majesty&#8217;s Government will not accept any proposals
which would maintain independence of Republic, as this would do, and that they must
expect refusal.

From the Secretary of State for War to Lord Kitchener.

War Office, 13th April 1902, 2.30 P.M.

His Majesty&#8217;s Government sincerely share the earnest desire of the Boer representatives
for peace, and hope that the present negotiations may lead to that result; but they have
already stated in the clearest terms, and must now repeat, that they cannot entertain any
proposals which are based upon the continued independence of the former Republics,
which have been formally annexed to the British Crown.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, 14th April 1902, 6.10 P.M.

The High Commissioner and I met the Boer representatives this morning, when I communicated
to them the substance of your telegram. We then endeavoured to induce them
to make fresh proposals, but President Steyn, who throughout acted as their leading spokesman,
immediately took the line that while the Boer Governments were competent to make
peace they were not competent to surrender the independence of their country; that only
the people could do this&mdash;the people, as explained, meaning the Burghers still in the field.
If he was to suggest anything involving the abandonment of independence, it would be a
betrayal of their trust.

Schalk Burger and General Botha took precisely the same line. As no progress could be
made the meeting was adjourned by mutual consent till this afternoon. The Boer representatives
then suggested an armistice in order to consult their people; but I pointed out,
with Lord Milner&#8217;s full concurrence, that we had not got nearly far enough in the direction
of agreement to justify such a course. Finally it was agreed that I should send you the
following message, which was read over several times, and fully agreed to by the representatives,
to whom I have given a copy of it:&mdash;

&#8220;A difficulty has arisen in getting on with proceedings. The representatives state that
constitutionally they have no power to discuss terms based on the surrender of independence,
inasmuch as only the Burghers can agree to such a basis; therefore, if they were to propose,
it would put them in a false position with regard to their people. If, however, his Majesty&#8217;s
Government would state the terms that, subsequent to a relinquishment of independence,
they would be prepared to grant, the representatives, after asking for the necessary explanations,
without any expression of approval or disapproval, would submit such conditions
to their people.&#8221;

THE QUESTION OF INDEPENDENCE.

From the Secretary of State for War to Lord Kitchener.

War Office, April 16, 1902, 2.20 P.M.

We have received with considerable surprise the message from the Boer leaders contained
in your telegram of April 14.

The meeting was arranged at their request, and they must have been aware of our
repeated declarations that we could not entertain any proposals based on the renewed independence
of the two South African States. We were, therefore, entitled to assume that the[Pg 204]
Boer representatives had relinquished the idea of independence, and would propose terms
of surrender for the forces still in the field.

They now state that they are constitutionally incompetent to discuss terms which do not
include a restoration of independence, but request us to inform them what conditions would
be granted if, after submitting the matter to their followers, they were to relinquish the
demand for independence.

This does not seem to us to be a satisfactory method of proceeding, or one best adapted
to secure, at the earliest moment, a cessation of the hostilities which have involved the loss
of so much life and treasure.

We are, however, as we have been from the first, anxious to spare the effusion of further
blood, and to hasten the restoration of peace and prosperity to the countries afflicted by the
war, and you and Lord Milner are therefore authorised to refer the Boer leaders to the offer
made by you to General Botha more than twelve months ago, and to inform them that,
although the subsequent great reduction in the strength of the forces opposed to us and the
additional sacrifices thrown upon us by the refusal of that offer would justify us in imposing
far more onerous terms, we are still prepared, in the hope of a permanent peace and reconciliation,
to accept a general surrender on the lines of that offer, but with such modifications
in detail as may be agreed upon mutually.

You are also authorised to discuss such modifications with them, and to submit the result
for our approval.

Communicate this to High Commissioner.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, April 17, 1902, 6.40 P.M.

I communicated your telegram to the Boer representatives this morning. They immediately
asked for adjournment to consider it. We met again at 2 P.M., when they pressed for
the return of the Boer delegates and for an armistice to enable them to consult their
burghers. I refused both on military grounds, but promised facilities for them to hold
meeting of their Burghers. Lord Milner impressed on them necessity of coming back with
definite powers and determination to make peace at once, which they promised to do. The
meeting then broke up, and I had a short meeting with Generals Botha, De Wet, and
Delarey, to arrange details of how they are to carry out meeting. These were settled satisfactorily,
and they will probably leave to-morrow to get vote from their people.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, April 18, 1902, 10.55 A.M.

Have now arranged with the generals all details as to holding meeting, and representatives
of both States will leave here to-night to carry out the arrangements.

From the Secretary of State for War to Lord Kitchener.

War Office, April 19, 1902.

Yours of yesterday. We fully realise the necessity of giving the Boer leaders all due
opportunity of consulting their commandos, but we trust that no arrangements will be come
to which will make it necessary for you to suspend operations until some definite arrangement
is in view. We are continuing to send reinforcements.

SURRENDER OF INDEPENDENCE.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, April 19, 1902, 11.40 A.M.

The Boer representatives have all left. The meeting of elected representatives from
commandos is arranged to be held at Vereeniging on 13th or 15th May. I did my best to
hasten, but it was found impossible. I am not allowing facilities for meeting of commandos
in Cape Colony, and none will be there. I have arranged with Boer leaders that foreigners
serving with them shall have no vote, and that votes will be by ballot. Each commando
will be represented by two Burghers. It is thought probable that the meeting at Vereeniging
will take two days, after which, if favourable decision is arrived at, Boer representatives will
come here to arrange final settlement.[Pg 205]

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 17, 1902, 6.55 P.M.

Following telegram just received:&mdash;

&#8220;From State Presidents Burger and Steyn to Lord Kitchener.

&#8220;We have the honour to communicate to your Excellency that, as a result of the
Burghers assembling here, a commission has been appointed by our Governments to
negotiate with your Excellency with a view to finishing the present hostilities. This
commission consists of Louis Botha, Christian De Wet, Hertzog, Delarey, and Smuts. If
your Excellency is agreeable to meet this commission we request you to appoint time
and place of meeting.&#8221;

After consultation with Lord Milner I have sent following reply:&mdash;

&#8220;I have the honour to acknowledge your communication, and should be glad to be
informed if the commission you announce have plenary powers to agree to terms for the
cessation of hostilities. If so, Lord Milner and I will be prepared to receive them here.
Colonel Henderson will arrange to put a train at their disposal directly they inform him
when they wish to start.&#8221;

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 18, 1902, 2.15 P.M.

Following is reply from Burger and Steyn:&mdash;

&#8220;In reply to your Excellency&#8217;s telegram of this morning, we have the honour to inform
you that commission, appointed in accordance with instructions by the Burghers assembled,
has power to negotiate with your Excellency, subject to ratification by the Burghers.&#8221;

After consultation with Lord Milner, I have informed the Presidents we will be glad to
meet the commission here to-morrow.

Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 19, 1902, 7.20 P.M.

Meeting took place at 11.30, and Boer commission made following proposals:&mdash;

1. We are prepared to surrender our independence as regards foreign relations.

2. We wish to retain self-government under British supervision.

3. We are prepared to surrender a part of our territory.

Lord Milner and I refused to accept these terms as basis for negotiation, as they differ
essentially from the principles laid down by his Majesty&#8217;s Government. After a long discussion
nothing was decided, and it was determined to meet in the afternoon. Commission
met again at 4 P.M., when Lord Milner proposed a form of document that might be submitted
to the Burghers for a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; vote. There was a good deal of objection to this, but
it was agreed finally that Lord Milner should meet Smuts and Hertzog with a view of drafting
as far as possible an acceptable document on the Botha lines. They will meet to-morrow
for that purpose. Lord Milner stipulated for the assistance of Sir Richard Solomon in the
preparation of the draft documents.

FOR A &#8220;YES&#8221; OR &#8220;NO&#8221; VOTE.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 21, 1902, 4.50 P.M.

Commission are prepared to submit the following document to the Burghers assembled
at Vereeniging for a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; vote if his Majesty&#8217;s Government approves of its
terms:&mdash;

&#8220;His Excellency General Lord Kitchener and his Excellency Lord Milner, on behalf
of the British Government, and Messrs. M. T. Steyn, J. Brebner, General C. R. de Wet,
General C. Olivier, and Judge J. B. M. Hertzog, acting as the Government of the Orange
Free State, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Generals Louis Botha, J. H. Delarey,
Lucas Meyer, Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, on behalf[Pg 206]
of their respective Burghers desirous to terminate the present hostilities agree on the following
articles:&mdash;

&#8220;1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all
guns, rifles, and munitions of war in their possession or under their control, and desist from
any further resistance to the authority of his Majesty King Edward VII., whom they
recognise as their lawful Sovereign. The manner and details of this surrender will be
arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General
Delarey, and Chief Commandant de Wet.

&#8220;2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal or Orange River Colony, on
surrendering, will be brought back to their homes.

&#8220;3. All prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are Burghers will, on their
declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of his Majesty King Edward VII.,
be brought back to the places where they were domiciled before the war.

&#8220;4. The Burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal
liberty or their property.

&#8220;5. No proceeding, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the Burghers surrendering
or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war.

&#8220;6. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and Orange
River Colony, where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in Courts of
Law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

&#8220;7. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony
to persons requiring them for their protection on taking out a licence according to law.

&#8220;8. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest
possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit,
representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

&#8220;9. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the
introduction of self-government.

&#8220;10. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange
River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

&#8220;11. A judicial commission will be appointed, to which Government notes issued under
Law No. 1 of 1900 of the South African Republic may be presented within six months.
All such notes as are found to have been duly issued in the terms of that law, and for which
the persons presenting them have given valuable considerations, will be paid, but without
interest. All receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics, or under their
orders, may likewise be presented to the said commission within six months, and, if found
to have been given bonâ fide for goods used by the Burgher forces in the field, will be paid
out to the persons to whom they were originally given. The sum in respect of the said
Government notes and receipts shall not exceed £3,000,000 sterling, and if the total amount
of such notes and receipts approved by the commission is more than that sum there shall
be a pro rata diminution. Facilities will be afforded to the prisoners of war to present
their Government notes and receipts within the six months aforesaid.

&#8220;12. As soon as conditions permit, a commission, on which the local inhabitants will be
represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony,
under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the
restoration of the people to their homes, and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are
unable to provide for themselves with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed,
stock, implements, &amp;c., indispensable to the resumption of their normal occupations.
Money for this will be advanced by the Government, free of interest, and repayable over a
period of years.&#8221;

MR. CHAMBERLAIN&#8217;S EMENDATIONS.

From Mr. Chamberlain to Lord Milner.

Colonial Office, May 27, 1902, 3.45 P.M.

I have to inform you that his Majesty&#8217;s Government approve of the submission to the
assembly at Vereeniging for a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; vote the document prepared by the commission,
and forwarded by Lord Kitchener on 21st May to the Secretary of State for War,
subject to the following alterations:&mdash;

Clauses 2 and 3 should be put together, and will run as follows:&mdash;

&#8220;All Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony,
and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa, who are Burghers, will, on duly
declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of his Majesty King Edward VII.,[Pg 207]
be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their
means of subsistence ensured.&#8221;

The object of this alteration is to make clear that Burghers in the field outside the two
States will, like the Burghers inside and the prisoners of war, declare their acceptance of
the position of subjects. It was clearly not intended that they should be in any different
position to their countrymen elsewhere.

We have also inserted words to explain that return must be gradual.

Clause 5. We add at end of clause the words:&mdash;

&#8220;The benefit of this clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to usages of war
which have been notified by Commander-in-Chief to the Boer generals, and which shall be
tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.&#8221;

Clauses 11 and 12 must be omitted and the following clause substituted:&mdash;

&#8220;As soon as conditions permit, a commission, on which the local inhabitants will be
represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony
under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration
of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable
to provide themselves with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements,
&amp;c., indispensable to the resumption of their normal occupations.

&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of
£3,000,000 for the above purposes, and will allow all notes issued under Law 1 of 1900 of
the South African Republic, and all receipts given by officers in the field of the late
Republics, or under their orders, to be presented to a judicial commission, which will be
appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this commission
to have been duly issued in return for valuable considerations, they will be received by the
first-named commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they
were originally given.

&#8220;In addition to the above-named free grant of £3,000,000, his Majesty&#8217;s Government
will be prepared to make advances on loan for the same purposes free of interest for two
years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years with 3 per cent. interest. No
foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this clause.&#8221;

In making this communication to the delegates you must inform them that if this
opportunity of an honourable termination of hostilities is not accepted within a time fixed
by you the conference will be considered at an end, and his Majesty&#8217;s Government will not
be bound in any way by their present declarations.

Lord Kitchener should have a copy of this telegram.



SURRENDERED BOERS AT BELFAST ANXIOUS TO JOIN THE NATIONAL SCOUTS AFTER BEING ADDRESSED
BY LORD KITCHENER

Drawing by F. de Harnen from Photographs


THE SUBJECT OF BANISHMENT.

From Mr. Chamberlain to Lord Milner.

Colonial Office, May 27, 1902, 5.10 P.M.

We understand that the terms of surrender offered in my telegram of to-day are confined
to Burghers of the Orange Free State and South African Republic at the date of the outbreak
of the war. His Majesty&#8217;s Government are unable to make any pledges on behalf of
the Governments of the Cape or Natal as to the treatment of rebels. You have no doubt
kept in mind that any favourable terms accorded by either of these Governments will have
to be sanctioned by the Legislature of the Colony.

His Majesty&#8217;s Government must place it on record that the treatment of Cape and
Natal colonists who have been in rebellion and who now surrender will be determined, if
they return to their colonies, by the Colonial Governments and in accordance with the laws
of the colonies, and that any other British subjects who have joined the enemy will be liable
to trial under the law of that part of the British Empire to which they belong.

The Cape Government have informed his Majesty&#8217;s Government that the following are
their views as to the terms which should be granted to British subjects of Cape Colony who
are now in the field, or have surrendered, or have been captured since the 12th April
1901:&mdash;

&#8220;With regard to rank and file, Ministers advise that upon surrender they shall all, after
giving up their arms, sign a document before Resident Magistrate of district in which
surrender takes place acknowledging themselves guilty of high treason, and that the
punishment to be awarded to them, provided they shall not have been guilty of murder or
other acts contrary to usages of civilised warfare, shall be that they shall not be entitled for
life to be registered as voters or to vote at any Parliamentary, Divisional Council, or
Municipal election. Legislation will be required to give effect to this recommendation.[Pg 208]
With regard to Justices of the Peace and Field-Cornets of Cape Colony and all other
persons holding an official position under Government of Cape Colony, or who may occupy
post of commandant of rebel or Burgher forces, Ministers advise that they shall be tried for
high treason before the ordinary tribunal of country or such special court as may be
hereafter constituted by law, the punishments for their offence to be left to the discretion of
court, with this proviso, that in no case shall penalty of death be inflicted.&#8221;

The Natal Government are of opinion that rebels should be dealt with according to the
law of the colony.

From Mr. Chamberlain to Lord Milner.

Colonial Office, 26th May 1902, 6.50 P.M.

Have any promises been made to Boers by you with regard to the leaders liable to
banishment under the proclamation of 7th August, some of whom have been specially
named in notices issued subsequently? This proclamation, you will recollect, was the
result of a strong representation from Lord Kitchener, and supported by minute of Natal
Government of 25th July. The exact terms were finally settled by you. If you now think
that this proclamation should be disregarded I have no objection to make.

From Lord Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.

(Received Colonial Office 3.30 P.M., 27th May 1902.)

Referring to your telegram of 26th May. No promises have been made or asked for.
The Boers are no doubt aware that legislation is required to give effect to banishment, and
feel that we would not introduce such legislation if Article 3 of proposed agreement is accepted.
This is obvious, and it follows that if surrender comes off banishment will be
tacitly dropped. I was in favour of banishment proclamation, and was prepared to go even
further, as I thought, and I still think, that resistance of Boers had ceased to be legitimate
at that stage, and that it was our duty to impose special penalties upon those responsible
for adoption of guerilla methods by which the country was being ruined and by which alone
the struggle could be kept up at all.

So far from regretting the proclamation I believe it has had great effect in increasing
the number of surrenders, and in inducing the Boers still in the field to desist from further
fighting. That has certainly been Kitchener&#8217;s opinion, as he has always pressed and given
the greatest publicity to the lists of banished leaders. But it would be a mistake if the
Boers now give in in a body and live as British subjects to continue a prescription which
would only keep up bitter feelings and tend to prevent the country from settling down.

Kitchener agrees entirely.

From Lord Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.

(Sent 7.55 P.M. Received Colonial Office 7.45 P.M., 27th May 1902.)

My telegram of to-day, No. 1.

I made it clear, I hope, that what I said applied only to banishment, not to sale of
farms. Smuts did allude to this point in committee, though not to banishment, but I gave
him an emphatic negative, and the subject was then dropped.

THE FIRST DRAFT AGREEMENT.

From Lord Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.

(Despatched 11.10 P.M., May 28. Received Colonial Office 5.5 A.M., May 29, 1902.)

Referring to your telegram No. 1 of May 27. Commander-in-Chief and I met the Boer
delegates again this morning, and I communicated to them the alterations and additions to
their draft contained in your telegram under reply, and informed them that his Majesty&#8217;s
Government approved of the draft so altered being submitted to the Burghers at
Vereeniging for a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; answer. I added that if this opportunity of an
honourable termination of hostilities was not accepted within a time fixed by us the
conference would be considered at an end, and his Majesty&#8217;s Government would not be
in any way bound by the present declarations. I handed them at the same time a copy of
draft agreement in accordance with your instructions. There was no discussion of it.
Commander-in-Chief stated that before fixing definitely the time by which we must receive[Pg 209]
an answer he would like to know their opinion. He thought forty-eight hours would be
ample, but he did not wish to rush them.

The delegates, who it was agreed should return to Vereeniging this evening, asked for
an adjournment before giving an answer as to time. To this we agreed.

Before they left I read to them a statement based on your telegram of 27th May, No. 2,
and was obliged to modify slightly your message in order to bring it into harmony with the
latest communication I have received from the Cape Government on the subject, according
to which fresh legislation will not be necessary; but essential points, viz., the degree of
punishment to be awarded and the classification of rebels, were given absolutely in your
words.

The delegates asked for a copy of my statement, which I handed to them. The
meeting then adjourned.

This afternoon we met delegates again for a few minutes. They asked us to give them
until Saturday night for their answer, to which we agreed. We then shook hands and
parted.

They returned at 9 P.M. to Vereeniging.

From Lord Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.

(Despatched 6.5 P.M., 30th May. Received Colonial Office 8.30 A.M., 31st May 1902.)

After handing to Boer delegates a copy of draft agreement which his Majesty&#8217;s
Government are prepared to approve with a view of terminating the present hostilities,
I read to them the following statement and gave them a copy:&mdash;

His Majesty&#8217;s Government must place it on record that the treatment of Cape and
Natal Colonists who have been in rebellion and who now surrender will, if they return to
their colonies, be determined by the Colonial Governments and in accordance with the laws
of the colonies, and that any British subjects who have joined the enemy will be liable to
trial under the law of that part of the British Empire to which they belong.

His Majesty&#8217;s Government are informed by the Cape Government that the following
are their views as to the terms which should be granted to British subjects of Cape
Colony who are now in the field, or who have surrendered, or have been captured since
April 12, 1901:&mdash;

&#8220;With regard to rank and file, they should all, upon surrender, after giving up their
arms, sign a document before the Resident Magistrate of the district in which the
surrender takes place, acknowledging themselves guilty of high treason, and the punishment
to be awarded to them, provided they shall not have been guilty of murder or other
acts contrary to the usages of civilised warfare, should be that they shall not be entitled
for life to be registered as voters or to vote at any Parliamentary, Divisional Council, or
Municipal election. With reference to Justices of the Peace and Field-Cornets of Cape
Colony and all other persons holding an official position under the Government of Cape
Colony, or who may occupy the position of commandant of rebel or Burgher forces, they
shall be tried for high treason before the ordinary court of the country or such special
court as may be hereafter constituted by law, the punishment for their offence to be left
to the discretion of court, with this proviso, that in no case shall penalty of death be
inflicted.&#8221;

The Natal Government are of opinion that rebels should be dealt with according to the
law of the colony.

THE SIGNING OF THE TERMS.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 31, 1902, 5.15 P.M.

It is now settled that the Boer representatives will come here immediately, and also the
High Commissioner from Johannesburg. It is possible that the document will be signed
to-night. I have received from them a statement saying that they accept and are prepared
to sign.

From Lord Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War.

Pretoria, May 31, 1902, 11.15 P.M.

Negotiations with Boer delegates. The document containing terms of surrender was
signed here this evening at 10.30 P.M. by all Boer representatives, as well as by Lord
Milner and myself.[Pg 210]

From Lord Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.

Pretoria, June 1, 10.15 A.M.

The agreement, as amended by his Majesty&#8217;s Government in your telegram of May 27,
was signed just before 11 P.M. last night by Lord Kitchener and myself and ten Boer
delegates, six representing the Transvaal and four Orange Free State. A resolution of
Burgher assembly at Vereeniging authorising them to sign was put in by them before
signing it. Names of signatories are the same as those in original draft sent in Lord
Kitchener&#8217;s telegram, except that the initials had been corrected in some cases and Mr.
Steyn&#8217;s name was omitted. He was too ill to come up, and had already taken his parole.
The order of signatories is chiefly the same, except that De Wet signed first of the Orange
River Colony delegates, Hertzog next, and then Brebner, the reason being that De Wet
was nominated &#8220;Acting President&#8221; by Steyn on retiring.

OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AFTER THE BATTLE
OF COLENSO, DECEMBER 15, 1899

Since the conduct of General Sir Redvers Buller in regard to the Relief
of Ladysmith has been much discussed, it seems necessary for the sake of
the completeness of this Record of the War to reproduce, without comment,
the Official Correspondence which followed the defeat at Colenso. General
Buller himself forwarded the Despatches to the Press Association, accompanied
by the following letter:&mdash;

&#8220;17 Lowdnes Square, W., July 7, 1902.

&#8220;I send you the enclosed document in the exact form in which it has been supplied to
me by the Secretary of State for War for publication, and I shall be much obliged if you
will kindly circulate it to all newspapers, together with this letter, as I wish to supplement
the document by the remark that I was delighted to receive the answer of the Secretary of
State for War of the 16th December 1899, because it assured me that forces which I had
been apprehensive were pledged in another and less important direction would be at
my disposal for operations in Natal. Thanking you in anticipation, I am, sir, yours
faithfully,&#8221;

Redvers Buller, General.&#8221;

From Sir R. Buller to the Secretary of State for War.

&#8220;Chieveley Camp, December 15, 1899.

&#8220;A serious question is raised by my failure to-day. I do not now consider that I am
strong enough to relieve Ladysmith. Colenso is a fortress which, if not captured by a rush,
could, I think, only be taken by a siege. Within the eight miles from the point of attack
there is no water, and in this weather that exhausts infantry. The place is fully entrenched.
I do not think we saw either a gun or a Boer all day, but the fire brought to bear on us was
very heavy. The infantry were willing enough to fight, but the intense heat absolutely
exhausted them. I consider I ought to let Ladysmith go and to occupy a good position for
the defence of South Natal, and so let time help us. But I feel I ought to consult you on
such a step. Twenty thousand men, I consider, faced us to-day; both in arms and in position
they had the advantage. They admit, indeed, that they suffered severely, but my men
are dispirited because they have not seen a dead Boer. My losses have not been very
heavy; much heavier, indeed, I could have made them, but the moment I failed to get on
the run the result would have been the same. I was beaten. I now feel I cannot say that
with my available force I can relieve Ladysmith, and I suggest that for me to occupy a
defensive position and fight it out in a country better suited to our tactics is the best thing
that I can do.[Pg 211]&#8221;

From the Secretary of State for War to General Sir R. Buller.

&#8220;War Office, December 16, 1899.

&#8220;The abandonment of White&#8217;s force and its consequent surrender is regarded by the
Government as a national disaster of the greatest magnitude. We would urge you to devise
another attempt to carry out its relief, not necessarily viâ Colenso, making use of the
additional men now arriving if you think fit.&#8221;

From Sir R. Buller to Sir G. White.

&#8220;December 16, 1899.

&#8220;I tried Colenso yesterday but failed; the enemy is too strong for my force, except with
siege operations, and these will take one full month to prepare. Can you last so long? If
not, how many days can you give me in which to take up defensive position? After which
I suggest you firing away as much ammunition as you can and making best terms you can.
I can remain here if you have alternative suggestion, but unaided I cannot break in. I find
my Infantry cannot fight more than ten miles from camp, and then only if water can be got,
and it is scarce here.&#8221;

Note.&mdash;In his subsequent message of 17th December Sir R. Buller said
the above message had been signalled correctly, but asked to make the following
corrections:&mdash;

&#8220;Strike out from &#8216;If not how many&#8217; down to &#8216;after which&#8217; inclusive, and substitute
&#8216;How many days can you hold out?&#8217; Add to end of message, &#8216;Whatever happens
recollect to burn your cipher, decipher, and code-books, and all deciphered messages.&#8217;&#8221;

Message of 16th December, as altered by that of 17th December 1899:&mdash;

&#8220;I tried Colenso yesterday but failed; the enemy is too strong for my force, except with
siege operations, and these will take one full month to prepare. Can you last so long?
How many days can you hold out? I suggest you firing away as much ammunition as you
can and making best terms you can. I can remain here if you have alternative suggestion,
but unaided I cannot break in. I find my Infantry cannot fight more than ten miles from
camp, and then only if water can be got, and it is scarce here. Whatever happens recollect
to burn your cipher, decipher, and code-books, and all deciphered messages.&#8221;

From Sir G. White to Sir R. Buller.

&#8220;December 16, 1899.

&#8220;Yours of to-day received and understood. My suggestion is that you take up strongest
available position that will enable you to keep touch of the enemy and harass him constantly
with artillery fire, and in other ways as much as possible. I can make food last for much
longer than a month, and will not think of making terms till I am forced to. You may
have hit enemy harder than you think. All our native spies report that your artillery
fire made considerable impression on enemy. Have your losses been very heavy? If you
lose touch of enemy, it will immensely increase his opportunities of crushing me, and have
worse effect elsewhere. While you are in touch with him, and in communication with me,
he has both of our forces to reckon with. Make every effort to get reinforcements as early
as possible, including India, and enlist every man in both colonies who will serve and can
ride. Things may look brighter.

&#8220;The loss of 12,000 men here would be a heavy blow to England. We must not yet
think of it. I fear I could not cut my way to you. Enteric fever is increasing alarmingly
here. There are now 180 cases, all within last month. Answer fully; I am keeping everything
secret for the present till I know your plans.&#8221;

[Pg 212]

RECIPIENTS OF THE VICTORIA CROSS

(Continued)

King Edward VII. was pleased to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross
on the following officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, whose
claims were submitted to his Majesty&#8217;s approval, for their conspicuous
bravery in South Africa, as stated against their names:&mdash;

Captain H. N. Schofield,[11] Royal Field
Artillery.&mdash;At Colenso, on December 15, 1899,
when the detachments serving the guns of the
14th and 60th Batteries Royal Field Artillery
had all been killed, wounded, or driven from
them by infantry fire at close range, Captain
Schofield went out when the first attempt was
made to extricate the guns, and assisted in
withdrawing the two that were saved.

Private C. Ravenhill, 2nd Battalion Royal
Scots Fusiliers.&mdash;At Colenso, on December 15,
1899, Private Ravenhill went several times,
under a heavy fire, from his sheltered position
as one of the escort to the guns, to assist the
officers and drivers who were trying to withdraw
the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries
Royal Field Artillery, when the detachments
serving them had all been killed, wounded, or
driven from them by infantry fire at close
range, and helped to limber up one of the guns
that were saved.

Lieutenant (now Captain and Brevet-Major)
J. E. I. Masterson, 1st Battalion
Devonshire Regiment.&mdash;During the action at
Wagon Hill on January 6, 1900, Lieutenant
Masterson commanded, with the greatest
gallantry and dash, one of the three companies
of his regiment which charged a ridge held by
the enemy and captured their position. The
companies were then exposed to a most heavy
and galling fire from the right and left front.
Lieutenant Masterson undertook to give a
message to the Imperial Light Horse, who
were holding a ridge some hundred yards
behind, to fire to the left front and endeavour
to check the enemy&#8217;s fire. In taking this
message he crossed an open space of a hundred
yards which was swept by a most heavy cross
fire, and though badly wounded in both thighs
managed to crawl in and deliver his message
before falling exhausted into the Imperial
Light Horse trench. His unselfish heroism
was undoubtedly the means of saving several
lives.

Privates R. Scott and J. Pitts, 1st
Battalion Manchester Regiment.&mdash;During the
attack on Cæsar&#8217;s Camp, in Natal, on January
6, 1900, these two men occupied a sangar, on
the left of which all our men had been shot
down and their positions occupied by Boers,
and held their post for fifteen hours without
food or water, all the time under an extremely
heavy fire, keeping up their fire and a smart
look-out, though the Boers occupied some
sangars on their immediate left rear. Private
Scott was wounded.

Sergeant W. Firth, 1st Battalion West
Riding Regiment.&mdash;During the action at Plowman&#8217;s
Farm, near Arundel, Cape Colony, on
February 24, 1900, Lance-Corporal Blackman,
having been wounded and lying exposed to a
hot fire at a range of from four to five hundred
yards, Sergeant Firth picked him up and
carried him to cover. Later in the day, when
the enemy had advanced to within a short
distance of the firing line. Second Lieutenant
Wilson being dangerously wounded and in a
most exposed position, Sergeant Firth carried
him over the crest of the ridge, which was
being held by the troops, to shelter, and was
himself shot through the nose and eye while
doing so.

Corporal J. J. Clements, Rimington&#8217;s
Guides.&mdash;On February 24, 1900, near Strijdenburg,
when dangerously wounded through the
lungs and called on to surrender, Corporal
Clements threw himself into the midst of a
party of five Boers, shooting three of them
with his revolver, and thereby causing the
whole party to surrender to himself and two
unwounded men of Rimington&#8217;s Guides.

Captain N R. House, New South Wales
Medical Staff Corps.&mdash;During the action at
Vredefort on July 24, 1900, Captain House went
out under a heavy cross fire and picked up a
wounded man and carried him to a place of
shelter.

Sergeant H. Hampton, 2nd Battalion
Liverpool Regiment.&mdash;On August 21, 1900, at
Van Wyk&#8217;s Vlei, Sergeant Hampton, who was
in command of a small party of Mounted Infantry,
held an important position for some
time against heavy odds, and when compelled
to retire saw all his men into safety, and then,
though he had himself been wounded in the
head, supported Lance-Corporal Walsh, who
was unable to walk, until the latter was again
hit and apparently killed, Sergeant Hampton
himself being again wounded a short time
after.

Private E. Durrant, 2nd Battalion Rifle
Brigade.&mdash;At Bergendal, on August 27, 1900,
Acting-Corporal Wellar having been wounded,
and being somewhat dazed, got up from his
prone position in the firing line, exposing him[Pg 213]self
still more to the enemy&#8217;s fire, and commenced
to run towards them. Private Durrant
rose, and pulling him down endeavoured to
keep him quiet, but finding this impossible
he took him up and carried him back for 200
yards under a heavy fire to shelter, returning
immediately to his place in the line.

Private C. Kennedy, 2nd Battalion Highland
Light Infantry.&mdash;At Dewetsdorp, on
November 22, 1900, Private Kennedy carried
a comrade, who was dangerously wounded and
bleeding to death, from Gibraltar Hill to the
hospital, a distance of three-quarters of a mile,
under a very hot fire. On the following day,
volunteers having been called for to take a
message to the commandant across a space
over which it was almost certain death to venture,
Private Kennedy at once stepped forward.
He did not, however, succeed in delivering the
message, as he was severely wounded before
he had gone twenty yards.

Farrier-Major W. J. Hardham, 4th New
Zealand Contingent.&mdash;On January 28, 1901,
near Naauwpoort, this non-commissioned officer
was with a section which was extended and
hotly engaged with a party of about twenty
Boers. Just before the force commenced to
retire Trooper M&#8217;Crae was wounded and his
horse killed. Farrier-Major Hardham at once
went under a heavy fire to his assistance, dismounted
and placed him on his own horse, and
ran alongside until he had guided him to a
place of safety.

Sergeant W. B. Traynor, 2nd Battalion the
Prince of Wales&#8217;s Own (West Yorkshire Regiment).&mdash;During
the night attack on Bothwell
Camp on February 6, 1901, Sergeant Traynor
jumped out of a trench and ran out under
an extremely heavy fire to the assistance of a
wounded man. While running out he was
severely wounded, and being unable to carry
the man by himself he called for assistance.
Lance-Corporal Lintott at once came to him,
and between them they carried the wounded
soldier into shelter. After this, although
severely wounded, Sergeant Traynor remained
in command of his section, and was most cheerful,
encouraging his men till the attack failed.

Lieutenant F. B. Dugdale, 5th Lancers.&mdash;On
March 3, 1901, Lieutenant Dugdale, who
was in command of a small outpost near Derby,
having been ordered to retire, his patrol came
under a heavy fire at a range of about two
hundred and fifty yards, and a sergeant, two
men, and a horse were hit. Lieutenant Dugdale
dismounted and placed one of the wounded
men on his own horse; he then caught another
horse, galloped up to a wounded man and took
him up behind him, and brought both men
safely out of action.

Lieutenant F. W. Bell, West Australian
Mounted Infantry.&mdash;At Brakpan, on May 16,
1901, when retiring through a heavy fire after
holding the right flank, Lieutenant Bell noticed
a man dismounted and returned and took him
up behind him. The horse, not being equal to
the weight, fell with them. Lieutenant Bell
then remained behind and covered the man&#8217;s
retirement till he was out of danger.

Sergeant James Rogers, South African
Constabulary.&mdash;On the 15th June 1901, during
a skirmish near Thabanchu, a party of the
rearguard of Captain Sitwell&#8217;s column, consisting
of Lieutenant F. Dickinson, Sergeant
James Rogers, and six men of the South
African Constabulary, was suddenly attacked
by about sixty Boers. Lieutenant Dickinson&#8217;s
horse having been shot, that officer was compelled
to follow his men on foot. Sergeant
Rogers seeing this, rode back, firing as he did
so, took Lieutenant Dickinson up behind him,
and carried him for half a mile on his horse.
The sergeant then returned to within four
hundred yards of the enemy and carried away,
one after the other, two men who had lost
their horses, after which he caught the horses
of two other men, and helped the men to
mount. All this was done under a very heavy
rifle fire. The Boers were near enough to
Sergeant Rogers to call on him to surrender:
his only answer was to continue firing.

Lieutenant W. J. English, 2nd Scottish
Horse.&mdash;This officer with five men was holding
the right of a position at Vlakfontein on July 3,
1901, during an attack by the Boers. Two
of his men were killed and two wounded, but
the position was still held largely owing to
Lieutenant English&#8217;s personal pluck. When
the ammunition ran short he went over to the
next party and obtained more; to do this he
had to cross some fifteen yards of open ground
under a heavy fire at a range of from twenty
to thirty yards.

Private H. G. Crandon, 18th Hussars.&mdash;On
July 4, 1901, at Springbok Laagte, Privates
Berry and Crandon were scouting towards
a kopje when the Boers suddenly opened
fire on them at a range of one hundred yards.
Private Berry&#8217;s horse fell and became disabled,
and he was himself shot in the right hand and
left shoulder. Private Crandon at once rode
back under a heavy fire to his assistance, gave
up his horse to the wounded man to enable
him to reach shelter, and followed him on foot
having to run for one thousand one hundred
yards, all the time under fire.

Sergeant-Major Alexander Young, Cape
Police.&mdash;Towards the close of the action at
Ruiter&#8217;s Kraal, on the 13th of August 1901,
Sergeant-Major Young, with a handful of men,
rushed some kopjes which were being held by
Commandant Erasmus and about twenty Boers.
On reaching these kopjes the enemy were seen
galloping back to another kopje held by the
Boers. Sergeant-Major Young then galloped
on some fifty yards ahead of his party, and
closing with the enemy shot one of them and
captured Commandant Erasmus, the latter
firing at him three times at point blank range
before being taken prisoner.

Lieutenant L. A. E. Price Davies. D.S.O.,
King&#8217;s Royal Rifle Corps.&mdash;At Blood River
Poort, on September 17, 1901, when the Boers
had overwhelmed the right of the British
column, and some four hundred of them were
galloping round the flank and rear of the guns,
riding up to the drivers (who were trying to
get the guns away) and calling on them to[Pg 214]
surrender, Lieutenant Price Davies, hearing
an order to fire on the charging Boers, at once
drew his revolver and dashed in among them,
firing at them in a most gallant and desperate
attempt to rescue the guns. He was immediately
shot and knocked off his horse, but was
not mortally wounded, although he had ridden
to what seemed to be almost certain death
without a moment&#8217;s hesitation.

Driver F. G. Bradley, 69th Battery Royal
Field Artillery.&mdash;During the action at Itala,
Zululand, on the 26th September 1901, Major
Chapman called for volunteers to carry ammunition
up the hill. To do this a space of about
one hundred and fifty yards swept by a heavy
cross fire had to be crossed. Driver Lancashire
and Gunner Bull at once came forward and
started, but half-way across Driver Lancashire
fell wounded. Driver Bradley and Gunner
Rabb without a moment&#8217;s hesitation ran out
and caught Driver Lancashire up, and Gunner
Rabb carried him under cover, the ground
being swept by bullets the whole time. Driver
Bradley then, with the aid of Gunner Boddy,
succeeded in getting the ammunition up the hill.

Private W. Bees, 1st Battalion Derbyshire
Regiment.&mdash;Private Bees was one of the
Maxim-gun detachment which at Moedwil on
the 30th September 1901 had six men hit out
of nine. Hearing his wounded comrades asking
for water he went forward, under a heavy
fire, to a spruit held by Boers about five
hundred yards ahead of the gun, and brought
back a kettle full of water. In going and
returning he had to pass within one hundred
yards of some rocks also held by Boers, and
the kettle which he was carrying was hit by
several bullets.

Lieutenant L. C. Maygar, 5th Victorian
Mounted Rifles.&mdash;At Geelhoutboom, on the
23rd November 1901, Lieutenant Maygar
galloped out and ordered the men of a detached
post, which was being outflanked, to
retire. The horse of one of them being shot
under him, when the enemy were within two
hundred yards, Lieutenant Maygar dismounted
and lifted him on to his own horse, which
bolted into boggy ground, causing both of
them to dismount. On extricating the horse,
and finding that it could not carry both, Lieutenant
Maygar again put the man on its back
and told him to gallop for cover at once, he
himself proceeding on foot. All this took
place under a very heavy fire.

Surgeon-Captain T. J. Crean, 1st Imperial
Light Horse.&mdash;During the action with De Wet
at Tygerskloof, on the 18th December 1901,
this officer continued to attend to the wounded
in the firing line, under a heavy fire at only
one hundred and fifty yards&#8217; range, after he
had himself been wounded, and only desisted
when he was hit a second time, and, as it was
at first thought, mortally wounded.

Surgeon-Captain A. Martin-Leake,
South African Constabulary.&mdash;During the
action at Vlakfontein, on the 8th of February
1902, Surgeon-Captain Martin-Leake went up
to a wounded man and attended to him under
a heavy fire from about forty Boers at a hundred
yards&#8217; range. He then went to the assistance
of a wounded officer, and while trying to place
him in a comfortable position was shot three
times, but would not give in till he rolled over
thoroughly exhausted. All the eight men at
this point were wounded, and while they were
lying on the veldt Surgeon-Captain Martin-Leake
refused water till every one else had been
served.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
