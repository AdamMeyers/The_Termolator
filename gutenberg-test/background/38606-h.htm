<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This work is intended as a practical guide to those
  about to commence Poultry keeping, and to provide those
  who already have experience on the subject with the most
  trustworthy information compiled from the best authorities
  of all ages, and the most recent improvements in Poultry
  Breeding and Management. The Author believes that he
  has presented his readers with a greater amount of valuable
  information and practical directions on the various
  points treated than will be found in most similar works.
  The book is not the result of the Author's own experience
  solely, and he acknowledges the assistance he has received
  from other authorities. Among those whom he has consulted
  he desires specially to acknowledge his obligations
  to Mr. Tegetmeier, whose &quot;Poultry Book&quot; (published by
  Messrs. Routledge &amp; Sons, London) contains his especial
  knowledge of the Diseases of Poultry; and to Mr. L.
  Wright, whose excellent and practical Treatise, entitled
  &quot;The Practical Poultry Keeper&quot; (published by Messrs.
  Cassell, Petter &amp; Galpin, London), cannot be too highly
  commended.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>Until of late years the breeding of poultry has been
  almost generally neglected in Great Britain. Any kind of
  mongrel fowl would do for a farmer's stock, although he
  fully appreciated the importance of breeding in respect of his
  cattle and pigs, and the value of improved seeds. Had he
  thought at all upon the subject, it must have occurred to
  him that poultry might be improved by breeding from
  select specimens as much as any other kind of live stock.
  The French produce a very much greater number of fowls
  and far finer ones for market than we do. In France,
  Bonington Mowbray observes, &quot;poultry forms an important
  part of the live stock of the farmer, and the poultry-yards
  supply more animal food to the great mass of the
  community than the butchers' shops&quot;; while in Egypt, and
  some other countries of the East, from time immemorial,
  vast numbers of chickens have been hatched in ovens by
  artificial heat to supply the demand for poultry; but in
  Great Britain poultry-keeping has been generally neglected,
  eggs are dear, and all kinds of poultry so great a luxury
  that the lower classes and a large number of the middle
  seldom, if ever, taste it, except perhaps once a year in the
  form of a Christmas goose, while hundreds of thousands
  cannot afford even this. It is computed that a
  million of eggs are eaten daily in London and its suburbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> alone; yet this vast number only gives one egg to every
  three mouths. &quot;It is a national waste,&quot; says Mr. Edwards,
  &quot;importing eggs by the hundreds of millions, and poultry
  by tens of thousands, when we are feeding our cattle upon
  corn, and grudging it to our poultry; although the return
  made from the former, it is generally admitted, is not five
  per cent. beyond the value of the corn consumed, whereas
  an immense percentage can be realised by feeding poultry.&quot;
  A writer in the <i>Times</i>, of February 1, 1853, states that,
  while it will take five years to fatten an ox to the weight
  of sixty stone, which will produce a profit of &pound;30, the same
  sum may be realised in five months by feeding an equal
  weight of poultry for the table.</p>
<p>Although fowls are so commonly kept, the proportion to
  the population is still very small, and the number of those
  who rear and manage them profitably still smaller, chiefly
  because most people keep them without system or order,
  and have not given the slightest attention to the subject.
  Nevertheless, it costs no more trouble and much less
  expense to keep fowls successfully and profitably, for
  neglected fowls are always falling sick, or getting into
  mischief and causing annoyance, and often expense and
  loss. &quot;A man,&quot; says Mr. Edwards, &quot;who expects a good
  return of flesh and eggs from fowls insufficiently fed and
  cared for, is like a miller expecting to get meal from a
  neglected mill, to which he does not supply grain.&quot;</p>
<p>The antiquated idea that fowls on a farm did mischief to
  the crops has been proved to be false; for if the grain is
  sown as deeply as it should be, they cannot reach it by
  scratching; and, besides, they greatly prefer worms and
  insects. Mr. Mechi says, &quot;commend me to poultry as
  the farmer's best friend,&quot; and considers the value of fowls,
  in destroying the vast number of worms, grubs, flies, beetles,
  insects, larv&aelig;, &amp;c., which they devour, as incalculable; and
  the same may be said as to their destruction of the seeds of
  weeds. They also consume large quantities of kitchen and
  table refuse, which is generally otherwise wasted, and often
  allowed to decay and become a source of disease, or at
  least of impurity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>The enormous prices paid at the poultry shows of 1852
  and 1853 for fancy fowls gave a new impulse to poultry-keeping;
  and many persons who formerly thought the
  management of poultry beneath their attention, now superintend
  their yards. Mrs. Ferguson Blair, now the Hon.
  Mrs. Arbuthnot, the authoress of the &quot;Henwife,&quot; whose
  experience may be judged by the fact that she gained in
  four years upwards of 460 prizes in England and Scotland,
  and personally superintended the management of forty
  separate yards, in which above 1,000 chickens were hatched
  annually, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;I began to breed poultry for amusement only, then for
  exhibition, and lastly, was glad to take the trouble to make
  it pay, and do not like my poultry-yard less because it is
  not a loss. It is impossible to imagine any occupation
  more suited to a lady, living in the country, than that of
  poultry rearing. If she has any superfluous affection to
  bestow, let it be on her chicken-kind and it will be returned
  cent. per cent. Are you a lover of nature? come with me
  and view, with delighted gaze, her chosen dyes. Are you
  a utilitarian? rejoice in such an increase of the people's
  food. Are you a philanthropist? be grateful that yours
  has been the privilege to afford a <i>possible</i> pleasure to the
  poor man, to whom so many are <i>impossible</i>. Such we
  often find fond of poultry&mdash;no mean judges of it, and frequently
  successful in exhibition. A poor man's pleasure in
  victory is, at least, as great as that of his richer brother.
  Let him, then, have the field whereon to fight for it. Encourage
  village poultry-shows, not only by your patronage,
  but also by your presence. A taste for such may save
  many from dissipation and much evil; no man can win
  poultry honours and haunt the taproom too.&quot;</p>
<p>For those who desire to encourage a taste for poultry
  keeping in young people, and their humbler neighbours, we
  would recommend our smaller work on the subject as a
  suitable present.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;It becomes,&quot; says Miss Harriet Martineau, &quot;an interesting
  wonder every year why the rural cottagers of the United
  Kingdom do not rear fowls almost universally, seeing how
  little the cost would be and how great the demand. We
  import many millions of eggs annually. Why should we
  import any? Wherever there is a cottage family living
  on potatoes or better fare, and grass growing anywhere
  near them, it would be worth while to nail up a little penthouse,
  and make nests of clean straw, and go in for a
  speculation in eggs and chickens. Seeds, worms, and
  insects go a great way in feeding poultry in such places;
  and then there are the small and refuse potatoes from the
  heap, and the outside cabbage leaves, and the scraps of all
  sorts. Very small purchases of broken rice (which is
  extremely cheap), inferior grain, and mixed meal, would do
  all else that is necessary. There would be probably larger
  losses from vermin than in better guarded places; but these
  could be well afforded as a mere deduction from considerable
  gains. It is understood that the keeping of poultry is
  largely on the increase in the country generally, and even
  among cottagers; but the prevailing idea is of competition
  as to races and specimens for the poultry-yard, rather than
  of meeting the demand for eggs and fowls for the table.&quot;</p>
<p>With the exception of prizes for Dorkings, which are
  chiefly bred for market, our poultry-shows have always
  looked upon fowls as if they were merely ornamental birds,
  and have framed their standards of excellence accordingly,
  and not with any regard to the production of profitable
  poultry, which is much to be regretted.</p>
<p>Martin Doyle, the cottage economist of Ireland, in his
  &#39;Hints to Small Holders,&#39; observes that &quot;a few cocks and
  hens, if they be prevented from scratching in the garden,
  are a useful and appropriate stock about a cottage, the
  warmth of which causes them to lay eggs in winter&mdash;no
  trifling advantage to the children when milk is scarce. The
  French, who are extremely fond of eggs, and contrive to
  have them in great abundance, feed the fowls so well on
  curds and buckwheat, and keep them so warm, that they
  have plenty of eggs even in winter. Now, in our country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> (Ireland), especially in a gentleman's fowl yard, there is not
  an egg to be had in cold weather; but the warmth of the
  poor man's cabin insures him an egg even in the most
  ungenial season.&quot;</p>
<p>Such fowls obtain fresh air, fresh grass, and fresh ground
  to scratch in, and prosper in spite of the most miserable,
  puny, mongrel stock, deteriorating year after year from
  breeding in and in, without the introduction of fresh blood
  even of the same indifferent description. Many an honest
  cottager might keep himself and family from the parish
  by the aid of a small stock of poultry, if some kind
  poultry-keeper would present him with two or three good
  fowls to begin with, for the cottager has seldom capital
  even for so small a purchase.</p>
<p>Considerable profit may be made by the sale of eggs for hatching and surplus
  stock, if the breeds kept are good, and the stock known to be pure and vigorous.
  The &#39;Henwife&#39;
  says: &quot;You may reduce your expenses by selling
  eggs for setting, at a remunerative price. No one should
  be ashamed to own what he is not ashamed to do; therefore,
  boldly announce your superfluous eggs for sale, at
  such a price as you think the public will pay for them.&quot;
  This is now done extensively by breeders of rank and
  eminence, especially through the London <i>Field</i> and agricultural
  papers. But, &quot;beware of sending such eggs to
  market. Every one would be set, and you might find
  yourself beaten by your own stock, very likely in your own
  local show, and at small cost to the exhibitor.&quot;</p>
<p>The great secret of success in keeping fowls profitably is to
  hatch chiefly in March and April; encourage the pullets by
  proper feeding to lay at the age of six months; and fatten
  and dispose of them when about nineteen months old, just
  before their first adult moult; and never to allow a cockerel
  to exceed the age of fourteen weeks before it is fattened
  and disposed of.</p>

<h3>THE FOWL-HOUSE.</h3>
<p>In this work we shall consider the accommodation and
  requisites for keeping fowls successfully on a moderate
  scale, and the reader must adapt them to his own premises,
  circumstances, and requirements. Everywhere there must
  be some alterations, omissions, or compromises. We shall
  state the essentials for their proper accommodation, and
  describe the mode of constructing houses, sheds, and
  arranging runs, and the reader must then form his plan
  according to his own wishes, resources, and the capabilities
  of the place. The climate of Great Britain being so very
  variable in itself, and differing in its temperature so much
  in different parts, no one manner or material for building
  the fowl-house can be recommended for all cases.</p>
<p>Plans for poultry establishments on large scales for the
  hatching, rearing, and fattening of fowls, turkeys, ducks,
  and geese, are given in our smaller work on Poultry, referred
  to on <a href="#Page_3">page 3</a>.</p>
<p>The best aspects for the fowl-house are south and south-east,
  and sloping ground is preferable to flat.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only of late years,&quot; says Mr. Baily, &quot;poultry-houses
  have been much thought of. In large farmyards,
  where there are cart-houses, calf-pens, pig-styes, cattle-sheds,
  shelter under the eaves of barns, and numerous other
  roosting-places, not omitting the trees in the immediate
  vicinity, they are little required&mdash;fowls will generally do
  better by choosing for themselves; and it is beyond a doubt
  healthier for them to be spread about in this manner, than
  to be confined to one place. But a love of order, on the one
  hand, and a dread of thieves or foxes on the other, will
  sometimes make it desirable to have a proper poultry-house.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Each family of fowls should, if possible, have a house
  and run; and if they are kept as breeding stock, and the
  breeds are to be preserved pure, this is essential. And
  where many kinds are kept, the various houses must be
  adapted to the peculiarities of the different breeds, in order
  to do justice to them all, and to attain success in each.</p>
<p>The size of the house and the extent of the yard or run
  should be proportioned to the number of fowls kept; but
  it is better for the house to be too small than too large,
  particularly in winter, for the mutual imparting of animal
  heat. It is found by experience that when fowls are
  crowded into a small space, their desire for laying continues
  even in winter; and there is no fear of engendering
  disease by crowding if the house is properly ventilated,
  and thoroughly cleansed every day. Mr. Baily kept for
  years a cock and four hens in a portable wooden house six
  feet square, and six feet high in the centre, the sides being
  somewhat shorter, and says such a house would hold six
  hens as well as four. Ventilating holes were made near
  the top. It had no floor, being placed upon the ground,
  and could be moved at pleasure by means of two poles
  placed through two staples fixed at the end of each side.
  A few Cochin-Chinas may be kept where there is no other
  convenience than an outhouse six feet square to serve for
  their roosting, laying, and sitting, with a yard of twice that
  size attached. Mr. Wright &quot;once knew a young man
  who kept fowls most profitably, with only a house of his
  own construction, not more than three feet square, and a
  run of the same width, under twelve feet long.&quot; The
  French breeders keep their fowls in as small a space as
  possible, in order to generate and preserve the warmth
  that will induce them to lay; while the English breeders
  allow more space for exercise, larger houses, and free circulation
  of air. The French mode, is very likely the best
  for the winter and the English for the summer, but the
  two opposite methods may be made available by having
  one or more extra houses and runs into which the fowls
  can be distributed in the summer. A close, warm roosting-place
  will cause the production of more eggs in winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> when they are scarcest and most valuable, while air and
  exercise are necessary to rear superior fowls for the table;
  and if they can have the run of a farmyard or good fields
  in which to pick up grain or insects, their flesh will be far
  superior in flavour to that of fowls kept in confinement, or
  crammed in coops.</p>
<p>Almost any outbuilding, shed, or lean-to, may be easily
  and cheaply converted into a good fowl-house by the exercise
  of a little thought and ingenuity.</p>
<p>The best material to build a house with is brick, but the
  cheapest to be durable is board, with the roof also of wood,
  covered with patent felt. One objection to timber houses
  is their being combustible, and easily ignited, and houses
  had better be built of a single brick in thickness, unless
  cheapness is a great object.</p>
<p>A lean-to fowl-house may be constructed for a very small
  sum, with boards an inch thick, against the west or south
  side of any wall. Whenever wood is employed it should
  be tongued, which is a very cheap method of providing
  against warping by heat, or admitting wind or rain; lying
  flat against the uprights, it saves material and has an
  external appearance far superior to any other method of
  boarding. If the second coat of paint is rough cast over
  with sand, it will greatly improve the appearance, and the
  house will not be unsightly even in the ornamental part of
  a gentleman's grounds.</p>
<p>A house may be built very cheaply by driving poles into
  the ground at equal distances, and nailing weather-boarding
  upon their outside. If it is to be square, one pole should
  be placed at each corner, and two more will be required
  for the door-posts. The house may be made with five, six,
  or more sides, as many poles being used as there are sides,
  and the door may occupy one side if the house be small
  and the side narrow, otherwise two door-posts will be required.
  If the boards are not tongued together, the chinks
  between them must be well caulked by driving in string or
  tow with a blunt chisel, for it is not only necessary to keep
  out the rain but also to keep out the wind, which has great
  influence on the health and laying of the fowls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Where double boarding is employed for the sides, the
  house may be made much warmer by filling up the space
  with straw, or still better with marsh reeds, so durable for
  thatching. This plan, unfortunately, affords a shelter for
  rats, mice, and insects, and therefore, if adopted, it will be
  highly advantageous to form the inside boarding in panels,
  so as to be removable at pleasure for examination and
  cleansing.</p>
<p>For the roof, tiles or slates alone are not sufficient, but,
  if used, must have a boarding or ceiling under them; otherwise
  all the heat generated by the fowls will escape through
  the numerous interstices, and it will be next to impossible
  to keep the house warm in winter. A corrugated roof of
  galvanised iron may be used instead, but a ceiling also will
  be absolutely necessary for the sake of warmth. A rough
  ceiling of lath and plaster not only preserves the warmth
  generated by the fowls and keeps out the cold, but has the
  great advantage of being easily lime-washed, an operation
  that should be performed at least four or five times a year.
  Boards alone make a very good and cheap roof. They
  may be laid either horizontally, one plank overlapping the
  other, and the whole well tarred two or three times, and
  once every autumn afterwards; or they may be laid perpendicularly
  side by side, fitting closely, in which case they
  should be well tarred, then covered with old sheeting,
  waste calico, or thick brown paper tightly stretched over
  it, and afterwards brushed over with hot tar, or a mixture
  of tar boiled with a little lime, and applied while hot;
  this, soaking through the calico, cements it to the roof, and
  makes it waterproof. But board covered with patent felt,
  and tarred once a year, is the best. The roof ought to
  project considerably beyond the walls, in order to prevent
  the rain from dripping down them.</p>
<p>Ventilation is most important, and the house should be
  high, especially if there are many fowls, for by having it
  lofty a current of air can pass through it far above the
  level of the fowls, and purify the atmosphere without
  causing a draught near them. They very much dislike a
  draught, and will alter their positions to avoid it, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> unable to do so, will seek another roosting-place. Ventilation
  may be obtained by leaving out some bricks in the
  wall or making holes in the boarding; and when there is a
  shed at the side of the fowl-house, by boring a few holes
  near the top of the wall next to the shed; all ventilators
  should be considerably above the perches, in order to avoid
  a draught near to the fowls; and should be entirely closed
  at night in severe weather. The best method of ventilation
  for a fowl-house of sufficient size and height, is by means
  of an opening in the highest part of the roof, covered with
  a lantern of laths or narrow boards, placed one over the
  other in a slanting position, with a small space between
  them like Venetian blinds.</p>
<p>Light is essential, not only for the health of the fowls,
  but in order that the state of the house may be seen, and
  the floor and perches may be well cleansed. It may be
  admitted either through a common window, a pane or two
  of thick glass placed in the sides, or glass tiles in the roof.
  It also induces them to take shelter there in rough
  weather.</p>
<p>Warmth is the most important point of all. Fowls that
  roost in cold houses and exposed places require more food
  and produce fewer eggs; and pullets which are usually
  forward in laying will not easily be induced to do so in
  severe weather if their house is not kept warm. It is a
  great advantage when the house backs a fire-place or stable.
  A gentleman told Mr. Baily that he &quot;had been very successful
  in raising early chickens in the north of Scotland,
  and he attributed much of it to the following arrangements.
  He had always from twenty to thirty oxen or other cattle
  fattening in a long building; he made his poultry-house to
  join this, and had ventilators and openings made in the
  partition, so that the heat of the cattle-shed passed into
  the fowl-house. Little good has resulted from the use of
  stoves, or hot-water pipes, for poultry; but by skilfully
  taking advantage of every circumstance like that above
  mentioned, and by consulting aspect and position, many
  valuable helps are obtained.&quot;</p>
<p>A house built of wood in the north of England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> Scotland must be lined, unless artificially warmed. Felt
  is the best material, as its strong smell of tar will keep
  away most insects. Matting is frequently used, and will
  make the house sufficiently warm, but it harbours vermin,
  and therefore, if used, should be only slightly fastened to
  the walls, so that it can be often taken down and well
  beaten, and, if necessary, fumigated.</p>
<p>Various materials are recommended for the flooring.
  Boards are warm, but they soon become foul. Beaten
  earth, with loose dust scattered over it some inches deep,
  is excellent for the feet of the birds, but is a harbour for
  the minute vermin which are often so troublesome, and
  even destructive, to domestic fowls. Mowbray recommends
  a floor of &quot;well-rammed chalk or earth, that its surface,
  being smooth, may present no impediment to being swept
  perfectly clean.&quot; Chalk laid on dry coal-ashes to absorb
  the moisture is excellent. A mixture of cow-dung and
  water, about the consistency of paint, put on the surface of
  the floor, no thicker than paint, gives it a hard surface
  which will bear sweeping down. It is used by the natives
  of India, not only for the floors, but often for the walls of
  their houses, and is supposed to be healthy in its application,
  and to keep away vermin. Miss Watts says: &quot;Dig
  out the floor to about a foot deep, and fill in with burnt
  clay, like that used extensively on railways, the strong
  gravel which is called 'metal' in road-making, or any loose
  dry material of the kind. Let this be well rammed down,
  and then lay over it, with a bricklayer's trowel, a flooring
  of a compost of cinder-ashes, gravel, quick-lime, and water.
  This flooring is without the objections due to those which
  are cold and damp, and those which imbibe foul moisture.
  Stone is too cold for a flooring; beaten earth or wood
  becomes foul when the place is inhabited by living animals;
  and a flooring of bricks possesses both these bad qualities
  united.&quot; Bricks are the worst of all materials; they retain
  moisture, whether atmospheric or arising from insufficient
  drainage; and thus the temperature is kept low, and disease
  too often follows, especially rheumatic attacks of the
  feet and legs. However, trodden earth makes a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> flooring, and it or other materials may easily be kept clean
  by placing moveable boards beneath the perches to receive
  the fowl-droppings. The floor should slope from every
  direction towards the door, to facilitate its cleansing, and
  to keep it dry.</p>
<p>Perches are generally placed too high, probably because
  it was noticed that fowls in their natural state, or when at
  large, usually roost upon high branches; but it should be
  observed that, in descending from lofty branches, they have
  a considerable distance to fly, and therefore alight on the
  ground gently, while in a confined fowl-house the bird
  flutters down almost perpendicularly, coming into contact
  with the floor forcibly, by which the keel of the breast-bone
  is often broken, and bumble-foot in Dorkings and corns
  are caused.</p>
<p>Some writers do not object to lofty perches, provided
  the fowls have a board with cross-pieces of wood fastened
  on to it reaching from the ground to the perch; but this
  does not obviate the evil, for they will only use it for
  ascent, and not for descent. The air, too, at the upper
  part of any dwelling-room, or house for animals, is much
  more impure than nearer the floor, because the air that
  has been breathed, and vapours from the body, are lighter
  than pure air, and consequently ascend to the top. The
  perches should therefore not be more than eighteen inches
  from the ground, unless the breed is very small and light.
  Perches are also generally made too small and round.
  When they are too small in proportion to the size of the
  birds, they are apt to cause the breast-bone of heavy fowls
  to grow crooked, which is a great defect, and very unsightly
  in a table-fowl. Those for heavy fowls should not
  be less than three inches in diameter. Capital perches
  may be formed of fir or larch poles, about three inches in
  diameter, split into two, the round side being placed uppermost;
  the birds' claws cling to it easily, and the bark is not
  so hard as planed wood. The perches, if made of timber,
  should be nearly square, with only the corners rounded off,
  as the feet of fowls are not formed for clasping smooth
  round poles. Those for chickens should not be thicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> than their claws can easily grasp, and neither too sharp
  nor too round.</p>
<p>When more than one row of perches is required they
  should be ranged obliquely&mdash;that is, one above and behind
  the other; by which arrangement each perch forms a step
  to the next higher one, and an equal convenience in descending,
  and the birds do not void their dung over each
  other. They should be placed two feet apart, and supported
  on bars of wood fixed to the walls at each end;
  and in order that they may be taken out to be cleaned,
  they should not be nailed to the supporter, but securely
  placed in niches cut in the bar, or by pieces of wood nailed
  to it like the rowlocks of a boat. If the wall space at the
  sides is required for laying-boxes, the perches must be
  shorter than the house, and the oblique bars which support
  them must be securely fastened to the back of the house,
  and, if necessary, have an upright placed beneath the upper
  end of each.</p>
<p>Some breeders prefer a moveable frame for roosting,
  formed of two poles of the required length, joined at each
  end by two narrow pieces; the frame being supported
  upon four or more legs, according to its length and the
  weight of the fowls. If necessary it should be strengthened
  by rails&mdash;connecting the bottoms of the legs, and by pieces
  crossing from each angle of the sides and ends. These
  frames can conveniently be moved out of the house when
  they require cleansing. Or it may be made of one pole
  supported at each end by two legs spread out widely apart,
  like two sides of an equilateral or equal-sided triangle. The
  perch may be made more secure for heavy fowls by a rail
  at each side fastened to each leg, about three inches from
  the foot.</p>
<p>Mr. Baily says: &quot;I had some fowls in a large outhouse,
  where they were well provided with perches; as there was
  plenty of room, I put some small faggots, cut for firing, at
  one extremity, and I found many of the fowls deserted
  their perches to roost on the faggots, which they evidently
  preferred.&quot;</p>
<p>Cochin-Chinas and Brahma Pootras do not require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> perches, but roost comfortably on a floor littered down
  warmly with straw. It should be gathered up every
  morning, and the floor cleaned and kept uncovered till
  night, when the straw, if clean, should be again laid down.
  It must be often changed. A bed of sand is also used, and
  a latticed floor even without straw, and some use latticed
  benches raised about six inches from the floor. But we
  should think that latticed roosting-places must be uncomfortable
  to fowls, and the dung which falls through is
  often unseen, and, consequently, liable to remain for too
  long a time, while a portion will stick to the sides of the
  lattice-work, and be not only difficult to see, but also to
  remove when seen. The &quot;Henwife&quot; finds, however, &quot;that
  if there are nests, there the Cochins will roost, in spite of
  all attempts to make them do otherwise.&quot; It is a good
  plan, in warm weather, occasionally to sprinkle water over
  and about the perches, and scatter a little powdered
  sulphur over the wetted parts, which will greatly tend to
  keep the fowls free from insect parasites.</p>
<p>The nests for laying in are usually made on the ground,
  or in a kind of trough, a little raised; but some use boxes
  or wicker-baskets, which are preferable, as they can be
  removed separately from time to time, and thoroughly
  cleansed from dust and vermin, and can also be kept a
  little apart from each other. These boxes or troughs
  should be placed against the sides of the house, and a
  board sloping forwards should be fixed above, to prevent
  the fowls from roosting upon the edges. If required, a
  row of laying-boxes or troughs may be placed on the
  ground, and another about a foot or eighteen inches above
  the floor. The nest should be made of wheaten, rye, or
  oaten straw, but never of hay, which is too hot, and
  favourable besides to the increase of vermin. Heath cut
  into short pieces forms excellent material for nests, but it
  cannot always be had. The material must be changed
  whenever it smells foul or musty, for if it is allowed to
  become offensive, the hens will often drop their eggs upon
  the ground sooner than go to the nest. When the fowl-house
  adjoins a passage, or it can be otherwise so contrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> it is an excellent plan to have a wooden flap made to open
  just above the back of the nests, so that the eggs can
  be removed without your going into the roosting-house,
  treading the dung about, and disturbing any birds that
  may be there, or about to enter to lay. Where possible
  the nests in the roosting-houses should be used for laying
  in only; and a separate house should be set apart for
  sitting hens. Where there are but a few fowls and
  only one house, if a hen is allowed to sit, a separate
  nest must be made as quiet as possible for her.&mdash;<i>See</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI.</a></p>
<p>Cleanliness must be maintained. The <i>Canada Farmer</i> suggested an admirable plan for keeping the roosting-house
  clean. A broad shelf, securely fastened, but moveable, is
  fixed at the back of the house, eighteen inches from the
  ground, and the perch placed four or five inches above it,
  a foot from the wall. The nests are placed on the ground
  beneath the board, which preserves them from the roosting
  fowl's droppings, and keeps them well shaded for the laying
  or sitting hen, if the latter is obliged to incubate in the
  same house, and the nests do not need a top. The shelf can
  be easily scraped clean every morning, and should be
  lightly sanded afterwards. Thus the floor of the house is
  never soiled by the roosting birds, and the broad board at
  the same time protects them from upward draughts of air.
  Where the nests and perches are not so arranged, the idea
  may be followed by placing a loose board below each
  perch, upon which the dung will fall, and the board can be
  taken up every morning and the dung removed. With
  proper tools, a properly constructed fowl-house can be kept
  perfectly clean, and all the details of management well
  carried out without scarcely soiling your hands. A birch
  broom is the best implement with which to clean the house
  if the floor is as hard as it ought to be. A handful of ashes
  or sand, sprinkled over the places from which dung has
  been removed, will absorb any remaining impurity.</p>
<p>Fowls' dung is a very valuable manure, being strong,
  stimulating, and nitrogenous, possessing great power in
  forcing the growth of vegetables, particularly those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> cabbage tribe, and is excellent for growing strawberries,
  or indeed almost any plants, if sufficiently diluted; for,
  being very strong, it should always be mixed with earth.
  A fowl, according to Stevens, will void at least one ounce of
  dry dung in twenty-four hours, which is worth at least
  seven shillings a cwt.</p>
<p>The door should fit closely, a slight space only being left
  at the bottom to admit air. It should have a square hole,
  which is usually placed either at the top or bottom, for the
  poultry to enter to roost. A hole at the top is generally
  preferred, as it is inaccessible to vermin. The fowls ascend
  by means of a ladder formed of a slanting board, with
  strips of wood nailed across to assist their feet; a similar
  ladder should be placed inside to enable them to descend,
  if they are heavy fowls; but the evil is that, even with this
  precaution, they are inclined to fly down, as they do from
  high perches, without using the ladder, and thus injure
  their feet. A hole in the middle of the door would be preferable
  to either, and obviate the defects of both. These
  holes should be fitted with sliding panels on the inside, so
  that they can be closed in order to keep the fowls out
  while cleaning the house, or to keep them in until they
  have laid their eggs, or it may be safe to let them out in
  the morning in any neighbourhood or place where they
  would else be liable to be stolen. Every day, after the fowls
  have left their roosts, the doors and windows should be
  opened, and a thorough draught created to purify the house.
  During the winter months all the entrance holes should be
  closed from sunset to sunrise, unless in mild localities.
  Where there are many houses, they should, if possible,
  communicate with each other by doors, so that they may
  be cleaned from end to end, or inspected without the necessity
  of passing through the yards, which is especially
  unpleasant in wet weather. The doors should be capable
  of being fastened on either side, to avoid the chance of the
  different breeds intermingling while your attention is occupied
  in arranging the nests, collecting eggs, &amp;c. See that
  your fowls are securely locked in at night, for they are
  more easily stolen than any other kind of domestic animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> A good dog in the yard or adjoining house or stable is an
  excellent protection.</p>
<p>Every poultry-house should be lime-washed at least four
  or five times a year, and oftener if convenient. Vermin of
  any kind can be effectually destroyed by fumigating the
  place with sulphur. In this operation a little care is requisite;
  it should be commenced early in the morning, by
  first closing the lattices, and stopping up every crevice
  through which air can enter; then place on the ground a
  pan of lighted charcoal, and throw on it some brimstone
  broken into small pieces. Directly this is done the room
  should be left, the door kept shut and airtight for some
  hours; care too should be taken that the lattices are first
  opened, and time given for the vapour to thoroughly disperse
  before any one again enters, when every creature
  within the building will be found destroyed.</p>
<p>It is said that a pair of caged guinea-pigs in the fowl-house
  will keep away rats.</p>
<p>In a large establishment, and in a moderate one, if the
  outlay is not an object, the pens for the chickens and the
  passages between the various houses may be profitably
  covered with glass, and grapes grown on the rafters.
  Raising chickens under glass has been tried with great
  success.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE FOWL-YARD.</h3>
<p>The scarcity of poultry in this country partly arises
  from all gallinaceous birds requiring warmth and dryness
  to keep them in perfect health, while the climate of Great
  Britain is naturally moist and cold.</p>
<p>&quot;The warmest and driest soils,&quot; says Mowbray, &quot;are
  the best adapted to the breeding and rearing of gallinaceous
  fowls, more particularly chickens. A wet soil is the
  worst, since, however ill affected fowls are by cold, they
  endure it better than moisture. Land proper for sheep is
  generally also adapted to the successful keeping of poultry
  and rabbits.&quot;</p>
<p>But poultry may be reared and kept successfully even
  on bad soils with good drainage and attention. The
  &quot;Henwife&quot; says: &quot;I do not consider any one soil necessary
  for success in rearing poultry. Some think a chalk
  soil essential for Dorkings, but I have proved the fallacy
  of this opinion by bringing up, during three years, many
  hundreds of these <i>soi disant</i> delicate birds on the strong
  blue clay of the Carse of Gowrie, doubtless thoroughly
  drained, that system being well understood and universally
  practised by the farmers of the district. A coating of
  gravel and sand once a year is all that is requisite to secure
  the necessary dryness in the runs.&quot; The best soil for a
  poultry-yard is gravel, or sand resting on chalk or gravel.
  When the soil is clayey, or damp from any other cause, it
  should be thoroughly drained, and the whole or a good
  portion of the ground should be raised by the addition of
  twelve inches of chalk, or bricklayer's rubbish, over which
  should be spread a few inches of sand. Cramp, roup,
  and some other diseases, more frequently arise from stagnant
  wet in the soil than from any other cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>The yard should be sheltered from the north and east
  winds, and where this is effected by the position of a shrubbery
  or plantation in which the fowls may be allowed to
  run, it will afford the advantage of protection, not only
  from wind and cold, but also shelter from the rain and the
  burning sun. It also furnishes harbourage for insects,
  which will find them both food and exercise in picking up.
  Indeed, for all these purposes a few bushes may be advantageously
  planted in or adjoining any poultry-yard. When
  a tree can be enclosed in a run, it forms an agreeable object
  for the eye, and affords shelter to the fowls.</p>
<p>A covered run or shed for shelter in wet or hot weather
  is a great advantage, especially if chickens are reared. It
  may be constructed with a few rough poles supporting a
  roof of patent felt, thatch, or rough board, plain or painted
  for preservation, and may be made of any length and width,
  from four feet upwards, and of any height from four feet at the
  back and three feet in the front, to eight feet at the back and six
  feet in the front. The shed should, if possible, adjoin the fowl-house.
  It should be wholly or partly enclosed with wire-work,
  which should be boarded for a foot from the ground
  to keep out the wet and snow, and to keep in small chickens.
  The roof should project a foot beyond the uprights which
  support it, in order to throw the rain well off, and have a
  gutter-shoot to carry it away and prevent it from being blown
  in upon the enclosed space. The floor should be a little
  higher than the level of the yard, both in order to keep it
  dry and the easier to keep it clean; and it should be higher
  at the back than in the front, which will keep it drained if
  any wet should be blown in or water upset. If preferred,
  moveable netting may be used, so that the fowls can be
  allowed their liberty in fine weather, and be confined in
  wet weather. But the boarding must be retained to keep
  out the wet. The ground may be left in its natural state
  for the fowls to scratch in, in which case the surface should
  be dug up from time to time and replaced with fresh earth
  pressed down moderately hard. If the house is large and
  has a good window, a shed is not absolutely necessary,
  especially for a few fowls only, but it is a valuable addition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> and is also very useful to shelter the coops of the mother
  hens and their young birds in wet, windy, or hot weather.</p>
<p>By daily attention to cleanliness, a few fowls may be kept
  in such a covered shed, without having any open run, by
  employing a thick layer of dry pulverised earth as a deodoriser,
  which is to be turned over with a rake every day,
  and replaced with fresh dry pulverised earth once a week.
  The dry earth entirely absorbs all odour. In a run of this
  kind, six square feet should be allowed to each fowl kept,
  for a smaller surface of the dry earth becomes moist and
  will then no longer deodorise the dung. Sifted ashes
  spread an inch deep over the floor of the whole shed will
  be a good substitute if the dry earth cannot be had. They
  should be raked over every other morning, and renewed at
  least every fortnight, or oftener if possible. The ground
  should be dug and turned over whenever it looks sodden, or
  gives out any offensive smell; and three or four times a
  year the polluted soil below the layer, that is, the earth to
  the depth of three or four inches, should be removed and
  replaced with fresh earth, gravel, chalk, or ashes.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
  shed must be so contrived that the sun can shine upon the
  fowls during some part of the day, or they will not continue
  in health for any length of time, and it is almost impossible
  to rear healthy chickens without its light and warmth; and
  it will be a great improvement if part of the run is open.
  Another shed will be required if chickens are to be reared.</p>
<p>Fowls that are kept in small spaces or under covered
  runs will require a different diet to those that are allowed
  to roam in fields and pick up insects, grass, &amp;c., and must
  be provided with green food, animal food in place of
  insects, and be well supplied with mortar rubbish and
  gravel.</p>
<p>The height of the wall, paling, or fencing that surrounds
  the yard, and of the partitions, if the yard is divided into
  compartments for the purpose of keeping two or more
  breeds separate and pure, must be according to the nature
  of the breed. Three feet in height will be sufficient to
  retain Cochins and Brahmas; six feet will be required for
  moderate-sized fowls; and eight or nine feet will be necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> to confine the Game, Hamburg, and Bantam breeds.
  Galvanised iron wire-netting is the best material, as it does
  not rust, and will not need painting for a long time. It is
  made of various degrees of strength, and in different forms,
  and may be had with meshes varying from three-fourths of
  an inch to two inches or more; with very small meshes at
  the lower part only, to keep out rats and to keep in
  chickens; with spikes upon the top, or with scoloped
  wire-work, which gives it a neat and finished appearance;
  with doors, and with iron standards terminating in double
  spikes to fix in the ground, by which wooden posts are
  divided, while it can be easily fixed and removed. The
  meshes should not be more than two inches wide, and if
  the meshes of the lower part are not very small, it should
  be boarded to about two feet six inches from the ground,
  in order to keep out rats, keep in chickens, and to prevent
  the cocks fighting through the wire, which fighting is
  more dangerous than in the open, for the birds are very
  liable to injure themselves in the meshes, and, Dorkings
  especially, to tear their combs and toes in them. If iron
  standards are not attached to the netting, it should be
  stretched to stout posts, well fixed in the ground, eight feet
  apart, and fastened by galvanised iron staples. A rail at
  the top gives a neater appearance, but induces the fowls to
  perch upon it, which may tempt them to fly over.</p>
<p>Where it is not convenient to fix a fence sufficiently high,
  or when a hen just out with her brood has to be kept in, a
  fowl may be prevented from flying over fences by stripping
  off the vanes or side shoots from the first-flight feathers of
  one wing, usually ten in number, which will effectually
  prevent the bird from flying, and will not be unsightly, as
  the primary quills are always tucked under the others when
  not used for flying. This method answers much better
  than clipping the quills of each wing, as the cut points are
  liable to inflict injuries and cause irritation in moulting.</p>
<p>The openness of the feathers of fowls which do not throw
  off the water well, like those of most birds, enables them
  to cleanse themselves easier from insects and dirt, by dusting
  their feathers, and then shaking off the dirt and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> minute pests with the dust. For this purpose one or more
  ample heaps of sifted ashes, or very dry sand or earth, for
  them to roll in, must be placed in the sun, and, if possible,
  under shelter, so as to be warm and perfectly dry. Wood
  ashes are the best. This dust-heap is as necessary to fowls
  as water for washing is to human beings. It cleanses their
  feathers and skin from vermin and impurities, promotes the
  cuticular or skin excretion, and is materially instrumental
  in preserving their health. If they should be much troubled
  with insects, mix in the heap plenty of wood ashes
  and a little flour of sulphur.</p>
<p>A good supply of old mortar-rubbish, or similar substance,
  must be kept under the shed, or in a dry place, to
  provide material for the eggshells, or the hens will be
  liable to lay soft-shelled eggs. Burnt oyster-shells are an
  excellent substitute for common lime, and should be prepared
  for use by being heated red-hot, and when cold broken
  into small pieces with the fingers, but not powdered.
  Some give chopped or ground bones, or a lump of chalky
  marl. Eggshells roughly crushed are also good, and are
  greedily devoured by the hens.</p>
<p>A good supply of gravel is also essential, the small stones
  which the fowls swallow being necessary to enable them to
  digest their hard food. Fowls swallow all grain whole,
  their bills not being adapted for crushing it like the teeth
  of the rabbit or the horse, and it is prepared for digestion
  by the action of a strong and muscular gizzard, lined with
  a tough leathery membrane, which forms a remarkable
  peculiarity in the internal structure of fowls and turkeys.
  &quot;By the action,&quot; says Mr. W. H. L. Martin, &quot;of the two
  thick muscular sides of this gizzard on each other, the
  seeds and grains swallowed (and previously macerated in
  the crop, and there softened by a peculiar secretion oozing
  from glandular pores) are ground up, or triturated in order
  that their due digestion may take place. It is a remarkable
  fact that these birds are in the habit of swallowing small
  pebbles, bits of gravel, and similar substances, which it
  would seem are essential to their health. The definite use
  of these substances, which are certainly ground down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> the mill-like action of the gizzard, has been a matter of
  difference among various physiologists, and many experiments,
  with a view to elucidate the subject, have been
  undertaken. It was sufficiently proved by Spallanzani that
  the digestive fluid was incapable of dissolving grains of
  barley, &amp;c., in their unbruised state; and this he ascertained
  by filling small hollow and perforated balls and tubes of
  metal or glass with grain, and causing them to be swallowed
  by turkeys and other fowls; when examined, after twenty-four
  and forty-eight hours, the grains were found to be
  unaffected by the gastric fluid; but when he filled similar
  balls and tubes with bruised grains, and caused them to be
  swallowed, he found, after a lapse of the same number of
  hours, that they were more or less dissolved by the action
  of the gastric juice. In other experiments, he found that
  metallic tubes introduced into the gizzard of common fowls
  and turkeys, were bruised, crushed, and distorted, and even
  that sharp-cutting instruments were broken up into blunt
  fragments without having produced the slightest injury to
  the gizzard. But these experiments go rather to prove the
  extraordinary force and grinding powers of the gizzard,
  than to throw light upon the positive use of the pebbles
  swallowed; which, after all, Spallanzani thought were
  swallowed without any definite object, but from mere
  stupidity. Blumenbach and Dr. Bostock aver that fowls,
  however well supplied with food, grow lean without them,
  and to this we can bear our own testimony. Yet the question,
  what is their precise effect? remains to be answered.
  Boerhave thought it probable that they might act as
  absorbents to superabundant acid; others have regarded
  them as irritants or stimulants to digestion; and Borelli
  supposed that they might really contribute some degree of
  nutriment.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Everard Home, in his &quot;Comparative Anatomy,&quot;
  says: &quot;When the external form of this organ is first
  attentively examined, viewing that side which is anterior in
  the living bird, and on which the two bellies of the muscle
  and middle are more distinct, there being no other part to
  obstruct the view, the belly of the muscle on the left side is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> seen to be larger than on the right. This appears, on
  reflection, to be of great advantage in producing the necessary
  motion; for if the two muscles were of equal strength,
  they must keep a greater degree of exertion than is necessary;
  while, in the present case, the principal effect is
  produced by that of the left side, and a smaller force is used
  by that on the right to bring the parts back again. The
  two bellies of the muscle, by their alternate action, produce
  two effects&mdash;the one a constant friction on the contents of
  the cavity; the other, a pressure on them. This last arises
  from a swelling of the muscle inwards, which readily
  explains all the instances which have been given by Spallanzani
  and others, of the force of the gizzard upon substances
  introduced into it&mdash;a force which is found by their experiments
  always to act in an oblique direction. The internal
  cavity, when opened in this distended state, is found to be
  of an oval form, the long diameter being in the line of the
  body; its capacity nearly equal to the size of a pullet's
  egg; and on the sides there are ridges in their horny coat
  (lining membrane) in the long direction of the oval. When
  the horny coat is examined in its internal structure, the
  fibres of which it is formed are not found in a direction perpendicular
  to the ligamentous substance behind it; but in
  the upper portion of the cavity it is obliquely upwards.
  From this form of cavity it is evident that no part of the
  sides is ever intended to be brought in contact, and that the
  food is triturated by being mixed with hard bodies, and
  acted on by the powerful muscles which form the gizzard.&quot;</p>
<p>The experiments of Spallanzani show that the muscular
  action of the gizzard is equally powerful whether the small
  stones are present or not; and that they are not at all
  necessary to the trituration of the firmest food, or the hardest
  foreign substances; but it is also quite clear that when
  these small stones are put in motion by the muscles of the
  gizzard they assist in crushing the grain, and at the same
  time prevent it from consolidating into a thick, heavy, compacted
  mass, which would take a far longer time in undergoing
  the digestive process than when separated and
  intermingled with the pebbles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>This was the opinion of the great physiologist, John
  Hunter, who, in his treatise &quot;On the Animal Economy,&quot;
  after noticing the grinding powers of the gizzard, says, in
  reference to the pebbles swallowed, &quot;We are not, however,
  to conclude that stones are entirely useless; for if we compare
  the strength of the muscles of the jaws of animals
  which masticate their food with those of birds who do not,
  we shall say that the parts are well calculated for the
  purpose of mastication; yet we are not thence to infer that
  the teeth in such jaws are useless, even although we have
  proof that the gums do the business when the teeth are
  gone. If pebbles are of use, which we may reasonably
  conclude they are, birds have an advantage over animals
  having teeth, so far as pebbles are always to be found,
  while the teeth are not renewed. If we constantly find in
  an organ substances which can only be subservient to the
  functions of that organ, should we deny their use, although
  the part can do its office without them? The stones assist
  in grinding down the grain, and, by separating its parts,
  allow the gastric juice to come more readily in contact
  with it.&quot;</p>
<p>When a paddock is used as a run for a large number of
  poultry, it should be enclosed either by a wall or paling,
  but not by a hedge, as the fowls can get through it, and
  will also lay their eggs under the hedge. The paddock
  should be well drained, and it will be a great advantage if
  it contains a pond, or has a stream of water running through
  or by it. Mowbray advises that the grass run should be
  sown &quot;with common trefoil or wild clover, with a mixture
  of burnet, spurry, or storgrass,&quot; which last two kinds &quot;are
  particularly salubrious to poultry.&quot; If the grass is well
  rooted before the fowls are allowed to run on it, they may
  range there for several hours daily, according to its extent
  and their number, but it should be renewed in the spring
  by sowing where it has become bare or thin. A dry
  common, or pasture fields, in which they may freely wander
  and pick up grubs, insects, ants' eggs, worms, and leaves
  of plants, is a great advantage, and they may be accustomed
  to return from it at a call. Where there is a cropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> field, orchard, or garden, in which fowls may roam at
  certain seasons, when the crops are safe from injury, each
  brood should be allowed to wander in it separately for a
  few hours daily, or on different days, as may be most
  convenient. &quot;A garden dung-heap,&quot; says Mr. Baily,
  &quot;overgrown with artichokes, mallows, &amp;c., is an excellent
  covert for chickens, especially in hot weather. They find
  shelter and meet with many insects there.&quot; When horse-dung
  is procured for the garden, or supplied from your
  stables, some should be placed in a small trench, and
  frequently renewed, in which the fowls will amuse themselves,
  particularly in winter, by scraping for corn and
  worms. When fowls have not the advantage of a grass
  run they should be indulged with a square or two of fresh
  turf, as often as it can be obtained, on which they will feed
  and amuse themselves. It should be heavy enough to enable
  them to tear off the grass, without being obliged to drag
  the turf about with them.</p>

<h3>FOOD.</h3>
<p>The following table, which first appeared in the &quot;Poultry
  Diary,&quot; will show at a glance the relative constituents and
  qualities of the different kinds of food, and may be consulted
  with great advantage by the poultry-keeper, as it will
  enable him to proportion mixed food correctly, and to
  change it according to the production of growth, flesh,
  or fat that may be desired, and according to the temperature
  of the season. These proportions, of course, are not
  absolutely invariable, for the relative proportions of the
  constituents of the grain will vary with the soil, manure
  used, and the growing and ripening characteristics of the
  season.</p>

<p>Barley is more generally used than any other grain, and,
  reckoned by weight, is cheaper than wheat or oats; but,
  unless in the form of meal, should not be the only grain
  given, for fowls do not fatten upon it, as, though possessing
  a very fair proportion of flesh-forming substances, it contains
  a lesser amount of fatty matters than other varieties
  of corn. In Surrey barley is the usual grain given, excepting
  during the time of incubation, when the sitting
  hens have oats, as being less heating to the system than
  the former. Barley-meal contains the same component
  parts as the whole grain, being ground with the husk, but
  only inferior barley is made into meal.</p>
<p>Wheat of the best description is dearer than barley, both
  by weight and measure, and possesses but about one-twelfth
  part more flesh-forming material, but it is fortunate
  that the small cheap wheat is the best for poultry, for Professor
  Johnston says, &quot;the small or tail corn which the
  farmer separates before bringing his grain to market is
  richer in gluten (flesh-forming food) than the full-grown
  grain, and is therefore more nutritious.&quot; The &quot;Henwife&quot;
  finds &quot;light wheats or tailings the best grain for daily use,
  and next to that barley.&quot;</p>
<p>Oats are dearer than barley by weight. The heaviest
  should be bought, as they contain very little more husk
  than the lightest, and are therefore cheaper in proportion.
  Oats and oatmeal contain much more flesh-forming material
  than any other kind of grain, and double the amount
  of fatty material than wheat, and three times as much as
  barley. Mowbray says oats are apt to cause scouring, and
  chickens become tired of them; but they are recommended
  by many for promoting laying, and in Kent, Sussex, and
  Surrey for fattening. Fowls frequently refuse the lighter
  samples of oats, but if soaked in water for a few hours so
  as to swell the kernel, they will not refuse them. The
  meal contains more flesh-forming material than the whole
  grain.</p>
<p>The meal of wheat and barley are much the same as the
  whole grain, but oatmeal is drier and separated from a
  large portion of the husk, which makes it too dear except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> for fattening fowls and feeding the youngest chickens, for
  which it is the very best food. Fine &quot;middlings,&quot; also
  termed &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;thirds,&quot; and in London coarse
  country flour, are much like oatmeal, but cheaper than the
  best, and may be cheaply and advantageously employed
  instead of oatmeal, or mixed with boiled or steamed small
  potatoes or roots.</p>
<p>Many writers recommend refuse corn for fowls, and the
  greater number of poultry-keepers on a small scale perhaps
  think such light common grain the cheapest food; but
  this is a great mistake, as, though young fowls may be fed
  on offal and refuse, it is the best economy to give the older
  birds the finest kind of grain, both for fattening and laying,
  and even the young fowls should be fed upon the best if
  fine birds for breeding or exhibition are desired. &quot;Instead
  of giving ordinary or tail corn to my fattening or breeding
  poultry,&quot; says Mowbray, &quot;I have always found it most
  advantageous to allow the heaviest and the best; thus
  putting the confined fowls on a level with those at the
  barn-door, where they are sure to get their share of the
  weightiest and finest corn. This high feeding shows itself
  not only in the size and flesh of the fowls, but in the size,
  weight, and substantial goodness of their eggs, which, in
  these valuable particulars, will prove far superior to the
  eggs of fowls fed upon ordinary corn or washy potatoes;
  two eggs of the former going further in domestic use than
  three of the latter.&quot; &quot;Sweepings&quot; sometimes contain
  poisonous or hurtful substances, and are always dearer,
  weight for weight, than sound grain.</p>
<p>Some poultry-keepers recommend that the grain should
  be boiled, which makes it swell greatly, and consequently
  fills the fowl's crop with a smaller quantity, and the bird is
  satisfied with less than if dry grain be given; but others
  say that the fowls derive more nutriment from the same
  quantity of grain unboiled. Indeed, it seems evident that a
  portion of the nutriment must pass into the water, and
  also evaporate in steam. The fowl's gizzard being a
  powerful grinding mill, evidently designed by Providence
  for the purpose of crushing the grain into meal, it is clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> that whole grain is the natural diet of fowls, and that
  softer kinds of food are chiefly to be used for the first or
  morning meal for fowls confined in houses (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), and
  for those being fattened artificially in coops, where it is
  desired to help the fowl's digestive powers, and to convert
  the food into flesh as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Indian corn or maize, either whole or in meal, must not
  be given in too great a proportion, as it is very fattening
  from the large quantity of oil it contains; but mixed with
  barley or barley-meal, it is a most economical and useful
  food. It is useful for a change, but is not a good food by
  itself. It may be given once or twice a week, especially in
  the winter, with advantage. From its size small birds
  cannot eat it and rob the fowls. Whether whole or in
  meal, the maize should be scalded, that the swelling may
  be done before it is eaten. The yellow-coloured maize is not
  so good as that which is reddish or rather reddish-brown.</p>
<p>Buckwheat is about equal to barley in flesh-forming
  food, and is very much used on the Continent. Mr.
  Wright has &quot;a strong opinion that the enormous production
  of eggs and fowls in France is to some extent
  connected with the almost universal use of buckwheat by
  French poultry-keepers.&quot; It is not often to be had cheap
  in this country, but is hardy and may be grown anywhere
  at little cost. Mr. Edwards says, he &quot;obtained (without
  manure) forty bushels to the acre, on very poor sandy soil,
  that would not have produced eighteen bushels of oats.
  The seed is angular in form, not unlike hempseed; and is
  stimulating, from the quantity of spirit it contains.&quot;</p>
<p>Peas, beans, and tares contain an extraordinary quantity
  of flesh-forming material, and very little of fat-forming,
  but are too stimulating for general use, and would harden
  the muscular fibres and give too great firmness of flesh to
  fowls that are being fattened, but where tares are at a low
  price, or peas or beans plentiful, stock fowls may be
  advantageously fed upon any of these, and they may
  be given occasionally to fowls that are being fattened. It
  is better to give them boiled than in a raw state, especially
  if they are hard and dry, and the beans in particular may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> be too large for the fowls to swallow comfortably. Near
  Geneva fowls are fed chiefly upon tares. Poultry reject
  the wild tares of which pigeons are so fond.</p>
<p>Rice is not a cheap food. When boiled it absorbs a great
  quantity of water and forms a large substance, but, of
  course, only contains the original quantity of grain which
  is of inferior value, especially for growing chickens, as
  it consists almost entirely of starch, and does not contain
  quite half the amount of flesh-forming materials as oats.
  When broken or slightly damaged it may be had much
  cheaper, and will do as well as the finest. Boil it for half
  an hour in skim-milk or water, and then let it stand in the
  water till cold, when it will have swollen greatly, and be so
  firm that it can be taken out in lumps, and easily broken
  into pieces. In addition to its strengthening and fattening
  qualities rice is considered to improve the delicacy of the
  flesh. Fowls are especially fond of it at first, but soon grow
  tired of this food. If mixed with less cloying food, such as
  bran, they would probably continue to relish it.</p>
<p>Hempseed is most strengthening during moulting time,
  and should then be given freely, especially in cold localities.</p>
<p>Linseed steeped is occasionally given, chiefly to birds
  intended for exhibition, to increase the secretion of oil, and
  give lustre to their plumage.</p>
<p>Potatoes, from the large quantity of starch they contain,
  are not good unmixed, as regular food, but mixed with
  bran or meal are most conducive to good condition and
  laying. They contain a great proportion of nutriment,
  comparatively to their bulk and price; and may be advantageously
  and profitably given where the number of
  eggs produced is of more consequence than their flavour or
  goodness. A good morning meal of soft food for a few fowls
  may be provided daily almost for nothing by boiling the
  potato peelings till soft, and mashing them up with enough
  bran, slightly scalded, to make a tolerably stiff dry paste.
  The peelings will supply as many fowls as there are persons
  at the dinner table. A little salt should always
  be added, and in winter a slight sprinkling of pepper
  is good.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;It is indispensable,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;to give the
  potatoes to fowls not only in a boiled state, but hot; not
  so hot, however, as to burn their mouths, as they are
  stupid enough to do if permitted. They dislike cold potatoes,
  and will not eat them willingly. It is likewise
  requisite to break all the potatoes a little, for they will not
  unfrequently leave a potato when thrown down unbroken,
  taking it, probably, for a stone, since the moment the skin
  is broken and the white of the interior is brought into
  view, they fall upon it greedily. When pieces of raw
  potatoes are accidentally in their way, fowls will sometimes
  eat them, though they are not fond of these, and it is
  doubtful whether they are not injurious.&quot;</p>
<p>Mangold-wurtzel, swedes, or other turnips, boiled with
  a very small quantity of water, until quite soft, and then
  thickened with the very best middlings or meal, is the
  very best soft food, especially for Dorkings.</p>
<p>Soft food should always be mixed rather dry and <i>friable</i>,
  and not <i>porridgy</i>, for they do not like sticky food, which
  clings round their beaks and annoys them, besides often
  causing diarrh&oelig;a. There should never be enough water in
  food to cause it to glisten in the light. If the soft food is
  mixed boiling hot at night and put in the oven, or covered
  with a cloth, it will be warm in the morning, in which state
  it should always be given in cold weather.</p>
<p>Fowls have their likes and dislikes as well as human
  beings, some preferring one kind of grain to all others,
  which grain is again disliked by other fowls. They also
  grow tired of the same food, and will thrive all the
  better for having as much variety of diet as possible, some
  little change in the food being made every few days.
  Fowls should not be forced or pressed to take food to
  which they show a dislike. It is most important to give
  them chiefly that which they like best, as it is a rule,
  with but few exceptions, that what is eaten with most
  relish agrees best and is most easily digested; but care
  must be taken not to give too much, for one sort of grain
  being more pleasing to their palate than another, induces
  them to eat gluttonously more than is necessary or healthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> M. R&eacute;aumur made many careful experiments upon the
  feeding of fowls, and among them found that they were
  much more easily satisfied than might be supposed from the
  greedy voracity which they exhibit when they are fed, and
  that the sorts of food most easily digested by them are
  those of which they eat the greatest quantity.</p>
<p>No definite scale can be given for the quantity of food
  which fowls require, as it must necessarily vary with the
  different breeds, sizes, ages, condition, and health of the
  fowls; and with the seasons of the year, and the temperature
  of the season, much more food being necessary to keep
  up the proper degree of animal heat in winter than in
  summer; and the amount of seeds, insects, vegetables, and
  other food that they may pick up in a run of more or less
  extent. Over-feeding, whether by excess of quantity or
  excess of stimulating constituents, is the cause of the most
  general diseases, the greater proportion of these diseases,
  and of most of the deaths from natural causes among
  fowls. When fowls are neither laying well nor moulting,
  they should not be fed very abundantly; for in such a state
  over-feeding, especially with rich food, may cause them
  to accumulate too much fat. A fat hen ceases to lay, or
  nearly, while an over-fed cock becomes lazy and useless,
  and may die of apoplexy.</p>
<p>But half-fed fowls never pay whether kept for the table
  or to produce eggs. A fowl cannot get fat or make an egg
  a day upon little or poor food. A hen producing eggs will
  eat nearly twice as much food as at another time. In cold
  weather give plenty of dry bread soaked in ale.</p>
<p>Poultry prefer to pick their food off the ground. &quot;No
  plan,&quot; says Mr. Baily, &quot;is so extravagant or so injurious as
  to throw down heaps once or twice per day. They should
  have it scattered as far and wide as possible, that the birds
  may be long and healthily employed in finding it, and may
  not accomplish in a few minutes that which should occupy
  them for hours. For this reason every sort of feeder or
  hopper is bad. It is the nature of fowls to take a grain at
  a time, and to pick grass and dirt with it, which assist
  digestion. They should feed as pheasants, partridges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> grouse, and other game do in a state of nature; if, contrary
  to this, they are enabled to eat corn by mouthfuls,
  their crops are soon overfilled, and they seek relief in
  excessive draughts of water. Nothing is more injurious
  than this, and the inactivity that attends the discomfort
  caused by it lays the foundation of many disorders. The
  advantage of scattering the food is, that all then get their
  share; while if it is thrown only on a small space the master
  birds get the greater part, while the others wait around.
  In most poultry-yards more than half the food is wasted;
  the same quantity is thrown down day after day, without
  reference to time of year, alteration of numbers, or variation
  of appetite, and that which is not eaten is trodden
  about, or taken by small birds. Many a poultry-yard is
  coated with corn and meal.&quot;</p>
<p>If two fowls will not run after one piece, they do not
  want it. If a trough is used, the best kind is the simplest,
  being merely a long, open one, shaped like that used for
  pigs, but on a smaller scale. It should be placed about a
  foot from one of the sides of the yard, behind some round
  rails driven into the ground three inches apart, so that
  the fowls cannot get into the troughs, so as to upset them,
  or tread in or otherwise dirty the food. The rails should
  be all of the same height, and a slanting board be fixed
  over the trough.</p>
<p>Some persons give but one meal a day, and that generally
  in the morning; this is false economy, for the whole
  of the nutriment contained in the one meal is absorbed in
  keeping up the animal heat, and there is no material for
  producing eggs. &quot;The number of meals per day,&quot; says
  Mr. Wright, &quot;best consistent with real economy will vary
  from two to three, according to the size of the run. If
  it be of moderate extent, so that they can in any degree
  forage for themselves, two are quite sufficient, at least in
  summer, and should be given early in the morning and
  the last thing before the birds go to roost. In any case,
  these will be the principal meals; but when the fowls are
  kept in confinement they will require, in addition, a scanty
  feed at mid-day. The first feeding should consist of soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> food of some kind. The birds have passed a whole night
  since they were last fed; and it is important, especially in
  cold weather, that a fresh supply should as soon as possible
  be got into the system, and not merely into the crop. But
  if grain be given, it has to be ground in the poor bird's
  gizzard before it can be digested, and on a cold winter's
  morning the delay is anything but beneficial. But, for
  the very same reason, at the evening meal grain forms the
  best food which can be supplied; it is digested slowly, and
  during the long cold nights affords support and warmth
  to the fowls.&quot;</p>
<p>They should be fed at regular hours, and will then soon
  become accustomed to them, and not loiter about the
  house or kitchen door all day long, expecting food, which
  they will do if fed irregularly or too often, and neglect to
  forage about for themselves, and thus cost more for food.</p>
<p>Grass is of the greatest value for all kinds of poultry, and
  where they have no paddock, or grass-plot, fresh vegetables
  must be given them daily, as green food is essential to the
  health of all poultry, even of the very youngest chickens.
  Cabbage and lettuce leaves, spinach, endive, turnip-tops,
  turnips cut into small pieces and scattered like grain, or
  cut in two, radish-leaves, or any refuse, but not stale
  vegetables will do; but the best thing is a large sod of
  fresh-cut turf. They are partial to all the mild succulent
  weeds, such as chickweed and <i>Chenopodium</i>, or fat-hen, and
  eat the leaves of most trees and shrubs, even those of evergreens;
  but they reject the leaves of strawberries, celery,
  parsnips, carrots, potatoes, onions, and leeks. The supply
  of green food may be unlimited, but poultry should never
  be entirely fed on raw greens. Cabbage and spinach are
  still more relaxing when boiled than raw. They are very
  fond of the fruit of the mulberry and cherry trees, and will
  enjoy any that falls, and prevent it from being wasted.</p>
<p>Insect food is important to fowls, and essential for
  chickens and laying hens. &quot;There is no sort of insect,
  perhaps,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;which fowls will not eat.
  They are exceedingly fond of flies, beetles, grasshoppers,
  and crickets, but more particularly of every sort of grub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> caterpillar, and maggot, with the remarkable exception of
  the caterpillar moth of the magpie (<i>Abraxas grossularia</i>),
  which no bird will touch.&quot; M. R&eacute;aumur mentions the
  circumstance of a quantity of wheat stored in a corn-loft
  being much infected with the caterpillars of the small corn-moth,
  which spins a web and unites several grains together.
  A young lady devised the plan of taking some chickens to
  the loft to feed on the caterpillars, of which they were so
  fond that in a few days they devoured them all, without
  touching a single grain of the corn. Mr. Dickson observes,
  that &quot;biscuit-dust from ships' stores, which consists of
  biscuit mouldered into meal, mixed with fragments still
  unbroken, would be an excellent food for poultry, if soaked
  in boiling water and given them hot. It is thus used for
  feeding pigs near the larger seaports, where it can sometimes
  be had in considerable quantity, and at a very
  reasonable price. It will be no detriment to this material
  if it be full of weevils and their grubs, of which fowls are
  fonder than of the biscuit itself.&quot;</p>
<p>There is not any food of which poultry generally are so
  fond as of earthworms; but all fowls are not equally fond
  of them, and some will not touch them. They will not eat
  dead worms. Too many ought not to be given, or they
  will become too fat and cease laying. When fowls are
  intended for the table worms should not be given, as they
  are said always more or less to deteriorate the flavour of
  the flesh. A good supply may easily be obtained. By
  stamping hard upon the ground, as anglers do, worms will
  rise to the surface; but a better method is to thrust a
  strong stake or a three-pronged potato-fork into the ground,
  to the depth of a foot or so, and jerk it backwards and
  forwards, so as to shake the soil all around. By going out
  with a light at night in calm, mild weather, particularly
  when there is dew, or after rain, a cautious observer will
  see large numbers of worms lying on the ground, gravel-walks,
  grass-plots or pastures; but they are easily frightened
  into their holes, though with caution and dexterity a great
  number, and those chiefly of the largest size, may be captured.
  Mr. Dickson advises that cottagers' children should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> be employed to imitate the example of the rooks, by following
  the plough or the digger, and collecting the worms
  which are disclosed to view; and also to collect cock-chafers,
  &quot;and, what would be more advantageous, they
  might be set to collect the grubs of this destructive insect
  after the plough, and thus, while providing a rich banquet
  for the poultry, they would be clearing the fields of a most
  destructive insect.&quot;</p>
<p>Fowls are very fond of shell snails. They are still more
  fattening than worms, and therefore too many must not be
  given when laying, but they do not injure the flavour of
  the flesh. Some will eat slugs, but they are not generally
  fond of these, and many fowls will not touch them.</p>
<p>One great secret of profitable poultry-keeping is, that
  hens cannot thrive and lay without a considerable quantity
  of animal food, and therefore if they cannot obtain a
  sufficient quantity in the form of insects, it must be supplied
  in meat, which, minced small, should be given daily
  and also to all fowls in winter, as insects are then not to
  be had. Mr. Baily says: &quot;Do not give fowls meat, but
  always have the bones thrown out to them after dinner;
  they enjoy picking them, and perform the operation perfectly.
  Do not feed on raw meat; it makes fowls quarrelsome,
  and gives them a propensity to peck each other,
  especially in moulting time if the accustomed meat be
  withheld.&quot; They will peck at the wound of another fowl to
  procure blood, and even at their own wounds when within
  reach. Take care that long pieces of membrane, or thick
  skin, tough gristle or sinew, or pieces of bone, are not left
  sticking to the meat, or it may choke them, or form a lodgment
  in the crop. &quot;Pieces of suet or fat,&quot; says Mr.
  Dickson, &quot;are liked by fowls better than any other sort of
  animal food; but, if supplied in any quantity, will soon
  render them too fat for continuing to lay. Should there
  be any quantity of fat to dispose of, it ought, therefore, to
  be given at intervals, and mixed or accompanied with bran,
  which will serve to fill their crops without producing too
  much nutriment.&quot; It is a good plan when there are plenty
  of bones and scraps of meat to boil them well, and mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> bran or pollard with the liquor before giving them to the
  fowls, as it makes the meat easier to mince, and extracts
  nourishment from the bones. When minced-meat is
  required for a large number of fowls, a mincing or sausage
  machine will save much time and prepare the meat better
  than chopping. They are as fond of fish, whether salted
  or fresh, as of flesh. Crumbs, fragments of pastry, and all
  the refuse and slops of the kitchen may be given them.
  Greaves, so much advertised for fowls, are very bad, rapidly
  throwing them out of condition, causing their feathers to
  fall off, spoiling the flavour of the flesh; they cause premature
  decrepitude, and engender many diseases, the most
  common being dropsy of an incurable character.</p>
<p>Where there is no danger from thieves, foxes, or other
  vermin, and the run is extensive, it is the best plan to leave
  the small door of the fowl-house open, and the fowls will
  go out at daybreak and pick up many an &quot;early worm&quot;
  and insect. The morning meal may be given when the
  household has risen.</p>
<p>A constant supply of fresh clean water is indispensable.
  Fountains are preferable to open vessels, in which the
  fowls are apt to void their dung, and the chickens to dabble
  and catch cold, often causing roup, cramp, &amp;c. The
  simplest kind of water vessel is a saucer made of red
  pottery, containing several circular, concentric troughs,
  each about an inch wide, and of the same depth. Chickens
  cannot get drowned in these shallow vessels, but unless
  placed behind rails the water will be dirtied by the fowls.
  They are sold at all earthenware shops, and are used for
  forcing early mustard in. A capital fountain may be made
  with an earthenware jar or flower-pot and a flower-pot
  saucer. Bore a small hole in the jar or flower-pot an inch
  and a half from the edge of the rim, or detach a piece
  about three-quarters of an inch deep and one inch wide,
  from the rim, and if a flower-pot is used plug the hole in
  the bottom airtight with a piece of cork; fill the vessel with
  water, place the saucer bottom upwards on the top, press it
  closely, and quickly turn both upside down, when the
  water will flow into the saucer, filling up the space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> it and the vessel up to the same height as the hole in the
  side of the jar or flower-pot, therefore the hole in the side
  of the rim of the vessel must not be quite so deep as the
  height of the side of the saucer; and above all the plug in
  the flower-pot must be airtight. This fountain is cheap,
  simple, and easily cleaned. Water may also be kept in
  troughs, or earthenware pans, placed in the same way. The
  fountains and pans should be washed and filled with fresh
  water once every day, and oftener in warm weather; and
  they should occasionally be scoured with sand to remove
  the green slime which collects on the surface, and produces
  roup, gapes, and other diseases. In winter the vessels
  should always be emptied at night, in order to avoid ice
  from forming in them, which is troublesome to remove, and
  snow must never be allowed to fall into them, snow-water
  being most injurious to poultry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>EGGS.</h3>
<p>During the natural process of moulting, hens cease
  laying because all the superabundant nutriment is required
  for the production of the new feathers. Fowls moult later
  each time; the moulting occupies a longer period, and is
  more severe as it becomes later, and if the weather should
  be cold at its termination they seldom recommence laying
  for some time. But young fowls moult in spring. Therefore,
  by having pullets and hens of different ages, and
  moulting at different times, a healthy laying stock may be
  kept up. Pullets hatched in March, and constantly fed
  highly, not only lay eggs abundantly in the autumn, but
  when killed in the following February or March, are as fat
  as any one could or need desire them to be, and open more
  like Michaelmas geese than chickens. When eggs alone
  are wanted, you can commence by buying in the spring as
  many hens as you require, and your run will accommodate,
  not more than a year or eighteen months old. If in good
  health and condition, they will be already laying, or will
  begin almost immediately; and, if well housed and fed,
  will give a constant supply of eggs until they moult in the
  autumn. When these hens have ceased laying, and before
  they lose their good condition by moulting, they should be
  either killed or sold, unless they are Hamburgs, Brahmas,
  or Cochins, and replaced by pullets hatched in March
  or April, which will have moulted early, and, if properly
  housed and fed, will begin to lay by November at the
  latest, and continue laying until February or March, when
  they may be sold or killed, being then in prime condition,
  and replaced as before; or, as they will not stop laying for
  any length of time, the best may be kept until the autumn,
  when, if profit is the chief consideration, they must be disposed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> of.<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But Brahmas, Cochins, and Hamburgs will lay
  through the winter up to their second, or even third year.
  If you commence poultry-keeping in the autumn you
  should buy pullets hatched in the preceding spring. The
  best and cheapest plan of keeping up a good stock is to
  keep a full-feathered Cochin or two for March or April
  sitting; and, if necessary, procure eggs of the breed you
  desire. The Cochin will sit again, being only too often
  ready for the task; and the later-hatched chickens can be
  fattened profitably for the table. But if you wish to obtain
  eggs all the year round, and to avoid replacing of stock, or
  object to the trouble of rearing chickens, keep only those
  breeds that are non-sitters, as the Hamburgs, Polands, and
  Spanish; but you must purchase younger birds from time
  to time to keep a supply of laying hens while others are
  moulting.</p>
<p>Warmth is most essential for promoting laying. A
  severe frost will suddenly stop the laying of even the most
  prolific hens. &quot;When,&quot; says M. Bosc, &quot;it is wished to
  have eggs during the cold season, even in the dead of
  winter, it is necessary to make the fowls roost over an oven,
  in a stable, in a shed where many cattle are kept, or to
  erect a stove in the fowl-house on purpose. By such
  methods, the farmers of Ange have chickens fit for the
  table in the month of April, a period when they are only
  beginning to be hatched in the farms around Paris,
  although farther to the south.&quot; It is the winter management
  of fowls that decides the question of profit or loss,
  for hens will be sure to pay in the summer, even if only
  tolerably attended to. It is thought by many that each
  hen can produce only a certain number of eggs; and if
  such be the case, it is very advantageous to obtain a portion
  of them in winter when they are generally scarce and
  can be eaten while fresh, instead of having the whole
  number produced in the summer, when so many are spoiled
  from too long keeping in consequence of more being produced
  than are required for use at the time.</p>
<p>When the time for her laying approaches, her comb and
  wattles change from their previous dull hue to a bright red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> the eye brightens, the gait becomes more spirited, and
  sometimes she cackles for three or four days. After laying
  her egg on leaving the nest the hen utters a loud cackling
  cry, to which the cock often responds in a high-pitched
  kind of scream; but some hens after laying leave the nest
  in silence. Some hens will lay an egg in three days, some
  every other day, and others every day. Hens should not
  be forced. By unnaturally forcing a fowl with stimulating
  food, and more particularly with hempseed and tallow
  greaves, to lay in two years or so the eggs that should have
  been the produce of several, the hen becomes prematurely
  old and diseased; and it is reasonable to suppose that the
  eggs are not so good as they would have been if nature
  had been left to run its own course. The eggs ought to
  be taken from the nest every afternoon when no more may
  be expected to be laid; for if left in the nest, the heat
  of the hens when laying next day will tend to corrupt
  them.</p>
<p>When the shells of the eggs are somewhat soft, it is
  because the hens are rather inclined to grow too fat. It is
  then proper to mix up a little chalk in their water, and to
  put a little mortar rubbish in their food, the quantity of
  which should be diminished. We give the following
  remarks by an experienced poultry-keeper of the old
  school, as valuable from being the result of practice: &quot;The
  hen sometimes experiences a difficulty in laying. In this
  case a few grains of salt or garlic put into the vent have
  been successfully tried. The keeper should indeed make
  use of the latter mode to find out the place where a hen
  has laid without his knowledge; for, as the hen will be in
  haste to deposit her egg, her pace towards the nest will be
  quickened; she may then be followed and her secret found
  out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Though one particular form,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;is
  so common to eggs, that it is known by the familiar name
  of egg-shaped, yet all keepers of poultry must be aware
  that eggs are sometimes nearly round, and sometimes
  almost cylindrical, besides innumerable minor shades of
  difference. In fact, eggs differ so much in shape, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> said experienced poultry-keepers can tell by the shape of
  the eggs alone the hen that laid them; for, strange to say,
  however different in size the eggs of any particular hen
  may be occasionally, they are very rarely different in form.
  Among the most remarkable eggs may be mentioned those
  of the Shanghae, or Cochin-China fowl, which are of a
  pale chocolate colour; and those of the Dorking fowl,
  which are of a pure white, and nearly as round as balls.
  The eggs of the Malay fowls are brown; those of the
  Polish fowl, which are very much pointed at one end, are
  of a delicate pinkish white; and those of the Bantam are
  of a long oval.&quot;</p>
<p>A very important part of the egg is the air-bag, or <i>folliculus &aelig;ris</i>, which is placed at the larger end, between
  the shell and its lining membranes. It is, according to Dr.
  Paris, about the size of the eye of a small bird in new laid
  eggs, but enlarges to ten times that size during the process
  of incubation. &quot;This air-bag,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;is of
  such great importance to the development of the chick,
  probably by supplying it with a limited atmosphere of
  oxygen, that if the blunt end of the egg be pierced with
  the point of the smallest needle (a stratagem which malice
  not unfrequently suggests), the egg cannot be hatched, but
  perishes.&quot;</p>
<p>An egg exposed to the air is continually losing a portion
  of its moisture, the place of which is filled by the entrance
  of air, and the egg consequently becomes stale, and after a
  time putrid. M. R&eacute;aumur made many experiments in
  preserving eggs, and found that, by coating them with varnish,
  it was impossible to distinguish those which had been
  kept for a year from those newly laid; but varnish, though
  not expensive, is not always to be had in country places,
  and it also remained on the eggs placed under a hen and
  impeded the hatching, while in boiling them, the varnish,
  not being soluble in hot water, prevented them from being
  properly cooked. He tried other substances, and found
  that fat or grease, such as suet, lard, dripping, butter, and
  oil, were well adapted for the purpose, the best of these
  being a mixture of mutton and beef suet thoroughly melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> together over a slow fire, and strained through a linen cloth
  into an earthen pan. It is only requisite, he says, to take
  a piece of the fat or butter about the size of a pea on the
  end of the finger, and rub it all over the shell, by passing
  and repassing the finger so that no part be left untouched;
  the transpiration of matter from the egg being as effectually
  stopped by the thinnest layer of fat or grease as by a
  thick coating, so that no part of the shell be left ungreased,
  or the tip of the finger may be dipped into oil and passed
  over the shell in the same manner. If it is desired that
  the eggs should look clean, they may be afterwards wiped
  with a towel, for sufficient grease or oil enters the pores of
  the shell to prevent all transpiration without its being
  necessary that any should be left to fill up the spaces
  between the pores. They can be boiled as usual without
  rubbing off the fat, as it will melt in the hot water, and
  when taken out of the water the little grease that is left
  upon the egg is easily wiped off with a napkin.</p>
<p>Eggs preserved in this manner can also be used for
  hatching, as the fat easily melts away by the heat of the
  hen; and by this means the eggs of foreign fowls might be
  carried to a distance, hatched, and naturalised in this and
  other countries. The French also find that a mixture of
  melted beeswax and olive oil is an excellent preservative.</p>
<p>Eggs may also be preserved for cooking by packing them
  in sawdust, in an earthen vessel, and covering the top with
  melted mutton suet or fat; as fruit is sometimes preserved.
  They are also said to keep well in salt, in a barrel arranged
  in layers of salt and eggs alternately. If the salt should
  become damp, it would penetrate through the pores of the
  shell and pickle them to a certain extent. M. Gagne says
  that eggs may be preserved in a mixture made of one
  bushel of quick-lime, two pounds of salt, and eight ounces
  of cream of tartar, with sufficient water to make it into a
  paste of a consistency to receive the eggs, which, it is said,
  may be kept in it fresh for two years; but eggs become
  tasteless when preserved with lime. It may be as well to
  mention here that eggs are comparatively wasted when used
  in making a rice pudding, as they render it too hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> dry, and the pudding without them, if properly made, will
  be just of the right consistency.</p>
<p>&quot;Another way to preserve eggs,&quot; says Mr. Dickson,
  &quot;is to have them cooked in boiling water the same day
  they are laid. On taking them out of the water they are
  marked with red ink, to record their date, and put away in
  a cool place, where they will keep, it is said, for several
  months. When they are wanted for use, they are again
  put into hot water to warm them. The curdy part which is
  usually seen in new-laid eggs is so abundant, and the taste
  is said to be so well preserved, that the nicest people may
  be made to believe that they are new laid. At the end of
  three or four months, however, the membrane lining the
  shell becomes much thickened, and the eggs lose their
  flavour. Eggs so preserved have the advantage of not
  suffering from being carried about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It ought not to be overlooked,&quot; says Mr. Dickson,
  &quot;with respect to the preservation of eggs, that they not
  only spoil by the transpiration of their moisture and the
  putrid fermentation of their contents, in consequence of air
  penetrating through the pores of the shell; but also by
  being moved about, and jostled when carried to a distance
  by sea or land. Any sort of rough motion indeed ruptures
  the membranes which keep the white, the yolk, and the
  germ of the chick in their proper places, and upon these
  becoming mixed, putrefaction soon follows.&quot;</p>
<p>If the eggs are to be kept for setting, place a box, divided
  by partitions into divisions for the eggs of the different
  breeds, in a dry corner of your kitchen, but not too near to
  the fire; fill the divisions with bran previously well dried in
  an oven; place the eggs in it upright, with the larger ends
  uppermost, as soon as they are laid, and cover them with
  the bran. Mark each egg in pencil with the date when
  laid, and description of breed or cross. They should be
  kept in a cool place or a warm place according to the season.
  Airtight jars, closed with airtight stoppers, may be used
  if the eggs are intended to be kept for a very long time.</p>
<p>In selecting eggs for setting, choose the freshest, those
  of moderate size, well-shaped, and having the air-vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> distinctly visible, either in the centre of the top of the egg,
  or slightly to the side, when the egg is held between the
  eye and a lighted candle, in a darkened room. Reject
  very small eggs, which generally have no yolk, those that
  are ill-shaped, and those of equal thickness at both ends,
  which latter is the usual shape of eggs with double yolks.
  These should be avoided, as they are apt generally to prove
  unfertile, or produce monstrosities.</p>
<p>It has been stated that the sex of the embryo chicken
  can be ascertained by the position of the air-vessel; that if
  it be on the top the egg will produce a cockerel, and if on
  the side a pullet; but there is no proof of the truth of
  this, and, notwithstanding such assertions, it appears to be
  impossible to foretell the sex of the chick, from the shape of
  the egg or in any other way.</p>
<p>In selecting eggs for the purpose of producing fowls
  that are to be kept for laying only, being non-sitters,
  choose eggs only from those hens that are prolific layers,
  for prolific laying is often as characteristic of some fowls of
  a breed as it is of the particular breeds, and by careful
  selection this faculty, like others, may be further developed,
  or continued if already fully developed.</p>
<p>If carefully packed, eggs for setting may be carried
  great distances&mdash;hundreds and even thousands of miles&mdash;without
  injury; vibration and even moderate shaking, and
  very considerable changes of temperature, producing no ill
  effect upon the germ. The chief point is to prevent the
  escape of moisture by evaporation, and consequent admission
  of air. A hamper travels with less vibration than a
  box, and is therefore preferable, especially for a long
  journey. They should be packed in hay, by which they
  will be preserved from breakage much better than by being
  packed in short, close material like bran, chaff, oats, or
  sawdust; these being shaken into smaller space by the
  vibration of travelling, the eggs often strike and crack each
  other. The hamper or box should be large enough to
  admit of some soft, yielding packing material being placed
  all round the eggs. The bottom should be first covered
  with a good layer of hay, straw, or moss. It is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> plan to roll each egg separately in hay or moss, fastened
  with a little wool or worsted. They should be covered
  with well-rubbed straw, pressed down carefully and gently.
  The lid of the hamper should be sewed on tightly all round,
  or in three or four places at least. If a box is used, the lid
  should be fastened by cords or screws, but not with nails,
  as the hammering would probably destroy the germ of the
  egg.</p>
<p>In procuring eggs for hatching, be sure that the parent
  birds are of mature age, but not too old, well-shaped,
  vigorous, and in perfect health; that one cock is kept to
  every six or seven hens; and that they are well fed and
  attended to. Have a steady broody hen ready to take the
  eggs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE SITTING HEN.</h3>
<p>All hens that are inclined to sit should be allowed to
  hatch and bring up one brood of chickens a year; for, if
  altogether restrained from sitting, a hen suffers much in
  moulting, and is restless and excited for the remainder of
  the season. It is unnatural, and therefore must be injurious.
  The period of incubation gives her rest from producing
  eggs. The hen that is always stimulated to produce
  eggs, and not allowed to vary that process by hatching
  and bringing up a young brood, must ultimately suffer
  from this constant drain upon her system, and the eggs are
  said to be unwholesome.</p>
<p>But hens frequently wish to sit when it is not convenient,
  or in autumn or winter, when it is not advisable, unless
  very late or early chickens are desired, and every attention
  can be given to them. To check this desire, the old-fashioned
  plan with farmers' wives, of plunging the broody
  hen into cold water, and keeping her there for some
  minutes, was not only a cruel practice, but often failed to
  effect its object, and must naturally always have caused
  ultimate disease in the poor bird. When it is absolutely
  necessary to check the desire of a hen to sit, the best plan
  is to let her sit on some nest-eggs for a week, then remove
  and coop her for a few days, away from the place where
  she made her nest, low diet, as boiled potatoes and boiled
  rice, and water being placed near; meanwhile taking away
  the eggs and destroying the nest, and, not finding it on
  her return, she will generally not seek for another, unless
  she is a Cochin, or the desire exceedingly strong.</p>
<p>When a hen wishes to sit, she utters a peculiar cluck,
  ruffles her feathers, wanders about, searches obscure corners
  and recesses, is very fidgety, feverishly hot, impatient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> anxiously restless, and seeks for a nest. Highly-fed hens
  feel this desire sooner than those that are not so highly fed.
  A hen may be induced to sit at any season, by confining
  her in a dark room in a covered basket, only large enough
  to contain her nest, keeping her warm, and feeding her on
  stimulating food, such as bread steeped in ale, a little raw
  liver or fresh meat chopped small, and potatoes mashed
  warm with milk and oatmeal.</p>
<p>Every large poultry establishment should have a separate
  house for the sitting hens, and the run that should be provided
  for their relaxation must be divided from that of the
  other fowls by wire or lattice work, to prevent any intrusion.
  Where there is a large number of sitting hens, each
  nest should be numbered, and the date of setting, number
  and description of eggs, entered in a diary or memorandum
  book opposite to the number; and the number of chickens
  hatched, and any particulars likely to be useful on a future
  occasion, should afterwards be entered.</p>
<p>A separate house and run for each sitting hen is a great
  advantage, as it prevents other hens from going to the nest
  during her absence, or herself from returning to the wrong
  nest, as will often happen in a common house. The run
  should not be large, or the hen may be inclined to wander
  and stay away too long from her nest. A separate division
  for the sitting hen is often otherwise useful, for the
  purpose of keeping the cock apart from the hens, or for
  keeping a few additional birds for which accommodation
  has not been prepared, or for the use of a pen of birds
  about to be sent for exhibition.</p>
<p>&quot;Boxes, of which every carpenter knows the form,&quot; says
  Mowbray, &quot;are to be arranged round the walls, and it is
  proper to have a sufficient number, the hens being apt to
  dispute possession, and sit upon one another. The board
  or step at the entrance should be of sufficient height to
  prevent the eggs from rolling out. Provision of a few
  railed doors may be made for occasional use, to be hung
  before the entrance, in order to prevent other hens from
  intruding to lay their eggs upon those which sit, a habit to
  which some are much addicted, and by which a brood is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> often injured. The common deep square boxes, uncovered at
  top, are extremely improper, because that form obliges the
  hen to jump down upon her eggs, whereas for safety she
  should descend upon them from a very small height, or in
  a manner walk in upon them. The same objection lies
  against hampers, with the additional one of the wicker-work
  admitting the cold in variable weather, during winter
  or early spring sittings. Many breeders prefer to have all
  the nests upon the ground, on account of the danger of
  chickens falling from the nests which are placed above.&quot;
  The ground is preferable for other reasons. The damp
  arising from the ground assists very materially in incubation.
  When fowls sit upon wooden floors, or in boxes, the eggs
  become so dry and parched as to prevent the chicken from
  disencumbering itself of the shell, and it is liable to perish
  in its attempts. Hens in a state of nature make their
  nests upon the ground; and fowls, when left to choose a
  nest for themselves, generally fix upon a hedge, where the
  hen conceals herself under the branches of the hedge, and
  among the grass. In general, the sitting places are too
  close and confined, and very different in this respect to
  those that hens select for themselves.</p>
<p>But nests cannot always be allowed to be made on the
  ground, unless properly secured from vermin, particularly
  from rats, which will frequently convey away the whole of
  the eggs from under a hen. And other considerations may
  render it necessary to have them on a floor, in boxes on
  the ground, or placed above; in which cases the eggs must
  be kept properly moistened, for, unless the egg is kept
  sufficiently damp, its inner membrane becomes so hard and
  dry that the chicken cannot break through, and perishes.
  When a hen steals her nest in a hedge or clump of evergreens
  or bushes, she makes it on the damp ground. She
  goes in search of food early in the morning, before the dew
  is off the grass, and returns to her nest with her feathers
  saturated with moisture. This is the cause of the comparatively
  successful hatching of the eggs of wild birds. The
  old farmers' wives did not understand the necessity of
  damping eggs, but frequently complained of their not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> hatching, although chickens were found in them, which
  was, in most cases, entirely caused by want of damping.
  If, therefore, the weather is warm and wet, all will probably
  go well; but if the air should be very dry, moisture
  must be imparted by sprinkling the nest and eggs slightly,
  when the hen is off feeding, by means of a small brush
  dipped in tepid water. A small flat brush such as is used
  by painters is excellent for this purpose, as it does not distribute
  the water too freely. The ground round about,
  also, should be watered with hot water, to cause a steam.
  But the natural moisture of a damp soil is preferable, and
  never fails.</p>
<p>The nest may be of any shape. A long box divided by
  partitions into several compartments is much used, but
  separate boxes or baskets are preferable as being more
  easily cleaned and freed from vermin. Wooden nest-boxes
  are preferable to wicker baskets in winter, as the latter let
  in the cold air, but many prefer wicker baskets in summer
  for their airiness. A round glazed earthen pan, with
  shelving sides, like those used in the midland counties for
  milk, and partially filled with moss, forms a good nest, the
  moss being easier kept moist in such a pan than in a box.
  The nest should be made so large that the hen can just fill
  it, not very deep, and as nearly flat inside at the bottom as
  possible, so that the eggs may not lean against each other,
  or they may get broken, especially by the hen turning
  them.</p>
<p>The best filling for hatching nests is fine dry sand,
  mould, coal or wood ashes placed on a cut turf, covering it
  and lining the sides with a little well-broken dry grass,
  moss, bruised straw, lichen, or liverwort collected from
  trees, or dry heather, which is the best of all, but cannot
  always be had. Hay, though soft at first, soon becomes
  hard and matted, and is also said to breed vermin. Straw
  is good material, but must be cut into short pieces, for if
  long straw is used and the hen should catch her foot in it,
  and drag it after her when she leaves the nest, it will disturb,
  if not break, the eggs. The nests of the sitting hens
  in Her Majesty's poultry-yard at Windsor are made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> heather, which offers an excellent medium between the
  natural damp hedge-nest of the hen and the dryness of a
  box filled with straw, and also enables her to free herself
  from those insects which are so troublesome to sitting hens.
  A thick layer of ashes placed under the straw in cold
  weather will keep in the heat of the hen. A little Scotch
  snuff is a good thing to keep the nests free from vermin.</p>
<p>Where only a few fowls are kept, and a separate place
  cannot be found for the sitting hen, she can be placed on a
  nest which should be covered over with a coop, closed in
  with a little boarding or some other contrivance for a day
  or two, to prevent her being disturbed by any other fowls
  that have been accustomed to lay there. They will then
  soon use another nest. She should be carefully lifted off
  her nest, by taking hold of her under the wings, regularly
  every morning, exercised and fed, and then shut in,
  so that she cannot be annoyed.</p>
<p>It is best to allow a hen to keep the nest she has
  chosen when she shows an inclination to sit; and if she continues
  to sit steadily, and has not a sufficient number of
  eggs under her, or the eggs you desire her to hatch,
  remove her gently at night, replace the eggs with the
  proper batch, and place her quietly upon the nest again.
  Hens are very fond of choosing their own nests in out of
  the way places; and where the spot is not unsafe, or too
  much exposed to the weather, it is best to let her keep
  possession, for it has been noticed that, when she selects
  her own nest and manages for herself, she generally brings
  forth a good and numerous brood. Mr. Tegetmeier observes
  that he has &quot;reason to believe, indeed, that whatever care
  may be taken in keeping eggs, their vitality is better preserved
  when they are allowed to remain in the nest.
  Perhaps the periodical visits of the hen, while adding to
  her store of eggs, has a stimulating influence. The warmth
  communicated in the half-hour during which she occupies
  the nest may have a tendency to preserve the embryo in a
  vigorous state.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a good plan, before giving an untried hen choice
  eggs, to let her sit upon a few chalk or stale eggs for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> days, and if she continue to sit with constancy, then to
  give her the batch for hatching. When choice can be
  made out of several broody hens for a valuable batch of
  eggs, one should be selected with rather short legs, a broad
  body, large wings well furnished with feathers, and having
  the nails and spurs not too long or sharp. As a rule, hens
  which are the best layers are the worst sitters, and those
  with short legs are good sitters, while long-legged hens are
  not. Dorkings are the best sitters of all breeds, and by
  high feeding may be induced to sit in October, especially
  if they have moulted early, and with great care and
  attention chickens may be reared and made fit for table by
  Christmas. Early in the spring Dorkings only should be
  employed as mothers, for they remain much longer with
  their chickens than the Cochin-Chinas, but the latter may
  safely be entrusted with a brood after April. Cochins are
  excellent sitters, and, from the quantity of &quot;fluff&quot; which is
  peculiar to them, keep the eggs at a high and regular
  degree of heat. Their short legs also are advantageous
  for sitting. A Cochin hen can always be easily induced to
  sit, and eggs of theirs or of Brahma Pootras for sitting,
  are not wanted in the coldest weather.</p>
<p>Old hens are more steady sitters than pullets, more fond
  of their brood, and not so apt as pullets to leave them too
  soon. Indeed, pullets were formerly never allowed to sit
  before the second year of their laying, but now many
  eminent authorities think it best to let them sit when they
  show a strong desire to do so, considering that the prejudice
  against them upon this point is unfounded, and that
  young hens sit as well as older fowls. Pullets hatched
  early will generally begin to lay in November or December,
  if kept warm and well fed, and will sit in January or
  February.</p>
<p>Broody hens brought from a distance should be carried
  in a basket, covered over with a cloth.</p>
<p>The number of eggs to be set under a hen must be
  according to the extent of her wings and the temperature
  of the weather. Some say that the number may vary from
  nine to fourteen, but others would never give more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> nine in winter and early spring, and eleven in summer, to
  the largest hen, and two fewer to the smaller fowls. A
  Cochin-China may have fifteen of her own in summer.
  A hen should not be allowed more eggs than she can completely
  cover; for eggs that are not thoroughly covered
  become chilled, and fewer and weaker chickens will be
  hatched from too large a number than from a more moderate
  allowance. It is not only necessary to consider how
  many eggs a hen can hatch, but also how many chickens
  she can cover when they are partly grown. In January
  and February, not more than seven or eight eggs should
  be placed under the hen, as she cannot cover more than
  that number of chickens when they grow large, and exposure
  to the cold during the long winter nights would
  destroy many. &quot;The common order to set egges,&quot; says
  Mascall, &quot;is in odde numbers, as seven, nyne, eleven,
  thirteen, &amp;c., whiche is to make them lye round the neste,
  and to have the odde egge in the middest.&quot;</p>
<p>Eggs for sitting should be under a fortnight old, if possible,
  and never more than a month. Fresh eggs hatch in
  proper time, and, if good, produce strong, lively chicks;
  while stale eggs are hatched sometimes as much as two
  days later than new laid, and the chickens are often too
  weak to break the shell, while of those well out fewer will
  probably be reared. It is certain, as a general rule, that
  the older the egg the weaker will be its progeny. Every
  egg should be marked by a pencil or ink line drawn quite
  round it, so that it can be known without touching, and if
  another be laid afterwards it may be at once detected and
  removed, for hens will sometimes lay several after they
  have commenced sitting. Place the eggs under the hen
  with their larger ends uppermost.</p>
<p>Let the hen be well fed and supplied with water before
  putting her on the nest. Whole barley and soft food,
  chiefly barley-meal and mashed potatoes, should be given
  to her when she comes off the nest, and she must have as
  much as she will eat, for she leaves the nest but once daily,
  and the full heat of the body cannot be kept up without
  plenty of food; or she may have the same food as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> general stock. A good supply of water must be always
  within her reach. A good-sized shallow box or pan, containing
  fine coal-ashes, sand, or dry earth, to cleanse herself
  in, should always be ready near to the nest. She should
  be left undisturbed, and, as far as possible, allowed to
  manage her own business. When a hen shows impatience
  of her confinement, and frequently leaves the nest,
  M. Parmentier advises that half only of her usual meal
  should be given, after which she should be replaced on the
  nest and fed from the hand with hemp or millet seed, which
  will induce her to stay constantly on her eggs. Others
  will sit so long and closely that they become faint for want
  of food. Such hens should not be fed on the nest, but
  gently induced with some tempting dainty to take a little
  exercise, for they will not leave their eggs of their own
  accord, and feeding on the nest has crippled many a good
  sitter. It is not healthy for the hen to feed while sitting
  on or close by the nest, for she requires a little exercise
  and rolling in the dust-heap, as well as that the eggs
  should be exposed for the air to carry off any of that
  stagnant vapour which M. R&eacute;aumur proved to be so
  destructive to the embryo chickens; and it has also been
  shown by physiologists that the cooling of the eggs caused
  by this absence of the hen is essential to allow a supply
  of air to penetrate through the pores of the shell, for the
  respiration of the chick. When there are many hens sitting
  at the same time, it is a good plan to take them off their
  nests regularly at the same time every morning to feed,
  and afterwards give them an opportunity to cleanse themselves
  in a convenient dusting-place, and, if possible, allow
  them exercise in a good grass run. A hen should never be
  caught, but driven back gently to her nest.</p>
<p>A good hen will not stay away more than half an hour,
  unless infested with vermin, from want of having a proper
  dust-heap. But hens have often been absent for more than
  an hour, and yet have hatched seven or eight chickens;
  and instances have been known of their being absent for
  five and even for nine hours, and yet hatching a few. The
  following remarkable instance is recorded by an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> authority: &quot;Eggs had been supplied and a sitting hen
  lent to a neighbour, and, when she had set in a granary
  ten days, she was shut out through the carelessness of a
  servant. Being a stranger in the farmyard, the hen was
  not recognised, but supposed to have strayed in from an
  adjoining walk, and thirty hours elapsed before it was discovered
  that the hen had left her nest. The farmer's wife
  despaired of her brood; but, to her surprise and pleasure,
  eight chickens were hatched. The tiled roof of the granary
  was fully exposed to the rays of the sun, and the temperature
  very high, probably above 80 deg. during the day, and
  not much lower at night.&quot; Valuable eggs, therefore,
  should not be abandoned on account of a rather lengthened
  absence; and ordinary eggs should not be discarded as
  worthless if the hen has already sat upon them for a fortnight
  or so; but if she has been sitting for only a few
  days, it is safer to throw them away, and have a fresh
  batch.</p>
<p>During the hen's absence, always look at the eggs,
  remove any that may have been broken, and very gently
  wash any sticky or dirty eggs with a flannel dipped in
  milk-warm water. See that they are dry before putting
  them back. If the nest is also dirty, replace it with fresh
  material of the same kind. Gently drive the hen back to
  her nest as quickly as possible, to prevent any damage
  from the eggs becoming chilled. If a hen should break an
  egg with her feet or otherwise, it should be removed as
  soon as it is seen, or she may eat it, and, liking the taste,
  break and eat the others. Some hens have a bad habit of
  breaking and eating the eggs on which they are sitting, to
  cure which some recommend to boil an egg hard, bore a
  few holes in it, so that the inside can be seen, and give it
  while hot to the culprit, who will peck at the holes and
  burn herself; but hens with such propensities should be
  fattened for the table, for they are generally useless either
  for sitting or laying.</p>
<p>Some persons examine the eggs after the hen has sat
  upon them for six or seven days, and remove all that are
  sterile, by which plan more warmth and space are gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> for those that are fertile, and the warmth is not wasted
  upon barren eggs. They may be easily proved by holding
  them near to the flame of a candle, the eye being kept
  shaded by one hand, when the fertile eggs will appear dark
  and the sterile transparent. Another plan is to place the
  eggs on a drum, or between the hands, in the sunshine,
  and observe the shadow. If this wavers, by the motion of
  the chick, the eggs are good; but if the shadow shows no
  motion, they are unfertile. If two hens have been sitting
  during the same time, and many unfertile eggs are found
  in the two nests, all the fertile eggs should be placed under
  one hen, and a fresh batch given to the other. The eggs
  should not be moved after this time, except by the hen,
  more especially when incubation has proceeded for some
  time, lest the position of the chick be interfered with,
  for if taken up a little time before its exit, and incautiously
  replaced with the large end lowermost, the chicken, from
  its position, will not be able to chip the shell, and must
  therefore perish. The forepart of the chicken is towards
  the biggest end of the egg, and it is so placed in the shell
  that the beak is always uppermost. When the egg of a
  choice breed has been cracked towards the end of the
  period of incubation, the crack may be covered with a slip
  of gummed paper, or the unprinted border that is round
  a sheet of postage stamps, and the damaged egg will
  probably yet produce a fine chick.</p>
<p>It is a good plan to set two hens on the same day, for
  the two broods may be united under one if desirable, and
  on the hatching day, to prevent the newly-born chickens
  being crushed by the unhatched eggs, all that are hatched
  can be given to one hen, and the other take charge of the
  eggs, which are then more likely to be hatched, as, while
  the chickens are under the hen, she will sit higher from
  the eggs, and afford them less warmth when they require
  it most.</p>
<p>The hen of all kinds of gallinaceous fowls, from the
  Bantam to the Cochin-China, sits for twenty-one days, at
  which time, on an average, the chickens break the shell;
  but if the eggs are new laid it will often lessen the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> by five or six hours, while stale eggs will always be behind
  time. For the purpose of breaking the shell, the yet soft
  beak of the chicken is furnished, just above the point of the
  upper mandible, with a small, hard, horny scale, which,
  from the position of the head, as Mr. Yarrell observes, is
  brought in contact with the inner surface of the shell.
  This scale may be always seen on the beaks of newly-hatched
  chickens, but in the course of a short time peels
  off. It should not be removed. The peculiar sound, incorrectly
  called &quot;tapping,&quot; so perceptible within the egg
  about the nineteenth day of incubation, which was universally
  believed to be produced by the bill of the chick
  striking against the shell in order to break it and effect
  its release, has been incontestably proved, by the late Dr.
  F. R. Horner, of Hull, in a paper read by him before the
  British Association for the Advancement of Science, to be
  a totally distinct sound, being nothing more than the
  natural respiratory sound in the lungs of the young chick,
  which first begins to breathe at that period. Of course
  there is also an occasional sound made by the tapping of
  the beak in endeavouring to break the shell.</p>
<p>The time occupied in breaking the shell varies, according
  to the strength of the chick, from one to three hours
  usually, but extends sometimes to twenty-four, and even
  more. &quot;I have seen,&quot; says R&eacute;aumur, &quot;chicks continue at
  work for two days together; some work incessantly, while
  others take rest at intervals, according to their physical
  strength. Some, I have observed, begin to break the shell
  a great deal too soon; for, be it observed, they ought,
  before they make their exit, to have within them provision
  enough to serve for twenty-four hours without taking food,
  and for this purpose the unconsumed portion of the yolk
  enters through the navel. The chick, indeed, which comes
  out of the shell without taking up all the yolk is certain to
  droop and die in a few days after it is hatched. The
  assistance which I have occasionally tried to give to several
  of them, by way of completing their deliverance, has
  afforded me an opportunity of observing those which had
  begun to break their shells before this was accomplished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> and I have opened many eggs much fractured, in each of
  which the chick had as yet much of the yolk not absorbed.
  Some chicks have greater obstacles to overcome than
  others, since all shells are not of an equal thickness nor of
  an equal consistence; and the same inequality takes place
  in the lining membrane, and offers still greater difficulty to
  the emergent chick. The shells of the eggs of birds of
  various species are of a thickness proportionate to the
  strength of the chick that is obliged to break through
  them. The canary-bird would never be able to break the
  shell it is enclosed in if that were as thick as the egg of
  a barn-door fowl. The chick of a barn-door fowl, again,
  would in vain try to break its shell if it were as thick and
  hard as that of an ostrich; indeed, though an ostrich ready
  to be hatched is perhaps thrice as large as the common
  chick, it is not easy to conceive how the force of its bill
  can be strong enough to break a shell thicker than a china
  cup, and the smoothness and gloss of which indicate that
  it is nearly as hard&mdash;sufficiently so to form, as may be
  often seen, a firm drinking-cup. It is the practice in some
  countries to dip the eggs into warm water at the time they
  are expected to chip, on the supposition that the shell is
  thereby rendered more fragile, and the labour of the chick
  lightened. But, though the water should soften it, upon
  drying in the air it would become as hard as at first.
  When the chick is entirely or almost out of the shell, it
  draws its head from under its wing, where it had hitherto
  been placed, stretches out its neck, directing it forwards,
  but for several minutes is unable to raise it. On seeing
  for the first time a chick in this condition, we are led to
  infer that its strength is exhausted, and that it is ready to
  expire; but in most cases it recruits rapidly, its organs
  acquire strength, and in a very short time it appears quite
  another creature. After having dragged itself on its legs
  a little while, it becomes capable of standing on them, and
  of lifting up its neck and bending it in various directions,
  and at length of holding up its head. At this period the
  feathers are merely fine down, but, as they are wet with
  the fluid of the egg, the chick appears almost naked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> From the multitude of their branchlets these down feathers
  resemble minute shrubs; when, however, these branchlets
  are wet and sticking to each other, they take up but very
  little room; as they dry they become disentangled and separated.
  The branchlets, plumules, or beards of each feather
  are at first enclosed in a membranous tube, by which they
  are pressed and kept close together; but as soon as this
  dries it splits asunder, an effect assisted also by the elasticity
  of the plumules themselves, which causes them to
  recede and spread themselves out. This being accomplished,
  each down feather extends over a considerable
  space, and when they all become dry and straight, the
  chick appears completely clothed in a warm vestment of
  soft down.&quot;</p>
<p>If they are not out in a few hours after the shell has been
  broken, and the hole is not enlarged, they are probably glued
  to the shell. Look through the egg then, and, if all the
  yolk has passed into the body of the chicken, you may assist
  it by enlarging the fracture with a pair of fine scissors,
  cutting up towards the large end of the egg, never downwards.
  &quot;If,&quot; says Miss Watts, &quot;the time has arrived when
  the chicken may with safety be liberated, there will be no
  appearance of blood in the minute blood-vessels spread
  over the interior of the shell; they have done their work,
  and are no longer needed by the now fully developed and
  breathing chick. If there should be the slightest appearance
  of blood, resist at once, for its escape would generally
  be fatal. Do not attempt to let the chicken out at once,
  but help it a little every two or three hours. The object
  is not to hurry the chicken out of its shell, but to prevent
  its being suffocated by being close shut up within it. If
  the chick is tolerably strong, and the assistance needful, it
  will aid its deliverance with its own exertions.&quot; When
  the chicken at last makes its way out, do not interfere with
  it in any way, or attempt to feed it. Animal heat alone can
  restore it. Weakness has caused the delay, and this has
  probably arisen from insufficient warmth, perhaps from the
  hen having had too many eggs to cover thoroughly, or
  they may have been stale when set. Should you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> to assist it out of the shell, take it out gently with your
  fingers, taking great care not to tear any of its tender
  skin, when freeing the feathers from the shell.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright says: &quot;We never ourselves now attempt to
  assist a chick from the shell. If the eggs were fresh, and
  proper care has been taken to preserve moisture during
  incubation, no assistance is ever needed. To fuss about
  the nest frets the hen exceedingly; and we have always
  found that, even where the poor little creature survived at
  the time, it never lived to maturity. Should the reader
  attempt such assistance, in cases where an egg has been long
  chipped, and no further progress made, let the shell be
  cracked gently all round, without tearing the inside membrane;
  if that be perforated, the viscid fluid inside dries
  and glues the chick to the shell. Should this happen, or
  should both shell and membrane be perforated at first,
  introduce the point of a pair of scissors and cut up the egg
  towards the large end, where there will be an empty space,
  remembering that, if blood flows, all hope is at end. Then
  put the chick back under the hen; she will probably
  squeeze it to death, it is true&mdash;it is so very weak; but
  it will never live if put by the fire, at least we always found
  it so. Indeed, as we have said, we consider it quite
  useless to make the attempt at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The fact is, it is scarcely worth while to attempt to assist
  in the case of ordinary eggs, but if the breed is valuable
  the labour may be well bestowed.</p>
<p>Some hens are reluctant to give up sitting, and will
  hatch a second brood with evident pleasure; but it is cruel
  to overtask their strength and patience, and they are
  sure to suffer, more or less, from the unnatural exertion.</p>
<p>Some breeders use a contrivance called an &quot;artificial
  mother&quot; for broods hatched under the hen, and it may be
  employed very advantageously when any accident has happened
  to her. It is made in various forms, such as a wooden
  frame, or shallow box, open at both ends, and sloping like
  a writing-desk, with a perforated lid lined with sheep
  or lamb's skin, goose-down, or some similar warm fleecy
  material hanging down, under and between which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> chickens nestle, heat being applied to the lid either by hot
  water or hot air, so as to imitate the warmth of the hen's
  breast. When chickens are hatched by artificial means,
  such as by the Hydro-Incubator, or the Eccaleobion, or in an
  oven according to the method practised by the Egyptians,
  these protectors are essential; for without a good substitute
  for the hen's natural warmth the chickens would perish.
  Artificial incubators are now extensively used, and where
  gas is laid on they are easily managed, but the chief difficulty
  is in rearing the chickens. For information on the
  subject see the works of Tegetmeier, Dickson, and Wright,
  on Poultry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>REARING AND FATTENING FOWLS.</h3>
<p>The first want which the chick will feel will be that of
  warmth, and there is no warmth so suited for them as that
  of the hen's body. Some persons remove the chicks from
  under the mother as soon as they are hatched, one by one,
  placing them in a basket covered up with flannel, and
  keep them there in a warm place, until the last chick
  is out, when they are put back under the hen. But this is
  very seldom necessary unless the weather is very cold and
  the hen restless, and is generally more likely to annoy than
  benefit her. Nor should the hen be induced to leave the
  nest, but be left undisturbed until she leaves of her own
  accord, when the last hatched chickens will be in a better
  condition to follow her than if she had been tempted
  to leave earlier. In a few hours they are able to run
  about and follow their parent; they do not require to be
  fed in the nest like most birds, but pick up the food
  which their mother shows them; and repose at night
  huddled up beneath her wings. The chicken during its
  development in the egg is nourished by the yolk, and the
  remaining portion of the yolk passes into its body previous
  to its leaving the shell, being designed for its first nourishment;
  and the chicken, therefore, does not require any food
  whatever during the first day. The old-fashioned plan, so
  popular with &quot;practical&quot; farmers' wives, of cramming a
  peppercorn down the throat of the newly-hatched chick
  is absurd and injurious.</p>
<p>The first food must be very light and delicate, such as
  crumbs of bread soaked in milk, the yolk of an egg boiled
  hard, and curds; but very little of anything at first except
  water, for thirst will come before hunger. The thirsty hen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> will herself soon teach the little ones how to drink. If
  your chicks be very weakly, you may cram them with
  crumbs of good white bread, steeped in milk or wine, but
  at the same time recollect that their little craws are not
  capable of holding more than the bulk of a pea; so rather
  under than over feed them.</p>
<p>As soon as the hen leaves the nest, she should have as
  much grain as she can eat, and a good supply of pure,
  clean water. In winter, or settled wet weather, she should,
  if possible, be kept on her nest for a day, and, when
  removed, be cooped in a warm, dry shed or outhouse;
  but in summer, if the weather be fine, and the chickens
  well upon their legs, they may be at once cooped out in
  the sun, on dry gravel, or if possible on a nice grass-plot,
  with food and water within her reach. The hen is cooped
  to prevent her from wearying the brood by leading them
  about until they are over-tired, besides being exposed to
  danger from cats, hawks, and vermin, tumbling into ditches,
  or getting wet in the high grass. They can pass in and
  out between the bars of the coop, and will come when she
  calls, or they wish to shelter under her wings. It is a
  good plan to place the coop for the first day out upon
  some dry sand, so that the hen can cleanse herself comfortably.
  The common basket coop should only be used
  in fine weather, and some straw, kept down by a stone,
  matting, or other covering, should be placed on the top, to
  shelter them from the mid-day sun; otherwise a wooden
  coop should be used, open in front only, about two and
  a half or three feet square; well-made of stout, sound
  boards, with a gabled roof covered with felt; and at night
  a thick canvas or matting should be hung over the front,
  sufficient space being left for proper ventilation, but not to
  admit cold draught, or to allow the chicks to get out.
  Mr. Wright describes an excellent coop which is &quot;very
  common in some parts of France, and consists of two
  compartments, separated by a partition of bars, one compartment
  being closed in front, the other fronted with bars
  like the partition. Each set of bars should have a sliding
  one to serve as a door, and the whole coop should be tight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> and sound. It is best to have no bottom, but to put it on
  loose dry earth or ashes, an inch or two deep. Each half
  of the coop is about two feet six inches square, and may
  or may not be lighted from the top by a small pane of
  glass. The advantage of such a coop is that, except in
  very severe weather, no further shelter is required, even at
  night [if placed under a shed]. During the day the hen
  is kept in the outer compartment, the chickens having
  liberty, and the food and water being placed outside;
  whilst at night she is put in the inner portion of the coop,
  and a piece of canvas or sacking hung over the bars of the
  outer half. If the top be glazed, a little food and the
  water-vessel may be placed in the outer compartment at
  night, and the chicks will be able to run out and feed early
  in the morning, being prevented by the canvas from going
  out into the cold air. It will be only needful to remove
  the coop every two days for a few minutes, to take away
  the tainted earth and replace it with fresh. There should,
  if possible, be a grass-plot in front of the shed, the floor
  of which should be covered with dry, loose dust or earth.&quot;
  The hen should be kept under a coop until the brood has
  grown strong. Some breeders object to cooping, on account
  of its preventing the hen from scratching for worms
  and insects for her brood, and which are far superior to
  the substitutes with which they must be supplied, unless,
  indeed, a good supply of worms, ants' eggs, insects, or
  gentles can be had. The hen too has not sufficient exercise
  after her long sitting. Cooping thus has its advantages
  and disadvantages, and its adoption or not should depend
  upon circumstances. If it is preferred not to coop the hen,
  and she should be inclined to roam too far, a small run may
  be made with network, or with the moveable wire-work
  described on <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>.</p>
<p>Winter-hatched chickens must be reared and fed in
  a warm place, which must be kept at an equal temperature.
  They return a large profit for the great care they
  require in hatching and rearing.</p>
<p>Chickens should be fed very often; every two hours is
  not too frequently. The number of these meals must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> reduced by degrees to four or five, which may be continued
  until they are full grown. Grain should not be
  given to newly-hatched chickens. The very best food for
  them, after their first meal of bread-crumbs and egg, is
  made of two parts of coarse oatmeal and one part of barley-meal,
  mixed into a thick crumbly paste with milk or
  water. If milk is used, it must be fresh mixed for each
  meal, or it will become sour. Cold oatmeal porridge is an
  excellent food, and much liked by them. After the first
  week they may have cheaper food, such as bran, oatmeal,
  and Indian meal mixed, or potatoes mashed with bran.
  In a few days they may also have some whole grain, which
  their little gizzards will then be fully able to grind. Grits,
  crushed wheat, or bruised oats, should form the last meal
  at night. Bread sopped in water is the worst food they
  can have, and even with milk is still inferior to meal.
  For the first three or four days they may also have daily
  the yolk of an egg boiled hard and chopped up small,
  which will be sufficient for a dozen chicks; and afterwards,
  a piece of cooked meat, rather underdone, the size of a
  good walnut, minced fine, should be daily given to the
  brood until they are three weeks old. In winter and very
  early spring this stimulating diet may be given regularly,
  and once a day they should also have some stale bread
  soaked in ale; and whenever chickens suffer from bad
  feathering, caused either by the coldness of the season or
  delicacy of constitution, they must be fed highly, and
  have a daily supply of bread soaked in ale. Ants' eggs,
  which are well known as the very best animal diet for
  young pheasants, are also excellent for young chickens;
  and when a nest can be obtained it should be thrown with
  its surrounding mould into the run for them to peck at.
  Where there is no grass-plot they should have some grass
  cut into small pieces, or other vegetable food minced small,
  until they are able to peck pieces from the large leaves.
  Onion tops and leeks chopped small, cress, lettuce, and
  cabbage, are much relished by all young poultry. The
  French breeders give a few dried nettle seeds occasionally.
  Young growing fowls can scarcely have too much food, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> long as they eat it with a good appetite, and do not tread
  any about, or otherwise leave it to waste.</p>
<p>Young poultry cannot thrive if overcrowded. They
  should not be allowed to roost on the branches of trees or
  shrubs, or otherwise out of doors, even in the warmest
  weather, or they will acquire the habit of sleeping out,
  which cannot be easily overcome; not that they would suffer
  much from even severe weather, when once accustomed to
  roosting out of doors, but from want of warmth the supply
  of eggs would decrease, and it would, in many places,
  be unsafe and, in most, inconvenient.</p>
<p>The sooner chickens can be fattened, of course the
  greater must be the profit. They should be put up for
  fattening as soon as they have quitted the hen, for they are
  then generally in good condition, but begin to lose flesh as
  their bones develop and become stronger, particularly
  those fowls which stand high on the leg.</p>
<p>Fowls are in perfection for eating just before they are
  fully developed. By keeping young fowls, especially the
  cockerels, too long before fattening them for market
  or home consumption, they eat up all the profit that would
  be made by disposing of them when the pullets have
  ceased laying just before their first adult moult, and the
  cockerels before their appetites have become large. Fowls
  intended to be fattened should be well and abundantly fed
  from their birth; for if they are badly fed during their
  growth they become stunted, the bones do not attain their
  full size, and no amount of feeding will afterwards supply
  these defects and transform them into fine, large birds.
  Poultry that have been constantly fed well from their birth
  will not only be always ready for the table, with very little
  extra attention and feeding, but their flesh will be superior
  in juiciness and rich flavour to those which are fattened
  up from a poor state. In choosing full-grown fowls for
  fattening, the short-legged and early-hatched should be
  preferred.</p>
<p>In fattening poultry, &quot;the well-known common
  methods,&quot; Mowbray observes, &quot;are, first, to give fowls the
  run of the farmyard, where they thrive upon the offals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> the stables and other refuse, with perhaps some small
  regular feeds; but at threshing time they become fat, and
  are thence styled barn-door fowls, probably the most delicate
  and high-flavoured of all others, both from their full
  allowance of the finest corn and from the constant health
  in which they are kept, by living in the natural state, and
  having the full enjoyment of air and exercise; or secondly,
  they are confined during a certain number of weeks in
  coops; those fowls which are soonest ready being drawn as
  wanted.&quot; &quot;The former method,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;is
  immeasurably the best as regards the flavour and even
  wholesomeness of the fowls as food, and though the
  latter mode may, in some cases, make the fowls fatter, it is
  only when they have been always accustomed to confinement;
  for when barn-door fowls are cooped up for a week
  or two under the notion of improving them for the table,
  and increasing their fat, it rarely succeeds, since the fowls
  generally pine for their liberty, and, slighting their food,
  lose instead of gaining additional flesh.&quot;</p>
<p>To fatten fowls that have not the advantage of a barn-door,
  Mowbray recommends fattening-houses large enough
  to contain twenty or thirty fowls, warm and airy, with
  well-raised earth floors, slightly littered down with straw,
  which should be often changed, and the whole place kept
  perfectly clean. &quot;Sandy gravel,&quot; he says, &quot;should be
  placed in several different layers, and often changed. A
  sufficient number of troughs for both water and food
  should be placed around, that the stock may feed with as
  little interruption as possible from each other, and perches
  in the same proportion should be furnished for those birds
  which are inclined to perch, which few of them will desire
  after they have begun to fatten, but it helps to keep them
  easy and contented until that period. In this manner
  fowls may be fattened to the highest pitch, and yet preserved
  in a healthy state, their flesh being nearly equal in
  quality to the barn-door fowl. To suffer fattening fowls to
  perch is contrary to the general practice, since it is supposed
  to bend and deform the backbone; but as soon as
  they become heavy and indolent from feeding, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> rather incline to roost in the straw, and the liberty of
  perching has a tendency to accelerate the period when they
  wish for rest.&quot;</p>
<p>The practice of fattening fowls in coops, if carried to a
  moderate extent, is not objectionable, and may be necessary
  in many cases. The coop may be three feet high, two
  feet wide, and four feet long, which will accommodate six
  or eight birds, according to their size; or it may be constructed
  in compartments, each being about nine inches by
  eighteen, and about eighteen inches high. The floor should
  not consist of board, but be formed of bars two inches
  wide, and placed two inches apart. The bars should be
  laid from side to side, and not from the back to the front
  of the coop. They should be two inches wide at the upper
  part, with slanting or rounded sides, so as to prevent the dung
  from sticking to them instead of falling straight between.
  The front should be made of rails three inches apart. The
  house in which the coops are placed should be properly
  ventilated, but free from cold draughts, and kept of an
  even temperature, which should be moderately warm. The
  fronts of the coops should be covered with matting or
  other kind of protection in cold weather. The coop should
  be placed about two inches from the ground, and a shallow
  tray filled with fresh dry earth should be placed underneath
  to catch the droppings, and renewed every day.</p>
<p>When fowls are put up to fat they should not have any
  food given to them for some hours, and they will take it
  then more eagerly than if pressed upon them when first
  put into the coop. But little grain should be given to
  fowls during the time they are fattening in coops; indeed
  the chief secret of success consists in supplying them with
  the most fattening food without stint, in such a form that
  their digestive mills shall find no difficulty in grinding it.
  Buckwheat-meal is the best food for fattening; and to its
  use the French, in a great measure, owe the splendid condition
  of the fowls they send to market. If it cannot be
  had, the best substitute is an equal mixture of maize-meal
  and barley-meal. The meal may be mixed with skim
  milk if available. Oatmeal and barley-meal alternately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> mixed with milk, and occasionally with a little dripping, is
  good fattening food. Milk is most excellent for all young
  poultry. A little chopped green food should be given
  daily, to keep their bowels in a proper state.</p>
<p>The feeding-troughs, which must be kept clean by
  frequent scouring, should be placed before the fowls at
  regular times, and when they have eaten sufficient it
  is best to remove them, and place a little gravel within
  reach to assist digestion. Each fowl should have as much
  food as it will eat at one time, but none should be left to
  become sour. A little barley may, however, be scattered
  within their reach. A good supply of clean water must be
  always within their reach. If a bird appears to be troubled
  with vermin, some powdered sulphur, well rubbed into the
  roots of the feathers, will give immediate relief. The
  coops should be thoroughly lime-washed after the fowls
  are removed, and well dried before fresh birds are put up
  in them.</p>
<p>It is a common practice to fatten poultry in coops by a
  process called &quot;cramming,&quot; by which they are loaded with
  greasy fat in a very short time. But it is evident that
  such overtaxing of the fowls' digestive powers, want of
  exercise and fresh air, confinement in a small space, and
  partial deprivation of light, without which nothing living,
  either animal or vegetable, can flourish, cannot produce
  healthy or wholesome flesh. &quot;Indeed,&quot; as Mowbray observes,
  &quot;it seems contrary to reason, that fowls fed upon
  such greasy, impure mixtures can possibly produce flesh
  or fat so firm, delicate, high-flavoured, or nourishing,
  as those fattened upon more simple and substantial food;
  as for example, meal and milk, and perhaps either treacle
  or sugar. With respect to grease of any kind, its chief
  effect must be to render the flesh loose and of a coarse
  flavour. Neither can any advantage be gained, except
  perhaps a commercial one, by very quick feeding; for
  real excellence cannot be obtained but by waiting nature's
  time, and using the best food. Besides all this, I have
  been very unsuccessful in my few attempts to fatten fowls
  by cramming; they seem to loathe the crams, to pine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> to lose the flesh they were put up with, instead of acquiring
  flesh; and when crammed fowls do succeed, they must
  necessarily, in the height of their fat, be in a state of
  disease.&quot; Mr. Muirhead, poulterer to Her Majesty in
  Scotland, says: &quot;With regard to <i>cramming</i>, I may say
  that it is <i>wholly</i> unnecessary, provided the fowls have
  abundance of the best food at regular intervals, fresh air, and
  a free run; in confinement fowls may gain fat, but they
  lose flesh. None but those who have had experience can
  form any idea how both qualities can be obtained in
  a natural way. I have seen fowls reared at Inchmartine
  (which had never been shut up, or had food forced upon
  them), equal, if not superior, to the finest Surrey fowl,
  or those fattened by myself for the Royal table.&quot;</p>
<p>If &quot;cramming&quot; is practised it should be done in the
  following manner: The feeder, usually a female, should
  take the fowl carefully out of the fatting-coop by placing
  both her hands gently under its breast, then sit down with
  the bird upon her lap, its rump under her left arm, open
  its mouth with the finger and thumb of the left hand, take
  the pellet with the right, dip it well into water, milk, or
  pot liquor, shake the superfluous moisture from it, put it
  into the mouth, &quot;cram&quot; it gently into the gullet with her
  forefinger, then close the beak and gently assist it down
  into the crop with the forefinger and thumb, without
  breaking the pellet, and taking great care not to pinch the
  throat. When the fowl has been &quot;crammed&quot; it should be
  carefully carried back to its coop, both hands being placed
  under its breast as before. Chickens should be &quot;crammed&quot;
  regularly every twelve hours. The &quot;cramming&quot; should
  commence with a few pellets, and the number be gradually
  increased at each meal until it amounts to about
  fifteen. But always before you begin to feed gently feel
  the fowl's crop to ascertain that the preceding meal has
  been digested, and if you find it to contain food, let the
  bird wait until it is all digested, and give it fewer pellets
  at the next meal. If the &quot;crams&quot; should become hardened
  in the crop, some lukewarm water must be given to
  the bird, or poured down its throat if disinclined to drink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> and the crop be gently pressed with the fingers until the
  hardened mass has become loosened so that the gizzard can
  grind it.</p>
<p>The food chiefly used in France for &quot;cramming&quot; fowls
  is buckwheat-meal bolted very fine and mixed with milk.
  It should be prepared in the following manner: Pour the
  milk, which should be lukewarm in winter, into a hole
  made in the heap of meal, mixing it up with a wooden
  spoon a little at a time as long as the meal will take up the
  milk, and make it into the consistency of dough, keep
  kneading it until it will not stick to the hands, then divide
  it into pieces twice as large as an egg, which form into
  rolls generally about as thick as a small finger, but more
  or less thick according to the size of the fowls to be fed,
  and divide the rolls into pellets about two and a half inches
  in length by a slanting cut, which leaves pointed ends, that
  are easier to &quot;cram&quot; the fowls with than if they were
  square. The pellets should be rolled up as dry as
  possible.</p>
<p>The operation of caponising as performed in England is
  barbarous, extremely painful, and dangerous. In France
  it is performed in a much more scientific and skilful
  manner. But the small advantage gained by this unnatural
  operation is more than counterbalanced by the
  unnecessary pain inflicted on the bird, and the great risk
  of losing it. Capons never moult, and lose their previously
  strong, shrill voice. In warm, dry countries they
  grow to a large size, and soon fatten, but do not succeed
  well in our moist, cold climate. They are not common in
  this country, and most of the fowls sold in the London
  markets as capons are merely young cockerels well
  crammed. If capons are kept they should have a separate
  house, for the other fowls will not allow those even of their
  own family to occupy the same roosting-perch with them.
  The hens not only show them indifference, but decided
  aversion. Hen chickens, deprived of their reproductive
  organs in order to fatten them sooner, are common in
  France, where they are styled poulardes.</p>
<p>Fattening ought to be completed in from ten to twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> days. When fowls are once fattened up they should be
  killed, for they cannot be kept fat, but begin to lose flesh
  and become feverish, which renders their flesh red and
  unsaleable, and frequently causes their death.</p>
<p>Great cruelty is often ignorantly inflicted by poulterers,
  higglers, and others, in &quot;twisting the necks&quot; of poultry.
  An easy mode of killing a fowl is to give the bird a very
  sharp blow with a small but heavy blunt stick, such as a
  child's bat or wooden sword, at the back of the neck, about
  the second or third joint from the head, which will, if
  properly done, sever the spine and cause death very
  speedily. But the knife is the most merciful means; the
  bird being first hung up by the legs, the mouth must be
  opened wide, and a long, narrow, sharp-pointed knife, like
  a long penknife, which instrument is made for the purpose,
  should be thrust firmly through the back part of the roof of
  the mouth up into the brain, which will cause almost instant
  death. Another mode of killing is to pluck a few feathers
  from the side of the head, just below the ear, and make a
  deep incision there. Some say that fowls should not be
  bled to death like turkeys and geese, as, from the loss
  of blood, the flesh becomes dry and insipid. But when
  great whiteness of flesh is desired, the fowl should be
  hung up by its legs immediately after being killed, and if
  it has been killed without the flow of blood, an incision
  should be made in the neck so that it may bleed freely.</p>
<p>Fowls that have been kept without food and water for
  twelve hours before being killed will keep much better
  than if they had been recently fed, as the food is apt
  to ferment in the crop and bowels, which often causes the
  fowl to turn green in a few hours in warm weather. If
  empty they should not be drawn, and they will keep much
  better. Fowls are easiest plucked at once, while warm;
  they should afterwards be scalded by dipping them for a
  moment in boiling water, which will give a plump appearance
  to any good fowl. Fowls should not be packed for
  market before they are quite cold. Old fowls should not
  be roasted, but boiled, and they will then prove tolerably
  good eating.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>The feathers are valuable and should be preserved, which
  is very easily managed. &quot;Strip the plumage,&quot; says Mr.
  Wright, &quot;from the quills of the larger feathers, and mix
  with the small ones, putting the whole loosely in paper
  bags, which should be hung up in the kitchen, or some
  other warm place, for a few days to dry. Then let the
  bags be baked three or four times for half an hour each
  time, in a cool oven, drying for two days between each
  baking, and the process will be completed. Less trouble
  than this will do, and is often made to suffice; but the
  feathers are inferior in crispness to those so treated, and
  may occasionally become offensive.&quot;</p>

<h3>STOCK, BREEDING, AND CROSSING.</h3>
<p>Keep only good, healthy, vigorous, well-bred fowls,
  whether you keep them to produce eggs or chickens, or
  both. The ill-bred mongrel fowls which are so commonly
  kept, are the most voracious, and consume larger quantities
  of food, without turning it to any account; while
  well-bred fowls eat less, and quickly convert that into fat,
  flesh, and eggs. &quot;Large, well-bred fowls,&quot; says Mr.
  Edwards, &quot;do not consume more food than ravenous,
  mongrel breeds. It is the same with fowls as with other
  stock. I have at this moment two store pigs, one highly
  bred, the other a rough, ill-bred animal. They have,
  since they left their mothers, been fed together and upon
  the same food. The former, I am confident (from observation),
  ate considerably less than the latter, which was particularly
  ravenous. The former pig, however, is in excellent
  condition, kind, and in a measure fat; whereas the latter
  looks hard, starved, and thin, and I am sure she will require
  one-third more food to make bacon of.&quot;</p>
<p>For the amateur who is content with eggs and chickens,
  and does not long for prize cups, excellent birds possessing
  nearly all the best characteristics of their breeds, but rendered
  imperfect by a few blemishes, may be purchased at
  a small cost, and will be as good layers or chicken-producers,
  and answer his purpose as well as the most expensive
  that can be bought.</p>
<p>The choice of breed must depend upon the object for
  which the fowls are kept, whether chiefly for eggs or to
  produce chickens, or for both; the climate, soil, and
  situation; the space that can be allotted to them; and the
  amount of attention that can be devoted to their care. If
  fowls are to be bred for exhibition, you must be guided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> your own taste, pocket, and resources, as well as by the
  suitability of the situation for the particular breed desired.
  The advantages, disadvantages, and peculiarities of the
  various breeds will be described under their respective
  heads.</p>
<p>In commencing poultry-keeping buy only young and
  healthy birds. No one sign is infallible to the inexperienced.
  In general, however, the legs of a young hen look delicate
  and smooth, her comb and wattles are soft and fresh, and
  her general outline, even in good condition (unless when
  fattened for the table), rather light and graceful; whilst
  an old one will have rather hard, horny-looking shanks;
  her comb and wattles look somewhat harder, drier, and
  more &quot;scurfy,&quot; and her figure is well filled out. But any
  of these signs may be deceptive, and the beginner should
  use his own powers of observation, and try and catch the
  &quot;old look,&quot; which he will soon learn to know.</p>
<p>All authorities agree that a cock is in his prime at two
  years of age, though some birds show every sign of full
  vigour when only four months old. It is agreed by nearly all
  the greatest authorities that the ages of the cocks and hens
  should be different; however, good birds may be bred from
  parents of the same age, but they should not be less than a
  year old. The strongest chickens are obtained from two-year
  old hens by a cockerel of about a year old; but such
  broods contain a disproportion of cocks, and, therefore,
  most poultry-keepers prefer to breed from well-grown
  pullets of not less than nine months with a cock of two
  years of age. The cock should not be related to the hens.
  It is, therefore, not advisable to purchase him from the
  same breeder of whom you procure the hens. Do not let
  him be the parent of chickens from pullets that are his own
  offspring. Breeding in-and-in causes degeneracy in fowls
  as in all other animals. Some birds retain all their fire and
  energy until five or even six years of age, but they are
  beyond their prime after the third, or at the latest their
  fourth year; and should be replaced by younger birds of the
  same breed, but from a different stock.</p>
<p>Poultry-breeders differ with respect to the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> number of hens that should be allowed to one cock.
  Columella, who wrote upon poultry about two thousand
  years ago, advised twelve hens to one cock, but stated that
  &quot;our ancestors did use to give but five hens.&quot; Stephanus
  gave the same number as Columella. Bradley, and the
  authors of the &quot;Complete Farmer,&quot; and the article upon
  the subject in &quot;Rees's Cyclop&aelig;dia,&quot; give seven or eight;
  and those who breed game-cocks are particular in limiting
  the number of hens to four or five for one cock, in order to
  obtain strong chickens. If fine, strong chickens be desired
  for fattening or breeding, there should not be more than
  five or six hens to one cock; but if the supply of eggs is
  the chief consideration, ten or twelve may be allowed;
  indeed, if eggs are the sole object, he can be dispensed with
  altogether, and his food saved, as hens lay, if there be any
  difference, rather better without one.</p>
<p>The russet red is the most hardy colour, white the most
  delicate, and black the most prolific. General directions
  for the choice of fowls, as to size, shape, and colour, cannot
  be applicable to all breeds, which must necessarily vary
  upon these points. But in all breeds the cock should, as
  M. Parmentier says, &quot;carry his head high, have a quick,
  animated look, a strong, shrill voice (except in the Cochins,
  which have a fuller tone), a fine red comb, shining as if
  varnished, large wattles of the same colour, strong wings,
  muscular thighs, thick legs furnished with strong spurs,
  the claws rather bent and sharply pointed. He ought also
  to be free in his motions, to crow frequently, and to scratch
  the ground often in search of worms, not so much for himself,
  as to treat his hens. He ought, withal, to be brisk,
  spirited, ardent, and ready in caressing the hens, quick in
  defending them, attentive in soliciting them to eat, in keeping
  them together, and in assembling them at night.&quot;</p>
<p>To prevent cocks from fighting, old Mascall, following
  Columella, says: &quot;Now, to slacke that heate of jealousie,
  ye shall slitte two pieces of thicke leather, and put them on
  his legges, and those will hang over his feete, which will
  correct the vehement heate of jealousie within him&quot;; and
  M. Parmentier observes that &quot;such a bit of leather will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> cause the most turbulent cock to become as quiet as a man
  who is fettered at the feet, hands, and neck.&quot;</p>
<p>The hen should be of good constitution and temper,
  and, if required to sit, large in the body and wide in the
  wings, so as to cover many eggs and shelter many chickens,
  but short in the legs, or she could not sit well. M.
  Parmentier advises the rejection of savage, quarrelsome,
  or peevish hens, as such are seldom favourites with the
  cocks, scarcely ever lay, and do not hatch well; also all
  above four or five years of age, those that are too fat to
  lay, and those whose combs and claws are rough, which
  are signs that they have ceased to lay. Hens should not
  be kept over their third year unless very good or choice.
  Hens are not uncommon with the plumage and spurs of
  the cock, and which imitate, though badly, his full-toned
  crow. In such fowls the power of producing eggs is invariably
  lost from internal disease, as has been fully demonstrated
  by Mr. Yarrell in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;
  for 1827, and in the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological
  Society&quot; for 1831. Such birds should be fattened and
  killed as soon as observed.</p>
<p>By careful study of the characteristics of the various
  breeds, breeding from select specimens, and judicious
  crossing, great size may be attained, maturity early developed,
  facility in putting on flesh encouraged, hardiness of
  constitution and strength gained, and the inclination to sit
  or the faculty of laying increased.</p>
<p>Sir John Sebright, speaking of breeding cattle, says:
  &quot;Animals may be said to be improved when any desired
  quality has been increased by art beyond what that quality
  was in the same breed in a state of nature. The swiftness
  of the racehorse, the propensity to fatten in cattle, and to
  produce fine wool in sheep, are improvements which have
  been made in particular varieties in the species to which
  these animals belong. What has been produced by art
  must be continued by the same means, for the most
  improved breeds will soon return to a state of nature, or
  perhaps defects will arise which did not exist when the breed
  was in its natural state, unless the greatest attention is paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> to the selection of the individuals who are to breed
  together.&quot;</p>
<p>The exact origin of the common domestic fowl and its
  numerous varieties is unknown. It is doubtless derived
  from one or more of the wild or jungle fowls of India.
  Some naturalists are of opinion that it is derived from the
  common jungle fowl known as the <i>Gallus bankiva</i> of Temminck,
  or <i>Gallus ferrugineus</i> of Gmelin, which very closely
  resembles the variety known as Black-breasted Red Game,
  except that the tail of the cock is more depressed; while
  others consider it to have been produced by the crossing
  of that species with one or more others, as the Malay
  gigantic fowl, known as the <i>Gallus giganteus</i> of Temminck,
  Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, <i>Gallus sonneratii</i>, and probably
  some other species. At what period or by what people
  it was reclaimed is not known, but it was probably first
  domesticated in India. The writers of antiquity speak of
  it as a bird long domesticated and widely spread in their
  days. Very likely there are many species unknown to us
  in Sumatra, Java, and the rich woods of Borneo.</p>
<p>The process by which the various breeds have been produced
  &quot;is simple and easily understood,&quot; says Mr. Wright.
  &quot;Even in the wild state the original breed will show some
  amount of variation in colour, form, and size; whilst in
  domestication the tendency to change, as every one
  knows, is very much increased. By breeding from birds
  which show any marked feature, stock is obtained of
  which a portion will possess that feature in an <i>increased
  degree</i>; and by again selecting the best specimens, the
  special points sought may be developed to almost
  any degree required. A good example of such a
  process of development may be seen in the 'white face' so
  conspicuous in the Spanish breed. White ears will be
  observed occasionally in all fowls; even in such breeds as
  Cochins or Brahmas, where white ear-lobes are considered
  almost fatal blemishes; they continually occur, and by
  selecting only white-eared specimens to breed from, they
  might be speedily fixed in any variety as one of the
  characteristics. A large pendent white ear-lobe once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> firmly established, traces of the white <i>face</i> will now and
  then be found, and by a similar method is capable of development
  and fixture; whilst any colour of plumage or of
  leg may be obtained and established in the same way.
  The original amount of character required is <i>very</i> slight;
  a single hen-tailed cock will be enough to give that
  characteristic to a whole breed. Any peculiarity of <i>constitution</i>,
  such as constant laying, or frequent incubation,
  may be developed and perpetuated in a similar manner, all
  that is necessary being care and time. That such has been
  the method employed in the formation of the more distinct
  races of our poultry, is proved by the fact that a continuance
  of the same careful selection is needful to perpetuate
  them in perfection. If the very best examples of
  a breed are selected as the starting-point, and the produce
  is bred from indiscriminately for many generations, the
  distinctive points, whatever they are, rapidly decline, and
  there is also a more or less gradual but sure return to the
  primitive wild type, in size and even colour of the plumage.
  The purest black or white originally, rapidly becomes first
  marked with, and ultimately changed into, the original red
  or brown, whilst the other features simultaneously disappear.
  If, however, the process of artificial selection be
  carried too far, and with reference <i>only to one</i> prominent
  point, any breed is almost sure to suffer in the other
  qualities which have been neglected, and this has been the
  case with the very breed already mentioned&mdash;the white-faced
  Spanish. We know from old fanciers that this breed
  was formerly considered hardy, and even in winter rarely
  failed to afford a constant supply of its unequalled large
  white eggs. But of late years attention has been so <i>exclusively</i> directed to the 'white-face,' that whilst this
  feature has been developed and perfected to a degree never
  before known, the breed has become one of the most
  delicate of all, and the laying qualities of at least many
  strains have greatly fallen off. It would be difficult to
  avoid such evil results if it were not for a valuable compensating
  principle, which admits of <i>crossing</i>. That
  principle is, that any desired point possessed in perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> by a foreign breed, may be introduced by crossing into a
  strain it is desired to improve, and every other characteristic
  of the cross be, by selection, afterwards bred out
  again. Or one or more of these additional characteristics
  may be also retained, and thus a <i>new variety</i> be established,
  as many have been within the last few years.&quot;</p>
<p>Size may be imparted to the Dorking by crossing it with
  the Cochin, and the disposition to feather on the legs bred
  out again by judicious selection; and the constitution may
  be strengthened by crossing with the Game breed. Game
  fowls that have deteriorated in size, strength, and fierceness,
  by a long course of breeding in-and-in, may have all these
  qualities restored by crossing with the fierce, powerful, and
  gigantic Malay, and his peculiarities may be afterwards
  bred out. The size of the eggs of the Hamburg might
  very probably be increased without decreasing, or with
  very slightly decreasing, the number of eggs, by crossing
  with a Houdan cock; and the size would also be increased
  for the table. The French breeds, Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur, Houdan,
  and La Fl&ecirc;che, gain in size and hardiness by being crossed
  with the Brahma cock. The cross between a Houdan cock
  and a Brahma hen &quot;produces,&quot; says the &quot;Henwife,&quot; &quot;the
  finest possible chickens for market, but not to breed from.
  Pure Brahmas and Houdans alone must be kept for that
  purpose; I have always found the second cross worthless.&quot;</p>
<p>In crossing, the cockerels will more or less resemble the
  male, and the pullets the hen. &quot;Long experience,&quot; says
  Mr. Wright, &quot;has ascertained that the male bird has most
  influence upon the colour of the progeny, and also upon
  the comb, and what may be called the 'fancy points,' of
  any breed generally; whilst the form, size, and useful
  qualities are principally derived from the hen.&quot;</p>
<p>Breed only from the strongest and healthiest fowls. In
  the breeding of poultry it is a rule, as in all other cases of
  organised life, that the best-shaped be used for the purpose
  of propagation. If a cock and hen have both the same
  defect, however trifling it may be, they should never be
  allowed to breed together, for the object is to improve the
  breed, not to deteriorate it, even in the slightest degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> Hens should never be allowed to associate with a cock of
  a different breed if you wish to keep the breed pure, and if
  you desire superior birds, not even with an inferior male of
  their own variety. &quot;No time,&quot; says Mr. Baily, &quot;has ever
  been fixed as necessary to elapse before hens that have been
  running with cocks of divers breeds, and afterwards been
  placed with their legitimate partners, can be depended
  upon to produce purely-bred chickens; I am disposed to
  think at least two months. Time of year may have much
  to do with it. In the winter the escape of a hen from one
  run to the other, or the intrusion of a cock, is of little
  moment; but it may be serious in the spring, and destroy
  the hopes of a season.&quot; Many poultry-keepers separate
  the cocks and hens after the breeding season, considering
  that stronger chickens will be thereby obtained the next
  season. Where there is a separate house and run for the
  sitting hen this can be conveniently done when that compartment
  is vacant. In order to preserve a breed perfectly
  pure, it will be necessary, where there is not a large stock
  of the race, to breed from birds sprung from the same
  parents, but the blood should be crossed every year by
  procuring one or more fowls of the same breed from a distance,
  or by the exchange of eggs with some neighbouring
  stock, of colour and qualities as nearly allied as possible
  with the original breed.</p>

<h3>POULTRY SHOWS.</h3>
<p>A few years ago poultry shows were unknown. In 1846,
  the first was held in the Gardens of the Zoological Society,
  in the Regent's Park; Mr. Baily being the sole judge. It
  was a very fair beginning, but did not succeed, and it was
  not till the Cochin-China breed was introduced into this
  country, and the first Birmingham show was held, that
  these exhibitions became successful.</p>
<p>In 1849, &quot;the first poultry show that was ever held in
  'the good old town of Birmingham,' was beset with all the
  untried difficulties of such a scheme, when without the
  experiences of the present day, then altogether unavailable,
  a few spirited individuals carried to a successful issue an
  event that has now proved the foster-parent of the many
  others of similar character that abound in almost every
  principal town of the United Kingdom. It is quite essential,
  that I may be clearly understood, to preface my
  narrative by assuring fanciers that in those former days
  poultry amateurs were by no means as general as at the
  present time; few and far between were their locations;
  and though even then, among the few who felt interest in
  fowls, emulation existed, generally speaking, the keeping
  of poultry was regarded as 'a useless hobby,' 'a mere
  individual caprice,' 'an idle whim from which no good
  result could by possibility accrue'; nay, sometimes it was
  hinted, 'What a pity they have not something better to
  employ them during leisure hours!' and they were styled
  'enthusiasts.' But have not the records of every age
  proved that enthusiasts are invariably the pioneers of improvement?
  And time, too, substantiated the verity of
  this rule in reference to our subject; for, among other
  proofs, it brought incontestable evidence that the raising of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> poultry was by no means the unremunerative folly idlers
  supposed it to be, and hesitated not rashly to declaim it;
  likewise, that it simply required to be fairly brought under
  public notice, to prove its general utility, and to induce
  the acknowledgment of how strangely so important a source
  of emolument had been hitherto neglected and overlooked.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Birmingham Show of 1852, about five thousand
  fowls were exhibited, and the specimens sold during the
  four days of the show amounted to nearly two thousand
  pounds, notwithstanding the high prices affixed to the pens,
  and that many were placed at enormous prices amounting
  to a prohibition, the owners not wishing to sell them. The
  Birmingham shows now generally comprise from one to
  two thousand pens of fowls and water-fowls, arranged in
  nearly one hundred classes; besides an equal proportion of
  pigeons. This show is the finest and most important, but
  there are many others of very high character and great
  extent. Poultry is also now exhibited to a considerable
  extent at agricultural meetings.</p>
<p>Any one may see the wonderful improvement that has
  been made in poultry-breeding by visiting the next Birmingham
  or other first-class show, and comparing the fowls
  there exhibited with those of his earliest recollections, and
  with those mongrels and impure breeds which may still be
  seen in too many farmyards. Points that were said to be
  impossible of attainment have been obtained with comparative
  ease by perseverance and skill, and the worst birds of a
  show are now often superior to the chief prize fowls of
  former days. Indeed, &quot;a modern prize bird,&quot; says the
  &quot;Henwife,&quot; &quot;almost merits the character which a Parisian
  waiter gave of a melon, when asked to pronounce whether
  it was a fruit or a vegetable, 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'a melon
  is neither; it is a work of art.'&quot;</p>
<p>Such shows must have great influence on the improvement
  of the breeds and the general management of poultry,
  though like all other prize exhibitions they have certain
  disadvantages. &quot;We cannot but think,&quot; says Mr. Wright,
  &quot;that our poultry shows have, to some extent, by the character
  of the judging, hindered the improvement of many breeds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> It will be readily admitted in <i>theory</i> that a breed of fowls
  becomes more and more valuable as its capacity of producing
  eggs is increased, and the quantity and quality of
  its flesh are improved, with a small amount of bone and
  offal in proportion. But, if we except the Dorking, which
  certainly is judged to some extent as a table fowl, all this
  is <i>totally</i> lost sight of both by breeders and judges, and
  attention is fixed exclusively upon colour, comb, face, and
  other equally fancy 'points.' Beauty and utility might
  be <i>both</i> secured. The French have taught us a lesson of
  some value in this respect. Within a comparatively recent
  period they have produced, by crossing and selection, four
  new varieties, which, although inferior in some points to
  others of older standing, are all eminently valuable as table
  fowls; and which in one particular are superior to any
  English variety, not even excepting the Dorking&mdash;we
  mean the very small proportion of bone and offal. This is
  really useful and scientific breeding, brought to bear upon <i>one</i> definite object, and we do trust the result will prove
  suggestive with regard to others equally valuable. We
  should be afraid to say how much might be done if English
  breeders would bring <i>their</i> perseverance and experience to
  bear in a similar direction. Agricultural Societies in particular
  might be expected in <i>their</i> exhibitions to show
  some interest in the improvement of poultry regarded
  as <i>useful stock</i>, and to them especially we commend the
  matter.&quot;</p>
<p>The rules and regulations relating to exhibitions vary at
  different shows, and may be obtained by applying to the
  secretary. Notices of exhibitions are advertised in the
  local papers, and in the <i>Field</i> and other London papers of
  an agricultural character.</p>
<p>In breeding birds for exhibition the number of hens to one
  cock should not exceed four or five, but if only two or three
  hens of the breed are possessed, the proper number of his
  harem should be made up by the addition of hens of another
  breed, those being chosen whose eggs are easily known
  from the others.</p>
<p>If it is intended to rear the chickens for exhibition at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> the June, July, or August shows, the earlier they are
  hatched the better, and therefore a sitting should be made
  in January, if you have a young, healthy hen broody. Set
  her on the ground in a warm, sheltered, and quiet place,
  perfectly secure from rain, or from any flow of snow water.
  Feed her well, and keep water and small quantities of
  food constantly within her reach, so that she may not
  be tempted to leave the nest in search of food; for the
  eggs soon chill in winter. Mix the best oatmeal with hot
  water, and give it to her warm twice a day. A few grains
  of hempseed as a stimulant may be given in the middle of
  the day. The great difficulty to overcome in rearing
  early chickens is to sustain their vital powers during the
  very long winter nights, when they are for so many hours
  without food, the only substitute for which is warmth, and
  this can only be well got from the hen. Consequently
  a young Cochin-China with plenty of &quot;fluff&quot; will provide
  most warmth. The hen should not be set on more than
  five, or at most seven eggs; for if she has more, although
  she may sufficiently cover the chickens while very small,
  she will not be able to do so when they grow larger, and
  the outer ones will be chilled unless they manage to push
  themselves into the inside places, and then the displaced
  chickens being warm are sure to get more chilled than the
  others; and so the greater number of the brood, even if they
  survive, will probably be weakly, puny things, through the
  greedy desire to rear so many, while if she hatch but five
  chickens she will probably rear four. The hen should be
  cooped until the chickens are at least ten weeks old, and
  covered up at night with matting, sacking, or a piece
  of carpet.</p>
<p>Give them plenty of curd, chopped egg, and oatmeal,
  mixed with new milk. Stiff oatmeal porridge is the best
  stock food. Some onion tops minced fine will be an excellent
  addition if they can be had. They should have
  some milk to drink. Feed the hen well. The best warmth
  the chickens can have is that of their mother, and the best
  warmth for her is generated by generous, but proper,
  food, and a good supply of it. Early chickens rearing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> show should be fed twice after dark, say at eight and eleven
  o'clock, and again at seven in the morning, so that they
  will not be without food for more than eight hours. The
  hen should be fed at the same times, and she will become
  accustomed to it, and call the chickens to feed; it will also
  generate more warmth in her for their benefit. Yolk
  of egg beaten up and given to drink is most strengthening
  for weakly chickens; or it may be mixed with their oatmeal.
  The tender breeds should not be hatched till April
  or May, unless in a mild climate, or with exceptional
  advantages.</p>
<p>For winter exhibition, March and April hatched birds
  are preferable to those hatched earlier. Not more than
  seven eggs should be set, for a hen cannot scratch up
  insects and worms and find peculiar herbage for more than
  six chickens. If the chickens have not a good grass run,
  they must be supplied with abundance of green food.</p>
<p>They should not be allowed to roost before they are three
  months old, and the perches must be sufficiently large.
  Mr. Wright recommends a bed of clean, dry ashes, an
  inch deep, for those that leave the hen before the proper
  age for roosting, and does not allow his chickens, even
  while with the hen, to bed upon straw, considering the
  ashes to be much cleaner and also warmer.</p>
<p>The chickens intended to be exhibited should be distinguished
  from their companions by small stripes of
  different coloured silks loosely sewn round their legs,
  which distinguishing colours should be entered in the
  poultry-book. A few good birds should always be kept in
  reserve to fill up the pen in case of accidents.</p>
<p>Weight is more important in the December and later
  winter shows than at those held between August and
  November, but at all shows feather and other points of
  competitors being equal weight must carry the day, Game
  and Bantams excepted. It is not safe to trust to the apparent
  weight of a bird, for the feathers deceive, and it is therefore
  advisable to weigh the birds occasionally. Each
  should be weighed in a basket, allowance being made for
  the weight of the basket, and they should if possible be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> weighed before a meal. But fowls that are over-fattened,
  as some judges very improperly desire, cannot be in good
  health anymore than &quot;crammed&quot; fowls, and are useless
  for breeding, producing at best a few puny, delicate, or
  sickly chickens; thus making the exhibition a mere
  &quot;show,&quot; barren of all useful results.</p>
<p>Pullets continue to grow until they begin to lay, which
  almost or quite stops their growth; and therefore if great
  size is desired for exhibition, they should be kept from the
  cockerels and partly from stimulating food until a month
  before the show, when they will be required to be matched
  in pens. During this month they should have extra food
  and attention.</p>
<p>If fowls intended for exhibition are allowed to sit, the
  chickens are apt to cause injury to their plumage, and loss
  of condition, while if prevented from sitting, they are liable
  to suffer in moulting. Their chickens may be given to
  other hens, but the best and safest plan is to set a broody
  exhibition hen on duck's eggs, which will satisfy her
  natural desire for sitting, while the young ducklings will
  give her much less trouble, and leave her sooner than a
  brood of her own kind.</p>
<p>All the birds in a pen should match in comb, colour of
  their legs, and indeed in every particular. Mr. Baily
  mentions &quot;a common fault in exhibitors who send two
  pens composed of three excellent and three inferior birds,
  so divided as to form perhaps one third class and one
  highly commended pen: whereas a different selection
  would make one of unusual merit. If an amateur who
  wishes to exhibit has fifteen fowls to choose from, and to
  form a pen of a cock and two hens, he should study and
  scan them closely while feeding at his feet in the morning.
  He should then have a place similar to an exhibition pen,
  wherein he can put the selected birds; they should be
  raised to the height at which he can best see them, and
  before he has looked long at them defects will become
  apparent one after the other till, in all probability, neither
  of the subjects of his first selection will go to the show.
  We also advise him rather to look for defects than to dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> on beauties&mdash;the latter are always prominent enough. The
  pen of which we speak should be a moveable one for convenience'
  sake, and it is well to leave the fowls in it for a time
  that they may become accustomed to each other, and also
  to an exhibition pen.&quot; Birds that are strangers should
  never be put into the same hamper, for not only the cocks
  but even the hens will fight with and disfigure each
  other.</p>
<p>Some give linseed for a few days before the exhibition to
  impart lustre to the plumage, by increasing the secretion
  of oil. A small quantity of the meal should be mixed
  with their usual soft food, as fowls generally refuse the
  whole grain. But buckwheat and hempseed, mixed in
  equal proportions, if given for the evening meal during
  the last ten or twelve days, is healthier for the bird,
  much liked, and will not only impart equal lustre to the
  plumage, but also improve the appearance of the comb and
  wattles.</p>
<p>Spanish fowls should be kept in confinement for some
  days before the show, with just enough light to enable them
  to feed and perch, and the place should be littered with
  clean straw. This greatly improves their condition; why
  we know not, but it is an established fact. Game fowls
  should be kept in for a few days, and fed on meal, barley,
  and bread, with a few peas, which tend to make the
  plumage hard, but will make them too fat if given freely.
  Dark and golden birds should be allowed to run about till
  they have to be sent off. Remove all scurf or dead skin
  from the comb, dry dirt from the beak, and stains from the
  plumage, and wash their legs clean. White and light
  fowls that have a good grass run and plenty of clean straw
  in their houses and yards to scratch in, will seldom require
  washing, but town birds, and country ones if not perfectly
  clean, should be washed the day before the show with tepid
  water and mild white soap rubbed on flannel, care being
  taken to wash the feathers downwards, so as not to break
  or ruffle them; afterwards wiped with a piece of flannel
  that has been thoroughly soaked in clean water, and gently
  dried with soft towels before the fire; or the bird may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> entirely dipped into a pan of warm water, then rinsed
  thoroughly in cold water, wiped with a flannel, and placed
  in a basket with soft straw before a fire to dry. They
  should then be shut up in their houses with plenty of clean
  straw. They should have their feet washed if dirty, and
  be well fed with soft nourishing food just before being put
  into the travelling-basket, for hard food is apt to cause
  fever and heat while travelling, and, having to be digested
  without gravel or exercise, causes indigestion, which ruffles
  the plumage, dulls its colour, darkens the comb, and
  altogether spoils the appearance of the bird. Sopped or
  steeped bread is excellent.</p>
<p>The hampers should always be round or oval in form, as
  fowls invariably creep into corners and destroy their
  plumage. They should be high enough for the cocks to
  stand upright in, without touching the top with their
  combs. Some exhibitors prefer canvas tops to wicker lids,
  considering that the former preserve the fowls' combs from
  injury if they should strike against the top, while others
  prefer the latter as being more secure, and allowing one
  hamper to be placed upon another if necessary, and also
  preserving the fowls from injury if a heavy hamper or
  package should otherwise be placed over it. A good plan
  is to have a double canvas top, the space between being
  filled with hay. A thick layer of hay or straw should be
  placed at the bottom of the basket. Wheaten straw is
  the best in summer and early autumn, and oat or barley
  straw later in the year and during winter. A good lining
  also is essential; coarse calico stitched round the inside of
  the basket is the best. Ducks and geese do not require
  their hampers to be lined, except in very cold weather;
  and the best lining for them is made by stitching layers of
  pulled straw round the inside of the basket. Turkeys
  should have their hampers lined, for although they are
  very hardy, cold and wet damage their appearance more
  than other poultry. Take care that the geese cannot get
  at the label, for they will eat it, and also devour the
  hempen fastenings if within their reach.</p>
<p>Be very careful in entering your birds for exhibition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> describe their ages, breed, &amp;c., exactly and accurately, and
  see yourself to the packing and labelling of their hampers.</p>
<p>Mr. F. Wragg, the superintendent of the poultry-yard
  of R. W. Boyle, Esq., whose fowls have a sea voyage from
  Ireland besides the railway journey, and yet always appear
  in splendid condition and &quot;bloom,&quot; ties on one side of the
  hamper, &quot;near the top, a fresh-pulled cabbage, and on the
  other side a good piece of the bottom side of a loaf, of
  which they will eat away all the soft part. Before starting,
  I give each bird half a tablespoonful of port wine, which
  makes them sleep a good part of the journey. Of course,
  if I go with my birds, as I generally do, I see that they,
  as well as myself, have 'refreshment' on the road.&quot;<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
  cabbage will always be a treat, and the loaf and wine may
  be added for long journeys.</p>
<p>Birds are frequently over-fed at the show, particularly
  with barley, which cannot be properly digested for want of
  gravel and exercise; and therefore, if upon their return
  their crops are hard and combs look dark, give a tablespoonful
  of castor oil; but if they look well do not interfere
  with them. They should not have any grain, but be fed
  sparingly on stale bread soaked in warm ale, with two or
  three mouthfuls of tepid water, for liquid is most hurtful if
  given in quantity. They should not be put into the yard with
  the other fowls which may treat them, after their absence,
  as intruders, but be joined with them at night when the
  others have gone to roost. On the next day give them a
  moderate allowance of soft food with a moderate supply of
  water, or stale bread sopped in water, and a sod of grass
  or half a cabbage leaf each, but no other green food; and
  on the following day they may have their usual food.</p>
<p>When the fowls are brought back, take out the linings,
  wash them, and put them by to be ready for the next
  show; and after the exhibition season, on a fine dry day,
  wash the hampers, dry them thoroughly, and put them in
  a dry place. Never use them as quiet berths for sick birds,
  which are sure to infect them and cause the illness of the
  next occupants; or as nesting-places for sitting hens,
  which may leave insects in the crevices that will be difficult
  to eradicate.</p>

<p>In our descriptions of the various Breeds, we have given
  sufficient general information upon the Exhibition Points
  from the best authorities; but considerable differences of
  opinion have been expressed of late years, and eminent
  breeders dissent in some cases even from the generally
  recognised authority of the popular &quot;Standard of Excellence.&quot;
  We, therefore, advise intending exhibitors to
  ascertain the standards to be followed at the show and the
  predilections of the judges, and to breed accordingly, or, if
  they object to the views held, not to compete at that
  exhibition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>COCHIN-CHINAS, OR SHANGHAES.</h3>
<p>Like many other fowls these possess a name which is
  incorrectly applied, for they came from Shanghae, not
  Cochin-China, where they were comparatively unknown.
  Mr. Fortune, who, from his travels in China, is well
  qualified to give an opinion, states that they are a Chinese
  breed, kept in great numbers at Shanghae; the real
  Cochin-China breed being small and elegantly shaped.
  But all attempts to give them the name of the port from
  which they were brought have failed, and the majority of
  breeders persist in calling them Cochins. In the United
  States both names are used, the feather-legged being called
  Shanghaes, and the clean-legged Cochins.</p>
<p>The first Shanghae fowls brought to this country were
  sent from India to Her Majesty, which gave them great
  importance; and the eggs having been freely distributed
  by the kindness of the Queen and the Prince Consort, the
  breed was soon widely spread. They were first introduced
  into this country when the northern ports of China,
  including Shanghae, were thrown open to European
  vessels on the conclusion of the Chinese war in 1843; but
  some assign the date of their introduction from 1844 to
  1847, and say that those called Cochins, exhibited by the
  Queen in 1843, were not the true breed, having been not
  only entirely without feathers on the shanks, but also altogether
  different in form and general characteristics. A pair
  which were sent by Her Majesty for exhibition at the
  Dublin Cattle Show in April, 1846, created such a sensation
  from their great size and immense weight, and the full,
  loud, deep-pitched crowing of the cock, that almost every
  one seemed desirous to possess some of the breed, and
  enormous prices were given for the eggs and chickens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> With his propensity for exaggeration, Paddy boasted that
  they laid five eggs in two days, each weighing three
  ounces, that the fowls equalled turkeys in size, and
  &quot;Cochin eggs became in as great demand as though they
  had been laid by the fabled golden goose. Philosophers,
  poets, merchants, and sweeps had alike partook of the
  mania; and although the latter could hardly come up to
  the price of a real Cochin, there were plenty of vagabond
  dealers about, with counterfeit crossed birds of all kinds,
  which were advertised to be the genuine article. For to
  such a pitch did the excitement rise, that they who never
  kept a fowl in their lives, and would hardly know a
  Bantam from a Dorking, puzzled their shallow brains as
  to the proper place to keep them, and the proper diet to
  feed them on.&quot; Their justly-deserved popularity speedily
  grew into a mania, and the price which had been from
  fifteen to thirty shillings each, then considered a high price
  for a fowl, rose to ten pounds for a fine specimen, and ultimately
  a hundred guineas was repeatedly paid for a
  single cock, and was not an uncommon price for a pair of
  really fine birds. &quot;They were afterwards bred,&quot; says Miss
  Watts, &quot;for qualities difficult of attainment, and, as the
  result proved, little worth trying for,&quot; and &quot;fowls with <i>many</i> excellent qualities were blamed for not being <i>perfect</i>,&quot; and
  they fell from their high place, and were as unjustly
  depreciated as they had been unduly exalted.</p>
<p>&quot;Had these birds,&quot; wrote Mr. Baily many years since,
  &quot;been shy breeders&mdash;if like song birds the produce of a
  pair were four, or at most five, birds in the year, prices
  might have been maintained; but as they are marvellous
  layers they increased. They bred in large numbers, and
  consequently became cheaper, and then the mania ended,
  because those who dealt most largely in them did so not
  from a love of the birds or the pursuit, but as a speculation.
  As they had over-praised them before, they now
  treated them with contempt. Anything like a moderate
  profit was despised, and the birds were left to their own
  merits. These were sufficient to ensure their popularity,
  and now after fluctuating in value more than anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> except shares, after being over-praised and then abused,
  they have remained favourites with a large portion of the
  public, sell at a remunerating price, and form one of the
  largest classes at all the great exhibitions.&quot; This has
  proved to be a perfectly correct view, and the breed is now
  firmly established in public estimation, and unusually fine
  birds will still sell for from five to twenty pounds each. The
  mania did great service to the breeding and improvement
  of poultry by awakening an interest in the subject
  throughout the kingdom which has lasted.</p>
<p>They are the best of all fowls for a limited space, and
  not inclined to wander even when they have an extensive
  run. They cannot fly, and a fence three feet high will
  keep them in. But if kept in a confined space they must
  have an unlimited supply of green food. They give us
  eggs when they are most expensive, and indeed, with regard
  to new-laid eggs, when they are almost impossible to be
  had at any price. They begin to lay soon after they are
  five months old, regardless of the season or weather, and
  lay throughout the year, except when requiring to sit,
  which they do twice or thrice a year, and some oftener.
  Pullets will sometimes lay at fourteen weeks, and want to
  sit before they are six months old. Cochins have been
  known to lay twice in a day, but not again on the following day,
  and the instances are exceptional. Their eggs are of
  a pale chocolate colour, of excellent flavour, and usually
  weigh 2&frac14; ounces each. They are excellent sitters and
  mothers. Pullets will frequently hatch, lay again, and sit
  with the chickens of the first brood around them. Cochins
  are most valuable as sitters early in the year, being broody
  when other fowls are beginning to lay; but unless cooped
  they are apt to leave their chickens too soon, especially for
  early broods, and lay again. They are very hardy, and
  their chickens easy to rear, doing well even in bleak places
  without any unusual care. But they are backward in
  fledging, chickens bred from immature fowls being the
  most backward. Those which are cockerels show their
  flight feathers earliest. They are very early matured.</p>
<p>A writer in the <i>Poultry Chronicle</i> well says: &quot;These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> fowls were sent to provide food for man; by many they are
  not thought good table fowls; but when others fail, if you
  keep them, you shall never want the luxury of a really
  new-laid egg on your breakfast table. The snow may fall,
  the frost may be thick on your windows when you first look
  out on a December morning, but your Cochins will provide
  you eggs. Your children shall learn gentleness and kindness
  from them, for they are kind and gentle, and you
  shall be at peace with your neighbours, for they will not
  wander nor become depredators. They have fallen in price
  because they were unnaturally exalted; but their sun
  is not eclipsed; they have good qualities, and valuable.
  They shall now be within the reach of all; and will make
  the delight of many by their domestic habits, which will allow
  them to be kept where others would be an annoyance.&quot;
  They will let you take them off their roost, handle and
  examine them, and put them back without struggling.</p>
<p>The fault of the Cochin-Chinas as table birds is, that
  they produce most meat on the inferior parts; thus, there
  is generally too little on the breast which is the prime part
  of a fowl, while the leg which is an inferior part, is unusually
  fleshy, but it must be admitted that the leg is more
  tender than in other breeds. A greater quantity of flesh
  may be raised within a given time, on a certain quantity of
  food, from these fowls than from any other breed. The
  cross with the Dorking is easily reared, and produces a
  very heavy and well-shaped fowl for the table, and a good
  layer.</p>
<p>&quot;A great hue and cry,&quot; says Miss Watts, &quot;has been
  raised against the Cochin-Chinas as fowls for the table, but
  we believe none have bestowed attention on breeding them
  with a view to this valuable consideration. Square, compact,
  short-legged birds have been neglected for a certain
  colour of feather, and a broad chest was given up for
  the wedge-form at the very time that was pronounced a
  fault in the fowl. It is said that yellow-legged fowls are
  yellow also in the skin, and that white skin and white legs
  accompany each other; but how pertinaciously the yellow
  leg of the Cochin is adhered to! Yet all who have bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> them will attest that a little careful breeding would perpetuate
  white-legged Cochins. Exhibitions are generally
  excellent; but to this fowl they certainly have only been
  injurious, by exaggerating useless and fancy qualities at
  the expense of those which are solid and useful. Who
  would favour, or even sanction, a Dorking in which size
  and shape, and every property we value in them, was
  sacrificed to an endeavour to breed to a particular colour?
  and this is what we have been doing with the Cochin-China.
  Many breeders say, eat Cochins while very young;
  but we have found them much better for the table as fowls
  than as chickens. A fine Cochin, from five to seven months
  old, is like a turkey, and very juicy and fine in flavour.&quot;</p>
<p>A peculiar characteristic of these birds, technically called
  &quot;fluff,&quot; is a quantity of beautifully soft, long feathers,
  covering the thighs till they project considerably, and
  garnishing all the hinder parts of the bird in the same
  manner, so that the broadest part of the bird is behind.
  Its quality is a good indication of the breed; if fine and
  downy the birds are probably well-bred, but if rank and
  coarse they are inferior. The cocks are frequently somewhat
  scanty in &quot;fluff,&quot; but should be chosen with as much
  as possible; but vulture-hocks which often accompany the
  heaviest feathered birds should be avoided, as they now
  disqualify at the best shows. &quot;The fluff,&quot; says a good
  authority, &quot;in the hen especially, should so cover the tail
  feathers as to give the appearance of a very short back, the
  line taking an upward direction from within an inch or so
  of the point of junction with the hackle.&quot; The last joint
  of the wings folds up, so that the ends of the flight feathers
  are concealed by the middle feathers, and their extremities
  are again covered by the copious saddle, which peculiarity
  has caused them to be also called the ostrich-fowl.</p>
<p>A good Cochin cock should be compact, large, and
  square built; broad across the loins and hind-quarters;
  with a deep keel; broad, short back; short neck; small,
  delicately-shaped, well-arched head; short, strong, curved
  beak; rather small, finely and evenly serrated, straight,
  single, erect comb, wholly free from reduplications and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> sprigs; brilliant red face, and pendant wattles; long hanging
  ear-lobe, of pure red, white being inadmissible; bright,
  bold eye, approaching the plumage in colour; rich, full,
  long hackle; small, closely-folded wings; short tail,
  scarcely any in some fine specimens, not very erect, with
  slightly twisted glossy feathers falling over it like those
  of the ostrich; stout legs set widely apart, yellow and
  heavily feathered to the toe; and erect carriage. The
  chief defect of the breed is narrowness of breast, which
  should therefore be sought for as full as possible.</p>
<p>The hen's body is much deeper in proportion than that
  of the cock. She resembles him upon most points, but
  differs in some; her comb having many indentations; the
  fluff being softer, and of almost silky quality; the tail has
  upright instead of falling feathers, and comes to a blunt
  point; and her carriage is less upright.</p>
<p>Cochins lose their beauty earlier than any other breed,
  and moult with more difficulty each time. They are in
  their greatest beauty at from nine to eighteen months old.
  The cocks' tails increase with age. In buying Cochins
  avoid clean legs, fifth toes, which show that it has been
  crossed with the Dorking, double combs that betray
  Malay blood, and long tails, particularly taking care that
  the cock has not, and ascertaining that he never had, sickle
  feathers. The cock ought not to weigh less than ten or
  eleven pounds, and a very fine bird will reach thirteen;
  the hens from eight to ten pounds.</p>
<p>The principal colours now bred are Buff, Cinnamon,
  Partridge, Grouse, Black, and White. The Buff and
  White are the most popular.</p>
<p>Buff birds may have black in the tails of both sexes,
  but the less there is the better. Black-pencilling in the
  hackle is considered objectionable at good shows. The cock's
  neck hackles, wing coverts, back, and saddle hackles,
  are usually of a rich gold colour, but his breast and the
  lower parts of his body should match with those of his
  hens. Buff birds generally produce chickens lighter than
  themselves. Most birds become rather lighter at each
  moult. In making up an exhibition pen, observe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> Grouse and Partridge hens should have a black-breasted
  cock; and that Buff and Cinnamon birds should not be
  placed together, but all the birds in the pen should be
  either Buff or Cinnamon. The Cinnamon are of two
  shades, the Light Cinnamon and the Silver, which is a pale
  washy tint, that looks very delicate and pretty when perfectly
  clean. Silver Cinnamon hens should not be penned
  with a pale Yellow cock, but with one as near to their own
  tint as can be found. Mr. Andrews's celebrated strain of
  Cochins sometimes produced both cocks and hens which
  were Silver Cinnamon, with streaks of gold in the hackle.</p>
<p>In Partridge birds the cock's neck and saddle hackles
  should be of a bright red, striped with black, his back and
  wings of dark red, the latter crossed with a well-defined
  bar of metallic greenish black, and the breast and under
  parts of his body should be black, and not mottled. The
  hen's neck hackles should be of bright gold, striped with
  black, and all the other portions of her body of a light
  brown, pencilled with very dark brown. The Grouse are
  very dark Partridge, have a very rich appearance, and
  are particularly beautiful when laced. They are far from
  common, and well worth cultivating. The Partridge are
  more mossed in their markings, and not so rich in colour
  as the Grouse. Cuckoo Cochins are marked like the
  Cuckoo Dorkings, and difficult to breed free of yellow.</p>
<p>The White and Black were introduced later than the
  others. Mr. Baily says the White were principally bred
  from a pair imported and given to the Dean of Worcester,
  and which afterwards became the property of Mrs.
  Herbert, of Powick. White Cochins for exhibition must
  have yellow legs, and they are prone to green. The origin
  of the Black is disputed. It is said to be a sport from the
  White, or to have been produced by a cross between the
  Buff and the White. By careful breeding it has been fixed
  as a decided sub-variety, but it is difficult, if not almost
  impossible, to rear a cock to complete maturity entirely
  free from coloured feathers. They keep perfectly pure in
  colour till six months old, after which age they sometimes
  show a golden patch or red feathers upon the wing, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> a few streaks of red upon the hackle, of so dark a shade as
  to be imperceptible except in a strong light, and are often
  found on close examination to have white under feathers,
  and others barred with white.</p>
<p>The legs in all the colours should be yellow. Flesh-coloured
  legs are admissible, but green, black, or white are
  defects. In the Partridge and Grouse a slight wash, as of
  indigo, appears to be thrown over them, which in the
  Black assumes a still darker shade; but in all three yellow
  should appear partially even here beneath the scales, as
  the pink tinge does in the Buff and White birds.</p>
<p>Cochin-Chinas being much inclined to accumulate
  internal fat, which frequently results in apoplexy, should
  not be fed on food of a very fattening character, such as
  Indian corn. They are liable to have inflamed feet if they
  are obliged to roost on very high, small, or sharp perches,
  or allowed to run over sharp-edged stones.</p>
<p>They are also subject to an affection called White Comb,
  which is a white mouldy eruption on the comb and wattles
  like powdered chalk; and if not properly treated in time,
  will spread over the whole body, causing the feathers to
  fall off. It is caused by want of cleanliness, over-stimulating
  or bad food, and most frequently by want of green
  food, which must be supplied, and the place rubbed with
  an ointment composed of two parts of cocoanut oil, and
  one of turmeric powder, to which some persons add one
  half part of sulphur; and six grains of jalap may be given
  to clear the bowels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>BRAHMA-POOTRAS.</h3>
<p>It is a disputed point among great authorities whether
  Brahmas form a distinct variety, or whether they originated
  in a cross with the Cochin, and have become established
  by careful breeding. When they were first introduced,
  Mr. Baily considered them to be a distinct breed, and has
  since seen nothing to alter his opinion. Their nature and
  habits are quite dissimilar, for they wander from home and
  will get their own living where a Cochin would starve,
  have more spirit, deeper breasts, are hardier, lay larger
  eggs, are less prone to sit, and never produce a clean-legged
  chicken. Whatever their origin, by slow and sure
  degrees, without any mania, they have become more and
  more popular, standing upon their own merits, and are
  now one of the most favourite varieties.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst accusation,&quot; says Miss Watts, &quot;their enemies
  can advance against them is, that no one knows their
  origin; but this is applicable to them only as it is when
  applied to Dorkings, Spanish, Polands, and all the other
  kinds which have been brought to perfection by careful
  breeding, working on good originals. All we have in
  England are descended from fowls imported from the
  United States, and the best account of them is, that a
  sailor (rather vague, certainly) appeared in an American
  town (Boston or New York, I forget which) with a new
  kind of fowl for sale, and that a pair bought from him
  were the parents of all the Brahmas. Uncertain as this
  appears, the accounts of those who pretend to trace their
  origin as cross-bred fowls is, at least, equally so, and I
  believe we may just act towards the Brahmas as we do
  with regard to Dorkings and other good fowls, and be
  satisfied to possess a first-rate, useful kind, although we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> may be unable to trace its genealogical tree back to the
  root. Whatever may be their origin, I find them distinct
  in their characteristics. I have found them true to their
  points, generation after generation, in all the years that I
  have kept them. The pea-comb is very peculiar, and I
  have never had one chicken untrue in this among all that
  I have bred. Their habits are very unlike the Cochins.
  Although docile, they are much less inert; they lay a
  larger number of eggs, and sit less frequently. Many of
  my hens only wish to sit once a year; a few oftener than
  that, perhaps twice or even three times in rare instances,
  but never at the end of each small batch of eggs, as I find
  (my almost equal favourites) the Cochins do. The division
  of Light and Dark Brahmas is a fancy of the judges,
  which any one who keeps them can humour with a little
  care in breeding. My idea of their colour is, that it should
  be black and grey (iron grey, with more or less of a blue
  tinge, and devoid of any brown) on a clear white ground,
  and I do not care whether the white or the marking predominates.
  I believe breeders could bear me out, if they
  would, when I say many fowls which pass muster as
  Brahmas are the result of a cross, employed to increase
  size and procure the heavy colour which some of the judges
  affect.&quot;</p>
<p>For strength of constitution, both as chickens and fowls,
  they surpass all other breeds. Brahmas like an extensive
  range, but bear confinement as well as any fowls, and keep
  cleaner in dirty or smoky places than any that have white
  feathers. They are capital foragers where they have their
  liberty, are smaller eaters and less expensive to keep than
  Cochins, and most prolific in eggs. They lay regularly on
  an average five fine large eggs a week all the year round,
  even when snow is on the ground, except when moulting
  or tending their brood. Mr. Boyle, of Bray, Ireland, the
  most eminent breeder of Dark Brahmas in Great Britain,
  says he has &quot;repeatedly known pullets begin to lay in
  autumn, and <i>never stop</i>&mdash;let it be hail, rain, snow, or storm&mdash;for
  a single day till next spring.&quot; They usually lay from
  thirty to forty eggs before they seek to sit. The hens do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> not sit so often as Cochins, and a week's change of place
  will generally banish the desire. They put on flesh well,
  with plenty of breast-meat, and are more juicy and better
  shaped for the table than most Cochins; though, after they
  are six months old, the flesh is much inferior to that of the
  Dorking. A cross with a Dorking or Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur cock
  produces the finest possible table fowl, carrying almost
  incredible quantities of meat of excellent quality.</p>
<p>The chickens are hardy and easy to rear. They vary in
  colour when first hatched, being all shades of brown,
  yellow, and grey, and are often streaked on the back and
  spotted about the head; but this variety gives place, as
  the feathers come, to the mixture of black, white, and
  grey, which forms the distinguishing colour of the Brahma.
  Mr. Baily has &quot;hatched them in snow, and reared them
  all out of doors without any other shelter than a piece of
  mat or carpet thrown over the coop at night.&quot; They reach
  their full size at an early age, and the pullets are in their
  prime at eight months. Miss Watts noticed that Brahmas
  &quot;are more clever in the treatment of themselves when they
  are ill than other fowls; when they get out of order, they
  will generally fast until eating is no longer injurious,&quot;
  which peculiarity is corroborated by the experienced
  &quot;Henwife.&quot; The feathers of the Brahma-Pootra are said
  to be nearly equal to goose feathers.</p>
<p>The head should have a slight fulness over the eye,
  giving breadth to the top; a full, pearl eye is much admired,
  but far from common; comb either a small single,
  or pea-comb&mdash;the single resembling that of the Cochin;
  the neck short; the breast wide and full; the legs short,
  yellow, and well-feathered, but not so fully as in the finest
  Cochins; and the tail short but full, and in the cock
  opening into a fan. They should be wide and deep made,
  large and weighty, and have a free, noble carriage, equally
  distinct from the waddle of the Cochin, and the erect
  bearing of the Malay. Unlike the Cochins, they keep
  constantly to their colour, which is a mixture of black,
  white, and grey; the lightest being almost white, and the
  darkest consisting of grey markings on a white ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> The colour is entirely a matter of taste, but the bottom
  colour should always be grey.</p>
<p>&quot;After breeding Brahmas for many years,&quot; says Miss
  Watts, &quot;through many generations and crosses (always,
  however, keeping to families imported direct from America),
  we are quite confirmed in the opinion that the pea-comb is <i>the</i> comb for the Brahma; and this seems now a settled
  question, for single-combed birds never take prizes when
  passable pea-combed birds are present. The leading
  characteristic of the peculiar comb, named by the Americans
  the pea-comb, is its triple character. It may be developed
  and separated almost like three combs, or nearly united
  into one; but its triple form is always evident. What we
  think most beautiful is, where the centre division is a little
  fluted, slightly serrated, and flanked by two little side
  combs. The degree of the division into three varies, and
  the peculiarities of the comb may be less perceptible in
  December than when the hens are laying; but the triple
  character of the pea-comb is always evident. It shows
  itself in the chick at a few days old, in three tiny paralleled
  lines.&quot; It is thick at the base, and like three combs joined
  into one, the centre comb being higher than the other, but
  the comb altogether must be low, rounded at the top, and
  the indentations must not be deep. Whether single or
  triple, all the combs in a pen should be uniform.</p>
<p>The dark and light varieties should not be crossed, as,
  according to Mr. Teebay, who was formerly the most
  extensive and successful breeder of Brahmas in England,
  the result is never satisfactory.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>MALAYS.</h3>
<p>This was the first of the gigantic Asiatic breeds imported
  into this country, and in height and size exceeds
  any fowl yet known. The origin of the Malay breed is
  supposed to be the <i>Gallus giganteus</i> of Temminck. &quot;This
  large and very remarkable species,&quot; says Mr. W. C. L.
  Martin, &quot;is a native of Java and Sumatra. The comb is
  thick and low, and destitute of serrations, appearing as if
  it had been partially cut off; the wattles are small, and the
  throat is bare. The neck is covered with elongated
  feathers, or hackles, of a pale golden-reddish colour, which
  advance upon the back, and hackles of the same colour
  cover the rump, and drop on each side of the base of the tail.
  The middle of the back and the shoulders of the wings are of
  a dark chestnut, the feathers being of a loose texture. The
  greater wing-coverts are of a glossy green, and form a bar
  of that colour across the wing. The primary and secondary
  quill feathers are yellowish, with a tinge of rufous.
  The tail feathers are of a glossy green. The under surface
  uniformly is of a glossy blackish green, but the base of
  each feather is a chestnut, and this colour appears on the
  least derangement of the plumage. The limbs are remarkably
  stout, and the robust tarsi are of a yellow colour.
  The voice is a sort of crow&mdash;hoarse and short, and very
  different from the clear notes of defiance uttered by our
  farmyard chanticleer. This species has the habit, when
  fatigued, of resting on the tarsi or legs, as we have seen
  the emu do under similar circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>In the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society&quot; for 1832,
  we find the following notice respecting this breed, by
  Colonel Sykes, who observed it domesticated in the
  Deccan: &quot;Known by the name of the Kulm cock by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> Europeans in India. Met with only as a domestic bird;
  and Colonel Sykes has reason to believe that it is not a
  native of India, but has been introduced by the Mussulmans
  from Sumatra or Java. The iris of the real game
  bird should be whitish or straw yellow. Colonel Sykes
  landed two cocks and a hen in England in June, 1831.
  They bore the winter well; the hen laid freely, and has
  reared two broods of chickens. The cock has not the shrill
  clear pipe of the domestic bird, and his scale of note
  appears more limited. A cock in the possession of Colonel
  Sykes stood twenty-six inches high to the crown of the
  head; but they attain a greater height. Length from the
  tip of the bill to the insertion of the tail, twenty-three
  inches. Hen one-third smaller than the male. Shaw very
  justly describes the habit of the cock, of resting, when
  tired, on the first joint of the leg.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a long, large, heavy bird, standing remarkably
  upright, having an almost uninterrupted slope from the
  head to the insertion of the tail; with very long, though
  strong, yellow legs, quite free from feathers; long, stout,
  firm thighs, and stands very erect; the cock, when full
  grown, being at least two feet six inches, and sometimes
  over three feet in height, and weighing from eight to
  eleven pounds. The head has great fulness over the eye,
  and is flattened above, resembling that of the snake. The
  small, thick, hard comb, scarcely rising from the head, and
  barely as long, like half a strawberry, resembles that of a
  Game fowl dubbed. The wattles are very small; the neck
  closely feathered, and like a rope, with a space for an inch
  below the beak bare of feathers. It has a hard, cruel
  expression of face; a brilliant bold eye, pearled around the
  edge of the lids; skinny red face; very strong curved
  yellow beak; and small, drooping tail, with very beautiful,
  though short, sickle feathers. The hen resembles the cock
  upon all these points, but is smaller.</p>
<p>Their colours now comprise different shades of red and
  deep chestnut, in combination with rich browns, and there
  are also black and white varieties, each of which should be
  uniform. The feathers should be hard and close, which
  causes it to be heavier than it appears.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>Malays are inferior to most other breeds as layers, but
  the pullets commence laying early, and are often good
  winter layers. Their eggs, which weigh about 2&frac12; ounces
  each, are of a deep buff or pale chocolate colour, surpass
  all others in flavour, and are so rich that two of them are
  considered to be equal to three of ordinary fowls. They
  are nearly always fertile.</p>
<p>Their chief excellence is as table fowls, carrying, as they
  do, a great quantity of meat, which, when under a year old,
  is of very good quality and flavour. Crossed with the
  Spanish and Dorking, they produce excellent table fowls;
  the latter cross being also good layers.</p>
<p>Malays are good sitters and mothers, if they have roomy
  nests. Their chickens should not be hatched after June,
  as they feather slowly, and are delicate; but the adult
  birds are hardy enough, and seem especially adapted to
  crowded localities, such as courts and alleys. &quot;Malays,&quot;
  says Mr. Baily, &quot;will live anywhere; they will inhabit a
  back yard of small dimensions; they will scratch in the
  dust-hole, and roost under the water-butt; and yet not
  only lay well, but show in good condition when requisite.&quot;
  Like the Game fowl, it is terribly pugnacious, and in its
  native country is kept and trained for fighting. This propensity,
  which is still greater in confinement, is its greatest
  disadvantage. When closely confined they are apt to eat
  each other's feathers, the cure for which is turning them
  into a grass run, and giving them a good supply of lettuce
  leaves, with an occasional purgative of six grains of jalap.
  The Chittagong is said to be a variety of the Malay.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>GAME.</h3>
<p>This is the kind expressly called the English breed by
  Buffon and the French writers, and is the noblest and most
  beautiful of all breeds, combining an admirable figure,
  brilliant plumage, and stately gait. It is most probably
  derived from the larger or continental Indian species of the
  Javanese, or Bankiva Jungle Fowl&mdash;the <i>Gallus Bankiva</i> of
  Temminck&mdash;which is a distinct species, distinguished chiefly
  from the Javanese fowl by its larger size. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_124">page 124</a>.)
  Of this continental species, Sir W. Jardine states that he
  has seen three or four specimens, all of which came from
  India proper. The Game cock is the undisputed king of
  all poultry, and is unsurpassed for courage. The Malay is
  more cruel and ferocious, but has less real courage. Game
  fowls are in every respect fighting birds, and, although
  cock-fighting is now very properly prohibited by law,
  Game fowls are always judged mainly in reference to
  fighting qualities. But their pugnacious disposition renders
  them very troublesome, especially if they have not ample
  range, although it does not disqualify them for small runs
  to the extent generally supposed. A blow with his spur
  is dangerous, and instances have been recorded of very
  severe injuries inflicted upon children, even causing death.
  An old newspaper states that &quot;Mr. Johnson, a farmer in
  the West Riding of Yorkshire, who has a famous breed of
  the Game fowl, has had the great misfortune to lose his
  little son, a boy of three years old, who was attacked by a
  Game cock, and so severely injured that he died shortly
  afterwards.&quot; High-bred hens are quite as pugnacious as
  the cocks. The chickens are very quarrelsome, and both
  cocks and hens fight so furiously, that frequently one-half
  of a brood is destroyed, and the other half have to be killed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>Game fowls are hardy when they can have liberty, but
  cannot be well kept in a confined space. They eat little,
  and are excellent for an unprotected place, because by
  their activity they avoid danger themselves, and by their
  courage defend their chickens from enemies. The hen is a
  prolific layer, and, if she has a good run, equal to any breed.
  The eggs, though of moderate size only, are remarkable
  for delicacy of flavour. She is an excellent sitter, and still
  more excellent mother. The chickens are easily reared,
  require little food, and are more robust in constitution than
  almost any other variety.</p>
<p>The flesh of the Game fowl is beautifully white, and
  superior to that of all other breeds for richness and delicacy
  of flavour. They should never be put up to fat, as they
  are impatient of confinement. &quot;They are in no way fit for
  the fattening-coop,&quot; says Mr. Baily. &quot;They cannot bear
  the extra food without excitement, and that is not favourable
  to obesity. Nevertheless, they have their merits. If
  they are reared like pheasants round a keeper's house, and
  allowed to run semi-wild in the woods, to frequent sunny
  banks and dry ditches, they will grow up like them; they
  will have little fat, but they will be full of meat. They
  must be eaten young; and a Game pullet four or five
  months old, caught up wild in this way, and killed two days
  before she is eaten, is, perhaps, the most delicious chicken
  there is in point of flavour.&quot;</p>
<p>The Game-fowl continues to breed for many years without
  showing any signs of decay, and in this respect is
  superior to the Cochin, Brahma, and even to the Dorking.</p>
<p>The cock's head should be long, but fine; beak long,
  curved, and strong; comb single, small, upright, and
  bright red; wattles and face bright red; eyes large and
  brilliant; neck long, arched, and strong; breast well
  developed; back short and broad between the shoulders,
  but tapering to the tail; thighs muscular, but short compared
  to the shanks; spur low; foot flat, with powerful
  claws, and his carriage erect. The form of the hen should
  resemble the above on a smaller scale, with small, fine comb
  and face, and wattles of a less intense red. The feathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> of both should be very hard, firm, and close, very strong
  in the quills, and seem so united that it should be almost
  impossible to ruffle them, each feather if lifted up falling
  readily into its original place. Size is not a point of merit,
  from four to six pounds being considered sufficient, and
  better than heavier weights. Among the list of imperfections
  in Game cocks, Sketchley enumerates &quot;flat sides,
  short legs, thin thighs, crooked or indented breast, short
  thin neck, imperfect eye, and duck or short feet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the custom,&quot; says Miss Watts, &quot;consequently
  imperative, that all birds which are exhibited should have
  been dubbed, and this should not be done until the comb
  is so much developed that it will not spring again after the
  dubbing. This will be safe if the chicken is nearly six
  months old, but some are more set than others at a certain
  age. A keen pair of scissors is the best instrument with
  which to operate. Hold the fowl with a firm hand, cut
  away the deaf ears and wattles, then cut the comb, cutting
  a certain distance from the back, and then from the front
  to join this cut, taking especial care not to go too near the
  skull. Some operators put a finger inside the mouth to
  get a firm purchase. We should like to see dubbing done
  away with, leaving these beautiful fowls as nature makes
  them; but since amateurs and shows will not agree to
  this, it is best to give directions for dubbing, as an operation
  bunglingly performed is sure to give unnecessary
  pain.&quot; To save the bird from excessive loss of blood his
  wattles are usually cut off a week later. Every superfluous
  piece of flesh and skin should be removed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Henwife&quot; well says: &quot;Why these poor birds are
  condemned to submit to this cruel operation is a mystery,
  unfathomable, I suspect, even by the judges themselves.
  Cock-fighting being forbidden by law, the cocks should, on
  principle, be left undubbed, as a protest against this brutal
  amusement. The comb of the Game male bird is as beautifully
  formed as that of the Dorking; why then rob it of
  this great ornament? It is asserted that it is necessary to
  remove the comb to prevent the cocks injuring each other
  fatally in fighting; but this is not true; a Dorking will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> fight for the championship as ardently as any Game bird,
  and yet his comb is spared. Cockerels will not quarrel if
  kept apart from hens until the breeding season, when they
  should be separated, and put on their several walks. If
  pugnaciously inclined I do not believe that the absence of
  the comb will save the weaker opponent from destruction;
  therefore I raise my voice for pity, in favour of the
  beautiful Game cock.&quot;</p>
<p>The colours are various, and they are classed into
  numerous varieties and sub-varieties, of which the chief
  are&mdash;Black-breasted Red; Brown-Red; Silver Duck-wing
  Greys, so called from the feathers resembling those of a
  duck; Greys; Blues; Duns; Piles, or Pieds; Black;
  White; and Brassy-winged, which is Black with yellow
  on the lesser wing coverts. Colours and markings must
  be allowed a somewhat wide range in this breed; and
  figure, with courage, may be held to prove purity of blood
  though the colour be doubtful. Mr. Douglas considers
  the Black-breasted Red the finest feathered Game, and
  states that he never found any come so true to colour as a
  brood of that variety. White in the tail feathers is highly
  objectionable, though not an absolute disqualification.
  White fowls should be entirely white, with white legs.
  The rules for the coloured legs are very undecided. Light
  legs match light-coloured birds best. No particular colour
  is imperative, but it should harmonise with the plumage,
  and all in a pen must agree.</p>
<p>The best layers are the Black-breasted Reds with willow
  legs, and the worst the Greys.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>DORKINGS.</h3>
<p>This is one of the finest breeds, and especially English.
  A pure Dorking is distinguished by an additional or fifth
  toe. There are several varieties, which are all comprised
  in two distinct classes&mdash;the White and the Coloured. The
  rose-combed white breed is <i>the</i> Dorking of the old fanciers,
  and most probably the original breed, from which the
  coloured varieties were produced by crossing it with the
  old Sussex, or some other large coloured fowl. &quot;That such
  was the case,&quot; says Mr. Wright, &quot;is almost proved by the
  fact that only a few years ago nothing was more uncertain
  than the appearance of the fifth toe in coloured chickens,
  even of the best strains. Such uncertainty in any important
  point is always an indication of mixed blood; and
  that it was so in this case is shown by the result of long
  and careful breeding, which has now rendered the fifth toe
  permanent, and finally established the variety.&quot; Mr. Brent
  says: &quot;The <i>old</i> Dorking, the <i>pure</i> Dorking, the <i>only</i> Dorking,
  is the <i>White</i> Dorking. It is of good size, compact
  and plump form, with short neck, short white legs, five
  toes, a full rose-comb, a large breast, and a plumage of
  spotless white. The practice of crossing with a Game cock
  was much in vogue with the old breeders, to improve a
  worn-out stock (which, however, would have been better
  accomplished by procuring a fresh bird of the same kind,
  but not related). This cross shows itself in single combs,
  loss of a claw, or an occasional red feather, but what is
  still more objectionable, in pale-yellow legs and a yellow
  circle about the beak, which also indicates a yellowish
  skin. These, then, are faults to be avoided. As regards
  size, the White Dorking is generally inferior to the Sussex
  fowl (or 'coloured Dorking'), but in this respect it only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> requires attention and careful breeding. The pure White
  Dorking may truly be considered as fancy stock, as well as
  useful, because they will breed true to their points; but
  the grey Sussex, Surrey or Coloured Dorking, often sport.
  To the breeders and admirers of the so-called 'Coloured
  Dorkings' I would say, continue to improve the fowl of
  your choice, but let him be known by his right title; do
  not support him on another's fame, nor yet deny that the
  rose-comb or fifth toe is essential to a Dorking, because
  your favourites are not constant to those points. The
  absence of the fifth claw to the Dorking would be a great
  defect, but to the Sussex fowl (erroneously called a 'Coloured
  Dorking') it is my opinion it would be an improvement,
  provided the leg did not get longer with the loss.&quot;</p>
<p>The fifth toe should not be excessively large, or too far
  above the ordinary toe.</p>
<p>The White Dorking must have the plumage uniformly
  white, though in the older birds the hackle and saddle may
  attain a light golden tint. The rose-comb is preferable,
  and the beak and legs should be light and clear.</p>
<p>The Coloured Dorking is now bred to great size and
  beauty. It is a large, plump, compact, square-made bird,
  with short white legs, and should have a well-developed
  fifth toe. The plumage is very varied, and may have a
  wide range, and might almost be termed immaterial, provided
  a coarse mealy appearance be avoided, and the pen
  is well matched. This latitude in respect of plumage is so
  generally admitted that the assertion &quot;you cannot breed
  Dorkings true to colour,&quot; has almost acquired the authority
  of a proverb. They may be shown with either rose or
  single combs, but all the birds in a pen must match.</p>
<p>The Dorking is the perfection of a table bird, combining
  delicately-flavoured white flesh, which is produced in
  greatest quantity in the choicest parts&mdash;the breast, merry-thought,
  and wings&mdash;equal distribution of fat, and symmetrical
  shape. Mr. Baily prefers the Speckled or Grey to
  the White, as &quot;they are larger, hardier, and fatten more
  readily, and although it may appear anomalous, it is not
  less true that white-feathered poultry has a tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> yellowness in the flesh and fat.&quot; Size is an important
  point in Dorkings. Coloured prize birds weigh from seven
  to fourteen pounds, and eight months' chickens six or
  seven pounds. The White Dorking is smaller.</p>
<p>They are not good layers, except when very young, and
  are bad winter layers. The eggs are large, averaging 2&frac34;
  ounces, pure white, very much rounded, and nearly equal
  in size at each end. The hen is an excellent sitter and
  mother. The chickens are very delicate, requiring more
  care when young than most breeds, and none show a
  greater mortality, no more than two-thirds of a brood
  usually surviving the fourth week of their life. They
  should not be hatched before March, and must be kept on
  gravel soil, hard clay, or other equally dry ground, and
  never on brick, stone, or wooden flooring.</p>
<p>This breed will only thrive on a dry soil. They are fond
  of a wide range, and cannot be kept within a fence of less
  than seven feet in height. When allowed unlimited range
  they appear to grow hardy, and are as easily reared as any
  other breed if not hatched too early. If kept in confinement
  they should have fresh turf every day, besides other
  vegetable food. Dorkings degenerate more than any breed
  by inter-breeding, and rapidly decrease in size.</p>
<p>Dorkings are peculiarly subject to a chronic inflammation
  or abscess of the foot, known as &quot;bumble-foot,&quot;
  which probably originated in heavy fowls descending from
  high perches and walking over sharp stones. The additional
  toe may have rendered them more liable to this
  disease. It may now arise from the same cause, and is
  best prevented by using broad, low perches, and keeping
  their runs clear of sharp, rough stones, but it also appears
  to have become hereditary in some birds. There is no
  cure for it when matured except its removal, and this
  operation fails oftener than it succeeds; but Mr. Tegetmeier
  states, that he has in early cases removed the corn-like or
  wart-like tumours on the ball of the foot with which the
  disease begins, and cauterised the part with nitrate of
  silver successfully.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>SPANISH.</h3>
<p>This splendid breed was originally imported from
  Spain, and is characterised by its peculiar white face,
  which in the cock should extend from the comb downwards,
  including the entire face, and meet beneath in a
  white cravat, hidden by the wattles; and in the hen
  should be equally striking. The plumage is perfectly
  black, with brilliant metallic lustre, reflecting rich green
  and purple tints. The tail should resemble a sickle in the
  cock, and be square in the hen. The comb should be of a
  bright red, large, and high, upright in the cock, but
  pendent in the hen; the legs blue, clean, and long, and
  the bearing proud and gallant.</p>
<p>With care they will thrive in a very small space, and are
  perhaps better adapted for town than any other variety.
  They are tolerably hardy when grown, but suffer much
  from cold and wet. Their combs and wattles are liable
  to be injured by severe cold, from which these fowls should
  be carefully protected. If frost-bitten, the parts should be
  rubbed with snow or cold water, and the birds must not
  be taken into a warm room until recovered.</p>
<p>The Spanish are excellent layers, producing five or six eggs
  weekly from February to August, and two or three weekly
  from November to February, and also laying earlier than
  any other breed except the Brahma, the pullets beginning
  to lay before they are six months old. Although the hens
  are only of an average size, and but moderate eaters, their
  eggs are larger than those of any other breed, averaging
  3&frac12; ounces, and some weighing 4&frac12; ounces, each. The shells
  are very thin and white, and the largest eggs are laid in
  the spring.</p>
<p>The flesh is excellent, but the body is small compared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> that of the Dorking. They very seldom show any inclination
  to sit, and if they hatch a brood are bad nurses. The
  chickens are very delicate, and are best hatched at the end
  of April and during May. They do not feather till almost
  three-parts grown, and require a steady mother that will
  keep with them till they are safely feathered, and therefore
  the eggs should be set under a Dorking hen, because that
  breed remains longer with the chicks than any other.
  They almost always have white feathers in the flight of the
  wings, but these become black.</p>
<p>&quot;In purchasing Spanish fowls,&quot; says an excellent
  authority, &quot;blue legs, the entire absence of white or
  coloured feathers in the plumage, and a large white face,
  with a very large, high comb, which should be erect in the
  cock, though pendent in the hen, should be insisted on.&quot;
  Legginess is a fault that breeders must be careful to avoid.</p>
<p>The cockerels show the white face earlier than the
  pullets, and a blue, shrivelly appearance in the face of the
  chickens is a better sign of future whiteness than a red
  fleshiness. Pullets are rarely fully white-faced till above a
  year old. &quot;The white face,&quot; says an excellent authority,
  &quot;should always extend well around the eye, and up to the
  point of junction with the comb, though a line of short
  black feathers is there frequently seen to intrude its undesired
  presence. It is certainly objectionable, and the
  less of it the better; but any attempt to remove or disguise
  this eyesore should be followed by immediate disqualification.&quot;
  Some exhibitors of Spanish shave the down of the
  edges of the white-face, in order to make it smooth and
  larger. This disgraceful practice is not allowed at the
  Birmingham Show.</p>
<p>&quot;One test of condition,&quot; says Mr. Baily, &quot;more particularly
  of the pullets, is the state of the comb, which will
  be red, soft, and developed, just in proportion to the condition
  of the bird. While moulting&mdash;and they are almost
  naked during this process&mdash;the comb entirely shrivels up.&quot;</p>
<p>The White-faced <span class="smcap">White Spanish</span> is thought to be merely
  a sport of the White-faced Black Spanish. But, whatever
  their origin may have been, they possess every indication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> common blood with their Black relatives, and their claims
  to appear by their side in the exhibition room are as good
  as those of the White Cochins and the White Polish. The
  plumage is uniformly white, but in all other respects they
  resemble the Black breed. From the absence of contrast
  of colour shown in the face, comb, and plumage of the
  Black Spanish, the White variety is far less striking in
  appearance.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Andalusian</span> are so called from having been brought
  from the Spanish province of Andalusia. This breed is of
  a bluish grey, sometimes slightly laced with a darker shade,
  but having the neck hackles and tail feathers of a glossy
  black, with red face and white ears. The chickens are very
  hardy, and feather well, and earlier than the Spanish.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Minorca</span> is so called from having been imported
  from that island, and is a larger and more compactly-formed
  breed, resembling the Spanish in its general characteristics;
  black, with metallic lustre, but with red face,
  and having only the ear-lobes white; showing even a
  larger comb, and with shorter legs. They are better as
  table fowls than the Spanish, but the Andalusian are superior
  to either. The Minorca is the best layer of all the
  Spanish breeds, its chickens are tolerably hardy, and it is
  altogether far superior to the White-faced breed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ancona</span> is a provincial term applied to black and white
  mottled, or &quot;cuckoo,&quot; which on all other points resemble
  Minorcas, but are smaller.</p>
<p>The &quot;Black Rot,&quot; to which Spanish fowls are subject, is
  a blackening of the comb, swelling of the legs and feet,
  and general wasting of the system; and can only be cured
  in the earlier stages by frequent purgings with castor oil,
  combined with warm nourishing food, and strong ale, or
  other stimulants, given freely. They are also subject to a
  peculiar kind of swelled face, which first appears like a
  small knob under the skin, and increases till it has covered
  one side of the face. It is considered to be incurable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>HAMBURGS.</h3>
<p>This breed is medium-sized, and should have a brilliant
  red, finely-serrated rose-comb, terminating in a spike at
  the back, taper blue legs, ample tail, exact markings, a
  well-developed white deaf-ear, and a quick, spirited bearing.
  They are classed in three varieties, the Pencilled,
  Spangled, and Black varieties, with the sub-varieties of
  Gold and Silver in the two former.</p>
<p>The Pencilled Hamburg is of two ground colours, gold
  and silver, that is, of a brown yellow or white, and very
  minutely marked. The hens of both colours should have
  the body clearly pencilled across with several bars of
  black. The hackle in both sexes should be free from dark
  marks. In the Golden-pencilled variety the cock should
  be of one uniform red all over his body without any pencilling
  whatever, and his tail copper colour; but many
  first-class birds have pure black tails and the sickle feathers
  should be shaded with a rich bronze or copper. In the
  Silver-pencilled variety the cock is often nearly white, with
  yellowish wing-coverts, and a brown or chestnut patch on
  the flight feathers of his wing. The tail should be black
  and the sickle feathers tinged with a reddish white.</p>
<p>The Speckled or Spangled Hamburg, also called Pheasant
  Fowl, from the false idea that the pheasant was one
  of its parents, is of two kinds, the Golden-speckled and
  Silver-speckled, according to their ground colour, the marking
  taking the form of a spot upon each feather. They
  have very full double and firmly fixed combs, the point at
  the end turning upwards, a dark rim round the eyes, blue
  legs, and mixed hackle. They were also called Moss
  Fowls, and Mooneys, the latter probably because the end
  of every feather should have a black rim on the yellow or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> white ground. In the Golden-spangled some judges prefer
  cocks with a pure black breast, but others desire them
  spangled.</p>
<p>&quot;One chief cause of discussion,&quot; says Miss Watts,
  &quot;relating to the Hamburg, regarded the markings on the
  cocks. The Yorkshire breed, which had been a favourite
  in that county for many years, produced henny cocks&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> cocks with plumage resembling that of a hen. The feathers
  of the hackle were not narrow and elongated like those of
  cocks generally, but were short and rounded like those of
  the hen; the saddle-feathers were the same, and the tail,
  instead of being graced with fine flowing sickle feathers,
  was merely square like that of a hen. The Lancashire
  Mooneys, on the contrary, produce cocks with as fine
  flowing plumage as need grace any chanticleer in the land,
  and tails with sickle-feathers twenty-two inches long, fine
  flowing saddle-feathers, and abundant hackle. The hen-tail
  cocks had the markings, as well as the form, of the
  hen; the long feathers of the others cannot, from their
  form, have these markings. On this question party-spirit
  ran high: York and Lancaster, Cavalier and Roundhead,
  were small discussions compared with it; but the hen-cocks
  were beaten, and we now seldom hear of them. A mixture
  of the two breeds has been tried; but by it valuable qualities
  and purity of race have been sacrificed.&quot;</p>
<p>The Black Hamburg is of a beautiful black with a
  metallic lustre, and is a noble-looking bird, the cocks often
  weighing seven pounds. There is little doubt that it was
  produced by crossing with the Spanish, which blood shows
  itself in the white face, which is often half apparent, and
  in the darker legs. But it is well established as a distinct
  variety, and good birds breed true to colour and points.
  The cocks' combs are larger, and the hens' legs shorter,
  than the other varieties.</p>
<p>Bolton Bays and Greys, Chitteprats, Turkish, and
  Creoles or Corals, Pencilled Dutch fowls, and Dutch every-day
  layers, are but incorrect names for the Hamburgs,
  with which they are identical.</p>
<p>The Hamburgs do not attain to their full beauty until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> three years old. &quot;As a general rule,&quot; says Mr. Baily,
  &quot;no true bred Hamburg fowl has top-knot, single comb,
  white legs, any approach to feather on the legs, white tail,
  or spotted hackle.&quot; The white ear-lobe being so characteristic
  a feature in all the Hamburgs, becomes most
  important in judging their merits. Weight is not considered,
  but still the Pencilled cock should not weigh less
  than four and a half pounds, nor the hen than three and a
  half; and the Spangled cock five pounds and the hen four.</p>
<p>The Hamburgs are most prolific layers naturally, without
  over-stimulating feeding, surpassing all others in the
  number of their eggs, and deserve their popular name of
  &quot;everlasting layers.&quot; Their eggs are white, and do not
  weigh more than 1&frac12; ounce to 1&frac34; ounce each; and the
  hens are known to average 240 eggs yearly. Not being
  large eaters, they are very profitable fowls to keep. The
  eggs of the Golden-spangled are the largest, and it is the
  hardiest variety, but the Pencilled lay more. The Black
  variety produces large eggs, and lays a greater number
  than any known breed.</p>
<p>They very seldom show any desire to sit except when
  they have a free woodland range, for even if free it must
  be wild to induce any desire to perpetuate the species, and
  they never sit if confined to a yard. The chickens should
  not be hatched earlier than May, but in the South of
  England they will do very well if hatched by a Cochin-China
  hen at the beginning of March. They are small
  birds for table, but of excellent quality.</p>
<p>Hamburgs do not bear confinement well, and will not
  thrive without a good run; a grass field is the best.
  Being small and light, even a ten-feet fence will not keep
  them within a small run. They may indeed be kept in a
  shed, but the number must be very few in proportion to
  its size, and they must be kept dry and scrupulously clean.
  They are excellent guards in the country, for if disturbed
  in their roosting-place they will make a great noise.
  The breed has improved in this country, and British bred
  fowls are much stronger than the imported birds.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>POLANDS.</h3>
<p>This breed might with good reason be divided into
  more families, but it is usual to rank as Polands all fowls
  with their chief distinguishing characteristic, a full, large,
  round, compact tuft on the head. The breed &quot;is quite
  unknown in Poland, and takes its name,&quot; says Mr. Dickson,
  &quot;from some resemblance having been fancied between
  its tufted crest and the square-spreading crown of the
  feathered caps worn by the Polish soldiers.&quot; It is much
  esteemed in Egypt, and equally abundant at the Cape of
  Good Hope, where their legs are feathered. Some travellers
  assert that the Mexican poultry are crested, and that what
  are called Poland fowls are natives of either Mexico or
  South America; but others believe that they are natives of
  the East, and that they, as well as all the other fowls on
  the Continent of America, have been introduced from the
  Old World.</p>
<p>The Golden-spangled and Silver-spangled are the most
  beautiful varieties, the first being of a gold colour and the
  second white, both spangled with black. The more uniform
  the colour of the tuft is with that of the bird, the higher it
  is valued.</p>
<p>The Black Poland is of a deep velvety black; has a large,
  white, round tuft, and should not have a comb, but many
  have a little comb in the form of two small points before
  the tuft. The tuft to be perfect should be entirely white,
  but it is rare to meet with one without a slight bordering
  of black, or partly black, feathers round the front.</p>
<p>There are also Yellow, laced with white, Buff or Chamois,
  spangled with white, Blue, Grey, Black, and White mottled.
  All the sub-varieties should be of medium size, neat compact
  form, plump, full-breasted, and have lead-coloured legs and
  ample tails.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>The top-knot of the cock should be composed of straight
  feathers, growing from the centre of the crown, and falling
  over outside, but not so much as to intercept the sight,
  and form a circular crest. That of the hen should be
  formed of feathers growing out and turning in at the
  extremity, so as to resemble a cauliflower, and it should be
  even, firm, and as nearly round as possible. Large,
  uneven top-knots composed of loose feathers do not equal
  smaller but firm and well-shaped crests. The white ear-lobe
  is essential in all the varieties.</p>
<p>&quot;Beards&quot; in Polands were formerly not admired.
  Among the early birds brought from the continent, not
  one in a hundred was bearded, and those that were so were
  often rejected, and it was a question of dispute whether
  the pure bird should have them or not. Bearded birds at
  shows were the exceptions, but an unbearded pen of Polands
  is now seldom or ever seen.</p>
<p>There was formerly a breed of White, with black top-knots,
  but that is lost, although it seems to have been not
  only the most ornamental, but the largest and most valuable
  of all the Polish varieties. The last specimen known
  was seen by Mr. Brent at St. Omer in 1854, and it is
  possible that the breed may still exist in France or
  Ireland.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Serai Ta-ook</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fowl of the Sultan</span>, is the
  latest Polish fowl introduced into this country. They were
  imported in 1854 by Miss Watts, who says: &quot;With
  regard to the name, Serai is the name of the Sultan's
  palace; T&auml;-ook is Turkish for fowl; the simplest translation
  of this is, Sultan's fowls, or fowls of the Sultan; a
  name which has the double advantage of being the
  nearest to be found to that by which they have been
  known in their own country, and of designating the
  country from which they came. In general habits
  they are brisk and happy-tempered, but not kept in
  as easily as Cochin-Chinas. They are very good layers;
  their eggs are large and white; they are non-sitters, and
  small eaters. A grass run with them will remain green
  long after the crop would have been cleared by either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> Brahmas or Cochins, and with scattered food they soon
  become satisfied and walk away. They are the size of
  our English Poland fowls. Their plumage is white and
  flowing; they have a full-sized compact Poland tuft on the
  head, are muffed, have a good flowing tail, short well-feathered
  legs, and five toes upon each foot. The comb is
  merely two little points, and the wattles very small. We
  have never seen fowls more fully decorated&mdash;full tail,
  abundant furnishing, in hackle almost touching the ground,
  boots, vulture-hocks, beards, whiskers, and full round
  Poland crests. Their colour is pure white.&quot;</p>
<p>They are prolific layers during spring and summer.
  Their eggs are white, and weigh from 2 ounces to 2&frac14;
  ounces each, the Spangled varieties producing the largest.
  They rarely sit, and generally leave their eggs after five or
  six days, and are not good mothers. The chickens require
  great care for six weeks. They should never be hatched
  by heavy hens, as the prominence in the skull which supports
  the top-knot is never completely covered with bone,
  and very sensible to injury. Like the Game breed they
  improve in feather for several years. Polands never thrive
  on a wet or cold soil, and are more affected by bad weather
  than any other breed; the top-knots being very liable to
  be saturated with wet. They are easily fattened, and their
  flesh is white, juicy, and rich-flavoured, but they are not
  sufficiently large for the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Hewitt cautions breeders against attempting to seize
  birds suddenly, as the crest obscures their sight, and, being
  taken by surprise, they are frequently so frightened as to
  die in the hand. They should, therefore, always be
  spoken to, or their attention otherwise attracted before
  being touched.</p>

<h3>BANTAMS.</h3>
<p>Of this breed one kind is Game, and resembles the Game
  fowl, except in size; another is feathered to the very toes,
  the feathers on the tarsi, or beam of the leg, being long
  and stiff, and often brushing the ground. They are peculiarly
  fancy fowls. There are several varieties, the White,
  Black, Nankin, Partridge, Booted or Feather-legged, Game,
  and the Golden-laced and Silver-laced, or Sebright Bantam.
  All should be very small, varying from fourteen to twenty
  ounces in the hen, and from sixteen to twenty-four in the
  cock. The head should be narrow; beak curved; forehead
  rounded; eyes bright; back short; body round and full;
  breast very prominent; legs short and clean, except in the
  Booted variety; wings depressed; and the carriage unusually
  erect, the back of the neck and the tail feathers
  almost touching; and the whole bearing graceful, bold,
  and proud.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt=""/> <span class="caption">Black. Sebright&#39;s Gold and Silver-laced. White. Game.<br />
  BANTAMS. </span> </div>
<p>&quot;The Javanese jungle-fowl&quot; (<i>Gallus Bankiva</i>), says Mr.
  W. C. L. Martin, &quot;the Ayam-utan of the Malays, is a
  native of Java; but either a variety or a distinct species of
  larger size, yet very similar in colouring, is found in continental
  India. The Javanese, or Bankiva jungle-fowl, is
  about the size of an ordinary Bantam, and in plumage
  resembles the black-breasted red Game-bird of our country,
  with, a steel-blue mark across the wings. The comb is
  high, its edge is deeply serrated, and the wattles are rather
  large. The hackle feathers of the neck and rump are long
  and of a glossy golden orange; the shoulders are chestnut
  red, the greater wing-coverts deep steel-blue, the quill
  feathers brownish black, edged with pale, reddish yellow,
  or sandy red. The tail is of a black colour, with metallic
  reflections of green and blue. The under parts are black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> the naked space round the eyes, the comb, and wattles are
  scarlet. The hen closely resembles a brown hen of the
  Game breed, except in being very much smaller. That
  this bird, or its continental ally, is one of the sources&mdash;perhaps
  the main source&mdash;of our domestic race, cannot be
  doubted. It inter-breeds freely with our common poultry,
  and the progeny is fertile. Most beautiful cross-breeds
  between the Bankiva jungle-fowl and Bantam may be seen
  in the gardens of the Zoological Society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That the Bankiva jungle-fowl of Java, or its larger continental
  variety, if it be not a distinct species (and of which
  Sir W. Jardine states that he has seen several specimens),
  is one of the sources of our domestic breeds, cannot, we
  think, be for a moment doubted. It would be difficult
  to discover any difference between a clean-limbed, black-breasted
  red Bantam-cock, and a cock Bankiva jungle-fowl.
  Indeed, the very term Bantam goes far to prove their specific
  identity. Bantam is a town or city at the bottom of
  a bay on the northern coast of Java; it was first visited by
  the Portuguese in 1511, at which time a great trade was
  carried on by the town with Arabia, Hindostan, and China,
  chiefly in pepper. Subsequently it fell into the hands of
  the Dutch, and was at one time the great rendezvous for
  European shipping. It is now a place of comparative
  insignificance. From this it would seem that the jungle-fowls
  domesticated and sold to the Europeans at Bantam
  continued to be designated by the name of the place where
  they were obtained, and in process of time the name was
  appropriated to all our dwarfish breeds.&quot;</p>
<p>Game Bantams are exact miniatures of real Game fowls,
  in Black-breasted red, Duck-wing, and other varieties. The
  cocks must not have the strut of the Bantam, but the bold,
  martial bearing of the Game cock. Their wings should be
  carried closely, and their feathers be hard and close. The
  Duck-wing cock's lower wing-coverts should be marked
  with blue, forming a bar across each wing.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Sebright</span>, or <span class="smcap">Gold and Silver-laced Bantam</span>, is a
  breed with clean legs, and of most elegantly spangled
  plumage, which was bred and has been brought to great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> perfection by Sir John Sebright, after whom they are
  named. The attitude of the cock is singularly bold and
  proud, the head being often thrown so much back as to
  meet the tail feathers, which are simple like those of a hen,
  the ordinary sickle-like feathers being abbreviated and
  broad. The Gold-laced Sebright Bantams should have
  golden brownish-yellow plumage, each feather being bordered
  with a lacing of black; the tail square like that of
  the hen, without sickle feathers, and carried well over the
  back, each feather being tipped with black, a rose-comb
  pointed at the back, the wings drooping to the ground,
  neither saddle nor neck hackles, clean lead-coloured legs
  and feet, and white ear-lobes; and the hen should correspond
  exactly with him, but be much smaller. The Silver-laced
  birds have exactly the same points except in the
  ground feathering, which should be silvery, and the nearer
  the shade approaches to white the more beautiful will be
  the bird. Their carriage should resemble that of a good
  Fantail pigeon.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Black Bantams</span> should be uniform in colour, with
  well-developed white ear-lobes, rose-combs, full hackles,
  sickled and flowing tail, and deep slate-coloured legs. The <span class="smcap">White Bantams</span> should have white legs and beak. Both
  should be of tiny size.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Nankin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Common Yellow Bantam</span>, is probably
  the nearest approach to the original type of the family&mdash;the
  &quot;Bankiva fowl.&quot; The cock &quot;has a large proportion
  of red and dark chestnut on the body, with a full black
  tail; while the hen is a pale orange yellow, with a tail
  tipped with black, and the hackle lightly pencilled with
  the same colour, and clean legs. Combs vary, but the rose
  is decidedly preferable. True-bred specimens of these
  birds being by no means common, considerable deviations
  from the above description may consequently be expected
  in birds passing under this appellation.&quot;</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Booted Bantams</span> have their legs plumed to the toes,
  not on one side only like Cochin-Chinas, but completely on
  both, with stiff, long feathers, which brush the ground.
  The most beautiful specimens are of a pure white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> &quot;Feathered-legged Bantams,&quot; says Mr. Baily, &quot;may be of
  any colour; the old-fashioned birds were very small,
  falcon-hocked, and feathered, with long quill feathers to
  the extremity of the toe. Many of them were bearded.
  They are now very scarce; indeed, till exhibitions brought
  them again into notice, these beautiful specimens of their
  tribe were all neglected and fast passing away. Nothing
  but the Sebright was cultivated; but now we bid fair to
  revive the pets of our ancestors in all their beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Pekin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Cochin Bantams</span>, were taken from the
  Summer Palace at Pekin during the Chinese war, and
  brought to this country. They exactly resemble the Buff
  Cochins in all respects except size. They are very tame.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Japanese Bantam</span> is a recent importation, and
  differs from most of the other varieties in having a very
  large single comb. It has very short well-feathered legs,
  and the colour varies. Some are quite white, some have
  pure white bodies, with glossy, jet-black tails, others are
  mottled and buff. They throw the tail up and the head
  back till they nearly meet, as in the Fantailed pigeon.
  They are said to be the constant companions of man in
  their native country, and have a droll and good-natured
  expression.</p>
<p>All the Bantam cocks are very pugnacious, and though
  the hens are good mothers to their own chickens, they will
  attack any stranger with fury. They are good layers of
  small but exquisitely-flavoured eggs. But no breed produces
  so great a proportion of unfertile eggs. June is the
  best month for hatching, as the chickens are delicate.
  They feather more quickly than most breeds, and are apt
  to die at that period through the great drain upon the
  system in producing feathers. When fully feathered they
  are quite hardy. The hens are excellent mothers. The
  chickens require a little more animal food than other fowls,
  and extra attention for a week or two in keeping them dry.
  Bantams are very useful in a garden, eating many slugs
  and insects, and doing little damage.</p>

<h3>FRENCH AND VARIOUS.</h3>
<p>The French breeds are remarkable for great weight and
  excellent quality of flesh, with a very small proportion of
  bones and offal; their breeders having paid great attention
  to those important, substantial, and commercial points
  instead of devoting almost exclusive attention to colour and
  other fancy points as we have done. As a rule they are
  all non-sitters, or sit but rarely.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt=""/> <span class="caption">Houdans. La Fl&ecirc;che, cock. Cr&ecirc;vecoeur, hen.<br />
  FRENCH. </span></div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur</span> has been known the longest and most
  generally. This breed is said to derive its name from a
  village so called in Normandy, whence its origin can be
  distinctly traced; but others fancifully say, from the resemblance
  of its peculiar comb to a broken heart. It is
  scarce, and pure-bred birds are difficult to procure. The
  Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur is a fine large bird, black in plumage, or nearly
  so, with short, clean black legs, square body, deep chest,
  and a large and extraordinary crest or comb, which is thus
  described by M. Jacque: &quot;Various, but always forming
  two horns, sometimes parallel, straight, and fleshy; sometimes
  joined at the base, slightly notched, pointed, and
  separating at their extremities; sometimes adding to this
  latter description interior ramifications like the horns of
  a young stag. The comb, shaped like horns, gives the
  Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur the appearance of a devil.&quot; It is bearded, and
  has a top-knot or crest behind the comb. They are very
  quiet, walk slowly, scratch but little, do not fly, are very
  tame, ramble but little, and prefer seeking their food on
  the dunghill in the poultry-yard to wandering afar off.
  They are the most contented of all breeds in confinement,
  and will thrive in a limited space. They are tame, tractable
  fowls, but inclined to roup and similar diseases in our
  climate, and therefore prosper most on a dry, light soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> and can scarcely have too much sun. They are excellent
  layers of very large white eggs.</p>
<p>The chickens grow so fast, and are so inclined to fatten,
  that they may be put up at from ten to twelve weeks of
  age, and well fattened in fifteen days. The Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur is
  a splendid table bird, both for the quantity and quality
  of its flesh. The hen is heavy in proportion to the cock,
  weighing eight and a half pounds against his nine and a
  half, and the pullets always outweigh the cockerels.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">La Fl&ecirc;che</span> is thus described by M. Jacque: &quot;A strong,
  firm body, well placed on its legs, and long muscular
  feet, appearing less than it really is, because the feathers
  are close; every muscular part well developed; black
  plumage. The La Fl&ecirc;che is the tallest of all French
  cocks; it has many points of resemblance with the
  Spanish, from which I believe it to be descended by
  crossing with the Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur. Others believe that it is
  connected with the Br&ecirc;da, which it does, in fact, resemble,
  in some particulars. It has white, loose, and
  transparent skin; short, juicy, and delicate flesh, which
  puts on fat easily.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The comb is transversal, double, forming two horns
  bending forward, united at their base, divided at their
  summits, sometimes even and pointed, sometimes having
  ramifications on the inner sides. A little double 'combling'
  protrudes from the upper part of the nostrils, and
  although hardly as large as a pea, this combling, which
  surmounts the sort of rising formed by the protrusion of
  the nostrils, contributes to the singular aspect of the head.
  This measured prominence of the comb seems to add to
  the characteristic depression of the beak, and gives the bird
  a likeness to a rhinoceros.&quot; The plumage is jet black,
  with a very rich metallic lustre; large ear-lobe of pure
  white; bright red face, unusually free from feathers; and
  bright lead-coloured legs, with hard, firm scales. They are
  very handsome, showy, large, and lively birds, more
  inclined to wander than the Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur, and hardier when
  full grown; but their chickens are even more delicate in
  wet weather, and should not be hatched before May. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> are easily reared, and grow quickly. They are excellent
  layers of very large white eggs, but do not lay well in
  winter, unless under very favourable circumstances, and
  resemble the Spanish in the size and number of their eggs,
  and the time and duration of laying. Their flesh is excellent,
  juicy, and resembles that of the Game fowl, and the
  skin white and transparent, but the legs are dark. This
  breed is larger and has more style than the Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur, and
  is better adapted to our climate; but the fowls lack constitution,
  particularly the cocks, and are very liable to leg
  weakness and disease of the knee-joint, and when they get
  out of condition seldom recover. They are found in the
  north of France, but are not common even there.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Houdan</span> has the size, deep compact body, short legs,
  and fifth toe of the Dorking. They are generally white,
  some having black spots as large as a shilling, are bearded,
  and should have good top-knots of black and white feathers,
  falling backwards like a lark's crest; and the
  remarkable comb is thus described by M. Jacque:
  &quot;Triple, transversal in the direction of the beak, composed
  of two flattened spikes, of long and rectangular form,
  opening from right to left, like two leaves of a book;
  thick, fleshy, and variegated at the edges. A third spike
  grows between these two, having somewhat the shape of an
  irregular strawberry, and the size of a long nut. Another,
  quite detached from the others, about the size of a pea,
  should show between the nostrils, above the beak.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. F. H. Schr&ouml;der, of the National Poultry Company,
  considered that this surpassed all the French breeds, combining
  the size, shape, and quality of flesh of the Dorking
  with earlier maturity; prolific laying of good-sized eggs,
  which are nearly always fertile, and on this point the opposite
  of the Dorking; and early and rapid feathering in the
  chickens, which are, notwithstanding, hardier than any
  breeds except the Cochin and Brahma. They are very
  hardy, never sick, and will thrive in a small space. They
  are smaller than the Cr&ecirc;ve-C&oelig;ur or La Fl&ecirc;che, but well
  shaped and plump; and for combining size and quality of
  flesh with quantity and size of eggs nothing can surpass them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scotch Dumpies</span>, <span class="smcap">Go Laighs</span>, <span class="smcap">Bakies</span>, or <span class="smcap">Creepers</span>,
  are almost extinct; but they are profitable fowls, and
  ought to be more common, as they are very hardy, productive
  layers of fine large eggs, and their flesh is white
  and of excellent quality. They should have large, heavy
  bodies; short, white, clean legs, not above an inch and
  a half or two inches in length. The plumage is a mixture
  of black or brown, and white. They are good layers of fine
  large eggs. They cannot be surpassed as sitters and
  mothers, and are much valued by gamekeepers for hatching
  the eggs of pheasants. The cocks should weigh six or
  seven and the hen five or six pounds.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Silky</span> fowl is so called from its plumage, which is
  snowy white, being all discomposed and loose, and of a
  silky appearance, resembling spun glass. The comb and
  wattles are purple; the bones and the periosteum, or membrane
  covering the bones, black, and the skin blue or
  purple; but the flesh, however, is white and tender, and
  superior to that of most breeds. It is a good layer of small,
  round, and excellent eggs. The cock generally weighs
  less than three, and the hen less than two, pounds. It
  comes from Japan and China, and generally thrives in our
  climate. The chickens are easily reared if not hatched
  before April nor later than June. They are capital foster
  mothers for partridges, and other small and tender game.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Rumpkin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Rumpless</span> fowl, a Persian breed, not
  only lacks the tail-feathers but the tail itself. It is hardy,
  of moderate size, and varies in colour, but is generally
  black or brown, and from the absence of tail appears
  rounder than other fowls. The hens are good layers, but
  the eggs are often unfertile. They are good sitters and
  mothers, and the flesh is of fair quality.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Friesland</span>, so named from confounding the term
  &quot;frizzled&quot; with Friesland, is remarkable from having all
  the feathers, except those of the wings and tail, frizzled, or
  curled up the wrong way. It is small, very delicate, and a
  shower drenches it to the skin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barn-door</span> fowl are a mongrel race, compounded by
  chance, usually of the Game, Dorking, and Polish breeds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>TURKEYS.</h3>
<p>Turkeys are not considered profitable except on light,
  dry soils, which is said to be the cause of their success in
  Norfolk. They prosper, however, in Ireland; but although
  the air there is moist, the soil is dry, except in the boggy
  districts. Miss Watts believes that &quot;any place in which
  turkeys are properly reared and fed may compete with
  Norfolk. Very fine birds may be seen in Surrey, and other
  places near London.&quot; The general opinion of the best
  judges is, that they can barely be made to repay the cost
  of their food, which is doubtless owing to the usual great
  mortality among the chicks, which loss outbalances all
  profit; but others make them yield a fair profit, simply
  because, from good situation and judicious management,
  they rear all, or nearly all, the chicks. A single brood may
  be reared with ease on a small farm or private establishment
  without much extra expense, where sufficient attention
  can be devoted to them; but to make them profitable
  they should be bred on a large scale, and receive exclusive
  attention. They should have a large shed or house, with
  a boarded floor, to themselves.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt=""/> <span class="caption">Turkey and Guinea-fowls.</span> </div>
<p>Turkeys must have space, for they are birds of rambling
  habits, and only fitted for the farmyard, or extensive runs,
  delighting to wander in the fields in quest of insects, on
  which, with green herbage, berries, beech-mast, and various
  seeds, they greedily feed. The troop will ramble about all
  day, returning to roost in the evening, when they should
  have a good supply of grain; and another should be given
  in the morning, which will not only induce them to return
  home regularly every night, but keep them in good store
  condition, so that they can at any time be speedily fattened.
  Peas, vetches, tares, and most sorts of pulse, are almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> poisonous to them. Their feeding-place must be separate
  from the other poultry, or they will gobble up more than
  their share. Turkeys will rarely roost in a fowl-house,
  and should have a very high open shed, the perches being
  placed as high as possible. They are extremely hardy,
  roosting, if allowed, on the highest trees in the severest
  weather. But this should be prevented, as their feet are
  apt to become frost-bitten in severe weather. The chickens
  are as delicate. Wet is fatal to them, and the very
  slightest shower even in warm weather will frequently
  destroy half a brood.</p>
<p>The breeding birds should be carefully selected, any
  malformation almost invariably proving itself hereditary.
  The cock is at maturity when a year old, but not in his
  prime till he has attained his third year, and is entering
  upon his fourth, and he continues in vigour for three or
  four years more. He should be vigorous, broad-breasted,
  clean-legged, with ample wings, well-developed tail, bright
  eyes, and the carunculated skin of the neck full and rapid
  in its changes of colour. The largest possible hen should
  be chosen, the size of the brood depending far more upon
  the female than the male. One visit to the male is sufficient
  to render all the eggs fertile, and the number of
  hens may be unlimited, but to obtain fine birds, twelve or
  fifteen hens to one cock is the best proportion. The hen
  breeds in the spring following that in which she was
  hatched, but is not in her prime till two or three years old,
  and continues for two or three years in full vigour.</p>
<p>The hen generally commences laying about the middle
  of March, but sometimes earlier. When from her uttering
  a peculiar cry and prying about in quest of a secret spot
  for sitting, it is evident that she is ready to lay, she should
  be confined in the shed, barn, or other place where the
  nest has been prepared for her, and let out when she has
  laid an egg. The nest should be made of straw and dried
  leaves, in a large wicker basket, in a quiet secluded place,
  and an egg or nest-egg of chalk should be placed in it to
  induce her to adopt it. Turkeys like to choose their own
  laying-places, and keep to them though their eggs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> removed daily, provided a nest-egg is left there. They
  will wander to a distance in search of a secluded spot for
  laying, and pay their visits to the nest so cleverly that
  sometimes they keep it a secret and hatch a brood there,
  which, however, does not generally prove a strong or large
  one as in the case of ordinary fowls. When a hen has
  chosen a safe, quiet, and sheltered place for her nest, it is
  best to give her more eggs when she shows a desire to sit,
  and let her stay there. The hen generally lays from fifteen
  to twenty eggs, sometimes fewer and often many more.
  As soon as seven are produced, they should be placed
  under a good common hen, a Cochin is the best, and the
  remainder can be put under her when she wants to sit.
  The best hatching period is from the end of March to May,
  and none should be hatched later than June. The broody
  hens may be placed on their eggs in any quiet place, as
  they are patient, constant sitters, and will not leave their
  eggs wherever they may be put. A hen may be allowed
  from nine to fifteen eggs, according to her size. During
  the time the hen is sitting she requires constant attention.
  She must occasionally be taken off the nest to feed, and
  regularly supplied with fresh water; otherwise she will
  continue to sit without leaving for food, till completely
  exhausted. In general, do not let the cock go near the
  sitting hen, or he will destroy the eggs or chicks; but
  some behave well, and may be left at large with safety.
  She should not be disturbed or visited by any one but the
  person she is accustomed to be fed by, and the eggs should
  not be touched unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The chickens break the shell from the twenty-sixth to
  the twenty-ninth day, but sometimes as late as the thirty-first.
  Let them remain in the nest for twenty-four hours,
  but remove the shells, and next morning place the hen
  under a roomy coop or crate, on boards, in a warm outhouse.
  Keep her and her brood cooped up for two months,
  moving the coop every fine day into a dry grass field, but
  keep them in an outhouse in cold or wet weather. The
  chicks having a great tendency to diarrh&oelig;a, the very best
  food for the first week is hard-boiled eggs, chopped small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> mixed with minced dandelion, and when that cannot be
  had, with boiled nettles. They may then have boiled egg,
  bread-crumbs, and barley-meal for a fortnight, when the
  egg may be replaced by boiled potato, and small grain may
  soon be added. Do not force them to eat, but give them
  a little food on the tip of your finger, and they will soon
  learn to pick it out of the trough. A little hempseed, suet,
  onion-tops, green mustard, and nettle-tops, chopped very
  fine, should be mixed with their food. Curds are excellent
  food, and easily prepared by mixing powdered alum with
  milk slightly warmed, in the proportion of one teaspoonful
  of alum to four quarts of milk, and, when curdled, separating
  the curds from the whey. They should be squeezed
  very dry, and must always be given in a soft state. Water
  should be given but sparingly, and never allowed to stand
  by them, but when they have had sufficient it should be
  taken or thrown away. The water must be put in pans
  so contrived or placed that they cannot wet themselves.
  (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_38">page 38</a>.) Fresh milk is apt to disagree with the
  young chicks, and is not necessary. If a chick shows
  weakness, or has taken cold, give it some carraway seeds.</p>
<p>In their wild state the turkey rears only one brood in a
  season, and it is not advisable to induce the domesticated
  bird by any expedients to hatch a second, for it would be
  not only detrimental to her, but the brood would be
  hatched late in the season, and very difficult to rear, while
  those reared would not be strong, healthy birds.</p>
<p>The coop should be like that used for common fowls,
  but two feet broad, and higher, being about three feet high
  in front and one foot at the back; this greater slant of the
  roof being made in order to confine her movements, as
  otherwise she would move about too much, and trample
  upon her brood. When they have grown larger they must
  have a larger coop, made of open bars wide enough apart
  for them to go in and out, but too close to let in fowls to
  eat their delicate food, and the hen must be placed under it
  with them. A large empty crate, such as is used to contain
  crockery-ware, will make a good coop for large poults;
  but if one cannot be had, a coop may be made of laths or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> rails, with the bars four inches apart; it should be about
  five feet long, four feet broad, and three feet high.</p>
<p>Keep her cooped for two months, moving the coop every
  fine, dry day into a grass field, but on cold or wet days
  keep them in the outhouse. If she is allowed her liberty
  before they are well grown and strong, she will wander
  away with them through the long grass, hedges, and
  ditches, over highway, common, and meadow, mile after
  mile, losing them on the road, and straying on with the
  greatest complacency, and perfectly satisfied so long as she
  has one or two following her, and never once turning her
  head to see how her panting chicks are getting on, nor
  troubled when they squat down tired out, and implore her
  plaintively to come back; and all this arises from sheer
  heedlessness, and not from want of affection, for she will
  fight for her brood as valiantly as any pheasant will for
  hers. When full grown they should never be allowed to
  roam with her while there is heavy dew or white frost on
  the grass, but be kept in till the fields and hedgerows are
  dry. They will pick up many seeds and insects while
  wandering about in the fields with her, but must be fed by
  hand three or four times a day at regular intervals.</p>
<p>They cease to be chicks or chickens, and are called
  turkey-poults when the male and female distinctive characteristics
  are fairly established, the carunculated skin and
  comb of the cock being developed, which is called &quot;shooting
  the red,&quot; or &quot;putting out the red,&quot; and begins when
  they are eight or ten weeks old. It is the most critical
  period of their lives&mdash;much more so than moulting, and
  during the process their food must be increased in quantity,
  and made more nourishing by the addition of boiled
  egg-yolks, bread crumbled in ale, wheaten flour, bruised
  hempseed, and the like, and they must be well housed at
  night. When this process is completed they will be hardy,
  and able to take care of themselves; but till they are fully
  fledged it will be advisable to keep them from rain and
  cold, and not to try their hardness too suddenly.</p>
<p>Vegetables, as chopped nettles, turnip-tops, cabbage
  sprouts, onions, docks, and the like, boiled down and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> mixed with barley-meal, oatmeal, or wheaten flour, and
  curds, if they can be afforded, form excellent food for the
  young poults; also steamed potatoes, boiled carrots, turnips,
  and the like. With this diet may be given buckwheat,
  barley, oats, beans, and sunflower seeds.</p>
<p>When they are old enough to be sent to the stubble and
  fields, they are placed in charge of a boy or girl of from
  twelve to fifteen years old, who can easily manage one
  hundred poults. They are driven with a long bean stick,
  and the duties of the turkey-herd is to keep the cocks from
  fighting, to lead them to every place where there are
  acorns, beech-mast, corn, wild fruit, insects, or other food
  to be picked up. He must not allow them to get fatigued
  with too long rambles, as they are not fully grown, and
  must shelter them from the burning sun, and hasten
  them home on the approach of rain. The best times for
  these rambles are from eight to ten in the morning, when
  the dew is off the grass, and from four till seven in the
  evening, before it begins to fall.</p>
<p>Turkeys are crammed for the London markets. The
  process of fattening may commence when they are six
  months old, as they require a longer time to become fit for
  the market than fowls. The large birds which are seen at
  Christmas are usually males of the preceding year, and
  about twenty months old. All experienced breeders
  repudiate &quot;cramming.&quot; To obtain fine birds the chickens
  must be fed abundantly from their birth until they
  are sent to market, and while they are being fattened they
  should be sent to the fields and stubble for a shorter time
  daily, and their food must be increased in quantity and
  improved in quality. Early hatched, well fed young
  Norfolk cocks will frequently weigh twenty-three pounds
  by Christmas of the same year, and two-year-old birds
  will sometimes attain to twenty pounds. When two or
  more years old they are called &quot;stags.&quot;</p>
<p>The domesticated turkey can scarcely be said to be
  divided into distinct breeds like the common fowl, the
  several varieties being distinguished by colour only,
  but identical in their form and habits. They vary considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> in colour&mdash;some being of a bronzed black,
  others of a coppery tint, of a delicate fawn colour, or buff,
  and some of pure white. The dark coloured birds are
  generally considered the most hardy, and are usually the
  largest. The chief varieties are the Cambridge, Norfolk,
  Irish, American, and French.</p>
<p>The Cambridge combines enormous size, a tendency to
  fatten speedily, and first-rate flavour. The tortoiseshell
  character of its plumage gives the adult birds a very prepossessing
  appearance around the homestead, and a striking
  character in the exhibition room. The colours may vary
  from pale to dark grey, with a deep metallic brown tint,
  and light legs. The legs should be stout and long.</p>
<p>The Norfolk breed is more compact and smaller-boned,
  and produces a large quantity of meat of delicate whiteness
  and excellent quality. The cocks are almost as heavy as
  the Cambridge breed, but the hens are smaller and more
  compact. The Norfolk should be jet, not blue black,
  and free from any other colour, being uniform throughout,
  including the legs and feet.</p>
<p>All the birds in a pen must be uniform.</p>
<p>The American wild turkey has become naturalised in
  this country, but being of a very wandering disposition is
  best adapted to be kept in parks and on large tracts of wild
  land. It is slender in shape, but of good size, with uniform
  metallic bronze plumage, the flight feathers being barred
  with white, and the tail alternately with white, rich dark
  brown, and black, and with bright pink legs. The wattles
  are smaller than in the other breeds, and of a bluish tinge.
  They are very hardy, but more spiteful than others, and
  are said to be also more prolific. Crosses often take place
  in America between the wild and tame races, and are
  highly valued both for their appearance and for the table.
  Eggs of the wild turkey have also often been taken from
  their nests, and hatched under the domesticated hen.
  The flavour of the flesh of the American breed is peculiar
  and exceedingly good, but they do not attain a large size.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>GUINEA-FOWLS.</h3>
<p>The Guinea-fowl, Gallina, or Pintado (<i>Numida meleagris</i>),
  is the true meleagris of the ancients, a term
  generically applied by Belon, Aldrovandus, and Gesner to
  the turkey, and now retained, although the error is
  acknowledged, in order to prevent confusion. It is a
  native of Africa, where it is extensively distributed. They
  associate in large flocks and frequent open glades, the
  borders of forests, and banks of rivers, which offer abundant
  supplies of grain, berries, and insects, in quest of which
  they wander during the day, and collect together at
  evening, and roost in clusters on the branches of trees or
  shrubs. Several other wild species are known, some of
  which are remarkable for their beauty; but the common
  Guinea-fowl is the only one domesticated in Europe. The
  Guinea-fowl is about twenty-two inches long, and from
  standing high on its legs, and having loose, full plumage,
  appears to be larger than it really is, for when plucked it
  does not weigh more than an ordinary Dorking. It is
  very plump and well-proportioned. The Guinea-fowl
  is not bred so much as the turkey in England or France,
  is very rare in the northern parts of Europe, and in
  India is bred almost exclusively by Europeans, although
  it thrives as well there as in its native country. It &quot;is
  turbulent and restless,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;continually
  moving from place to place, and domineering over the
  whole poultry-yard, boldly attacking even the fiercest
  turkey cock, and keeping all in alarm by its petulant
  pugnacity&quot;; and the males, although without spurs, can
  inflict serious injury on other poultry with their short, hard
  beaks. The Guinea-fowls make very little use of their
  wings, and if forced to take to flight, fly but a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> distance, then alight, and trust to their rapid mode of
  running, and their dexterity in threading the mazes of
  brushwood and dense herbage, for security. They are
  shy, wary, and alert.</p>
<p>It is not much kept, its habits being wandering, and
  requiring an extensive range, but as it picks up nearly all
  its food, and is very prolific, it may be made very profitable
  in certain localities. The whole management of both the
  young and the old may be precisely the same as that of
  turkeys, in hatching, feeding, and fattening. This
  &quot;species,&quot; says Mr. Dickson, &quot;differs from all other
  poultry, in its being difficult to distinguish the cock from
  the hen, the chief difference being in the colour of the
  wattles, which are more of a red hue in the cock, and more
  tinged with blue in the hen. The cock has also a more
  stately strut.&quot;</p>
<p>They mate in pairs, and therefore an equal number
  of cocks and hens must be kept, or the eggs will prove
  unfertile. To obtain stock, some of their eggs must be
  procured, and placed under a common hen; for if old
  birds are bought, they will wander away for miles in
  search of their old home, and never return. They should
  be fed regularly, and must always have one meal at night,
  or they will scarcely ever roost at home. They will not
  sleep in the fowl-house, but prefer roosting in the lower
  branches of a tree, or on a thick bush, and retire early.
  They make a peculiar, harsh, querulous noise, which is
  oft-repeated, and not agreeable. The hens are prolific
  layers, beginning in May, and continuing during the
  whole summer. Their eggs are small, but of excellent
  flavour, of a pale yellowish red, finely dotted with a darker
  tint, and remarkable for the hardness of the shell. The
  hen usually lays on a dry bank, in secret places; and
  a hedgerow a quarter of a mile off is quite as likely to
  contain her nest as any situation nearer her home. She
  is very shy, and, if the eggs are taken from her nest, will
  desert it, and find another; a few should, therefore, always
  be left, and it should never be visited when she is in sight.
  But she often contrives to elude all watching, and hatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> a brood, frequently at a late period, when the weather is
  too cold for the chickens. As the Guinea-fowl seldom
  shows much disposition to incubate if kept under restraint,
  and frequently sits too late in the season to rear a brood in
  this country, it is a general practice to place her eggs
  under a common fowl&mdash;Game and Bantams are the best
  for the purpose. About twenty of the earliest eggs
  should be set in May. The Guinea-hen will hatch another
  brood when she feels inclined. They sit for twenty-six to
  twenty-nine or thirty days. When she sits in due season
  she generally rears a large brood, twenty not being an
  unusual number.</p>
<p>The chickens are very tender, and should not be
  hatched too early in spring, as a cold March wind is
  generally fatal to them. They must be treated like those
  of the turkey, and as carefully. They should be fed
  almost immediately, within six hours of being hatched,
  abundantly, and often; and they require more animal
  food than other chickens. Egg boiled hard, chopped very
  fine, and mixed with oatmeal, is the best food. They
  will die if kept without food for three or four hours;
  and should have a constant supply near them until they
  are allowed to have full liberty and forage for themselves.
  They will soon pick up insects, &amp;c., and will keep themselves
  in good condition with a little extra food. They
  are very strong on their legs, and those hatched under
  common hens may be allowed to range with her at the
  end of six weeks, and be fed on the same food and at the
  same times as other chickens.</p>
<p>The Guinea-fowl may be considered as somewhat intermediate
  between the pheasant and turkey. After the pheasant
  season, young birds that have been hatched the same year
  are excellent substitutes for that fine game, and fetch a fair
  price. They should never be fattened, but have a good
  supply of grain and meal for a week or two before being
  killed. The flesh of the young bird is very delicate, juicy,
  and well-flavoured, but the old birds, even of the second
  year, are dry, tough, and tasteless.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>DUCKS.</h3>
<p>Ducks will not pay if all their food has to be bought,
  except it is purchased wholesale, and they are reared for
  town markets, for their appetites are voracious, and they
  do not graze like geese. They may be kept in a limited
  space, but more profitably and conveniently where they
  have the run of a paddock, orchard, kitchen garden, flat
  common, green lane, or farmyard, with ditches and water.
  They will return at night, and come to the call of the
  feeder. Nothing comes amiss to them&mdash;green vegetables,
  especially when boiled, all kinds of meal made into porridge,
  all kinds of grain, bread, oatcake, the refuse and
  offal of the kitchen, worms, slugs, snails, insects and their
  larv&aelig;, are devoured eagerly. Where many fowls are kept,
  a few ducks may be added profitably, for they may be fed
  very nearly on what the hens refuse.</p>
<p>Ducks require water to swim in, but &quot;it is a mistake,&quot;
  says Mr. Baily, &quot;to imagine that ducks require a great
  deal of water. They may be kept where there is but very
  little, and only want a pond or tank just deep enough to
  swim in. The early Aylesbury ducklings that realise such
  large prices in the London market have hardly ever had a
  swim; and in rearing ducks, where size is a desideratum,
  they will grow faster and become larger when kept in pens,
  farmyards, or in pastures, than where they are at and in
  the water all day.&quot; Where a large number of geese and
  ducks are kept, water on a sufficient scale, and easily
  accessible, should be in the neighbourhood.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt=""/> <span class="caption">Toulouse Goose.<br />
  Rouen and Aylesbury Ducks. </span> </div>
<p>Ducks, being aquatic birds, do not require heated apartments,
  nor roosts on which to perch during the night.
  They squat on the floors, which must be dry and warm.
  They should, if possible, be kept in a house separate from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> the other poultry, and it should have a brick floor, so that
  it can be easily washed. In winter the floor should be
  littered with a thin layer of straw, rushes, or fern leaves,
  fresh every day. The hatching-houses should be separated
  from the lodging apartments, and provided with boxes for
  the purpose of incubation and hatching.</p>
<p>In its wild state the duck pairs with a single mate: the
  domestic duck has become polygamous, and five ducks may
  be allowed to one drake, but not more than two or three
  ducks should be given to one drake if eggs are required
  for setting.</p>
<p>Ducks begin laying in January, and usually from that
  time only during the spring; but those hatched in March
  will often lay in the autumn, and continue for two or three
  months. They usually lay fifty or sixty eggs, and have
  been known to produce 250. The faculty of laying might
  be greatly developed, as it has been in some breeds of
  fowls; but they have been hitherto chiefly bred for their
  flesh. They require constant watching when beginning to lay,
  for they drop their eggs everywhere but in the nest made for
  them, but as they generally lay in the night, or early in the
  morning, when in perfect health, they should therefore
  be kept in every morning till they have laid. One of
  the surest signs of indisposition among them is irregularity
  in laying. &quot;The eggs of the duck,&quot; says Mr.
  Dickson, &quot;are readily known from those of the common
  fowl by their bluish colour and larger size, the shell being
  smoother, not so thick, and with much fewer pores. When
  boiled, the white is never curdy like that of a new-laid
  hen's egg, but transparent and glassy, while the yolk is
  much darker in colour. The flavour is by no means so
  delicate. For omelets, however, as well as for puddings
  and pastry, duck eggs are much better than hen's eggs,
  giving a finer colour and flavour, and requiring less butter;
  qualities so highly esteemed in Picardy, that the women
  will sometimes go ten or twelve miles for duck eggs to
  make their holiday cakes.&quot;</p>
<p>A hen is often made to hatch ducklings, being considered
  a better nurse than a duck, which is apt to take them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> while too young to the pond, dragging them under beetling
  banks in search of food, and generally leaving half of them
  in the water unable to get out; and if the fly or the gnat
  is on the water, she will stay there till after dark, and lose
  part of her brood. Ducks' eggs may be advantageously
  placed under a broody exhibition hen. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>.) A
  turkey is much better than either, from the large expanse
  of the wings in covering the broods, and the greater heat
  of body; but if the duck is a good sitter, it is best to let
  her hatch her own eggs, taking care to keep her and them
  from the water till they are strong. The nest should be
  on the ground, and in a damp place. Choose the freshest
  eggs, and place from nine to eleven under her. Feed her
  morning and evening while sitting, and place food and
  water within her reach. The duck always covers her eggs
  upon leaving them, and loose straw should be placed near
  the house for that purpose.</p>
<p>They are hatched in thirty days. They may generally
  be left with their mother upon the nest for her own time.
  When she moves coop her on the short grass if fine
  weather, or under shelter if otherwise, for a week or ten
  days, when they may be allowed to swim for half an hour
  at a time. When hatched they require constant feeding.
  A little curd, bread-crumbs, and meal, mixed with chopped
  green food, is the best food when first hatched. Boiled
  cold oatmeal porridge is the best food for ducklings for the
  first ten days; afterwards barley-meal, pollard, and oats,
  with plenty of green food. Never give them hard spring
  water to drink, but that from a pond. Ducklings are
  easily reared, soon able to shift for themselves, and to pick
  up worms, slugs, and insects, and can be cooped together
  in numbers at night if protected from rats. An old pigsty
  is an excellent place for a brood of young ducks.</p>
<p>Ducklings should not be allowed to go on the water till
  feathers have supplied the place of their early down, for
  the latter will get saturated with the water while the former
  throws off the wet. &quot;Though the young ducklings,&quot; says
  Mr. W. C. L. Martin, &quot;take early to the water, it is
  better that they should gain a little strength before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> be allowed to venture into ponds or rivers; a shallow
  vessel of water filled to the brim and sunk in the ground
  will suffice for the first week or ten days, and this rule is
  more especially to be adhered to when they are under the
  care of a common hen, which cannot follow them into the
  pond, and the calls of which when there they pay little or
  no regard to. Rats, weasels, pike, and eels are formidable
  foes to ducklings: we have known entire broods destroyed
  by the former, which, having their burrows in a steep bank
  around a sequestered pond, it was found impossible to
  extirpate.&quot; If the ducklings stay too long in the water
  they will have diarrh&oelig;a, in which case coop them close for
  a few days, and mix bean-meal or oatmeal with their
  ordinary food.</p>
<p>A troop of ducks will do good service to a kitchen
  garden in the summer or autumn, when they can do no
  mischief by devouring delicate salads and young sprouting
  vegetables. They will search industriously for snails,
  slugs, woodlice, and millipedes, and gobble them up
  eagerly, getting positively fat on slugs and snails. Strawberries,
  of which they are very fond, must be protected
  from them. Where steamed food is daily prepared for
  pigs and cattle, a portion of this mixed with bran and
  barley-meal is the cheapest mode of satisfying their
  voracious appetites. They should never be stinted in
  food.</p>
<p>To fatten ducks let them have as much substantial food
  as they will eat, bruised oats and pea-meal being the
  standard, plenty of exercise, and clean water. Boiled
  roots mixed with a little barley-meal is excellent food,
  with a little milk added during fattening. They require
  neither penning up nor cramming to acquire plumpness,
  and if well fed should be fit for market in eight or ten
  weeks. Celery imparts a delicious flavour.</p>
<p>The Aylesbury is the finest breed, and should be of a
  spotless white, with long, flat, broad beak of a pale flesh
  colour, grey eyes, long head and neck, broad and flat body
  and breast, and orange legs, placed wide apart. As it
  lays early, its ducklings are the earliest ready for market.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> They have produced 150 large eggs in a year, and are
  better sitters than the Rouen.</p>
<p>The Rouen is hardy and easily reared, but rarely lay till
  February or March. They thrive better in most parts of
  England than the Aylesburys, and care less for the water
  than the other varieties. They are very handsome, and
  weigh eight or nine pounds each, and their flesh is
  excellent.</p>
<p>The Muscovy duck is so called, says Ray, &quot;not because
  it comes from Muscovy, but because it exhales a somewhat
  powerful odour of musk.&quot; Little is known of its origin,
  which is generally thought to be South America; nor has
  the date of its introduction into Europe been ascertained.
  &quot;This species,&quot; says Mr. W. C. L. Martin, &quot;will inter-breed
  with the common duck, but we believe the progeny
  are not fertile. The Musk duck greatly exceeds the
  ordinary kind in size, and moreover, differs in the colours
  and character of the plumage, in general contour, and the
  form of the head. The general colour is glossy blue-black,
  varied more or less with white; the head is crested,
  and a space of naked scarlet skin, more or less clouded
  with violet, surrounds the eye, continued from scarlet caruncles
  on the base of the beak; the top of the head is
  crested, the feathers of the body are larger, more lax,
  softer, and less closely compacted together than in the
  common duck, and seem to indicate less aquatic habits.
  The male far surpasses the female in size; there are no
  curled feathers in his tail.&quot; The male is fierce and quarrelsome,
  and when enraged has a savage appearance, and
  utters deep, hoarse sounds. The flesh is very good, but
  the breed is inferior as a layer to the Aylesbury or Rouen.</p>
<p>The Buenos Ayres, Labrador, or East Indian, brought
  most probably from the first-named country, is a small
  and very beautiful variety, with the plumage of a uniform
  rich, lustrous, greenish-black, and dark legs and bills; the
  drake rarely weighing five pounds, and the duck four
  pounds. Their eggs are often smeared over with a slatey-coloured
  matter, but the shell is really of a dull white.</p>

<h3>GEESE.</h3>
<p>Geese require much the same management as ducks.
  They may be kept profitably where there is a rough
  pasture or common into which they may be turned, and
  the pasturage is not rendered bare by sheep, as is generally
  the case; but even when the pasturage is good, a supply
  of oats, barley, or other grain should be allowed every
  morning and evening. Where the pasturage is poor or
  bad, the old geese become thin and weak, and the young
  broods never thrive and often die unless fully fed at home. A
  goose-house for four should not be less than eight feet long
  by six feet wide and six or seven feet high, with a smooth
  floor of brick. A little clean straw should be spread over
  it every other day, after removing that previously used,
  and washing the floor. Each goose should have a compartment
  two feet and a half square for laying and sitting,
  as she will always lay where she deposited her first egg.
  The house must be well ventilated. All damp must be
  avoided. A pigsty makes a capital pen. Although a
  pond is an advantage, they do not require more than a
  large trough or tank to bathe in.</p>
<p>For breeding not more than four geese should be kept to
  one gander. Their breeding powers continue to more than
  twenty years old. It is often difficult to distinguish the
  sexes, no one sign being infallible except close examination.
  The goose lays early in a mild spring, or in an ordinary
  season, if fed high throughout the winter with corn, and on
  the commencement of the breeding season on boiled barley,
  malt, fresh grains, and fine pollard mixed up with ale, or
  other stimulants; by which two broods may be obtained in
  a year. The common goose lays from nine to seventeen
  eggs, usually about thirteen, and generally carries straws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> about previously to laying. Thirteen eggs are quite enough
  for the largest goose to sit on. They sit from thirty to
  thirty-five days. March or early April is the best period
  for hatching, and the geese should therefore begin to sit in
  February or early March; for goslings hatched at any
  time after April are difficult to rear. Food and water
  should be placed near to her, for she sits closely. She
  ought to leave her nest daily and take a bath in a neighbouring
  pond. The gander is very attentive, and sits by
  her, and is vigilant and daring in her defence. When her
  eggs are placed under a common hen they should be
  sprinkled with water daily or every other day, for the
  moisture of the goose's breast is beneficial to them. (See <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.) A turkey is an excellent mother for goslings.</p>
<p>She should be cooped for a few days on a dry grass-plot
  or meadow, with grain and water by her, of which the
  goslings will eat; and they should also be supplied with
  chopped cabbage or beet leaves, or other green food. They
  must have a dry bed under cover and be protected from
  rats. Their only dangers are heavy rains, damp floors,
  and vermin; and they require but little care for the first
  fortnight; while the old birds are singularly free from
  maladies of all kinds common to poultry. When a fortnight
  old they may be allowed to go abroad with their
  mother and frequent the pond. &quot;It has been formerly
  recommended,&quot; says Mowbray, &quot;to keep the newly-hatched
  gulls in house during a week, lest they get cramp from
  the damp earth; but we did not find this indoor confinement
  necessary; penning the goose and her brood between
  four hurdles upon a piece of dry grass well sheltered,
  putting them out late in the morning, or not at all in
  severe weather, and ever taking them in early in the evening.
  Sometimes we have pitched double the number of
  hurdles, for the convenience of two broods, there being no
  quarrels among this sociable and harmless part of the
  feathered race. We did not even find it necessary to interpose
  a parting hurdle, which, on occasion, may be always
  conveniently done. For the first range a convenient field
  containing water is to be preferred to an extensive common,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> over which the gulls or goslings are dragged by the goose,
  until they become cramped or tired, some of them squatting
  down and remaining behind at evening.&quot; All the hemlock
  or deadly nightshade within range should be destroyed.
  When the corn is garnered the young geese may be turned
  into the stubble which they will thoroughly glean, and
  many of them will be in fine condition by Michaelmas.
  Green geese are young geese fattened at about the age of
  four months, usually on oatmeal and peas, mixed with
  skim-milk or butter-milk, or upon oats or other grain, and
  are very delicate. In fattening geese for Christmas give
  oats mixed with water for the first fortnight, and afterwards
  barley-meal made into a crumbling porridge. They
  should be allowed to bathe for a few hours before being
  killed, for they are then plucked more easily and the
  feathers are in better condition. Their feathers, down,
  and quills are very valuable.</p>
<p>Geese are very destructive to all garden and farm crops,
  as well as young trees, and must therefore be carefully
  kept out of orchards and plantations. Their dung, though
  acrid and apt to injure at first, will, when it is mellowed,
  much enrich the ground.</p>
<p>The Toulouse or Grey Goose is very large, of uniform
  grey plumage, with long neck, having a kind of dewlap
  under the throat; the abdominal pouch very much developed,
  almost touching the ground; short legs; flat feet;
  short, broad tail; and very upright carriage, almost like a
  penguin. The Toulouse lays a large number of eggs, sometimes
  as many as thirty, and even more, but rarely wishes
  to sit, and is a very bad mother.</p>
<p>The Emden or pure White is very scarce. The bill is
  flesh-colour, and the legs and feet orange. They require a
  pond. The Toulouse, crossed with the large white or dark-coloured
  common breed, produces greater weight than
  either, and the objection to the former as indifferent sitters
  and mothers is avoided; but is not desirable for breeding
  stock, and must have a pond like the White.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>DISEASES.</h3>
<p>It is more economical to kill at once rather than attempt to cure common
  fowls showing symptoms of any troublesome disease, and so save trouble,
  loss of their carcases, and the risk of infection. But if the fowls are
  favourites, or valuable, it may be desirable to use every means of cure.</p>
<p>See to a sick fowl at once; prompt attention may prevent serious illness,
  and loss of the bird. When a fowl's plumage is seen to be bristled up and
  disordered, and its wings hanging or dragging, it should be at once removed
  from the others, and looked to. Pale and livid combs are as certain a sign
  of bad health in fowls, as the paleness or lividness of the lips is in human
  beings. Every large establishment should have a warm, properly ventilated,
  and well-lighted house, comfortably littered down with clean straw,
  to be used as a hospital, and every fowl should be removed to it upon
  showing any symptoms of illness, even if the disease is not infectious, for
  sick fowls are often pecked at, ill treated, and disliked by their healthy
  companions. Bear in mind that prevention is better than cure, and that
  proper management and housing, good feeding, pure water and greens,
  cleanliness and exercise, will prevent all, or nearly all, these diseases.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apoplexy</span> arises from over-feeding, and can seldom be treated in time to
  be of service. The only remedy is bleeding, by opening the large vein
  under the wing, and pouring cold water on the head for a few minutes.
  Open the vein with a lancet, or if that is not at hand, with a sharp-pointed
  penknife; make the incision lengthways, not across, and press the
  vein with your thumb between the opening and the body, when the blood
  will flow. If the fowl should recover, feed it on soft, low food for a few
  days, and keep it quiet. It occurs most often in laying hens, which frequently
  die on the nest while ejecting the egg; and is frequently caused by
  too much of very stimulating food, such as hempseed, or improper diet of
  greaves, and also by giving too much pea or bean meal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hard Crop</span>, or being <span class="smcap">Crop-Bound</span>, is caused by too much food, especially
  of hard grain, being taken into the crop, so that it cannot be softened
  by maceration, and is therefore unable to be passed into the stomach.
  Although the bird has thus too large a supply of food in its crop, the
  stomach becomes empty, and the fowl eats still more food. Sometimes a
  fowl swallows a bone that is too large to pass into the stomach, and being
  kept in the crop forms a kernel, around which fibrous and other hard material
  collects. Mr. Baily says: &quot;Pour plenty of warm water down the throat,
  and loosen the food till it is soft. Then give a tablespoonful of castor-oil,
  or about as much jalap as will lie on a shilling, mixed in butter; make a
  pill of it, and slide it into the crop. The fowl will be well in the morning.
  If the crop still remain hard after this, an operation is the only remedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> The feathers should be picked off the crop in a straight line down the
  middle. Generally speaking, the crop will be found full of grass or hay,
  that has formed a ball or some inconveniently-shaped substance. (I once
  took a piece of carrot three inches long out of a crop.) When the offence
  has been removed, the crop should be washed out with warm water. It
  should then be sewn up with coarse thread, and the suture rubbed with
  grease. Afterwards the outer skin should be served the same. The crop
  and skin must not be sewed together. For three or four days the patient
  should have only gruel; no hard food for a fortnight.&quot; The slit should be
  made in the upper part of the crop, and just large enough to admit a blunt
  instrument, with which you must gently remove the hardened mass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Diarrh&oelig;a</span> is caused by exposure to much cold and wet, reaction after
  constipation from having had too little green food, unwholesome food, and
  dirt. Feed on warm barley-meal, or oatmeal mashed with a little warm
  ale, and some but not very much green food, and give five grains of powdered
  chalk, one grain of opium, and one grain of powdered ipecacuanha
  twice a day till the looseness is checked. Boiled rice, with a little chalk
  and cayenne pepper mixed, will also check the complaint. When the evacuations
  are coloured with blood, the diarrh&oelig;a has become dysentery, and
  cure is very doubtful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gapes</span>, a frequent yawning or gaping, is caused by worms in the windpipe,
  which may be removed by introducing a feather, stripped to within an
  inch of the point, into the windpipe, turning it round quickly, and then
  drawing it out, when the parasites will be found adhering with slime upon
  it; but if this be not quickly and skilfully done, and with some knowledge
  of the anatomy of the parts touched, the bird may be killed instead of
  cured. Another remedy is to put the fowl into a box, placing in it at the
  same time a sponge dipped in spirits of turpentine on a hot water plate filled
  with boiling water, and repeating this for three or four days. Some persons
  recommend, as a certain cure in a few days, half a teaspoonful of spirits of
  turpentine mixed with a handful of grain, giving that quantity to two dozen
  of chickens each day. A pinch of salt put as far back into the mouth as possible
  is also said to be effectual.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Leg_Weakness">Leg Weakness</a></span>, shown by the bird resting on the first joint, is generally
  caused by the size and weight of the body being too great for the strength
  of the legs; and this being entirely the result of weakness, the remedy is to
  give strength by tonics and more nourishing food. The quality should be
  improved, but the quantity must not be increased, as the disease has been
  caused by over-feeding having produced too much weight for the strength
  of the legs. Frequent bathing in cold water is very beneficial. This is
  best effected by tying a towel round the fowl, and suspending it over a pail
  of water, with the legs only immersed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Loss of Feathers</span> is almost always caused by want of green food, or dust-heap
  for cleansing. Let the fowls have both, and remove them to a grass
  run if possible. But nothing will restore the feathers till the next moult.
  Fowls, when too closely housed or not well supplied with green food and
  lime, sometimes eat each other's feathers, destroying the plumage till the
  next moult. In such cases green food and mortar rubbish should be supplied,
  exercise allowed, the injured fowl should be removed to a separate
  place, and the pecked parts rubbed over with sulphur ointment. Cut or
  broken feathers should be pulled out at once.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pip</span>, a dry scale on the tongue, is not a disease, but the symptom of some
  disease, being only analogous to &quot;a foul tongue&quot; in human beings. Do not
  scrape the tongue, nor cut off the tip, but cure the roup, diarrh&oelig;a, bad
  digestion, gapes, or whatever the disease may be, and the pip will disappear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Roup</span> is caused by exposure to excessive wet or very cold winds. It
  begins with a slight hoarseness and catching of the breath as if from cold,
  and terminates in an offensive discharge from the nostrils, froth in the
  corners of the eyes, and swollen lids. It is very contagious. Separate the
  fowl from the others, keep it warm, add some &quot;Douglass Mixture&quot; (see
  &quot;<a href="#Moulting.">Moulting</a>&quot;) to its water daily, wash its head once or twice daily with tepid
  water, feed it with meal, only mixed with hot ale instead of water, and
  plenty of green food. Mr. Wright advises half a grain of cayenne pepper
  with half a grain of powdered allspice in a bolus of the meal, or one of Baily's roup pills to be given daily. Mr. Tegetmeier recommends one grain
  of sulphate of copper daily. Another advises a spoonful of castor-oil at
  once, and a few hours afterwards one of Baily's roup pills, and to take the
  scale off the tongue, which can easily be done by holding the beak open with
  your left hand, and removing the scale with the thumbnail of your right
  hand; with a pill every morning for a week. If not almost well in a week
  it will be better to kill it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Thrush</span> may be cured by washing the tongue and mouth with borax
  dissolved in tincture of myrrh and water.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Paralysis</span> generally affects the legs and renders the fowl unable to move.
  It is chiefly caused by over-stimulating food. There is no known remedy
  for this disease, and the fowl seldom if ever recovers. Although chiefly
  affecting the legs of fowls, it is quite a different disease from <span class="smcap"> <a href="#Leg_Weakness">Leg
  Weakness</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vertigo</span> results from too great a flow of blood to the head, and is generally
  caused by over-feeding. Pouring cold water upon the fowl's head, or
  holding it under a tap for a few minutes, will check this complaint, and the
  bird should then be purged by a dose of castor-oil or six grains of jalap.</p>
<h3><a name="Moulting." id="Moulting."><span class="smcap">Moulting</span>.</a></h3>
<p>All birds, but especially old fowls, require more warmth and more
  nourishing diet during this drain upon their system, and should roost in a
  warm, sheltered, and properly-ventilated house, free from all draught. Do
  not let them out early in the morning, if the weather is chilly, but feed them
  under cover, and give them every morning warm, soft food, such as bread
  and ale, oatmeal and milk, potatoes mashed up in pot-liquor, with a little
  pepper and a little boiled meat, as liver, &amp;c., cut small, and a little hempseed
  with their grain at night. Give them in their water some iron or
  &quot;Douglass Mixture,&quot; which consists of one ounce of sulphate of iron and
  one drachm of sulphuric acid dissolved in one quart of water; a teaspoonful
  of the mixture is to be added to each pint of drinking water. This
  chalybeate is an excellent tonic for weakly young chickens, and young birds
  that are disposed to outgrow their strength. It increases their appetite,
  improves the health, imparts strength, brightens the colour of the comb,
  and increases the stamina of the birds. When chickens droop and seem to
  suffer as the feathers on the head grow, give them once a day meat minced
  fine and a little canary-seed.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
