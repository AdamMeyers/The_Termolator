The Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts

A SERIES OF BOOKS FOR BOYS

By Capt. Alan Douglas, Scout-master
                                          


The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol

Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer Chenowith, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.


Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good

This tale presents many stirring situations in which the boys are called upon to
exercise ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with healthful excitement.


Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot

Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.


Fast Nine; or, a Challenge from Fairfield

They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a stirring
narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.


Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop

After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.


Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day

Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most ardent
admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.


Under Canvas; or, The Hunt for the Cartaret Ghost

It was hard to disbelieve the evidence of their eyes but the boys by the
exercise of common-sense solved a mystery which had long puzzled older heads.


Storm-bound; or, a Vacation Among the Snow Drifts

The boys start out on the wrong track, but their scout training comes to the
rescue and their experience proves beneficial to all concerned.

THE HICKORY RIDGE BOY SCOUTS




GREAT HIKE;

OR,

THE PRIDE OF THE KHAKI TROOP.




CHAPTER I.

THE TALK IN AN APPLE TREE.


A number of active boys were perched high among the
heavily laden branches of a big fall pippin apple tree, back
of the old Philander Smith house, located just outside the
limits of the thriving town of Hickory Ridge.

"Take care, Landy!" called out Chatz Maxfield, whose
soft, mellow voice told of his Southern birth; "that long
ladder might chance to slip, suh, and it would be a long ways
to the ground!"

"Oh, shucks! I've got the upper end wedged fast in the
crotch along the outside of this limb, Chatz. And believe
me, I'm getting my basket full of the biggest yellow pippins
you ever saw. Who cares for expenses, anyhow?"

Landy, whose father owned the property, was very much
inclined to be fat; though he would never admit the fact;
and was forever declaring he had a new method of exercise
that would reduce him to a "living skeleton," sooner or
later.

Besides Chatz Maxfield, whose real name, of course, was
Charles, the busy bees in the tree who were assisting their
chum pick the ripe apples on this late August day consisted
of three fellows, all members of the Hickory Ridge[18]
troop of Boy Scouts; and well known to every lad who has
read the preceding volumes in this series.

First there was Ty Collins. Every boy in town would
know Ty as far away as they could see him; for, when not
going to school, winter and summer he clung to an old red
sweater that he seemed to love above all the garments he
possessed.

Then came a small fellow, Jasper Merriweather by name,
whose one ambition it was to get out of the "runt" class.
Jasper was never weary of asking some one to take his
measure, and compare it with past records; but thus far he
had not made much progress toward reaching the ordinary
height of a lad of fifteen. Still, he clung to hope and tried
to fill his position as Number Four in the Beaver Patrol, to
the best of his ability.

Last of all, but by no means least, was Ted Burgoyne.
Ted had the misfortune to lisp when he grew the least bit
excited; though no one ever knew him to acknowledge the
fact, and indeed, if accused, he would grow very indignant,
even while others could catch the fatal slip in his warm
denial.

They called him "Dr. Ted," for the very good reason
that he had his heart set on medicine and surgery, and often
found himself in great demand to practice on his fellow
scouts. Outside of a few rather wild theories, and a boy-like
desire to have a little fun out of things, Ted was quite
practical. He was held much in respect by the twenty odd
boys constituting the khaki troop.

The Hickory Ridge troop had passed the experimental
stage of progress, and had become an established fact. Three
patrols, of eight boys each, were complete, and there
were candidates to start a fourth, if they could meet the requirements
and feel capable of subscribing to the twelve[19]
cardinal principles that every true scout has to try to live
up to.

Lately a rival troop had sprung up in Fairfield, led by
one Matt Tubbs. Formerly Matt had only been known as
a great bully, and those who trained with him had served
under his banner simply through fear, without a grain of
respect.

But Matt had, strange to say, seen a great light. He had
watched the boys of the khaki troop in their open-air tests.
Something in the business seemed to appeal strongly to him;
and then had come the determination to start a troop in his
town.

Of course he ran up against a snag in the beginning, for
no boy with the loose principles Matt held at that time
could ever be accepted as a scout. He studied the matter,
watched the Hickory Ridge lads some more, and then came
the great awakening.

And now Matt Tubbs was on the right road. He
controlled his followers just as thoroughly as before, but
generally in a different manner. They respected him too.
Still, once in a while the old spirit cropped out; and it was
told how, when one of his cronies, thinking to take advantage
of this new mantle of meekness, boldly challenged Matt
to a fight, the new leader of the Fairfield troop gave him
the best kind of a whipping; after which he helped bind up
his scratches, and stop the flow of blood from his nose.

But the insurrection had been nipped in the bud: and
they did say that Matt tried to atone for his breaking of
the rules of the organization by being unusually patient
with those under him who had difficulty in keeping up with
the reform pace he set.

It was pretty generally understood all through the region
that Matt Tubbs might never have started to climb the[20]
ladder only for the boyish sympathy which he received from
Elmer Chenowith, the leader of the Hickory Ridge troop,
and assistant to the scout master, Mr. Garrabrant.

And the reformation of the worst boy in Fairfield and
Cramertown long astonished the good people of those communities.
When they awakened to the truth that it was no
myth, but apparently an accomplished fact, they were
quick to give most of the credit to the discipline of the new
organization.

And the Fairfield troop from that time on had never
lacked for backing from the parents of those boys connected
with the same.

The fellows in the apple tree had been talking about these
things as they helped Landy pick the fruit, a task that had
been set for him by his father, and which must be fulfilled
ere he could get off for play that day.

Of course they also discussed the great baseball game
that had recently been played between the rival troops, in
which Hickory Ridge came out victor, after a very strenuous
afternoon's work.

"The way Lil Artha circles the bases gets me," declared
Ty Collins, as he munched on a particularly fine specimen
of fruit he had struck, and which tempted him beyond his
capacity to decline, though it was possibly the seventh he
had eaten within the hour.

"Oh, I don't know," remarked Ted, swinging his legs
from the limb he straddled. "Most persons theem to think
there's no one tho fatht as Lil Artha. Now, I admit in the
thtart that he can cover the ground at a pretty rapid rate;
but nobody knowth jutht how long he could hold out on a
long hike. I've got my own ideath on that thubject, fellows."

"Sure you have, and so have a lot of others in the troop,
suh," declared Chatz. "Might I ask who you think would[21]
have the best chance in an endurance hike that would last,
say for twenty-four hours straight?"

"Why, Elmer would, for a thtarter," replied the other,
quickly; "and if that ain't enough, what'th the matter with
Ty Collinth himthelf? Theemth to me you'd hold out, and
give long-legged Lil Artha a run for hith money."

"Me for Matty Eggleston!" declared Jasper, eagerly;
for the boy in question was leader of the patrol to which
Jasper belonged, and in his eyes seemed a marvel second
only to Elmer himself.

"If Lil Artha fell down on the long run, I kind of think
Red Huggins might pull in a victor," Ty went on. "That
fellow is just chock-full of grit. When he shuts his teeth,
and starts in, there's no telling where he'll stop."

"How about George Robbinth, your couthin, Matty?"
asked Ted. "I've theen him walk half a dozen fellowth
until they admitted they weren't in the thame clath? Perhaps
now he might have a chance to win in a long tetht."

"Oh, George is a good one, all right," declared Landy.
"Our family is noted for producing marvels. You just
wait a little while longer, till I trim my weight down a few
more pounds, and I'll show you something worth while.
Huh, if there was a long-distance hike right now, d'ye know
I'd be strongly tempted to enter. You never can tell. Appearances
are sometimes mighty deceiving, boys."

"There's another swift one in our bunch, fellows," called
out little Jasper, who never could hope to enter any of these
competitions until Nature was kinder to him, and began to
add a few inches to his stature.

"Who's that, Jasper?" demanded Ty, perched high up
in the immense tree, and lowering his basket when filled
with an ingenious tackle he had contrived so that he need
not climb down with a bulky load; though twice he had[22]
managed to upset the whole picking, to the disgust of
Landy who feared the apples would be too badly bruised to
find a market, as his father intended.

"What d'ye say to Jack Armitage?" the small scout
went on. "Ever seen him get around and steal bases, no
matter what the catcher was doing? He's a screamer, that's
what! But of course I ain't sure how Jack would hold out
on a twenty-four-hour walk. He's full of staying power
though, and might surprise some fellows who have been
reckoned at the top of the heap."

"Well, you fellows have about put all the available candidates
on the list," declared Ty, laughing because he himself
figured in the same. "Elmer is out of the running because
he got a thorn in his foot a day or two ago, and is limping
to beat the band. His best chum, Mark Cummings, might
enter, but it happens he's out of town and may not be back
for a week. But what's all this talk going to amount to,
anyhow?"

"We ought to have thith important question thettled,
boyth!" declared Ted.

"There's been a heap of hot air circulating for a month
past about who is the best all-round walker in the troop,"
remarked Jasper; "and seems to me that matter ought to
be threshed out, once and for all!"

"Hurrah, that's the talk, Jasper!" cried Chatz, throwing
an apple at the other.

"Bully boy!" called Ty. "Go on and make a suggestion,
Jasper. You've got something in your noodle
after all. Keep it up, my boy, and success to you."

"That's right, Jasper," said Landy, stretching around
to pick several tempting yellow beauties that seemed just beyond
the reach of his rather short arm. "Tell us what
you've been thinking about. Is it a big hike for the best[23]
walkers and runners of the celebrated Hickory Ridge
troop?"

Jasper swelled with importance. It was not often he
found himself in the lime light, and his opinion in demand.
The experience seemed delightful, and he was not in too
great a hurry to satisfy the demand for information; since
once they had his views the discussion must become general,
and he would only stand on an equal footing with the rest.

"Well, to tell the truth I was thinking about suggesting
a great hike, with, say a limit of half a dozen fellows connected
with the troop as contestants. Perhaps you noticed
that I mentioned a twenty-four-hour consecutive tramp as
the basis of the test. Each fellow could be bound by a
solemn promise not to accept a lift on the way, under
penalty of displacement. And several others, like Elmer
for instance, might keep tabs on the bunch by following
them on their wheels."

"Listen to him, will you? Hasn't Jasper got it down
pat?" cried Landy, again exerting himself to the utmost
to gather in another lot of unusually tempting pippins.

"He's going to fill a long-felt want," declared Chatz.
"We need an organizer, some one who could take the responsibility
of fixing up these meets from the over-burdened
shoulders of Elmer. And, suh, I suspect Jasper is going to
develop into a master of ceremonies."

"Then you rather like the idea, fellows?" asked the
small scout, pleased beyond measure.

"It's just the thing," declared Ty.

"We'll take the thame up at wunth, and have the affair
arranged in a jiffy," Ted announced.

"Hey, take care there, Landy, your ladder's slipping!
Quick, grab hold of something, or you're a goner!" shouted
Ty, suddenly.[24]

Landy tried to wriggle himself back again, but his stretch
had been fatal to all chances for maintaining his position.
The top of the long ladder lost its grip in the swaying
crotch and slid from under him. There was a rattle of
apples thudding down on the ground twenty feet below;
but Landy had, on the spur of the moment, seized hold of the
outer branches, so that there he hung, swinging back and
forth; afraid to let go, and yet incapable of long maintaining
his frantic grip.



[25]
CHAPTER II.

JASPER'S IDEA TAKES ROOT.


"Hoop-la, somebody grab me before I drop!" shouted
Landy, as he kept trying to get a grip with his fat legs on
the foliage of the outer branches which seemed to take particular
delight in evading his ambitious designs.

"Get a feather bed under him!" shrieked Ty, although
at the same time he was changing his position in the tree
with all possible haste, meaning to assist the clinging boy,
if it could possibly be done.

"Oh, save me first, and joke about it afterward!" cried
Landy, who was really alarmed and under a tremendous
strain, both bodily and mentally.

"If I only had a rope with a loop in it, I could lasso
him!" declared Jasper.

"But you haven't, you see," cried Landy. "Think up
something else! Hurry along, boys; I can't hold out much
longer. I'm no Elmer as a gymnast. I'm slipping right
now, I tell you. Wow! Is that measly old ladder under me,
and will I come down with a splash on it?"

He panted as he uttered this complaint, and the boys saw
that his face resembled the setting sun, as he looked up to
them almost piteously. But who could reach him there?
On the very outer edge of the big tree, with the ground
fully twenty feet below, and nothing to break his fall, it
began to look like a serious business for poor Landy.

Dr. Ted realized that there was real danger of the boy
getting a broken leg if he fell that distance. Landy was not[26]
like agile Lil Artha, or some other members of the troop.
His weight made him solid, and being without any spring,
he would likely come down with a dull, sickening thud.

"Hold on as long as you can, Landy!" yelled Ted, even
neglecting to lisp in his great excitement.

He was slipping down the tree like a "greased pig," as
Jasper termed it, though what that sort of animal would be
doing up in an apple tree he never took the trouble to explain.

Ty saw what the idea was. He had been about to try and
reach Landy by standing far out on a limb; but the prospect
of success was very small. And so he followed Ted
down the tree, slipping from limb to limb with the agility
that some boys can only display when the owner of the orchard
is seen coming on the full run with a ferocious bulldog
at his heels.

"Oh, hurry! hurry! I'm near gone, and can't hold out
much longer! What're you doing down there to help me,
boys?" wailed the one whose legs swung back and forth
like a couple of pendulums, as they vainly sought for a
chance to grip something that would ease the strain on his
arms above.

"The ladder! They've gone to set it up again, Landy!
Just hold on half a minute longer. And there's Elmer
jumped off his bicycle; and he's already raising it up. Set
your teeth, Landy; take a fresh grip, and it's going to be all
right!"

So the excited Jasper shouted as he sat there in the tree,
unable to lend a helping hand, but at least capable of offering
good advice.

A boy who had been coming toward the place on a wheel,
seeing the state of affairs, had instantly sized up the situation;
and even while those in the tree were shouting back[27]
and forth, and before they could get started, Elmer Chenowith,
jumping from his saddle, had limped forward to
where the unlucky ladder lay.

By the time Ted, followed by Ty, landed on the ground,
he had raised it single-handed, and with a readiness that
told of long familiarity with ladders; for one not accustomed
to such things would never know the secret of bracing
the bottom against some root and then lifting rapidly.

So just in the nick of time the treacherous ladder was
dropped against the outer branches of the tree, alongside
the hanging boy. Elmer himself flew up the rounds, for he
feared that Landy, always more or less clumsy, might not
be able to swing his form around, and take advantage of the
opening.

But desperation gave Landy new abilities, and he managed
by a violent effort to roll around to the outer side of the
leaning ladder. Utterly exhausted by the strain he had
been under, the fat boy must have slipped helplessly down
only that Elmer managed to clutch him.

Step by step the gasping Landy was lowered until he
reached the bottom round. He was no longer furiously red,
but had turned a sickly white.

"Here, let him down on the ground," said Dr. Ted, taking
command at that point as though it were his acknowledged
right. "He's only getting the reaction now.
I'll fix him up, boys, and he'll be picking apples again before
ten minutes, believe me."

He was as good as his word, for Landy soon recovered;
but it was noticed that from that moment the fat boy showed
great caution how he climbed up that ladder, by which he
had once been betrayed.

"What was all that talk going on as I passed?" asked
Elmer, a bright, wide-awake young fellow, whose year out[28]
on a Canadian ranch belonging to an uncle was proving of
considerable value to him in his experience as a scout.

"What did you hear?" asked Jasper, assuming a little
of his former importance.

"Seemed to me it smacked of a contest," Elmer replied,
"and somebody was telling how a few of us could keep tabs
on the same, while using our wheels. That struck me as
interesting, and so, wanting to know more, I just wheeled
around, and was coming in through the back gate to the
garden when the ladder fell. Now tell me the rest, fellows,
because you all know that I'm head over ears interested in
anything that touches on contests of any sort."

"Well," spoke up Ty, grinning; "somehow we got to
talking about who the best all-round walker and runner in
the troop might be. A lot of names were mentioned, including
my own. Then there were Red, Lil Artha, Matty,
George Robbins and Jack Armitage. Even Landy here
threatened to enter for the big hike."

"But what was the idea?" asked Elmer, his face aglow
with interest.

"To fix up a long-distance hike, say for twenty-four consecutive
hours; and a few fellows, mounted on their wheels,
kind of superintend things by keeping tabs along the line.
The contestant coming in ahead at the end of the walk
to be declared the pride of the troop, and the greatest
ever."

Jasper rattled all this off with a fluency that told how
he had indeed been deliberating over the scheme for some
little time, and only sprang it on his chums now because
the talk had gotten around to the subject.

"How's that strike you, Elmer?" asked Ty.

"Yeth, give uth your opinion, Mr. Thcoutmaster!"
echoed Ted.[29]

"Boys, it's just dandy, and that's a fact!" declared
Elmer. "We can make up the arrangements to-night, if
you'll all come around to my house. I'll get a lot of the
other boys on the phone. I was thinking this morning that
we ought to have a meeting about now, anyway, for there
are a lot of matters that need attention."

"Then if you say so, it will be a go," declared Jasper,
highly pleased because his little scheme had met with such
instant approval at the hands of one in whom he placed the
utmost confidence.

"Sure to be, Jasper," came the reply. "And it does you
great credit too. Some of us were wondering what we might
do to stir things up a little. With school opening just two
weeks off, we want to make the most of the few days left of
our vacation. Now this big hike will be just the thing."

"Besides, you see, Elmer," the small scout continued,
eagerly, "it's going to settle a dispute between the lot
of us here. Some think one fellow is going to have a walkover,
and others hold different opinions. Of course we all
know you're bound to be shut out, on account of that sore
foot of yours. And as Mark is out of town, he can't enter
the game either. But we think the six fellows we picked
out ought to make things lively enough to suit anybody."

"They will, for a fact," replied Elmer. "Of course I
pin my faith on Lil Artha, but I may be mistaken just as
well as any one of you. But I must be going, fellows, as I
was on an errand, and just ran around here to see how you
were getting on. Better not try those gymnastics again,
Landy. That was an ugly scrape for even an acrobat, let
alone a fellow as chunky as you are."

"Elmer, never again," said the fat boy, solemnly, as he
slowly shook his head. "I'll be sore for a week after that
job. My arms feel right now like they'd been nearly pulled[30]
out of their sockets. Gee, but nobody can understand just
how it feels to be hanging twenty feet up, on the outside
branches of a tree, and slowly slipping, slipping! And I
lost a basket of the biggest pippins you ever saw; every one
a prize winner, but now all bruised and wasted!"

"You'd have been the biggest squashed pippin of the lot
if you went down that time," sang out Ty from the top
of the tree.

"Now that's real cruel of you, Ty," complained Landy;
but he did not take the jibes of his comrades much to heart,
for he was fond of a joke himself.

"Remember, every one of you drop around to-night,"
said Elmer, as he picked up his wheel, which he had hastily
thrown aside at the moment he discovered how necessary
prompt action was required in order to save Landy.

"Any chance of striking some of that delightful sponge
cake your housekeeper makes to beat the Dutch?" asked
Landy, who had never forgotten the treat set before the
scouts the last time some of them were invited around to
Elmer's home.

"Seems to me Mrs. Gregg was making a big batch this
very morning when I left home," called back Elmer; just
as if he hadn't asked her to do the same, since he intended
having the boys in khaki there that night.

"Then count me in," declared the fat boy, firmly; "even
if my arms are so sore I'll have to ask somebody to raise the
cake to my mouth. Yum, yum; that was the finest thing
that ever came down the pike, barring none! And you tell
her that, Elmer, with my compliments."

"All right, I will," sang out the departing one, as he
passed out of the rear gate, mounted on his wheel and riding
as one to the manner born.

The apple picking went on, with the heap at the base[31]
of the tree growing in size as basket after basket was added
to it. And the conversation between the five lads covered a
great variety of subjects as they stripped the big tree of its
golden freight.

"What makes me sore," remarked Landy with a big
sigh, "is the fact that I upset the basket that held the
finest apples going. You see, my dad expected to show some
of these at the fair next week, if they turned out as well
as they looked from the ground. And I was just saying to
myself that I had the beauts, when the silly old ladder
went back on poor little Philander."

"Don't weep, old chap," called out Ty. "If you look
over that last lot I sent down on my little cable here, you'll
find them the mates of the ones you dropped. And for a
wonder, too, I got that basket down safe without an upset."

"Thanks, you make me happy again, Ty," remarked
Landy. "And for that you'll be remembered in my last
will."

"Huh!" grunted Jasper; "he deserves a heap of credit
for letting all those fine pippins get past him; because he
acted like he meant to gobble every extra good one that
came along. I've counted about a dozen he's got away
with up to now; and I think even at that he's just taken the
edge off his appetite."

"Well, in that case I'll get down and pick out a basket
from the pile to take in the house, before Ty starts at full
speed," and Landy did actually head for the ground to put
his threat into execution.

So they kept up a crossfire of remarks, sometimes more
or less witty, until the last apple that could be reached was
bagged. Then the game was declared off, and Landy invited
his chums in to help dispose of a quart of peanuts he
happened to have in his room.[32]

"We'll all be around to-night at Elmer's house, I suppose?"
remarked Ty as, with Ted, Jasper and Chatz, he
started for the door.

"Count on me, if I have to be carried on a stretcher,"
vowed Landy, laughing at the speaker, as he recalled to
mind the attractive lure that had been held out for their
attendance.

"And I'm anxious to have this thing put through," declared
Jasper; "because, you see, it was partly my suggestion;
and besides, I've got a hunch that the Fairfield
troop are figuring on a long hike, to try out their best fellows.
I'd like to see our Lil Artha or Matty Eggleston up
against the best they have. It'd be a hike worth hearing
about, believe me, fellows."

"And perhaps we can fix up a match; I'm going to mention
the thing to Elmer, anyhow," remarked Chatz, who
really had no small nature, and could see one of his comrades
winning laurels without showing the slightest envy.

And talking it over earnestly, they left Landy, heading
for their various homes.



[33]
CHAPTER III.

AS THE CLOCK IN THE TOWER BOOMED SIX.


It lacked but ten minutes of six.

The sun had been up for about half an hour and there
was every promise of a fine August day. Possibly, before
the shades of evening fell, the heat of the dog days might
prove more or less exhausting; but at that early hour the
outlook was all that could be asked.

Around the old church with the belfry, fully half the
young people of Hickory Ridge seemed to have congregated.
Girls were there as well as boys; for what with the sisters
of the scouts, as well as all the other fellows' sisters, the
starting of what promised to be the greatest hike on record
among the lads of the new organization was an event that
could not be missed.

Of course, besides the six contestants, there were numerous
other khaki-clad members of the various patrols. Each
fellow was, as a rule, the center of a questioning group and
felt compelled to supply all the information in his power.

Mr. Garrabrant, the young man who served so faithfully
as scout master to the troop, was talking to the boys who expected
to participate in the long tramp. He encouraged
them, and at the same time laid down the law in plain
language.

No one was to accept any kind of a ride while on the hike;
even if only for a short space, it would invalidate all his
rights to be considered in the contest. And of course[34]
each fellow gave his solemn word of honor to abide faithfully
by the rules, a copy of which had been given to him.

The conditions were simple enough; Mr. Garrabrant had
arranged with the scout master of the troop of Boy Scouts
in Little Falls, and each of the rival contestants was supplied
with a letter of greeting, which they were to hand to
that gentleman upon arriving at the headquarters in Little
Falls. This town being some forty-seven miles away from
Hickory Ridge, as the crow flies, it can be seen that a herculean
task awaited the boys, in order to cover this distance
inside of the twenty-four hours.

What added spice to the game was the fact that it was
known there were to be several fellows who meant to leave
Fairfield at exactly the same hour, and under similar conditions.
And the spirit of Hickory Ridge was aroused in
civic pride. They yearned to win out over all competitors,
just as they had done in that wonderful baseball game only
a short time before.

Elsie Craig, one of the prettiest girls in the whole town,
and who was particularly fond of Elmer, waylaid Landy as
he was changing his position, meaning, to get closer to the
group where the six who had entered for the race were
making ready for the start.

"Oh, please wait a couple of minutes, Landy!" she
exclaimed, with an entreating smile on her winsome face.

Landy, much as he wanted to get where he could hear the
last instructions given to the half dozen scouts before they
started, could not resist this plea. Truth to tell, Landy was
a little "soft" himself when it came to a certain girl, and
Elsie happened to be her chum.

"All right, Elsie," he remarked, as he came to a halt,
though looking longingly toward the excited group about
Mr. Garrabrant. "What can I do for you?"[35]

"I want to know, that's all. Elmer is so busy he just
can't spend one little minute talking to me," she replied
with a pout.

"Why, you see, he just has to do his duty as the assistant
scout master," declared Landy, actually wincing
when the girl rested a hand on one of his sore arms. "But
I was at the meeting where all the particulars were decided
on, and perhaps I might be able to tell you what you
want to know, Elsie."

"First of all, do the boys only walk and not run?" she
asked, eagerly.

"This is a hike, and that means a walk, not a Marathon
race. So every fellow is put on his honor not to run," replied
Landy.

"But I should think Arthur Stansbury had all the advantage,
because he can take such big steps," observed the
girl, frowning a little, as though Lil Artha had never been
a very great favorite of hers.

Landy laughed with the air of one who knows all the ins
and outs of walking matches.

"Oh, that's nothing to go by, Elsie," he declared, with
a shrug of his shoulders that compelled him to make an immediate
grimace, for the muscles were sore. "Why, it
often happens that some little runt can outstrip a fellow
nearly twice his height. It's endurance that tells in the
long run. The boy who can set his teeth together, and fight
it out to the bitter end. That's what Mr. Garrabrant says,
and all of us athletes understand it."

Elsie smiled, and looked roguishly up and down Landy's
plump form when she heard him mention that word so
proudly. But then, after that experience when the ladder
fell and left him dangling twenty feet from the ground,
Landy really believed he deserved to be classed among the[36]
strenuous ones, even though it might be in an humble capacity.

"And they have to walk all the way to Little Falls before
to-morrow morning; poor fellows, don't I pity them,
though!" the girl went on. "Elmer would have been in
the game too, only for that ugly thorn in his foot. And
don't you think he would surely have won the prize, Landy,
if he had competed?"

"Oh, nearly everyone believes that," replied the fat
boy, readily; "though to tell the truth, there never has
been a hike like this around here before, and we don't just
know who's got the Injun sign on the rest of the bunch.
Between you and me, Elsie, I'm pinning some faith on
George Robbins. You know he's my cousin, and he's got
some of the old Philander Smith stock in him. The record
of my family is a proud one"; and he drew himself up as
he inflated his chest with a pompous air that would have
well become the drum major of the town band.

"To be sure, Landy," remarked the little miss, quickly;
"and it covers a lot of ground, too. Why, even in history
we come across it every now and then. But, Landy, how
will it be known that the six contestants keep to the route
that has been laid out for them? Some one might look up a
map and find a road that would be a short cut. That would
be an unfair advantage."

"Sure it would," remarked the boy; "and it was just to
prevent knowledge and craft from winning when this was
to be a question of speed and endurance, Mr. Garrabrant
says, that made the committee insist on stations along the
way."

"Stations? Whatever do you mean by that?" Elsie
demanded.

"Well, they picked out a number of taverns where one[37]
of the scouts who goes on ahead with Mr. Garrabrant will
establish a register. In that book every fellow in the great
hike is expected to enter his name in his own handwriting,
also the time of his arrival and departure."

"Oh, now I understand; and Landy, that is a clever
idea!" the girl exclaimed. "But Elmer intends setting out
on his wheel later on in the day; will you please tell me
what reason there is for that, Landy?"

"Oh, it was arranged by the committee, that's all.
Several of the fellows will go from time to time. Sort of
keep tabs on the contestants and see how they are getting on.
I expected to be chosen to be one of these inspectors, but I
had a little accident yesterday that knocked me out. But
all the fellows said that the game old Philander Smith spirit
cropped out, and that few boys could have held on up in
that tree as long as I did."

But if sly Landy expected in this manner to lead the
conversation into a personal line, so that he could glorify his
own prowess, he made a mistake. Evidently the pretty
little miss with the golden locks and the blue eyes had no
desire to hear about his wonderful escape.

"How will the six contestants get anything to eat on the
way?" she asked.

"Oh, that's left to them," answered the fat boy, frowning
with disappointment over the failure of his attempt to
rivet her attention on himself. "They can stop and have a
meal at any old tavern; but I reckon most of the fellows
are wise to the fact that they must lose valuable time that
way. I know George has a snack stowed away in his haversack
right now. He's on to all the dodges, you know."

"Why, of course he is, because he is your cousin, Landy.
But suppose one of the poor fellows breaks down? It's a[38]
terrible long trip, and all sorts of things might happen,
don't you think?" Elsie continued.

"Not much danger of that, I guess," Landy answered.
"You see every one of them had to undergo a physical
examination before Mr. Garrabrant would allow them to
enter; and they're all as fit as fiddles. Of course we don't
expect that after they've put, say twenty miles, behind
them they'll be as chipper as they are now. Their feet will
drag more or less; but that's where the grit must show."

"They expect to start all at the same time, then?" asked
the girl.

"Sure, but after a mile or so they'll be likely to separate.
One will believe the pace too warm for the start, and drop
back. You know they say it's a bad thing to urge your
horse early in a long race. All sorts of ideas will prevail,
so that long before the first ten miles have been covered the
six boys may be far apart, and each trudging along to suit
his ideas."

"How much you know about all these things, Landy!"
said Elsie, with a twinkle in her sunny eyes that he failed
to catch; for he again stiffened up with that superior air
that boys are apt to assume when explaining the science of
baseball or some other manly sport to a girl who has never
attended a game before.

"Oh, well, we just have to, you see, if we ever expect
to make good scouts," he replied, thinking that after all
Elsie was even a little prettier than her chum, when she
chose to smile on a fellow that way. "And besides, we
pick up a lot of information from our scout master, and
Elmer, who knows all about woodcraft, because he lived out
on the big plains. But it must be getting near time for the
start, because they're lining up now. Let's push ahead
so we can see what happens."[39]

Despairing of getting away while the persistent little
maid continued to seek information, Landy was now hedging,
and content to carry her along with him as he pushed
through the crowd of talking, laughing spectators.

The clock in the church tower pointed to two minutes of
six. And at the first stroke of the hour they were expected
to be off.

Six boys stood in line, eager and expectant. Their particular
friends called out encouraging words, and there was
a perfect babel of confusion about this time. But Mr.
Garrabrant anticipating such a happening, had spoken
the last words of caution. So that there was now
nothing to be done but wait for the loud boom of the big
clock in the tower.

"Good luck, Lil Artha!"

"Keep that good left foot of yours going right along,
George!"

"Red, we're counting on you to win out, remember!"

"That's Ty Collins on the extreme left; just you watch
his smoke!"

"Take it easy, Matty! You know the rules of the game,
old fellow!"

"Jack, don't you ever come around again unless you
bring that prize with you!"

This last created a roar of laughter, as one of the scouts
imitated the voice of a girl whom everyone knew Jack
Armitage was sweet on.

One minute of six!

Gradually this clamor died down as the critical minute
drew closer and closer. Many eyes were turned upon the
big face of the clock on the side of the square tower of
the church.

"Ready, all!" they heard Mr. Garrabrant call out.[40]

Then came a deathly silence. Everyone craned his or
her neck, and the figures of the six contestants who wore
the khaki garments of the Boy Scouts proved to be the hub
of all glances.

Some of the boys looked grim and determined; others,
like tall Lil Artha, wore confident smiles, as though they
believed in their hearts that it would be an easy snap.
But all were evidently primed to do their level best, no
matter what the final result.

Ah! There was a whirring sound up in the tower. Well
did the boys know that the big clock always emitted this
seeming gasp just before the striking of the hour. Then
came a reverberating boom!

It was time.

"Hurrah!" yelled the crowd, as hats and handkerchiefs
filled the air; "they're off!"

"And may the best man win!" said the smiling scout
master, looking after the fast walking line of contestants.



[41]
CHAPTER IV.

SIGNS OF TROUBLE.


"Look at 'em all in a bunch!" cried one of the watchers;
for the crowd had been particularly requested not to
follow the six walkers or annoy them in the start.

"But with Lil Artha at the head!" called another exultantly.

"But they're all keeping up close with him, even if
Red does have to cover five steps to three by Lil Artha. It
ain't the length of a fellow's legs that counts for everything
in a hike, let me tell you!"

"Shucks! Why, Lil Artha is just playing with 'em,"
laughed another.

"Sure he is; when he feels like it, he'll make a ring
around the rest, and then not be pushed!"

"Oh, he will, eh? Shows how much you know about
these things. Lil Artha may be due to a little surprise
before many hours go past; and it'll be George Robbins
who will do it," said Landy, proudly.

"For he has the true Philander Smith grit," sang another;
at which there was a shout from the rapidly breaking-up
crowd, for this little weakness on the part of the
fat boy was pretty generally known.

Presently a turn in the road shut out the walkers. They
were all going strong when last seen, and Lil Artha even
turned to wave a jaunty farewell to those of his friends
who had wished him success in the great hike.

Elmer and the balance of the scouts gathered together[42]
to talk over matters connected with the affair. A plan of
campaign had been mapped out with almost as much care
as if a battle were impending. Indeed, all sorts of road
maps had been consulted in laying out the course over
which the six contestants were expected to pass. And a
copy of the same, as well as the rules governing their actions,
had been sent over to the Fairfield troop at the earnest
request of the scout master who had lately taken
charge there.

The morning began to wear on.

Some of those who had gathered to watch the start had
come without waiting for breakfast, though the scouts, as
a rule, could not be reckoned in that class, being early
risers. And as the hours went by there was always more
or less excitement around headquarters.

Several fellows had brought their wheels around. These
were the chosen inspectors whose duty it was to sally forth
at certain hours when Elmer gave the word, and pick up
the several contestants along the way, perhaps telephoning
any interesting news connected with them from some convenient
inn where the registers were placed.

Mr. Garrabrant and one of the scouts had gone off in an
auto long ago. They expected to establish the chosen stations
and leave the registers in which each fellow was to
enter the time of his coming and going.

At ten o'clock the first scout on a wheel was sent out.
Another would follow at twelve, and around four Elmer,
as the last inspector, expected to start. He chose to be
last because a fellow who owned a motorcycle had loaned
it to him for the occasion, and thus he had a big advantage
over the others.

When noon came there was a ripple of interest. A
scout had come from the store where the telephone station[43]
happened to be located, and he brought the first news of
the big hike.

All the contestants had made the first station easily,
passing within five minutes of each other. And, strange to
say, it was Lil Artha whose time seemed to be just at the
tail end of the procession. No one could understand it,
and all sorts of speculations began to pass current.

"Got a stone in his shoe and bruised his heel!" one suggested.

"More'n likely he's gone and strained a tendon again;
remember he did that two years ago when he made the
home run that won the game!" another exclaimed.

"Rats!" called out a third, scornfully. "The sly old
fox is only doing that for fun. He's playing with the
other fellows, believe me. When he gets good and ready
he'll pass the bunch, and leave 'em so far behind they'll
forget their names. Oh, I know Lil Artha! Why, he even
took his little camera along. Said he wanted to snap off
a few pictures on the way, just to pass time, when he got
too lonesome."

After a hasty lunch the boys again assembled at the
church, and if anything, in greater numbers than before;
for every fellow in town seemed to be on the spot, anxious
to hear what news might come dribbling in.

Two o'clock came, and with it a running scout from the
store, where several were stationed in order to be ready
to answer the phone.

More news, and of a character to arouse great excitement.
At the second station there was a difference of just thirteen
minutes between the arrival of the leader and the
last contestant. That leader was Lil Artha; and sad to
relate, the tail ender trailed the proud banner of the Philander
Smiths in the dust, for it was no other than George.[44]

"Told you so!" burst out the fellow who had been so
positive about the tall Lil Artha playing tricks. "He's
starting now; and by night time he'll be hull down in the
distance. It's sure a walkover for Lil Artha."

"Reckon you're right, and that it's all over but the
shouting!" declared another, who had been for Red Huggins,
but proved rather weak-kneed in his faith.

Strange how the different natures of boys crop out under
such conditions.

"Huh, it's too early in the game to throw up the sponge
like that, Ben!" declared another fellow, derisively. "All
sorts of things might happen to Lil Artha. You never can
tell about them long-legged fellows. They're apt to double
up like a hinge with cramps or something. Wait and see.
Jack's holding his own with the rest, because he was only
three minutes behind the leader!"

"Next time it'll be half an hour, because Lil Artha has
unlimbered his heavy artillery. Why, I bet you he's going
along like a Weston, right now, and just eating the
miles up."

"Yes, we'll get a message from Little Falls any minute
now telling how he blew in there with his seven-league
boots, and has started back!" mocked another, who apparently
did not love the lanky one any too well.

Meanwhile Elmer was trying to keep his finger on the
pulse of things as well as he could. It was while he was
taking a look at the motorcycle that had been placed at
his disposal, to make sure the tank had a full gallon and
a half of oil aboard, and everything in order for a start,
that he heard the tooting of a horn up the road.

A couple of the scouts chanced to possess motorcycles.
True, they had seen considerable of service, and were
often in a condition far from useful; but then Nat Scott,[45]
whose father was at the head of the schools in Hickory
Ridge, and Toby Jones, had had more or less sport in times
past with the second-hand machines purchased with their
savings.

It was now just five minutes of four, and Elmer expected
to make his start as the hour struck. He knew that he
would have time enough to overtake the leading walker
long before night set in.

Somewhat to his surprise, the boys who were coming
began to shout as soon as they drew near; and he noticed
that both of them seemed very much excited.

Elmer's face paled a trifle. He wondered whether any
accident could have overtaken one of the contestants;
though he could not imagine how such a thing might be.

"Hold on, Elmer, was afraid we wouldn't get here in
time to catch you!" called Nat, as they came along, both
machines popping merrily; though it might be noticed that
they were erratic in their explosions, proving that the spark
could not be doing its full duty.

Of course nothing could have tempted Elmer to hasten
off now. He wanted to hear what these scouts had to say.

And he remembered something just then. Neither Nat
nor Toby had been present to witness the start of the six
who had entered for the race. The scout master had appointed
them, at their earnest request, as a committee to
go over to Fairfield and watch the start of those scouts
in the rival organization, so as to bring back a detailed
account.

Perhaps Mr. Garrabrant, knowing boys as well as he did,
may have secretly suspected that it might pay to have a
couple of wide-awake fellows around Fairfield during the
day to keep their eyes and ears open. He happened to
know that there had arisen a new bully in Fairfield, who[46]
was doing all in his power to assume the reins laid down
by Matt Tubbs at the time he saw a great light and gave
over his evil ways when taking up the attractive scout
movement. And it might be that some of those turbulent
Fairfield fellows would get together and hatch up a scheme
for keeping the Hickory Ridge scouts from winning the
long hike.

All this flashed into the mind of Elmer as he saw Nat
and Toby speeding toward the church and waving their
hands as they shouted.

They came to a stop with something of a dramatic effect,
and leaned their motorcycles up against the wall of the
church. Of course there was a rush on the part of everyone
within sight and hearing of the spot; and already all
sorts of wild theories were circulating, as they will at such
a time.

"What's happened, d'ye think?" one gasped, looking
frightened; for he had a brother in the contest, and his
first fear was that something had happened to him.

"One of the boys must have been badly hurt! Perhaps
they've come for the ambulance to fetch him home!"

"Aw, get out! What's the use talkin' that way, Jim?
However could they get knocked out that way?"

"Besides, ain't Nat and Toby been over at Fairfield all
day under orders? Must be news from that place. Perhaps
Matt Tubbs has gone back to his old ways again and
plans to do our fellows up on the road!"

"Matt Tubbs is all right, and don't you forget it. Here,
quit your pushin', and give a feller a chance to get in near
Elmer!"

Meanwhile Elmer had waited until the two scouts had
saluted, as they had been taught to do when meeting a
superior officer; since respect to authority is one of the[47]
cardinal principles to which the tenderfoot subscribes when
he first joins a patrol.

"Have you just come from Fairfield, Number Four?"
Elmer asked, turning first to Toby, who belonged to the
Wolf Patrol, which was under his own particular care as
patrol leader.

"Yes, sir; been there all day," replied Toby, who was
breathing rather hard, as though he might have been having
trouble with his machine on the road, and had found it
necessary to do considerable wrestling with it in order to
make the old tub behave.

"You were dispatched there by our scout master, in
order to watch the start of the Fairfield scouts, and be able
to give a detailed report of the same?" Elmer continued.

"Just what we were, sir; but that was not the whole
extent of our instructions," Toby went on.

"I believe you were also told to stay around during the
better part of the day, mingling with the boys of the town
all you could, and learning if any underhand doings were
being engineered among the tough element outside of the
scouts?"

"That's what," replied Toby. "And just this afternoon
we got on to something by accident that we thought
ought to be reported to headquarters. Wanted to phone
it, but they're repairing the wire between here and Fairfield,
and we had to try another way. So we hit up a hot
pace and came over direct on our machines; though of
course we had trouble on the road."

"You did the right thing, Number Four," remarked
Elmer. "And now, tell us what you learned. Is there
any sign of treachery afoot?"

"Just that, as sure as you live!" cried Nat, unable to
hold himself in longer, when he had as much right to be[48]
heard as his mate. "They're getting up a scheme to upset
all our plans. We didn't hear a breath about it till three,
but the fellers in the game had started more'n an hour
before."

"Meaning to waylay our boys, and put them out of the
running?" asked Elmer, showing signs of anger, as well
as an eagerness to be moving.

"Yes, but not exactly by what Mr. Garrabrant would
call physical violence," Toby spoke up, pushing his comrade
back at the same time. "Four fellows who don't
belong to the scouts, I'm glad to say, started out in a car,
with the intention of finding whether it seemed likely a
Hickory Ridge scout was far in the lead, and if he was,
then they meant to tempt him to ride with them for a mile
or more, knowing that if he did this he would be disqualified
in the race."

"And if he refused, what then?" asked Elmer, knowing
what the answer would be.

"They mean to take him along against his will!"
shouted Nat, triumphantly, before Toby could answer.



[49]
CHAPTER V.

THE MOTORCYCLE SQUAD.


Nobody spoke for several seconds; but those of the scouts
who were in the crowd looked at each other with gathering
frowns. They saw instantly that, according to the rules
of the game, if one of the contestants accepted a chance
to ride, or even was induced against his will to be carried
over a part of the course in an auto, a wagon, or any conveyance
whatever, he would invalidate his chances.

"It's a rotten shame, that's what!" declared Larry
Billings who belonged to the Beaver Patrol, and pinned
his faith on either Matty Eggleston or Red Huggins carrying
off the prize, for party faith was strong in the troop.

"Just what you might expect from Fairfield!" cried
another disgusted one.

"Hold on, don't say that!" said Elmer, holding up his
hand. "There are decent fellows over there, just as there
are in Hickory Ridge; and in both places you can find
some mean ones. Didn't you hear Toby and Nat say that
this contemptible game didn't crop up in the ranks of the
scouts of Fairfield, but some rank outsiders, who think
they are doing their mates a good turn, when in fact it's
the worst thing they could hatch up? Even if they win the
prize it will always be tarnished; and people will say it
would have come to Hickory Ridge troop only for foul
play."

A clamor of many tongues broke loose. Everybody
seemed to want to air his or her views; and the girls were[50]
just as indignant as any of the boys in denouncing the
outrage.

"Here, you'll have to let up on that, friends, or else
I'll take the boys inside the church to talk with them,"
called Elmer, waving his campaign hat with a show of
authority.

"Keep still, everybody!"

"Give us a chance to think!"

"Let Elmer run it; he knows what to do!"

"Sure; and he'll do it, too, you bet. I'm sorry for them
four Fairfield bullies. They're going to be up against it
good and hard, right quick now!"

Gradually the racket ceased, and Elmer could talk again.
Those who were close enough leaned forward to listen,
eager to understand just what plan the young assistant
scout master would engineer in the absence of Mr. Garrabrant,
with the idea of frustrating the clever if unscrupulous
scheme of the enemy.

It was a time that called for prompt action, as Elmer
well understood. If one of the Hickory Ridge scouts was
well in the lead, doubtless those four schemers in the automobile
would, by the time night came on, start operations.
Whether the victim was Lil Artha, or any one of the
others, he could not successfully hold his own against four
stout fellows. And having once dragged him into the car,
they meant to carry him many miles along the route;
dumping him out after they had "played hob," as Nat
expressed it, with all his chances.

Elmer thought fast. He had his motorcycle ready, and
knew that in all probability he could readily head off the
game, unless it was rushed through without waiting for
night to fall.

The only thing that bothered him was the fact that he[51]
would be just one against four; and in such a case he
might suffer the same fate it was intended to mete out to
the leader in the race.

If only the machines of Nat and Toby could be depended
on now, there was nothing to prevent his taking the boys
along; and he felt confident that both of them were in a
humor to accept at the drop of the hat. Filled with indignation
at the mean nature of the trick which those Fairfield
fellows had up their sleeve, and which they doubtless
considered smart, Toby and his mate would be only too
glad of the chance to accompany the scout leader on his
mission of rescue.

"How about your gas?" he asked, turning to the boys;
and it would seem as if they understood just what the
question implied, for a look of delight took the place of
the frown that had marked both faces.

"Heaps!" cried Toby, grinning.

"Filled mine just this morning, enough for seventy
miles, and I haven't gone more than thirteen!" declared
Nat, also newly excited at the joyous prospect.

"Then let's get a start away from here," Elmer called,
for the noise had begun again, and it was difficult to carry
on any sort of a conversation with comfort. "Anyhow,
we can drop out of town a few miles, and then stop to
consult."

"Wow! That's the ticket, Elmer!" exclaimed Toby,
making a rush for his machine.

"Bully! Bully all around! I'm on deck, Johnny on the
spot. Won't we do 'em up brown though, if we only ketch
'em," cried Nat, rather forgetting that as a scout fighting
was only to be resorted to as a last thing, and then in
defense of another rather than himself.

When the crowd saw the three getting ready to mount,[52]
they went fairly wild; and every imaginable sort of exhortation
was shouted. The news had circulated like wild-fire,
and everyone knew in some sort of hazy way that
the bullies of Fairfield were aiming to break up the great
hike.

"Get 'em, Elmer!"

"Oh, you Fairfield crowd, we're sorry for you!"

"Pinch 'em, Elmer! Knock the skunks into the middle
of next week!"

"You can do it, Elmer, we know you can! Give the
rascals the best licking they ever had! It's been a long
time coming; hand 'em the interest that's due!"

Evidently these last remarks did not come from any
fellow in khaki, since they had been learning other things
from the day they signed the roster of the scouts. But
even Elmer himself was thrilled with indignation; it
seemed so mean and contemptible in those Fairfield boys
to want to spoil the greatest hike contest that had ever
been started.

The machine that had been loaned to him was in good
trim; and, moreover, Elmer knew considerable about managing
a motorcycle, though he had never as yet owned one.

He started his engine without the least difficulty, and
then jumped into the saddle with the grace of one who
had long since mastered the art. The crowd opened up
before him, and Elmer sped along the road.

"Oh, you Indian, I bank on you!" called one of the
enthusiastic town fellows.

"Hi! Get a move on you, Toby and Nat!"

"Give the old wrecks a poke in the slats, and make 'em
be good!"

"There goes Toby! Good boy, you!"[53]

"Now, Nat will you let that dare slip by? Hit her up,
Nathan; that's the ticket!"

"Whoopla! We're all off!"

In this fashion did they call out, with other remarks
which space would not admit of our printing. Nat had
had a little trouble in making the start, since his engine
must have cooled down more or less; but after a little
fussing he managed to coax his battered old machine into
emitting a few rattling volleys, and then suddenly launched
forward.

Passing a mile or so down the road, Elmer threw up his
hand in the way drivers have of telling that they mean
to either turn aside or else stop, and which is a warning
for those who may be following to look sharp.

Then, picking out a place where they could stand the
heavy machines up against a rail fence, he came to a halt,
stepped off, and awaited the coming of the others.

"What happened?" exclaimed Toby, as he, too, reached
the spot and dismounted.

"Had a puncture, or spark gone back on you?" demanded
Nat, when he, too, came booming along, to make
a sudden halt and straddle his balky machine while he
talked.

"Nothing happened," returned Elmer; "but before we
start off we want to make sure it isn't going to be a wild-goose
chase."

"But we heard that talk, and we don't think they could
have been kidding; because you see none of 'em dreamed
we were near by," Toby declared, vehemently.

"That may be all true enough," Elmer said, "and at
the same time, unless we know just what we aim to do,
we may make a bad mess of it. Now, did you learn anything[54]
that would tell just where they expected to hold our
fellow up, in case he was in the lead?"

"Why, no, of course not, Elmer," replied Toby. "You
see, that would have to depend altogether on how far the
race had gone. It might be thirty miles away from the
start, and it might be less."

"Right. And we'll have to follow along the course in
order to get ahead. Here, we can put in a few minutes
to good advantage studying my map. I've got an idea
that by taking the Glenville short-cut road we can save
five miles easy. Perhaps there may be some other ways
of cutting the distance down. We looked after that when
we arranged the stations."

"Look here, Elmer, don't you think it might be a good
idea for us to go right along to the first station, and see if
there has been any late news from the front?" asked Nat.

"Gee, that sounds like we were in a regular battle!"
declared Toby, his face aglow with eagerness, as he awaited
the scout leader's reply.

"A fine suggestion, Nat, and we'll do it, just as soon as
we've glimpsed this map again," observed the one addressed,
as he sat down by the roadside and drew a folded
package from his pocket.

Elmer had made these road maps himself from one he
found in the house. They were rather cleverly done, and
showed every road, with the distances properly marked, all
the way to Little Falls. Besides, they had the various
taverns, where stations had been established, carefully
marked in red ink, so that no one could complain that he
lacked information.

Running a finger along the route, Elmer quickly showed
where in two places they could, if they wanted, leave the[55]
main road and take advantage of short cuts that must save
them quite a number of miles.

"But after all," he said, shaking his head, as he glanced
at the motorcycles of his comrades, "it might be a case of
saving at the spigot and wasting at the bunghole."

"How's that, Elmer?" asked Toby, perplexed.

"Well, we don't know what shape these side roads may
be in after that heavy rain night before last," he answered,
folding up the map.

"That's a fact!" ejaculated Toby; "and neither of us
thought about that for even a minute. Say, Nat, those
roads are only dirt ones, and not macadamized a single
bit. Perhaps we wouldn't have a warm old time jolting
along over 'em, eh? I can just imagine your old omnibus
going out of commission before you made a quarter of a
mile."

"Well, I admit that's so; but that would be about twice
as far as your rattlebox would carry you, Toby," the other
remarked, with a sting in his words.

But, then, when together they usually occupied much of
their time, when not engaged in waiting to make repairs,
in poking fun at each other's motorcycle; so that there
was little venom to the sting. It had all been threshed
out time and time again.

"Do we tune up now, Elmer?" asked Toby, as he prepared
for a flying start, that would make his companion
turn green with envy.

For answer Elmer took hold of his machine, manipulated
the lever, and as the engine started to throb, jumped into
the saddle, much to the envy of both the others, who could
never depend on doing anything as they planned.

However, they managed to get moving, though Elmer had
to slow up at the next bend in order to let them come[56]
along. He believed he would need the assistance these two
stout scouts were capable of affording; and but for that
must have been tempted to put on speed and leave them
far in the lurch to wrestle with their various troubles as
best they might.

So they sped along. Now and then something would
happen to one of the old machines and cause a delay.
Thanks to the presence of Elmer, who knew more about
machinery than either of the others, even though they had
owned motorcycles for years, these troubles were adjusted
in an unusually short time. Had it been otherwise, Elmer
must have felt compelled to abandon his running mates,
since minutes were valuable to him just then.

They presently came in sight of a road house, which
Elmer understood was the first on the list of stations. He
also remembered that one of the scouts had been detailed
to remain at this place, to use the phone as a sort of relay
station, and transmit any message from farther up the
road.

"We'll hold up here a little while, boys," he remarked,
as he shut off power and prepared to bring his machine
to a full stop. "Perhaps the news from up the road may
be worth listening to. Pull in and jump off. There's Hen
Condit in the doorway right now, beckoning to us."



[57]
CHAPTER VI.

GETTING IN A RUT.


"Great news, fellows!" called Hen Condit, as he gave
the salute on seeing that the assistant scout master was
with the party on motorcycles.

"What's that you say, Hen?" shouted Toby, making
a flying jump from his saddle that caused him to land
plump on hands and knees before the road house.

"Here, hold on, what d'ye think you're doing, Toby
Jones?" called Nat, who was showing a little more deliberation
in dismounting. "Guess you're dreaming about
aeroplanes and all such tomfoolery. Think you can fly,
eh? Well, grow a pair of real wings first!"

Toby's pet hobby lay in the line of aeronautics. He
was forever studying up the mysteries of bird motion,
and had the records of all the leading aeroplane drivers
at his finger tips, so that he could tell instantly what was
the highest point as yet reached by a bird-man; the fastest
flight made singly and with a passenger; the longest distance
traversed without alighting, and lots of other similar
facts in which the average boy might not be greatly interested.

He had several times made a gallant attempt to fly, but
thus far the machines he had constructed lacked some essential
quality. At any rate Toby had suffered pretty
much as did the Darius Green of whom we older fellows
used to read in our earlier days; and perhaps can still[58]
remember declaiming the story of a vaulting ambition that
took a tumble from the old barn roof.

Elmer gained the doorway where Hen Condit, one of
the later recruits in the Hickory Ridge troop, awaited him.
Hen had only received his new uniform on the preceding
day, and hence he felt as proud as a peacock. His chest
had never before been known to have anything like the
fine appearance that it now presented. And only that
morning his doting father had remarked that joining the
scouts had done more for the Condit son and heir than
years of pleading and scolding had effected, in so far as
making him stand up, and throw his shoulders back.

"Now, what's the news, Number Eight?" asked Elmer;
for the boy in the doorway belonged to the Wolf Patrol,
though a real tenderfoot, in that he had only qualified
for the lowest rung in the ladder by learning how to tie
a number of knots, learning what the requirements of a
scout consist of, and similar things.

"I just had news from up the road, sir," said Hen,
eagerly.

"Good news, or bad?" asked Elmer, just as if his eyes
did not tell him that.

"Fine and dandy, sir," was the reply.

"Of course connected with the advance member of our
immortal six?" Elmer continued.

"Sure." Hen forgot to add the term of respect now,
for he was burning with impatience to disclose his knowledge.

"Where from?" asked the scout leader.

"Rockledge, which is, I find, about thirty-two miles
from Hickory Ridge by the route marked out," answered
Hen.

"That's right," muttered Toby, who had the map in his[59]
mind pretty accurately, because he and Nat had often
scoured the country when their machines were newer and
acted more decently.

"What was the report, Number Eight?" Elmer asked.

"One of our boys had just registered there. He was
nearly half an hour ahead of the next contestant; though
that one appeared to be Felix Wagner, the smart second
baseman of the Fairfield nine!"

Elmer looked sober. He realized that the conditions
seemed to be peculiarly fitted for the carrying out of the
scheme which those four Fairfield plotters had arranged,
and started up the road some time before to execute, if it
was necessary, in order to help their man win.

A Hickory Ridge scout half an hour ahead of the fleetest
of the rival organization! That would mean a Fairfield
victory, providing the present leader could in some way
be disqualified.

"Who was the first man?" he asked, feeling pretty
confident as to what the answer would be.

"Lil Artha! He's doing the Hickory Ridge troop
proud this day. We'll forgive a heap in the way of practical
jokes if he only comes in away ahead of Felix," Hen
observed, with the natural pride boys always take in their
home-town doings.

"Hurrah for Lil Artha! Didn't I always say he would
show them a clean pair of heels? Oh, he's a wonder at
hiking and running! A three-bagger for most fellows lets
Lil Artha score the circuit. Bully boy, Artha! Yes, we'll
forgive everything if only he keeps this up and puts the
Injun sign on Fairfield."

Somehow or other it seemed as though most of their
concern lay in the possibility of the rival organization
winning the laurels. No matter which of the six home[60]
scouts came in ahead, if only he could have the laugh on
Fairfield!

"Half an hour ahead, you said, Number Eight?"
Elmer pursued, as he turned the matter over in his mind
and began to figure as to just how they should act in
order to play the game right.

"That's what I got over the wire. If you want, you
can call up Rockledge now, and perhaps they'll be able
to give more information," Hen Condit answered.

"No need, I reckon. What we want to do now is to get
busy," said Elmer.

His eye naturally turned toward the two old machines
that were apt to prove so unreliable. And no doubt Elmer
was compelled to once more debate within his mind whether
it would be best for him to leave Nat and Toby far in the
lurch, depending on his single arm to protect Lil Artha
against the vandals who would ruin the great hike; or by
suiting his pace to their progress, accidents and all, and
have comrades to depend on in an emergency.

He quickly made up his mind to stick to them, for a
while at least. If things grew to be too bad, he could say
good-by and go whirling off at the rate of forty miles
an hour.

Elmer was convinced that the fellows in the Fairfield car
would hardly be likely to start doing things until darkness
came. They would not want Lil Artha to see their faces,
so that he could recognize them and later on accuse them
when openly denouncing the miserable game.

"Send on the news to headquarters, Number Eight,"
he said, as he prepared to mount again; a movement that
sent both Toby and Nat hurrying toward their machines,
anxious to coax them into a fresh start.[61]

"Shall I tell them that you were along, sir?" asked
Hen, making the salute.

"Why, of course," said Elmer; "because they'll be
anxious; you see, there's a nasty plot afoot to kidnap Lil
Artha, and make him forfeit his place in the race, which
would go to the next in line."

"And that happens to be Felix Wagner! Great governor!
Now I know why you fellows are hitting up the
pace! Give 'em one for me, Toby, won't you?" Hen
bellowed after the three scouts; but they must have gone
beyond earshot, for at least no one seemed to pay the
slightest attention to his request.

It had been Elmer's first intention to make this trip on
his wheel, like the other inspectors, even though his still
sore foot would have rendered this a rather painful undertaking.
Perhaps it was the knowledge of his disability
that had caused the owner of the motorcycle to offer it to
Elmer. At any rate the patrol leader was very glad to
have it, since there was little labor needed in order to cover
all the ground necessary.

Of course there was little chance for the trio of scouts to
exchange words while they were spinning along on their motorcycles.
The road was not all that could be desired, the
heavy rain of the recent storm had washed it badly in
places, so that they had to keep a sharp lookout for ruts.

Possibly there is nothing more exasperating to anyone
riding a motorcycle than to find that he is in a deep rut.
For a brief time he may be able to keep his proper balance;
but presently he leans a trifle too much one way, the heavy
machine strikes the side of the rut, and as a consequence
there is a sudden dismounting; so that he feels himself
lucky if he alights anywhere but on his head.

Knowing this, and feeling that the wabbly machines of[62]
his comrades were doubly dangerous under such conditions,
Elmer always slowed down when he struck a poor streak
of road.

Even then their advance was not free from thrills.
Toby was the first to take a little header, because of thinking
he could push through a rut that somehow seemed to
have drawn him as with a magnet, even when he was fully
determined that he would give it a wide berth.

He came down with quite a hard bang; and Nat, hearing
the noise, and being just a little in advance, tried to twist
his head around in order to discover what had happened
to his companion in misfortune, when he, too, turned a
complete somersault and landed in the midst of a big
clump of thorny bushes that grew alongside the thoroughfare.

Of course, Elmer immediately stopped, and leaving his
motorcycle, ran back to see whether either of them could
be seriously hurt. First of all he laid hold on Nat, who
was kicking his legs vigorously in the air, and bleating
like a calf. After a little pulling, and working the prisoner
of the bush to and fro, he managed to set him free.

"No bones broken, I hope, Nat?" asked Elmer, as
the other started to dance up and down, rubbing his elbows,
his shins, and every part of his anatomy he could possibly
reach.

"Oh, I guess not, Elmer; but ain't I just a sight
though?" groaned the other. "My face feels like it was
marked with scratches like a map; and here's a big tear
in my trousers. Got a safety pin, Elmer? Oh, dear, won't
I look terrible!"

"Don't worry over it so much, Nat. Be a scout and
show your grit. Those are only little scratches and will
be gone in a few days. They're bleeding some now, of[63]
course, and feel bad. Let me wash them with some water
from this brook, to take any poison out. How is it with
you, Toby?" and Elmer turned upon the other unfortunate
who came limping along just then, trundling his
heavy motorcycle.

"Nothing much, I reckon, Elmer; got a lump about as
big as a pigeon's egg on top of my coco; but this ain't the
first time by a long shot. I'll be satisfied if only the upset
didn't put my old ice wagon here out of commission."
And Toby bent over to test the sparking of his machine
after dropping the rest to the road.

It started off at a rattling pace, which fact seemed to
tickle the owner very much indeed.

"Say, blest if I don't think that tumble must have just
knocked it back into its old shape again!" he exclaimed
in glee. "Haven't heard her take the spark like that
for a year and more. Hoopla! Nat, give yours a try.
Hope the same good luck fell your way."

However, such was not the case. Indeed, Nat's machine
utterly balked, and refused to do anything. Even after
Elmer had spent as much as fifteen minutes puttering over
it he could not make it behave.

"I'll give it just one more try, Nat," he declared finally,
"and then if it won't work, I'm afraid Toby and myself will
have to leave you here. We've just got to get along now,
or it'll all be too late."

"That's right, Elmer," declared the scout, manfully.
"I'm not the one to kick on account of being sacrificed
for the good of the troop. Lil Artha must be protected
against these Fairfield bullies. And if I have to hang out
here till after dark, why I'll just feel that I'm doing my
little part of the work. But I hope you make it this time,[64]
Elmer, because I'd rather be along with you, and have an
active share in the rush."

Once more did Elmer bend down over the motorcycle as
it leaned against a tree. Two minutes later there suddenly
broke forth a rattle of sharp reports and the rear wheel
flew around at a dizzy pace.

"Good, good! You did it, Elmer! She's in the running
again; and I won't have to camp out here on the road till
some wagon comes along to pick me up." And filled with
newborn pleasure, Nat proceeded to execute a hornpipe
right then and there.

"Well, get along with you both, then; I'll overtake you
in about three shakes of a lamb's tail," laughed Elmer,
as he stepped off along the road to where he had left his
motorcycle.

Ten seconds later the others, just about to start out, heard
him calling aloud.

"He says, hurry, Nat," cried Toby, for a little bend
in the road hid their chum from them; and not waiting
to test their machines any further they were off.

They found Elmer running around, with his head bent
low, as though he might be interested in the make of the
roadbed.

"What is it, Elmer?" asked Toby, coming to a stop.

"My motorcycle has gone!" was the startling reply the
scout leader made.



[65]
CHAPTER VII.

IN HOT PURSUIT.


Toby and Nat stared, first at Elmer, and then at each
other. Plainly they could not understand what he meant
by these strange words.

"Er       d'ye mean you forget just where you left it,
Elmer?" asked Toby.

"I tell you it's gone, vanished completely, disappeared!"
said the scout leader, with a show of anger in
his usually steady voice.

"Great goodness, Nat, he means somebody's swiped it!"
ejaculated Toby, his mouth opening in his astonishment.

Nat looked all around him, and then, not seeing a single
trace of the fine motorcycle, he began "barking," as Toby
called it, after his own peculiar way.

"Gee, whiz, now what d'ye think of that for a hummer!
The old story over again of the traveler on the
highway falling among thieves. My stars, Elmer, now who
under the sun do you think would be so mean as to run
off with your machine!"

"I don't know       yet; but I'm going to find out," replied
Elmer, setting his teeth in a way he had when greatly
aroused.

They saw him bend down again, and start to examine
the ground near a tree, against which he evidently had
leaned the motorcycle at the time he hurried to the rescue
of his comrades in distress.

"Get next to him, would you, Toby?" remarked Nat, as[66]
he watched the mysterious actions of the one who had
been robbed.

"Why, sure, I can understand what he's doing easy
enough," the other declared.

"Then for goodness' sake put me wise, won't you
please?" cried Nat.

"He's examining the tracks left by the chap who got
away with his machine while he was working with your
old ice wagon!" observed Toby, proudly.

"Well, now, I guess that's just what he is doing, sure
as you're born. And don't I just hope he gets on to him!
How is it, Elmer?" as the scout leader started to move
away.

Toby and Nat followed as close to his heels as they could,
considering that he immediately moved into the woods; and
they were compelled to trundle their heavy machines
along, no easy task under the best of conditions.

"He went this way, all right. I only hope he won't
think to smash the thing when he finds we're after him,"
said Elmer over his shoulder.

He was keeping his head bent low, and following the
trail with apparent readiness. The lessons he had learned
when on that ranch in the Canadian Northwest were undoubtedly
coming in "pat" just now; though really the
trail was so very plain that even a novice might have followed
it.

"Who d'ye thing could have done it, Toby?" asked Nat,
as he pushed his motorcycle through the scrub with a desperate
intention not to be left behind.

"Well, Elmer hasn't said a thing yet; but all the same
I can give a pretty good guess," returned the other.

"Go on and do it, then, for I'm all in the dark and up
a stump. Put me wise, Toby."[67]

"Huh, reckon you forget mighty soon!" grunted the
other, who was struggling manfully to rush his heavy wheel
along and did not have any spare breath, to tell the truth.

"Oh, slush, now I'm on!" cried Toby. "You mean
them Fairfield chaps that came out here to break up Lil
Artha's great winning streak?"

"Sure!" Toby grunted again, beginning to conserve his
breath when possible.

"They flagged us, and saw a chance to put us on the
blink!" exclaimed Nat who, like Lil Artha, was more or
less addicted to present-day slang, though otherwise he was
known to be a clean fellow, with no serious faults.

"That's it!" snapped Toby, gritting his teeth as though
even the thought made him furious.

"It's a punk deal, that's what," Nat went on. "They
just believe that if Elmer's out of the running the game
is in their hands. But he can have my machine, if he wants
to go ahead. If anybody can make it behave, Elmer can."

"Or mine either," declared Toby.

Now Elmer, of course, heard all this talk, even though he
seemed to be devoting himself wholly to the business in
hand. And at this juncture he beckoned to his comrades.

"He wants us to pick up, and get even with him," declared
Toby.

"Sure thing. Guess Elmer is going to take us at our
word, and borrow a mount," observed Nat, cheerfully.

Accordingly they put on an extra spurt, and managed
to gain enough ground so as to come alongside.

"I heard what you were saying, boys," Elmer immediately
remarked, as soon as he saw that they were up with
him; "but you're away off in your calculations. It isn't
one of those Fairfield fellows at all who's jumped my claim
with that borrowed motorcycle!"[68]

"W       w       what's that?" gasped Toby.

"I said that it wasn't a Fairfield fellow who ran off
with my machine," repeated Elmer, more positively than
before.

"Well, you make me feel like thirty cents," observed
Nat; "now, what under the sun would one of our boys
want with a motorcycle when, if he rides on it, for even a
minute, he's disqualified in the race?"

"It wasn't one of our scouts either," said Elmer.

"Then for goodness' sake tell us who it could be,
Elmer!" cried Toby.

"I haven't even glimpsed him once yet, though he's only
a little way ahead of us right now," the scout leader said;
"but judging from the fact that his shoes are all broken
out, I'm almost dead sure he's some Wandering Willie."

"He means a hobo, a common tramp!" exclaimed Toby
in astonishment.

"Tell me about that, will you!" cried Nat. "Just to
think of a four flusher like that making off with Elmer's
motorcycle, when he needs it the worst kind to block that
nasty little game of the envious Fairfield dubs! Oh, it's
a cruel world!"

"But we're goin' to get it back, don't you forget
that!" Toby insinuated.

"You never spoke truer words, Toby," laughed Elmer;
though there was little of mirth in the sound; for the boy
was tremendously aroused by this new calamity that threatened
to upset all his calculations.

"Hurry, hurry! I can go a bit faster, now that I know
what's on!" declared Toby, although his manner of gasping
belied his words.

"Oh, there he is right now! Look, look, Elmer!" cried
Nat.[69]

All of them caught a glimpse of some moving object that
was pushing at top speed through the scrub ahead. Undoubtedly
it was the party who had run away with Elmer's
motorcycle. They had gained on him constantly, and were
now surely overtaking the rascal.

"We're just bound to get him, fellows!" said Toby.

"That's so, Toby; it looks good to me," remarked Nat,
as he strained every muscle to keep alongside the others.

Elmer, being free to make a sprint, since he had no
machine to trundle along, suddenly left his chums in the
lurch. They saw him leaping through the low underbrush
as might a deer.

"Hurrah! He'll get him!" shouted Toby.

"Twenty-three for yours, Mr. Wandering Willie!"
added Nat.

"Don't I wish Elmer would just hold him till we come
up," added the other, with a threat in his manner that
hardly became a scout; but then Toby had been a boy long
before this scout movement was dreamed of, and the natural
instinct is very hard to repress.

"Hey, do we drop our wheels, and make a spurt, so as
to be in at the finish?" demanded Nat.

"You can, if you want to," replied his mate; "but
something tells me a machine may come in handy yet, even
if it is an old huckleberry makeshift like mine."

"Gee, yes! I didn't think of that," Nat muttered, still
clinging to his motorcycle. "The hobo might strike the
road again, you mean?"

"Yep, that's what, Nat."

"And go skeetering off on Elmer's wheel?"

"Just what I meant," replied Toby. "He's been making
a sorter curve all along, like he wanted to strike the
road; I noticed that, Nat."[70]

"So did I. Don't like the job of pushing that machine
through the scrub any too much, I reckon," Nat remarked,
panting from his own exertions.

"And say, do you blame him?" Toby asked.

"Listen!" and Nat cocked his head as though he could
hear better in that position.

"What was it? Did you catch a shout for help? Perhaps
Elmer's caught up with him, Nat!"

"I thought I heard somebody call out, or laugh," Nat
began, when he was interrupted by a shout.

"Toby       Nat, hurry along with your wheels!"

"That's Elmer!" gasped Toby, as he tried to add a
little more speed to his forward progress.

"Perhaps he's got him under his knee, and is holding
him for us," suggested Nat.

"That's silly," returned the other, immediately. "It
won't hold water, Nat. Whatever would he tell us to
bring our machines, if he had the hobo? Tell you what,
I reckon he's made off along the road with Elmer's motorcycle,
that's a fact!"

"And he wants one of ours to chase him with! Oh, I
wish I could fly right now, so's to hurry!" Nat cried.

"A fine mess you'd make of it, if even a fellow like me,
that's up to snuff, don't seem able to get it down pat,"
sneered Toby.

"I see Elmer, and he's waving his hand to us like
fun!" exclaimed Nat, without appearing to take any
notice of the slur cast upon his abilities in the line of
aviation.

Elmer came bounding toward them just then, as though
meaning to lend all the assistance in his power toward
getting the machine he fancied, if there was any choice
in the matter, to the road near by.[71]

He clutched hold of Toby's motorcycle, possibly believing
that its recent regeneration might prove fairly
lasting.

So they came upon the edge of the road again, after
making all that half circle through the woods and scrub.

Toby's first act was to stretch his neck, and stare along
the road. A moving object caught his eye, which he had
no difficulty in making out to be a motorcycle, upon which
a ragged specimen of a tramp was seated, and which he
was working at a great rate with his feet on the pedals!

"He don't know beans about how to run the engine!"
Toby exclaimed, with sudden delight, as he saw this plain
fact.

The road just there was as straight as a rule, for at least
a couple of miles; and the fellow had not gotten more than
a quarter of a mile away.

He happened to turn his head to look back just then,
while the machine "yawed" at an alarming rate, threatening
to dispose of the tramp in the bushes. To the indignation
of Toby and Nat, the latter having also managed
to reach the spot by this time, the Wandering Willie
jauntily waved a hand toward them, as though bidding
them a fond adieu.

There was a sudden sputter, and a rattling volley. Then
away sped Elmer, mounted on Toby's old machine, which
seemed about to redeem itself in this momentous crisis.

"Wow! Watch his smoke, will you!" shrieked Nat.

"Now will you be good, Mr. Hobo!" cried Toby; hoping
in his heart that the pursuing machine might not take
a notion to perform any of its frequent tricks and betray
its new master.

The man on the stolen wheel must have heard that rattle
as of artillery behind him, for Elmer never bothered using[72]
the hush pedal, such was his desire to speed up and overtake
the thief who was running off with his mount.

They saw him look back over his shoulder as if in sudden
alarm. Then his legs began to work faster than they could
possibly have done in ten years, as he endeavored to pedal
his stolen property at a rate of speed that would take him
beyond reach of the relentless pursuer. But like a meteor
shooting across the sky, Elmer bore down on the hobo
motorcycle thief.



[73]
CHAPTER VIII.

TWENTY-SEVEN MILES FROM HICKORY RIDGE AND HOME.


"Look at the silly guy, will you! Thinks he can run
away from a forty-mile-an-hour engine! I like his nerve,
now!" exclaimed Nat.

"But Elmer's eating up the distance like fun!" cried
Toby, dancing up and down in his great excitement.
"Think of my old machine behaving so decent, would
you! Why, she runs as smooth as grease       better than
when she was new! There! He's closing in on him now
like hot cakes. Watch what happens, Nat!"

They stood there in the road, with their eyes glued on
the little comedy that was happening not a great distance
away.

The tramp knew from the loudness of those rapid-fire
explosions that the speeding motorcycle must be rapidly
overhauling him. No need to turn his head any longer
to size up the situation, which in his mind was becoming
acute.

"He's going to skip out!" shrieked Nat, suddenly.

"Sure thing!" echoed Toby. "Look at him dragging
his big trilbies along the road to slow up. Hope he don't
run slap into a tree though, and bust things higher'n a
kite!"

"There he goes! Hoopla!" shouted Nat.

They saw the tattered thief suddenly bring the motorcycle
to a stop, or at least what looked like it from a distance.
Then he fell over on the ground, and rolled into[74]
the bushes, as if only too anxious to get out of the reach
of the owner, before he could lay hands on him.

Elmer shut off power and applied the brake, for he
quickly came to a stop close by the spot where his machine
lay.

"Chase after him, Elmer! Get him!" yelled Nat, as
he and his comrade started to hasten along the road, Nat
apparently forgetting that he might as well make use of
his machine, if so be it would answer his demand.

But it looked as though wise Elmer saw no reason why
he should get mixed up with a rough hobo, simply to
satisfy his desire for revenge. He seemed to be bending
over the motorcycle, as though investigating the extent of
damages it might have sustained in being so hastily dropped
on the hard road.

"Here, what's the reason we can't get along in style?"
demanded Toby. "Hit up your old ice wagon, and I'll
hitch on behind that far."

"Sure thing!" remarked Nat, as if the idea had never
once occurred to him, he was so busy thinking of how he
would like to lay hands on the thief.

After several attempts the machine decided to be good;
and as it started, Toby managed to hang on in some fashion,
until presently they arrived on the scene.

Elmer had raised his motorcycle and started the engine
going, after dropping the rest at the rear, so that the back
wheel could spin in the air.

"Seems to work all right!" declared Toby.

"Glad to say there's been no damage done, except a
dent in the gas tank, and that can be easily pounded out
later on," Elmer declared, as he heaved a sigh of relief.

"Are we going to let that hobo get off so easy; or do
we chase after him?" asked Nat, glaring around at the[75]
neighboring woods, in the depths of which no doubt the
object of his anger was snugly ensconced, watching to see
what they would do.

"No use trying to get hold of him," remarked Elmer.
"Forget it, and let's bump along the road. He just saw a
chance to steal something that he really had no use for,
and couldn't hold back. It's all right now, and no damage
done. Get ready to start, fellows!"

In another minute they were speeding away, possibly
much to the relief of the concealed tramp, who had begun
to fear that he had stirred up a hornet's nest, and was
likely to get stung pretty badly.

Ten minutes later, with all three machines humming
merrily, they flitted past a roadside tavern.

"See that?" called Elmer over his shoulder to Toby,
who was next in line.

"The road house, d'ye mean?" answered the other.

"Second signing station, fourteen miles, about, from
Hickory Ridge," Elmer said.

"But you didn't make any move to stop," remarked
Toby.

"No need," came the reply. "We wouldn't be apt
to pick up any later news than what Hen Condit gave us.
And we want to make all the time we can. Been enough
delay already."

"But perhaps there won't be any more, from my machine
anyhow, Elmer. She's going like a greased pig.
That shake-up must have been just what the old buster
needed." Toby bawled, knowing to what the other referred
when he mentioned hold-ups.

Nat was trailing along in the rear, but coming apparently
with no sign of another balk; although doubtless he lived
in perpetual fear of something new springing a surprise[76]
on him. A motorcycle, once it gets to acting queer, can
establish a reputation for opening up new avenues of
trouble second to none.

"Hey, look ahead!" called Toby, presently, after they
had covered another long distance of quite a number of
miles.

Elmer, upon doing so, discovered that a couple of fellows
occupied the middle of the road, and seemed to act as
though they meant to stay there, no matter what came
along.

As the motorcycle squad rushed toward them, Elmer had
no great difficulty in recognizing Landy's cousin, George
Robbins, and one of the Fairfield crowd, Angus McDowd.

They had their arms locked, and seemed on the best of
terms with the world in general, though their steps had
a tottery look, as Nat expressed it.

Finding themselves left far in the rear, these two had
apparently made up their minds not to bother about who
won the great hike; but to stick to each other, and take
things as easy as they could.

Hearing the sputtering of the several machines, they
looked back and waved their hands, evidently recognizing
Elmer in the lead. Then they stepped to one side of the
road so as to let the procession pass.

Elmer threw out his hand so as to warn Toby to slow
up, as he meant to do that same, and did not wish to take
the chances of being run down.

"How far are we from home?" shouted both the walkers,
as Elmer came close.

"About twenty miles," he replied, for he had anticipated
such a question, and prepared himself to meet it promptly.

"Is that all?" called Angus McDowd, who looked pretty
much "all in."[77]

"What's the news; who's ahead, Elmer?" called
George, as the motorcycle passed.

"Lil Artha at last accounts, by a long lead!"

"Bully for Lil Artha!" both trampers shouted; for
Angus was so tired himself that he really cared very little
who won.

"How far ahead of us, hey?" shouted George.

"Only about thirteen miles, George," answered Toby
as he flitted past with a fresh start.

"Oh, won't poor old Landy feel sore when he hears
how the hope of the Philander Smiths has gone aglimmering!"
mocked Nat, as he, too, went by.

George made a quick motion with his hand as though
throwing something at his tormentor; then his care-free
laugh floated after them.

About three miles farther along the road they discovered
another sight.

"What's going on there?" shouted Toby, who again
hung rather dangerously close in the rear of the leader,
because he wanted a chance to exchange remarks from time
to time.

"Looks like a breakdown, and that's a fact," Elmer
replied.

"That's right," called Toby immediately. "It's Tom
Cropsey, and he's trying to put a plug in his tire. He's
got a puncture, and that ended his run as inspector."

The boy looked up as they drew near, and shook his head
even as he grinned.

"All in, I reckon, Elmer, can't seem to fix her!" he
called, as the scout leader flashed past.

Possibly he would have been glad if they had stopped
in order to assist him repair the obstinate break; but Elmer
had other fish to fry just then, and time was too valuable[78]
to waste in gaining a recruit who could never keep up
with them for even half a mile.

So they presently saw the last of poor Tom, marooned
so far away from home, and with night coming on apace.

Elmer knew that they might expect to overtake some
of the others at any minute now, and every time he turned
a bend he looked closely to see if there were not figures
on the road ahead.

Nor was he mistaken.

A few more miles, and he saw a lone pedestrian manfully
struggling onward, with a stout stick, which he had
stopped to cut, assisting him. At first Elmer thought it
was an old man hobbling along, until coming up on the
party, the other wheeled.

"Hello, Jack, old fellow! making a game push for it,
eh?" called Elmer, who had slowed down considerably,
so as to give the contestant a cheery word to encourage
him in persisting.

"Wow, but I guess I'm pretty near the limit, Elmer,"
answered the other, who turned out to be Jack Armitage.
"How far have I come since morning, hey?"

"About twenty-four miles," answered Elmer, as he
passed.

"Gee, is that all? Thought it was near fifty!" lamented
the scout, as he waved his cane at both Toby and Nat as
they went by and doubtless cast an envious look at the
machines that were carrying them over the ground so
easily, while he was completely done up, and ready to cry
quits.

"Next!" shouted Nat, who was really enjoying this
thing of overhauling the various used-up walkers more
than anything that had come his way for a long time; it
is always so nice to spin along on a wheel, or a motorcycle,[79]
or in a car, and pity the poor fellows who have to
walk!

"Well, there he is, right beyond," said Toby over his
shoulder.

"Who under the sun is it?" demanded the rider in the
rear, whose view was somewhat obstructed by his companions.

"Blest if I know; looks a little like our Ty Collins!"
Toby shot back.

"It is Ty; anybody ought to recognize that old red
sweater of his," Elmer announced; "and he's got a fine
stone bruise on his foot, if that limp means anything!"

The contestant stepped out of the road as they drew
near. He stiffened up to salute, game to the last, and
chasing away the look of pain that had been on his boyish
face.

One of his shoes was held in his hand, and he had been
walking along in this way, determined not to give up until
the last gasp.

"Better throw up the sponge, Ty," called Elmer, who
had the authority to order anyone out of the race who
in his judgment was unfit to continue further.

Ty's face told that he welcomed this command, as it
released him from all further responsibility, and he could
retire with good grace.

"What'd I better do, Elmer?" he called out.

"Station four just ahead; stay there to-night. Some
one come for you in morning!" the scout leader shouted
back.

"All right, I will. Hello! Toby, and you ditto, Nat.
Who's winning? That fast Fairfield fellow, Wagner,
passed me a long time ago, going strong."

"Oh, Lil Artha is miles ahead of him!" replied Nat.[80]

"Hurrah for the pride of Hickory Ridge troop! Bully
for Lil Artha!" they heard Jack whoop as they sped
onward.

Thus one by one they were fast picking up the contestants
who were spread out along the road to Little Falls,
covering many miles from the leader to the fellow far in
the rear, the Hope of the Philander Smiths.

"There's the other bicycle boy, Phil Dale!" shouted
Toby a little later, after they had passed the tavern which
had been selected as the fourth station.

"And he's near played out, too. Look at him wabble,
would you! Wow, he can't do many more miles at that
rate!" Nat yelled.

Elmer gave a salute to warn the rider they were coming
and wanted half the road. As he swept past Phil called
out something, but Elmer failed to catch what he said,
the others also went whooping by, no one having thought
to slow down.

And so both inspectors as well as a number of the played-out
contestants had been overhauled. They were now fast
coming to the point where a crisis would be waiting for
them. Twenty-seven miles from Hickory Ridge and evening
close at hand, when the miserable plot of the Fairfield
schemers could be put into play!



[81]
CHAPTER IX.

NEARING THE CRISIS.


A sudden howl arose from Nat in the rear.

Both Elmer and Toby knew what it meant. The tricky
wheel of Nat had given signs of balking again, and they
must make a stop in order to coax it to be good. Elmer
seemed to have a "wheedling" way about him, both the
others had confessed, when it came to patching up the peace
with a mutinous motor. He seemed just naturally to know
how to go about smoothing out difficulties in a way that
told of his being a born mechanic, although as yet he had
found but few chances to show his skill.

So Elmer, though not without considerable reluctance,
threw up his hand as a signal that he meant to stop. Perhaps
he might even have thought of leaving Nat, and
taking only Toby with him; but after the other had stuck it
out so valiantly all this while, it hardly seemed fair to
abandon him on such a slight pretext.

So they were soon busy over the refractory motor, Elmer
looking into the trouble with his customary skill.

"How many other fellows are there ahead of us?"
asked Nat, who was hovering over the one who worked,
eager to lend a hand if called upon.

"Quite a bunch," replied Toby. "Let's see, there ought
to be Red, Matty, Lil Artha on our side, and from what we
know about the Fairfield crowd we've still got to reckon
with Henry Cobb and Felix Wagner."[82]

"Just leave out Cobb, boys," remarked Elmer, as he
worked rapidly.

"Why?" demanded Toby.

"Oh, he's all in, for a fact!" laughed the other.

"But say, we didn't pass Cobb; unless he was lying
in the bushes along the side of the road. How d'ye know
he's given up the fight, Elmer?" questioned Toby, bent
on finding out.

"I saw him sitting in that number four station, with
one of his feet on a chair, and being bound up," replied
the scout leader.

"Shucks, you don't say so!" exclaimed Nat. "Whatever
in the wide world do you think can have happened to
him?"

"Perhaps he's been bit by a mad dog!" suggested Toby.

"Might a' been a rattlesnake; I've heard tell about lots
of the critters being found up this way. One man used
to hunt 'em just for the skins and the rattlesnake oil he
got. Some people say it's mighty fine for rheumatism; and
athletes use it a heap. Say, Elmer, what d'ye think?"
Nat went on.

"Oh, nothing like all that stuff," chuckled the other.
"Henry has just sprained his ankle, I reckon, and is getting
it bound up. That eliminates all the Fairfield contestants
but one       Felix Wagner."

"And him the most dangerous of the bunch!" muttered
Toby.

"How does it come on, Elmer; think you can get it
fixed? Gee, I hope so, because I'd sure hate to drop out
now!" said Nat.

"It's going to be all right; just give me three minutes
more, and I'll have it in shape for a long run," came the
reply.[83]

"Oh, that sounds good to me!" declared Nat; "because
I do want to be in at the finish"; and secretly behind
Elmer's back he doubled up his fist, showed it to
Toby and the two conspirators grinned and nodded, as
though they had their minds fully made up as to what
they meant to do if the chance opened.

Elmer knew what he was saying when he made that
promise. By the time the three minutes were up he handed
the motorcycle over to its owner.

"There you are, Nat; give the engine a tryout," he said.

And as the other did so, with the result that the explosions
started off with a rush such as Nat had not been
acquainted with of late, he gave a shout.

"Runs bully, Elmer, you're just a wiz, when it comes
to tinkering with things. I bet you the old hippo runs
like a scared dog now. Here goes, fellows!"

He jumped for the saddle, almost missed it, and managing
to climb on, went along the road furiously, though
quickly slackening his speed as Elmer called out.

"How is it?" asked the latter, as he overtook Nat.

"Just oh be joyful, that's what!" answered Nat, who
seemed tickled at the way his rackety machine was now
behaving. "Why, she answers to the least touch, and is
as spry as a young colt. I'm almost afraid she'll take a
sudden notion to run away with me yet, Elmer."

"There's Red, boys! He's still hitting up the pace; but
it's only grit that carries him on now!" observed Elmer.

Red had always been known as the possessor of a stubborn
will. Although he was dragging his feet after him
when first the three on motorcycles discovered him, no
sooner did he know of their coming than he braced up
wonderfully and pretended to be as fresh as in the start.

Again were a few sentences exchanged as they drew past.[84]
But Red did not deign to ask how far he was from home.
He gave a shout upon hearing that the long-legged Hickory
Ridge scout was said to be well in the lead; as though his
one thought was to have his troop win out.

"Ambulance be along later, Red!" shouted Nat, who
could not resist the chance to get in another little dig; but
Red put his hands up to his mouth to serve as a megaphone
as he yelled after them:

"Not for me; I'm able to walk back home again, if I
want to, understand!"

Now they kept a lookout for Matty, who could not be
far beyond. They discovered him bending down at a running
stream where he had evidently been slaking his thirst,
and perhaps bathing his tired feet, for his shoes were both
off.

Again did Elmer give the "high sign," and the others
took heed. The three riders jumped to the ground. That
clear water looked mighty enticing; and, besides, here was
the last fellow whom they might expect to overtake, save
Felix and Lil Artha; and a wide gap was believed to exist
between them.

"Come on in, fellows, the water's fine," laughed Matty,
whose face looked as if he had dipped it partly in the creek,
for the dust was washed in streaks; but his smile was just
as genial as ever.

The trio soon slaked their thirst.

"Where are we at?" demanded the leader of the
Beaver Patrol, who had made a pretty good bid for the
prize, considering that he was not gifted with such long
legs as the two fellows ahead.

"I think about twenty-nine miles out," Elmer returned.

"And with just two fellows ahead; but I've got a poor
chance to overhaul 'em, though I don't give up yet awhile.[85]
That's all, ain't it, Elmer, Lil Artha and that muscular
Dutchman, Felix Wagner?"

"That's all," nodded Elmer. "Glad to find you so
filled with pluck, Matty; though it looks as if Lil Artha
would have to carry the colors of Hickory Ridge troop to
the scout master of Little Falls."

"How does the game stand; is Felix overhauling our
chum?" asked the other, as he started to put on his shoes,
making a wry face while doing so, as if his feet might be
more or less sore.

"Not that we know of; for at last accounts Lil Artha
had a lead of some three miles, and was going strong,"
Elmer replied.

"Then what in the mischief do you fellows look so
serious about, that's what I want to know?" demanded
Matty, whose sharp eyes had read something in their manner
that told him everything was not as serene as outward
conditions would seem to imply.

"Listen, then, and I'll try to tell you as quickly as I
can." And saying this, Elmer started to relate how word
had come of the detestable scheme engineered by some of
the rougher element among the Fairfield boys, looking to
rendering Lil Artha ineligible as a contestant, by either
coaxing him to ride in their auto, or if he persistently declined,
forcing him into doing so.

Matty's indignation was immediate.

"What a lot of scoundrels they are!" he declared, between
his set teeth. "If I wasn't a scout right now, d'ye
know what I'd say they deserved?"

"Well, never mind," laughed Elmer; "don't commit
yourself, Matty. And now, boys, since we've refreshed ourselves,
let's be moving. This is probably the last stop
we'll make up to the time we overhaul our chum who is[86]
so gallantly carrying our colors to victory. Come along,
both of you."

Elmer had thought they could spare the few minutes
needed to get a drink, and give Matty some hints as to how
things stood. The leader of the Beaver Patrol had made
such a brave fight of it, in that he had covered nearly
thirty miles of territory since morning, that really he deserved
to be told.

Fortunately both of the older machines started in decent
order. Doubtless Toby and Nat breathed sighs of relief
when this fact became evident; for they had been having
so much trouble of late that they distrusted the working
capacity of the worn-out motors to rise to an occasion.

But everything seemed going along smoothly, and once
more the three sped along, passing the fifth station, which
was the same Rockledge from whence the news had come
concerning Lil Artha some two hours and more before.

"How far d'ye think he could have gone in two hours,
Elmer?" asked Toby, who, as usual, was making the leader
a pacer for his own progress, as he hung dangerously close
at the rear of Elmer's machine.

"Well, if he was fairly fresh Lil Artha might make
eight miles, and think little of it," replied the other.

"But he must be tired by now, and say he's made six,
wouldn't that about fill the bill, Elmer?"

"We'll call it six, just for fun, and let it go at that.
Look out for Felix about this time. He ought to still be
half an hour behind the leader."

"Unless the conditions have changed a whole lot, which
I don't think has happened," Toby called.

Elmer had even considered dropping off while passing
through Rockledge, just to find out when Felix entered
his name and time of arrival. But on second thought he[87]
decided that it did not matter much anyway; since it was
not the persistent work of Felix that bothered them half
so much as what the plotters meant to do.

Thirty-two miles' walk was something worth while for
boys who had never made any pretense of being skilled
pedestrians; and even the slowest in the bunch, George and
Angus McDowd, need not be ashamed, after having tramped
over twenty miles since sunrise, without any previous experience
and no preparation, such as old walkers of the
Weston and O'Leary type practice before starting on a
long hike.

A short time after leaving Rockledge, they believed that
they must have reached the thirty-five-mile stage.

Elmer gave his horn a little toot, that being his way of
signaling to his comrades that he had sighted something
ahead.

"Is it Felix?" asked Toby, fearful lest the reply might
indicate that Lil Artha had fallen back to second in the
race, and the sturdy Dutchman beat him out.

"It isn't our chum, anyhow," Elmer answered; "because
he lacks half a foot of being as tall. Yes, it must be
Felix Wagner."

"He's walking strong, Elmer!" declared Toby, anxiously.

"So is Lil Artha, you'll find," the other flung back.

"Do you think he can be far ahead still?" Toby persisted,
just as though the boy in the lead could tell everything.

"I reckon he's holding his own," answered Elmer.
"When we last heard he was half an hour to the good.
Then we'll likely run across him a few miles farther on."

"Say, it ain't far from dusk now, Elmer!" sang out
Nat from the rear.[88]

"Oh, we know that easy enough," called Toby. "Just
you keep your machine in good temper, Nat, and everything'll
be lovely, with the goose hanging high."

So they flew past the Fairfield walker in rapid style.

After that little exchange of opinions the trio relapsed
into silence for a brief time. The motors kept humming
away as though out for business, and the regular music
that his machine was giving forth seemed especially pleasing
to Nat. Why, he was that delighted he could not bear
to hush matters in the least by using the muffler! Who
cared for the noise anyway; this was no crowded town for
the police to interfere.

And now Elmer began to grow anxious. Felix had
waved his hand to them in passing, and they had answered
in a friendly way, Felix was not supposed to know anything
about the mean plan on foot to further his interests
at the expense of the one whose fine work entitled him thus
far to the lead.

How would they find Lil Artha? Was the pride of the
khaki troop holding out all right, or would they discover
that he showed signs of weakening when that sturdy and
persistent Dutchman in the rear would soon pass him by?



[89]
CHAPTER X.

FOUND AT LAST.


Elmer was thinking about the car that had started from
Fairfield an hour before Toby and Nat learned about the
scheme to waylay the leader in the great hike, in case he
proved to be a representative of Hickory Ridge, and prevent
him from carrying out his intentions not to ride a
foot of the way to Little Falls.

It could have easily overtaken Lil Artha long before
this. Possibly the four reckless young fellows in the car
may have gone on ahead, to pick out a favorable place for
the ambush, from which they meant to pounce on the
walking Lil Artha and play their mean game.

He was looking on either side of the road as he went,
as though the thought had come to him that perhaps he
might discover the car in hiding; the plotters having decided
to wait until dark before overtaking the leader.

Then another idea flashed across Elmer's mind, and he
no longer bothered looking either to the right or the left.
Instead his eyes sought the road in front of his motorcycle.

It was now beginning to grow a trifle like twilight. The
glowing sun had sunk in the west, and left a legacy of red
and gold to paint a few fleecy clouds that hovered there
in the heavens.

So it was not as easy as one might wish, to discover
signs on the road, especially when going at the pace they
held. But here and there the conditions became a little
more favorable. Perhaps it was because the trees were[90]
farther back, allowing more of that glow from the west
to reach them; or else the shading branches had prevented
the sun from drying the mud entirely, so that such a broad
mark as that made by a poorly inflated automobile tire
might be detected.

And this was just what Elmer was looking for. He
found it presently, too; and was even able to tell that the
car had been going at a pretty good clip in the same direction
in which they were even then headed. This he did
by noting that the mud had been splashed forward, so that
it struck trees ahead of where it had formerly rested on
the roadbed. And the distance it had been thrown was
proof of considerable speed on the part of the passing car.

So Elmer constantly found his previous experience in
following a trail of considerable benefit when filling the
position of a scout leader. Little things that others would
have neglected to notice, or which, if seen, might be looked
upon as mere nothings, assumed an importance in his eyes
just as they would to an Indian born to reading signs
when following a trail in forest or on the desert.

There was no especial need of shouting all this out for
the information of the two fellows following after him.
They were quite satisfied to leave the arrangement of
things in his hands. All Toby and Nat wanted was a
chance to have a say in the wind-up; and if the opportunity
arose, to put in a good lick for Hickory Ridge.

All the while Elmer was trying to figure distances. He
had taken note of the cyclometer at the time he passed
Felix Wagner. It stood at just thirty-five miles then. And
if, as they suspected, Lil Artha, the gallant Hickory Ridge
representative, was some three or four miles ahead of his
closest rival, it was now about time they were sighting the
long-legged boy pedestrian.[91]

Indeed, unless they soon came upon him, Elmer would
begin to worry, lest those reckless blades in the Fairfield
car had declined to wait for darkness to come in order
to hide their actions, and had already carried their plan
into execution.

It was therefore with a purpose that Elmer shaded his
speed down until they were not moving along much more
than twice as fast as a walker would go.

"Keep tabs on the road to the left, boys, as we go," he
called back.

"What for?" demanded Toby, eager to do whatever
the leader wished, and yet not able to see for himself.

"Notice any signs that might stand for a struggle,"
Elmer went on.

"Good gracious! Elmer, do you think they've jumped
Lil Artha already?" demanded Toby; and from the rear
Nat called out:

"Didn't you say you thought they'd hold over till it
got dark enough so he couldn't recognize 'em, Elmer?"

"That's right, I did; and I still believe so," replied the
leader, confidently. "When I ask you to help me look
for any signs of a free-for-all scrap, I don't believe we'll
find such a thing; but I'm just insuring the correctness of
my ideas."

"Oh, that's it, eh?" said Toby; though from the manner
in which he uttered the words it could be plainly seen
that he failed to fully grasp Elmer's true meaning.

But with three pairs of young eyes on the watch, it was
not very likely that anything in the nature of marks indicating
a scrimmage would escape. A lot of boys engaged
in a wrestling match would be apt to leave many traces
on the road; for knowing Lil Artha as they did, the three[92]
chums felt sure he could not be hauled into that Fairfield
auto without a desperate resistance.

Once Nat sang out something that sounded as though he
had made a discovery; and instantly Elmer gave the signal
for a stop. With his heart beating like a trip hammer he
dropped his machine and hurried back.

"Where is it, Nat?" he asked, eagerly, ready to attempt
the reading of such signs as might be found on the dirt
of the road.

Nat's eyes opened wide.

"Where's what?" he asked, as if astonished.

"Didn't you sing out that you'd seen something that
ought to be investigated?" asked Elmer.

"Why, not that I know of," replied Nat, seeming rather
confused.

"But you did call out something?" went on the other,
hardly knowing whether to feel provoked or to laugh.

"Sure I did; but it was only to tell you I was feeling
as empty as a sugar barrel that's been scraped clean.
When do we get a snack, I'd like to know?" Nat replied,
rubbing the pit of his stomach as if to indicate its state
of emptiness.

"Well, if that ain't the worst cheek I ever struck,"
growled Toby; "to stop us just when my machine had got
into its best stride, and was humming most beautifully!"

"Oh, come off your perch!" cried Nat. "I didn't
stop you       never dreamed of such a thing. It was an accident,
that's all."

"Never mind," remarked Elmer, as he prepared to
mount again. "Not much time lost, and I've made sure
that Lil Artha has gone along here, with the car in front
of him!"

"What's that?" asked Toby, hardly understanding.[93]

"Why, I've seen a place where our chum's footprint
is marked in the tread the automobile tire made in the half-hard
mud. That tells as plain as print the car must have
passed him back here a little; for if he was not coming
after it he could not have stepped in the trail left by the
tire," Elmer went on, calmly.

"Oh, yes, I see now what you mean, Elmer; and as
sure as you live it's a mighty clever idea. Takes you to
think up all those things. That's what you learned when
you were out there on the plains, didn't you?" Toby remarked.

"Of course," was all the scout leader replied; but he
could not help thinking that in the case of some fellows it
would be necessary for them to have about fifty years'
experience out West before they could grasp the true
meaning of clews and trails and such things.

"Is there any need now for us to look out, and try to
find traces of a scrap?" asked Nat, as he balanced his
machine and prepared to start.

"You might as well keep it up," came the answer.

"But if those chaps have gone ahead, what's the use?"
demanded Nat.

"Because, don't you see," put in Toby, anxious to air
his knowledge, "what's going to hinder them lying in
wait, and jumping out on Lil Artha. Shall we keep tabs
of the left side as before, Elmer?"

"The left       yes; but I imagine we're going to come upon
our chum mighty soon now. That track was fresh, and
I've an idea it wasn't made more than ten minutes ago,
at the most fifteen."

Both the other lads looked admiringly at the one who
was able so confidently to say such a positive thing. They
could not imagine how it was done; and as their glances[94]
met they shook their heads, as though condoling with each
other on their mutual ignorance.

Then pop-pop-pop, and they were all off in a line, with
Nat, as usual bringing up the rear, and Elmer in the van.

Ahead of them, about half a mile away, there seemed to
be some sort of a bend; although the shadows played
around the spot so densely that even the sharp eyesight
of Elmer failed to make sure just what sort of a curve the
road took there.

He had what he called a "hunch" that once around
this they would be apt to sight the one in whose fortunes
they were so vitally interested. So away they tore, letting
the engines out for all they were worth; and Nat, as before,
utterly ignoring the fact that he had a muffler connected
with his metal steed.

And as Elmer whirled around the curve he looked eagerly
ahead. At first he saw nothing save a long stretch of
road that seemed to mellow as it dropped a little in the
distance. Was it possible that Lil Artha could have passed
beyond the extreme limit of observation? If so, then the
deduction he had made as to the length of time elapsing
since that footprint was made could not have been the
true one.

Ah, what was that moving there under the trees about
half a mile ahead, and just before the road took its slight
downward pitch? Surely he had seen something rise and
fall with regularity; and it could hardly be a branch.

The object caught his eye again. It was red, and Elmer
suddenly remembered that Lil Artha always made it a
point to carry a couple of big red bandana handkerchiefs
along with him when about to indulge in any game,
whether baseball, football or a fishing excursion that entailed
a long walk.[95]

Yes, surely that must be their comrade, who, hearing the
familiar explosion of the motorcycle engines, and possibly
guessing that some of the Hickory Ridge boys were following
on his trail, had stepped aside to let them pass. And
that waving of the red flag was not intended as a signal
of warning, but simply Lil Artha's method of greeting his
mates as they flew by.

He could see the tall figure plainly now, and even note
how he carried his khaki jacket over his left arm, as the
evening was anything but cool.

And Elmer felt a thrill of satisfaction as he realized that
after all their troubles on the way they had finally come
to the point where they were about to join forces with the
gallant fellow who was on his thirty-sixth mile and still
set upon arriving at Little Falls long before dawn closed
the contest.

Lil Artha stood at attention. He had recognized in the
leading figure the assistant scout master of the troop, and,
like a good scout, believed in paying him the respect due
his office. Under ordinary circumstances they were chums
and ready to indulge in any sort of rough-and-tumble
boyish wrestle, but when on duty it must always be a different
thing.

So, as his hand came up in the regular scout salute,
Lil Artha was surprised to see that the other was bringing
his motorcycle to a slow down, as were also those in
the rear, whom he now recognized as Toby and Nat.

Apparently, then, they intended to stop and speak with
him, perhaps with the idea of giving him fresh courage to
plod along over the ten miles or so that still remained
between himself and his destination.

Nothing averse to having a little chat with his chums[96]
as he walked along, the tall scout stepped out from under
the overshadowing branches of the tree.

"Hello, fellows!" he remarked. "Say, this is mighty
nice in you, hunting me up just to say howdy and wish
me luck. What's the news back along the line?"

"All pins down in this alley but one other besides you,
Lil Artha," said Toby, quickly.

"And I bet you I know who that chap is       he comes
from Fairfield and his name is Felix Wagner. How'd I
get on to that? Why, what's the use of telephones if you
don't use 'em? I called up and found out, you see.
But don't you worry one minute. Why, I ain't near
played out. Fact is, fellows, I'm getting my second wind,
and right now I'm good for another thirty without stopping."

"Gee, you are a wonder, all right!" exclaimed Nat, admiringly.

"But listen, Lil Artha," said Elmer as they walked on
in company, those who had motorcycles trundling them
along; "we've followed you all the way from Hickory
Ridge, which we left at four to-day, just to warn you that
you're in danger of being kidnaped!"

"What!" exclaimed the tall scout, evidently astounded.
"Say that again, won't you, Elmer? Me kidnaped!
Say, are you joshing me now or what? Open up
and tell me."



[97]
CHAPTER XI.

THE HOWL OF THE WOLF SIGNAL.


"Well, I like that, now!" burst out Toby. "He thinks
we've run all the way from good old Hickory Ridge, thirty-five
miles away and more, just to hand him a string."

"And me taking all the dreadful chances of breaking
my neck with this cranky machine that's got into its second
childhood!" echoed Nat, indignantly.

Elmer paid no attention to these side remarks. He could
easily understand just how Lil Artha looked at things.
Not having the slightest suspicion concerning any crooked
work in connection with the great hike, he could not comprehend
what was meant by "kidnaping" him.

"Just what we're here for, old fellow," he remarked.
"In the first place, perhaps you know it, and again you
may not; but Mr. Garrabrant sent these two good scouts
over to Fairfield on their motorcycles to take notes of the
start made by the three fellows who meant to compete
with us in this event."

"Yes, I knew about that," muttered Lil Artha.

"All right," Elmer continued. "They performed their
duties, and then, according to orders, hung around to find
out whether there might be any talk about some of those
famous tricks that used to be played when Matt Tubbs
was running things with a high hand over there."

"But hasn't Matt turned over a new leaf; did Mr. Garrabrant
expect that it was all a make believe with him?"
asked the other, quickly.[98]

"No," said the scout leader; "so far as we can tell,
Matt is in dead earnest about doing the right thing from
now on. I reckon he'd be as mad as hops if he heard
what some of his old mates have arranged."

"Well, hurry on and tell me, please, Elmer; I'm as
curious as any old woman you ever ran across," and Lil
Artha laughed as he said this.

"Late in the afternoon they happened to overhear a
talk between two Fairfield boys, and then and there learned
about the scheme. It seems that four fellows in a car had
already been gone an hour. They were to run up to the
head of the line, and find out just how things lay. If a
Fairfield competitor was running in the lead, of course
nothing would happen; but in case it proved to be a Hickory
Ridge scout they had their orders."

"But see here, Elmer, wouldn't that knock them out of
the organization. The rules of the scouts wouldn't stand
for such an outrage," protested Lil Artha.

"Hold on, Lil Artha," interrupted Elmer. "You don't
seem to get on to the real facts. Nobody said a word about
any scouts being connected with this thing."

"Outsiders, then, you mean, Elmer?"

"Yes, some of the crowd that used to run with Matt
Tubbs when he was the terror of the county. You know
they broke with him at the time he saw a great light. Some
of the best in the bunch followed him into the Fairfield
troop. Others laughed at the idea of turning over a new
leaf. And they say there's a new bully cropped up in
Fairfield, a fellow who used to sneeze in the old days every
time Matt took snuff."

"Yes," said Lil Artha, "I know       Eddie Johnston; and
a bad egg he is, too."

"Well," went on Elmer; "he's engineering this deal.[99]
The idea is that these four fellows will try to coax you to
enter their ear for a lift, promising that nobody will ever
hear about it, you see."

"But they ought to know I'd laugh at 'em. I'm good
for the rest of the hike, and could put on fresh speed if I
sighted any feller coming along to bother me," the tall
scout declared.

"Well, in that case they had orders to jump you, get
you in the car by force, and carry you off, to drop you
ten miles away, perhaps at Little Falls. In that way, you
see, Lil Artha, you would be eliminated from the game,
because you had entered a vehicle, which is against the
rules. And the second one in the race would win. That
must be Felix Wagner."

"Does he know about this?" demanded the excited
scout, frowning.

"Of course," answered Elmer, "we don't feel sure
about it; but the chances are he doesn't. No fellow who
has his heart in the true principles the scout movement
stands for, could take a hand in such a nasty game. And
I'm hoping that if Felix learned what has been done he'd
be the very first to declare that he wouldn't accept a
tainted title!"

"Good for you, Elmer! I don't know Felix very well
myself, but I want to think of him in that way, because
he's a fellow scout. But look here. I guess I saw the bunch
you speak of pass me by only a little while back."

"Yes, I knew they had gone on ahead, because I saw
that in several places your footprint was plainly marked
in the tread of the auto tire in the mud," said the scout
leader, quietly.

"Well, I declare now, if you don't beat anything in
finding out them tricks!" remarked Lil Artha, who frequently[100]
forgot there was such a thing as grammar in the
wide world. "Nobody else'd think of that way. The rest
of us have got heaps to learn. But I only saw two fellers
in the car, Elmer."

"Oh, well, perhaps the others were hiding low down
for a purpose," returned the one who observed things
closely and figured out results. "If they all showed
themselves you would be apt to know them later when they
started in with their rough-house business."

"Then what d'ye think they mean to do?" asked the
tall scout, anxiously; at the same time Toby and Nat noticed
that his hands were doubling up into fists, as if the old
spirit of self-defense had begun to run riot within him.

"They've gone down the road a few miles to some
place that looks good to them. Then, I reckon, the bunch
will pile out and hide till you come along. And while
they're about it, they may disguise their faces in some way
with handkerchiefs. When fellows are in for something
that won't bear the light of day, they nearly always do
that, don't you know, Lil Artha?"

"Sure I do," nodded the tall scout, promptly. "More'n
a few times I've done the same myself, and so has Toby
here. But all the same it's a mean dodge to try and cheat
me out of my honest dues. What're we goin' to do about
it, Elmer?"

"It stands to reason that we don't mean to let the game
go through," replied the one addressed, frowning. "I'm
as much opposed to violence as any fellow could be; but
there may come times when even the scout is justified in
using his fists. Mr. Garrabrant says so; and if he was here,
even if he is a man of peace, he'd say the same."

"That's right Elmer; I've heard him say that myself,
and he'd laugh right out when he declared that he was[101]
a man of peace, and that he was bound to have peace even
if he had to fight to get it," chuckled Toby.

"All right," snapped Elmer. "We must remember
that we're up against a condition that can only be met by
standing up for our rights. If those four rascals from
Fairfield tried to push Lil Artha into their car against
his will, he'd be justified in kicking and striking out in
defense of his liberty, wouldn't he, scout law or not?
And on the same ground, we, as his comrades, have the
right to defend him."

"And by ginger we will!" burst out Toby, triumphantly.

"Make your mind easy on that, Lil Artha," declared
Nat; "we haven't run all the way from Hickory Ridge
to see our chum badly treated without putting in a few
good licks for him. Gee, it will seem like old times! My
style is getting rusty, and will need some sandpapering,
I guess."

"Of course, talk won't amount to a row of pins," said
Elmer.

"Not with that kind of skunks it won't," observed Lil
Artha.

"As Mr. Garrabrant isn't here, and I stand in his place,
I'll have to try and do what I think he'd commend,"
Elmer went on.

"About that peace racket, even if you have to fight to
get it, eh?" laughed Nat.

"Wait and see," replied the scout leader, nodding his
head, and giving the other a significant, look that made
Nat's heart glad; for, like Red Huggins, Nat had always
had something of a reputation as a fighter, and found it
most difficult to repress this pugnacious spirit after he
joined the scouts.[102]

"Lay out the programme, Elmer, won't you, please?"
begged Lil Artha.

"Yes, tell us just what each fellow must do," added
Toby.

"Well, I've been thinking it over as we came along,"
remarked the one to whom these appeals were addressed;
"and this is the plan I settled on as promising the best
results. In the first place, as these chaps want darkness
before they show their hand, so that Lil Artha won't be
apt to recognize them, the chances are they've gone several
miles farther on before running the car in among the
trees at a likely spot. Do you agree on that, boys?"

"Sounds good to me, Elmer; please go on and roll your
hoop," said Nat.

"Beats all how you can hit things so close," remarked
Toby; "because, now that you've mentioned it, I c'n see
how they'd be apt to do just that very thing."

"I'm agreein' with the rest, so keep moving, Elmer,"
Lil Artha observed, deeply interested in the results, as he
had a right to be.

"Well, then, suppose now we ride on behind Lil Artha
for another mile. Then he can hold up when I give a
little whistle, or he hears the faint howl of a wolf in the
distance. The three of us will then proceed to hide our
motorcycles somewhere in the woods, marking the place
at the roadside so we can find 'em again easy later on to-night.
After that we'll haul upon our chum, and keep
a little distance behind him as he tramps on toward Little
Falls."

"Bully idea!" declared the object of all this attention,
shaking the hand of the one who had suggested it. "And
a feller don't have to have more'n two eyes, with a mite[103]
of common sense back of 'em, to know what's goin' to
happen when the Fairfield bullies jump out on me."

"Whack! whack! that's two down; one with the right,
and t'other with the left duke, leaving only two for you
three boys," declared Nat, making a violent lunge in either
direction, as though getting in trim after these months of
idleness, when following the mild paths of peace.

Toby laughed.

"Say, what d'ye suppose we'll be doing all that while?"
he demanded. "Don't be so greedy, Nathan. It's one
apiece all around. Nothin' could be fairer than that, and
I put it up to Elmer here. Who wants to get cheated out
of his share, tell me that!"

"I reckon that ought to be understood in the beginning,"
remarked Elmer, dryly. "Get this notion out of
your heads, fellows. All we want is to protect Lil Artha.
If talking would do it I'd say leave it to me entirely;
but we all know it needs something stronger. So let each
fellow try to capture one of the bunch in ambush and hold
him. Perhaps they'll skedaddle as soon as they see us
coming, and the job will be done without one blow."

"But if they do resist when we're trying to defend our
chum, what then?" asked Nat, with the most agonizing
appeal in his voice, as though he saw his dearest hopes
fading, fading gradually away.

"Oh, that goes without saying," chuckled Elmer. "I
don't think there's any real need of my giving you fellows
orders along that line, because you know what the only
remedy is. Only, please don't forget for one minute that
you are scouts, and as such should hold your hand the
instant the white flag goes up."

"Sure we will, Elmer, if we see it!" chuckled Nat. "You
make me happy again. Gee! I was afraid you might say[104]
that under no circumstances was a poor fellow allowed to
defend himself       that, like a lot of old women, all we could
do was to grab an enemy and hold on, no matter how he
scratched and bit and gouged. It's all right. We've got
our orders, fellows. Nuff said."

All this time they had been walking at a rather stiff
pace along the road that led in the direction of Little Falls,
distant something like nine miles. When Lil Artha had
said that he believed he was in possession of his second
wind, he evidently knew what he was talking about. At
least the others were hard pushed to keep up with the long-legged
contestant, hampered as they were by their heavy
machines, which had to be trundled along with considerable
effort.

"Fall back and mount, fellows," said Elmer; "and
you, Lil Artha, keep listening for the signal to wait for
us. Only a mile do we dare keep going; to get closer to
the place of ambush might betray us, as they would hear
the explosions from one of these machines, the muffler of
which never works decently. Get that?"

"It's as plain as the nose on my face, and nobody can
miss that," replied the other, as he started off along the
road.

Elmer cautioned his comrades to make as little racket as
possible, and presently they followed on their motorcycles.

About ten minutes later a low, weird sound floated
through the air. To most persons it would have meant
that some farmer's watchdog was uneasy, and baying at
the stars; but Lil Artha knew better.

It was intended for the howl of the wolf, the sign of his
patrol!



[105]
CHAPTER XII.

THE AMBUSH.


"I see him, Elmer," whispered Toby.

"Couldn't be anybody else," chuckled Nat, "because
Lil Artha is as tall as a house, you know."

The contestant representing the Hickory Ridge scouts
was standing there in the middle of the road, waiting for
them to come up.

"Is it time, Elmer?" he asked, anxiously, as the other
three joined him.

The gloaming was about them; indeed, since the heavens
were beginning to be overshadowed by clouds, the dusk
had already commenced to settle, earlier than usual in the
end of August.

It had been a pretty fair day, but there was no telling
what the night might bring forth; and Lil Artha, wisely
looking ahead to a possible thunder-storm about midnight,
was determined to complete his long hike as early as
possible.

"Yes," replied the leader of the Wolf Patrol, quietly.
"We're going to hide our machines somewhere about here,
where we can find them when we need them a little
later."

"And you want me to hold up till you're ready?"
asked Lil Artha.

"That's the programme," came the reply. "You see,
we expect that the four hold-up fellows must be hidden
only a little farther along; and we want to have our part[106]
of the game fixed. Just sit down here, Lil Artha, and we'll
be back again in a jiffy."

"Well, if it's all the same to you, Elmer, I think I'll
keep on standing," replied the tall boy, with a chuckle.

"Oh, all right," replied Elmer; "you're the doctor,
and ought to know what's best for your own case. Just
wait for us here. Come along, fellows, and bring your
motorcycles with you."

Of course there was no mystery about the refusal of
Lil Artha to sit down. He knew from past experiences
how difficult it is to get in working order again at such
a stage in a long hike should he give way to the temptation
and drop upon the ground. It was better to keep
moving, and not allow any of his muscles to get stiffened.

Following Elmer, the others pushed into the woods on
the right, where the scout leader seemed to think the conditions
looked best for the hiding of the three machines.

It was not a hard task to secrete them in the bushes.

"Hope it don't rain before we come back again," remarked
Toby, as he came out from the thicket where he
had placed his motorcycle as carefully as though it were
a brand-new one; for on account of its recent fairly decent
performances the boy began to feel a return of his former
affection for the wheel.

"We'll have to take the chances on that," replied
Elmer. "These clouds may not stand for anything,
after all."

"Often tries a big bluff like that," remarked Nat; "so
we ain't going to worry about it. Besides, if the little
circus is soon over, we can come here to get the bunch
before long."

"Back to the road then, fellows," Toby observed, leading
off with confidence.[107]

A minute later Nat broke out again:

"Say, what d'ye know about this?" he remarked.
"Don't seem a bit familiar to me along here. What're
you laughing at, Elmer? Has Toby led us the wrong
way?"

"Rats!" exclaimed that worthy, bristling up in indignation.
"Don't you suppose I know what I'm about?
Of course this is the right way to the road, ain't it,
Elmer?"

"You might get there, if you kept on long enough!"
admitted the other.

"But how far would we have to go?" demanded the
incredulous Nat.

"Oh, about twenty-five thousand miles, more or less,"
chuckled Elmer.

"Gee, he's turned right around and is heading away
from the road, that's what," declared Nat, laughing softly.
"A nice guide you'd be, Toby, old chum. Think of us
floundering deeper and deeper into these blessed old
woods, when every minute is worth a heap to us right
now!"

"But what did you let me do it for, Elmer?" complained
the culprit.

"Well, you started off as if you wanted to show us
what you know about woodcraft; and I thought the chance
to open your eyes a little too good to be lost," Elmer
replied.

"But we've wasted time by it," declared Toby, feeling
disheartened.

"Only a minute or two, and that doesn't count much
beside the lesson it may be to a couple of scouts I know,"
said Elmer.[108]

"Tell us just how you know which way the road lies,"
said Nat.

"Oh, that is as easy as falling off a log," came the
crushing reply. "I just kept my eyes about me when
we were coming in, and noted that we were moving due
east at the time, with the breeze exactly on our right, and
you remember it was coming out of the south a bit ago.
If it had been daylight I'd have known the points of the
compass from the direction of the sun; or, that failing,
by the moss that nearly always grows on the north side of
the trunks of forest trees. There are many ways for a
wide-awake boy to find out these things; but only when he
keeps his wits about him all the time, and his eyes and
ears open."

"I guess you're right, Elmer," grunted Toby. "Time
I woke up and began to do some tall thinking, if ever I'm
going to get out of the greenhorn class."

While the three were talking after this fashion, in low,
cautious tones, Elmer had been leading the way in a confident
fashion through the gloomy woods.

Both the others were now more than a little curious to
ascertain just how near the point where they had left Lil
Artha their guide would fetch up. So far as they themselves
were concerned it was by this time all a confused
jumble. If asked to point out the proper direction neither
could have done better than shut his eyes and thrust out
a hand at random; for they were very much turned
around, now that the clouds had rendered it impossible
for them to even decide which direction was west.

"Well, I declare!" ejaculated Toby, presently, "here's
the bally old road, as sure as you're born, Nat!"

"Elmer!" said a low voice, as some object moved
near by.[109]

"And better still, here's Lil Artha!" declared Nat, lost
in wonder as to how Elmer could have done such a remarkable
stunt, and with hardly an effort, too.

"Sure," came in the same low tone. "Where else
should he be but here just where you left him? But say,
Elmer, you were gone a long time."

"Not a bit over five or six minutes," replied the leader,
immediately; "and even then, we've had quite a lesson in
woodcraft. Besides, Felix is half an hour behind, and
there's little danger of his catching up, yet awhile."

"Do we start on again now?" asked Nat, who was opening
and shutting his hands nervously in a way that might
have excited the scout leader's suspicions had he been able
to notice the movement.

"Yes, we're going to set the stage now for the last little
scene in this act of the drama entitled the Great Hike
Conspiracy," chuckled Elmer.

"That sounds good to me," murmured Nat.

"Go on, Elmer, and tell us just what you want us all
to do," urged Lil Artha.

"First of all, you are to start on again, just as before,
Lil Artha."

"Yes, I get that all right," replied the tall lad.

"And the rest of us will shadow you," Elmer continued.

"I don't quite understand what you mean, Elmer; will
you keep a certain distance behind me all the time?" Lil
Artha asked.

"You can make up your mind that we'll be close enough
every minute to hear you whistle steadily as you trudge
along," came the reassuring reply.

"And that means you'll get on to what they say to me
when they show their hand: eh, Elmer?"

"Just what it does, Lil Artha," the leader answered.[110]

"Fact is, I want to hear that little dialogue or conversation
the worst way. Because, you see, we may have to
repeat this story a few times later on, and we'd like to be
able to have it all down pat."

"Well, what happens then after they show their
teeth?" questioned the tall boy.

"You make up your mind which one of the lot you
like best, and hang on to him with tooth and nail, as if
you thought he was your long-lost brother. Get that, Lil
Artha?" Elmer continued.

"I understand," came the reply. "You want me to
count for one hold-up, so as to leave the other three to you
fellows?"

"Well, you wouldn't be greedy, would you, and cheat
us out of all the fun, after we've come all this long way,
and risked breaking out necks time and time again?" remarked
Nat, reproachfully.

"He understands, Nat," remarked Elmer, pouring oil
on the troubled waters as he frequently did when little
frictions arose in the khaki troop. "And there's no need
of wasting any more time. Be off, Lil Artha, and success
to you."

"Same here, fellows," came the merry reply; "and
more power to your elbow, Nat"; from which last remark
it was very evident that Lil Artha knew full well
the impulsive character of the Scott boy, and how his
desire to engage in "scraps" had not as yet been wholly
tamed down by his becoming a scout in good standing.

Nat's father was the principal of the public schools in
Hickory Ridge; and from the time that Nat started to
attend he had possibly given the professor as much trouble
as any lad in the whole town. Not that Nat was naturally
bad, but his quick temper, and readiness to use his fists[111]
to settle argument, had drawn him into innumerable
scrapes.

Accordingly, Lil Artha once more started along the
darkening road, swinging out with those long strides which
his length made possible.

Elmer calculated to a nicety just how far they ought to
allow their chum to get before starting to follow. It was
important that they should be concealed from the eyes of
the four in ambush; and yet, on the other hand, he did
not want to drop back to such a distance that they might
be cheated out of hearing what happened when the surprise
came.

In order to maintain a certain distance in the rear he
had instructed the one ahead to keep up a steady whistle.
Lil Artha was known to be a whistler, and often amused
his chums by his accomplishment in this line. It was a
gift, such as an occasional boy finds himself in possession
of. And more than once had Elmer told his friend that
he would make a good woodsman if only he turned his
talent toward imitating the various clear sweet notes of
wild birds.

They could hear him easily now, and Elmer fixed the
sound in his mind. As he had cautioned Lil Artha to keep
up a steady flow, it would become apparent that they were
either diminishing the distance or adding to it, if that
whistle became louder or softer in volume.

Five minutes passed.

Elmer caught a big sigh close beside him, which he knew
must proceed from the impetuous Nat. Doubtless every
sixty seconds that dragged by seemed like an age to the
Scott boy; who fancied that after all their trouble perhaps
they were going to be cheated out of their fun, and
that the plotters had weakened at the last round.[112]

Not so Elmer, who estimated things at their true value,
and not by the rapid pulsations of an excited heart.

"Cheer up, Nat," he whispered in the ear of the other;
"it's going to come pretty soon now."

"Oh, I hope so!" sighed the one who loved action above
all things.

"He's stopped whistling, Elmer!" whispered Toby, excitedly.

"No, there he starts again," replied the leader, who in
truth suspected what the little break in Lil Artha's melody
might signify.

Possibly he had caught some suspicious rustling sound,
and unconsciously held his breath for just five seconds in
order to listen better.

Was it a false alarm, or would the music begin immediately?
Warned by this suggestive hint, Elmer waited,
fully expecting to hear a loud voice suddenly break forth
from some point ahead. Since this was not "Out West"
where lawless desperadoes held sway, it would hardly come
in a hoarse demand to "throw up your hands," but in
some milder fashion.

And presently Elmer realized that his guess had hit the
mark. The whistle suddenly ceased. Then they heard a
voice call out in the most familiar way possible:

"Hello, there, Lil Artha! Hold up a bit, won't you?"



[113]
CHAPTER XIII.

FRIENDS IN TIME OF NEED.


A nervous hand gripped the sleeve of Elmer's jacket.

Nat was trembling with suspense; and doubtless Toby,
on the other hand, was almost as badly off. Elmer had
come to a halt as the sound of that voice reached them;
but it was for only a fraction of a minute. He knew
that it was policy on their part to creep up, foot by foot;
because, when Lil Artha wanted help he would need it in
a hurry. If they were too far away perhaps those energetic
Fairfield plotters might be able to throw the tall
lad into the car, and start going; when, as Nat might have
expressed it, "the fat would be in the fire."

"Why, hello! Who's that?" they heard Lil Artha
reply, in the most natural tone any fellow could display.

Of course he ought to show surprise at being suddenly
hailed from the bushes so far away from home, and by
some one familiar with his name.

Evidently the quartette at that came out of hiding and
surrounded the tall lad; for his next exclamation seemed
to announce this fact.

"Four of you, hey? Well, this is nice of you, boys,
to come all this way just to give me a good word of
cheer!" he remarked.

"Hold up, don't be in such a hurry to get along, Lil
Artha," said one who seemed to be the leader of the lot.

"But how do I know how close some other fellow may
be on my heels!" remarked the tall lad; although he evidently[114]
did not make any further attempt to brush past
them.

"Say, that's just it!" declared the unknown, who, no
doubt, had his hat pulled down over his face, and depended
on this, as well as the gathering gloom of approaching
night, to conceal his identity. "There is a Fairfield fellow
hot on your trail, and he's bound to beat you out, because
he's got his second wind."

"Yes," spoke up another, quickly, chuckling at the same
time; "that's what we're bothered about, Lil Artha. We
just can't bear the idea of you being beat to a frazzle
by Felix Wagner."

"But I don't mean to be, you know, boys," expostulated
the tall boy. "Little Falls ain't mor'n nine miles ahead;
and if Felix has got his second wind, I'm in the same boat
myself. Count on me to get there ahead of him, fellows!"

"But you might have an accident, stub your toe or
something like that," declared the leader of the opposition.

"So might Felix," remarked Lil Artha, cheerfully.

"Yes, that's so," came the reply; "but you don't know
the luck of that Dutchman. Everything comes his way,
Lil Artha."

"Well, this hike won't, bet you a cookey!" remarked
the other, stubbornly.

"He's right behind you, and coming like a house afire."

"Then what in the dickens are you keeping me waiting
here for?" demanded Lil Artha, indignantly.

"I'll tell you," replied the leader of the four, mysteriously.

"Hurry up, then, and let me go ahead," ordered the
tall lad.

"We've been talking it over, you see," began the other.

"It's plain enough that talking is something in your[115]
trade," commented Lil Artha, bitterly; and Elmer heard
Toby alongside him chuckle softly, as though he might be
enjoying these caustic remarks of their tall chum mightily.

"And we've come to a conclusion, Lil Artha," went on
the other, as though he was not to be moved by any thrusts
from the tongue of the contestant.

"All right. Glad you've come to something. Hurry up
and spit it out, and then give me a clear road, won't
you?" the one who was being held up remarked, sharply.

"The honor of good old Hickory Ridge is at stake,"
continued the unknown, in a solemn tone that suggested
graveyards and all that sort of thing, Chatz Maxfield
would have declared.

"Sure it is, and if you don't let up on this business it'll
go aglimmering. I want to walk, I tell you," declared
Lil Artha.

"Hold on, now. Easy, Lil Artha. We represent a
committee of the Hickory Ridge boys, and have been sent
out to make dead sure that you win this big hike; d'ye
get on to that, now?"

"Well, it sounds all right, but for the life of me I can't
place you among all the fellows I know," returned Lil
Artha, suspiciously.

"Never mind about that; it don't cut any figure in the
matter at all. Fact is, none of us want you to know us.
Then you won't be able to give the game away."

"Game? What's that mean?" demanded the other.
"Open up here, and show your hand, won't you?"

"We want to help you on your weary way, Lil Artha."

"With cheery words and all that?" queried the one addressed,
with something of a sneer showing in his tone.

"Shucks! Something that counts better than cheery[116]
words. We've got a bully old car right here, Lil Artha.
You can see it if you look."

"Well, I see it all right," returned the Hickory Ridge
scout; "but what's that got to do with a fellow that's
on a long walk, and anxious to get to the end of his journey,
tell me that?"

"Huh, a heap, Lil Artha; and you must be silly not to
see through a grindstone that's got such a big hole in it.
What's a car made for, anyway?" demanded the leader
of the ambushing party, while his comrades laughed
harshly.

"Look here, what're you hinting at?" asked Lil Artha.
"You don't want me to get in there with you, I hope?"

"Plenty of room for six, and there's only four along,
Lil Artha."

"But I don't need any help that way," protested the
tall boy, angrily. "I tell you I'm good for hours of hard
grind yet. Not one chance in sixty of me losing out to
that Felix Wagner. I don't care what sort of a hustle
he's got on him. Just you clear the track, and watch my
smoke, that's all."

"But we fellows of Hickory Ridge don't want to take
the chances. Here's a bully opening for you to be carried
along five miles in as many minutes. Then we'll set you
down, and you can finish the hike into Little Falls as fresh
as a daisy. You'll do it, Lil Artha, of course you will?"

"Of course I won't, and you hear me warble at that!"
roared the tall boy, furiously. "What's more, I don't
believe a single one of you live in Hickory Ridge. Just let
me strike a match and have a look at your faces. Then
perhaps I'll believe you mean honest, even if I can't take
up your offer."

There was a slight scuffle at this. Evidently Lil Artha[117]
had attempted to put his suggestion into practice; but
a ready hand had knocked the match out of his grasp just
as he struck it. There was a sudden gleam of light, and
then darkness again.

"No, you don't, old fellow," said a voice that was now
tinged with anger. "None of that funny business goes
with us, does it, boys?"

"Nixey, not this time," replied one.

"Quit kidding, and make him be good," growled another,
who plainly had tired of the game as far as it had
gone and wanted to be on the move.

"What's this mean?" demanded Lil Artha, just as
though he could not as yet get the true facts through his
fuddled brain.

"The bird that can sing and won't, must be made to
sing, they say," growled the fellow who seemed to take
the lead in the abduction game.

"Grab him, boys, and jam him in the car; that's the
only way!" burst out a second of the quartette.

"Hold on here, do you know what this means?" asked
the one who was being threatened in this fashion. "It's
an outrage to stop me like this. And when you say you're
from Hickory Ridge, you lie, that's what! You're a bunch
of Fairfield cowards, and you're only trying to make me
break the rules of the game so that I can't win! I'm on
to your dodge, and don't you forget it!"

A series of scornful laughs greeted these words. Evidently
the hold-up fellows felt so very sure that they had
things in their hands that they could afford to delay a
little; just as the cat, not feeling particularly hungry, will
play with the mouse that has been maimed.

"Listen to him, will you?" jeered one.

"He's on, all right, fellows," exclaimed another; "he[118]
sees through the dodge, does Lil Artha. Oh, ain't it a
great thing to be a scout, and use your brains! But all
the same, we don't expect to let our big friend have his
way, do we, boys?"

Of course they were clustered around the Hickory Ridge
scout, cutting off all avenues of escape, even if Lil Artha
should conceive the idea of running away.

"Not much, we don't," echoed another.

"Keep your hands off me now, I warn you all!"
shouted the tall boy, aggressively; but in reality his words
were intended to inform Elmer, Toby and Nat just how
far events had progressed, so that they might arrange
their movements accordingly.

"Are you going to get aboard?" demanded the leader,
harshly.

"You mean of my own free will?" asked Lil Artha,
fighting for a little time, so that he could make sure of
having his chums come up for the crisis.

"Yes, climb in, Lil Artha!"

"I refuse; and defy the whole bunch of you. I'm going
to stick to the rules of the game; and you can't make me
change my mind. Bah!" the tall scout shouted.

"Tackle him, and if he fights back, don't be too gentle
with the big cub. He's going to be carried five miles and
more, whether he wants to go or not!"

As the leader snapped this out there were heard sounds
of a scuffle. No need of daylight to tell those who were
crouching so close at hand what was taking place.

Grunts and low exclamations told that Lil Artha was
doing his level best to resist the onslaught of the four Fairfield
rowdies.

Still, the tall scout from the Ridge was only a boy after
all; and if those opposed to him were less lengthy, that was[119]
no reason they lacked in physical powers. And left to
himself, there could have been no doubt in the world but
that after a gallant resistance Lil Artha would have found
himself bundled into the car, possibly bearing numerous
cuts and contusions on his body as mute witnesses to the
fight he had put up.

And once they had him in the tonneau, three could hold
him tight while the other fellow started the machine.
After that it would have been "one, two, three," in the
language of Lil Artha himself, so far as his right to
claim the prize of the great hike was concerned.

There could be no doubt but that the boy who was thus
attacked was following out the suggestions given by his
patrol leader. This was made evident by the loud cries
of the fellow whose voice proclaimed him as being the
leader of the attacking squad.

"Pull him off, there, can't you?" he yelled. "He's
hugging me like fun, and got his long arms twisted around
my neck. Hi, there! somebody give him a jerk before he
chokes me! Knock him in the ribs, and make him let go,
fellows!"

Nothing could hold Nat Scott back after that. The
sound of battle acted on him just as the smoke of burnt
powder is said to affect a horse that is accustomed to the
roar of mighty conflict.

Nor did Elmer have the slightest idea of trying to keep
either of his chums in restraint longer. The crisis had
arrived, and Lil Artha needed their help, lest he be bodily
kidnaped and carried away in that car.

So they swiftly bore down upon the scene of the fracas.
In the gathering darkness they could just manage to distinguish
a group of wildly struggling figures; for Lil
Artha had one of the ambushing party in his embrace,[120]
and the other three were vainly endeavoring to make him
break his hold.

"Remember, one apiece!" Elmer said, as they arrived
on the spot.

Up to that second none of the Fairfield fellows had the
slightest suspicion that their miserable game had reached
a snag. One happened to discover the coming of a single
figure, and apparently the only thought that flashed
through his mind was that the next nearest contestant had
somehow managed to arrive on the spot ahead of scheduled
time; for he immediately began to shout aloud:

"Keep your hands off, Felix; this is our job, and you
don't want to know anything about it. Go right along the
road now, and close your eyes and ears. You've got a
snap, and a soft one at that. Here, let go of me, you fool!
We're your friends, d'ye hear! Quit it, I tell you! Wow!
What's this mean, fellows?" And the one who was making
all this outcry suddenly changed his tune from indignation
to fright, as he noticed other vigorous forms attacking
his companions.



[121]
CHAPTER XIV.

HOW THE PLOT FAILED.


"Help, help! he's choking me! Pull him off, you fools,
can't you?" shouted the valiant leader of the four, who
had planned to have all this fun with Lil Artha, and now
found that the shoe was on the other foot, since it seemed
to be the tall scout who was enjoying a monopoly of the
sport.

But instead of his mates obeying, he found that they
had suddenly ceased in what efforts they were putting
forth. The mystery was not difficult to solve, because
every fellow had enough to do defending himself against
an assailant who had apparently sprung from the darkness.

It was a lively scene for a short time. The Fairfield
fellows understood that in some miserable way their scheme
must have become known to the Hickory Ridge scouts.
Perhaps they heard Toby call out the name of Elmer when
asking what he was to do with the fellow on whose back
he had lodged with the tenacity that the Old Man of the
Sea exhibited when he refused to let Sinbad the Sailor put
him down.

They struggled hard, but it was no longer with the idea
of completing their cowardly plan. All thought of carrying
Lil Artha off in the car was now abandoned, and
each and every Fairfield fellow only considered his individual
chances for making what Nat called a "get-away."

Speaking of Nat, that worthy was really and truly
happy. Old times had come back again, and once more[122]
were his muscles being allowed to play their part in a
struggle for the mastery.

He had early picked out the victim whom he felt called
upon to punish. If pugnacious Nat could only have had
his sweet way about the matter, that party would undoubtedly
have been the leader of the four Fairfield
schemers; but since Lil Artha already had that worthy "in
chancery," as it is called when one gets his opponent's
head under his arm and in a position of abject helplessness,
Nat had to content himself with selecting a less prominent
foeman.

What happened just then and there it would be hardly
fair to state, because of the fact that Nat was a scout in
good standing. But there were several loud thumps heard,
and somebody seemed to pick himself up from the road
twice, only to suddenly sit down again, with more grunts
and finally decline to get up at all. Upon which Nat
danced around him, making threatening gestures, and
actually daring the alarmed plotter to try and get on his
feet again.

Elmer, on his part, had happened to lay hold of a very
slippery customer. The Hickory Ridge scout did not want
to hurt the fellow any more than he could help; but at the
same time he was bound to do all in his power to hold him;
for he meant to take a look at every one of their faces, so
that he could tell them again.

Twice the other had come close to slipping out of his
clutches, despite the grip Elmer had upon him. The second
occasion was when with some sort of movement, which he
had possibly practiced until he had it down fine, the boy
suddenly drew his arms out of the sleeves of his coat, and
was in the act of darting away when Elmer threw out a
foot and tripped him.[123]

Again he pounced on the other, and this time managed to
get a good grip, so as to be able to exert himself. The
consequence was that he spun the Fairfield chap around
on his back and was able to place a knee on his chest.

"Now, lie still, you, unless you want to get hurt!"
Elmer exclaimed; and being by this time of the opinion
that he had run up against a buzz-saw in action, the panting
and defeated plotter gave in.

The clamor had for the most part ceased. Only Nat
seemed to be doing an Indian war dance around his prostrate
foeman and shaking his fist every little while in the
fellow's face.

"Don't hit me!" yelled the alarmed one. "I'm all in,
don't you see? I cave! I'm a prisoner, and scouts don't
dare hit a defenseless fellow, do they?"

"Aw, you make me think of a coward that would hide
behind a woman's skirts!" declared Nat, in disgust, because
his enjoyment had been so suddenly cut short by the
collapse of his opponent. "Why don't you stand up and
take your medicine like a little man? Just because I belong
to the scouts I ain't allowed to hand you what you'd
give me if you had the upper hand. It's tough, that's
what."

Possibly Nat might have been tempted beyond his powers
of resistance but for the fact of the patrol leader's presence.

"Hold up there, Nat, Toby, Lil Artha!" called out
Elmer just then. "How is the world treating you, fellows?"

"All to the good here," chuckled Toby, who was still
clinging to the back of his capture and showed no inclination
to let go.

"My pig looks like thirty cents!" said the tall scout
who, left to himself, had speedily reduced his opponent.[124]

"And mine is on the blink, too," declared Nat.

"Shucks, I ain't had hardly a mite of fun out of it all!
He laid down on me, that's what he did, Elmer."

"'Taint so," bawled the fellow, indignantly. "He just
went and knocked me down two times, and here he goes
now waving his old fist under my nose like he wanted to
do it some more. Call him off, Elmer, the game's all up
and we cave!"

"All right, boys, glad to hear it," sang out the patrol
leader; "but before we let you go we're bound to have a
look at every one of your faces, so we can know you again."

There was more or less muttering at this, for the Fairfield
boys began to see that they were doubtless in for considerable
unenviable publicity on account of the affair.
But beggars can seldom be choosers. They found themselves
helpless in the hands of their enemies, and must do
exactly what they were told.

So Elmer took out his match-safe and prepared to strike
a light.

"See if you know the fellow you've got hold of, boys,"
he called.

Then the little illumination flared up.

"I know this duck all right!" called out Toby. "He's
Dick Rawlings who used to play center field on the Fairfield
nine."

"And I've got Eddie Johnston, just as I expected!"
announced Lil Artha who, it will be remembered, had
seized upon the leader of the quartette by whom he had
been stopped on the road with the demand that he ride,
whether he wanted to do so or not.

"I don't seem to know this cowardly cub," declared Nat,
who had lighted a match on his own account, and bent low
over his prisoner. "He makes the worst faces you ever[125]
saw, just to keep me from knowing him again. Here, stop
your throwing your head around that way, or else you'll
get burned! Hey! what did I tell you? Got a little dose
of it then, did you? And one of your eyebrows singed
right off! Well, you will be a beaut for a while now, and
I reckon I can put my finger on you any time I want."

"You did that apurpose!" shouted the fellow on the
ground, glaring at the grinning Nat. "You just wanted
to mark me, that's what!"

"Oh, rats! Close your trap now and see how you can
run," laughed Nat, as he took a firm grip on the collar
of the other, and started to drag him up off the ground,
the fellow whimpering all the while as though he really expected
that he was going to be badly treated.

"Who's your bug, Elmer?" cried Lil Artha.

"I think his name is Sandy Coons; anyhow he's got
cross-eyes and that ought to mark him, if ever we want
to prove that he was here," replied the patrol leader, as
he assisted the fellow to get up.

"That's O. K., Elmer," declared Lil Artha. "Sandy
Coons has got a pair of the crookedest eyes ever; and if
you look close you'll see he's got a notch in his right ear.
I remember when he got that, too; a fellow he was with
pinned his ear to a tree with an arrow he fired, when they
were playing Buffalo Bill's Wild West, and when Sandy
tore loose it left a dent. Is it there, Elmer?"

"Sure as you live," laughed the other, as he looked.

"Then we know the whole cahoot of 'em," declared Lil
Artha, "And now, please hurry up and get 'em on the
jump, Elmer, because it's time I was hiking out again,
you understand."

"What're you going to do with us, fellows?" asked
the leader, as they were being ranged in line.[126]

"We're going to start you down the road to meet Felix
and tell him the game's all up," said Toby, who seemed to
believe the Fairfield competitor must be aware of the
scheme by means of which he was to be benefited; though
Elmer on his part thought better of the rival scout.

"But       our car is here," expostulated one of the prisoners.

"Then come back and get it later on; we don't mean
to run away with it. But if you take my advice, you'll
cut for home right away, because this thing has gone to
the limit. And anyone trying to hamper Lil Artha any
further is liable to get himself seriously hurt. Understand
that, all?" and Elmer allowed his voice to express the
indignation that surged through his soul.

"Aw, let us loose! You know we've thrown up the
sponge, and it's to the tall timber for the lot," grumbled
the leader.

Nat suddenly made a rapid movement. There was a cry,
and then a fellow started at a rapid pace along the road.
Nat, unable to hold in any longer, had given his prisoner the
start he promised, which, of course, meant a hearty kick.

Elmer let his captive go scot-free, which fact so aroused
the indignation of Nat that he darted after the fleeing
Sandy Coons, and by rapid work succeeded in placing his
number seven in the place where it would do the most good.
At least the others judged this from the agonized shriek
that floated back to their ears.

Lil Artha was quick to see a good thing and show his
appreciation. In his mind imitation was the sincerest flattery;
and accordingly the successor in the bully line to
Matt Tubbs was heard to loudly declare that he would
never, never cease to remember the long-legged scout; but[127]
upon hearing the aggressive Nat making in his direction
he, too, faded away.

That left only one to be treated, and this the chap whom
Toby had been riding as he might a horse. This fellow,
understanding that he was in for a good dose of the same
kind of medicine, began struggling again, hoping to upset
his captor and in some way make off without submitting
to that humiliating experience.

It was of no use, however. Lil Artha took hold of him,
and then told Toby to let go. There was some little confusion,
and then the fellow galloped madly up the road,
bellowing as though in pain.

"Did you get him?" asked Toby, eagerly.

"Well, I nearly broke my toe, because you see I'm wearing
light walking shoes on this hike. And how about you,
Toby?" laughed the tall one.

"Dick Rawlings won't play ball for a little while; till
he gets over his limp, anyway," answered the other.

"Field's clear now, Elmer, ain't it?" asked Lil Artha,
turning to the patrol leader for further orders.

"Yes, and the sooner you're off again the better, Lil
Artha," replied Elmer. "You see, that Felix has been
coming along all this while, and perhaps he may be nearer
than we think. How is it with you now; ready to put in
your best licks on the home stretch?"

"I'm just feeling as fresh as a daisy, Elmer," replied
the other. "This little business seems to have given me a
new appetite. You watch me just eat up the miles. Nine
of 'em, do you say? Shucks, I'll be in Little Falls before
two hours!"

"Bully for Lil Artha!" exclaimed Nat, clapping his
hands.

"Well, we'll put it out of the power of these fellows to[128]
pursue you any farther, by taking their spark plug along.
Ten to one they haven't got an extra plug with them. And,
Toby, Nat, we mustn't forget that we've got machines a
ways back here."

"That's right, Elmer. Do we get a move on us, and
go for 'em now?" asked Nat.

Lil Artha had already waved his hand at them, and
started off along the road at a stiff pace, which seemed
to emphasize the truth of what he had just said about
feeling as "fresh as a daisy."

"That's just what we're going to do," replied the other;
"so come along boys."

"Gee! I hope we happen to run foul of one of them
fellers again," laughed Nat.

"Don't be a hog, Nat," admonished Toby. "You had
ought to remember that now you belong to the scouts you've
got to be merciful."

"Ain't I?" protested the pugnacious one. "Didn't I
just kick that feller with the singed eyebrow, when I might
have punched his head? Guess I know my duty, Toby
Jones!"



[129]
CHAPTER XV.

VICTORY       SISS! BOOM! HURRAH!


Elmer was as good as his word. He knew how to cripple
the car, and in almost no time he had secured the vital
plug without which the machine was valueless for following
after Lil Artha, and making him any more trouble.

Then he and his two chums hurried back along the
road, meaning to look up their motorcycles; and once
mounted upon these they could speedily overtake Lil
Artha; to form a guard of honor about him while he covered
the last few miles of his long and adventurous hike,
that was to bring new glory to the khaki troop of Hickory
Ridge.

Nat ran on ahead. They knew full well that it was not
any eagerness to be the first to discover the marked spot
near which the machines had been secreted that influenced
him to do this, but some other motive, possibly not quite
so worthy of commendation.

But even Elmer did not say a word. In the first place
he did not think Nat would be successful in overtaking
one of the Fairfield schemers; and then again, Elmer was
not feeling any too kindly toward fellows who could try
to put through such a mean plot for defeating the ambitions
of the leader in the great hike.

"Hold on, there; come back, Nat!" called Toby, presently.
"You've gone and overrun the place. It's lucky
Elmer here took note of this big oak tree; or a pretty time
we'd have finding our wheels again."[130]

Nat did return, but with a bad grace. He was mumbling
something about "hard lines when everything goes
against a fellow," and all that sort of stuff; but no one
appeared to pay any attention to his complaint.

They quickly found the three motorcycles, just as they
had left them; and again Toby started out to lead the
way, only to make a mess of it.

"What's wrong this time, Elmer?" he asked, when
the patrol leader gave him to understand that they would
be a long time getting out of the woods if they kept on
the route he, Toby, had started to follow. "I made sure
to notice that the wind was on the same side as when you
led us out before."

"Yes, but since then the wind's taken a sudden shift.
You should have paid attention to that just when we left
the road," remarked the other. "A woodsman never goes
by what it was a while ago. He knows changes are liable
to come around most any old time; and that's what happened
here. Wind whipped around about ten degrees, and
is heading from the southwest quarter now. That may
mean rain before long, boys."

"Let her come if she wants," declared Toby, who was
something of a philosopher at times. "Can't do any more
than soak us through, and at this time of year that's
nothing. I've fallen into a pond more times than I've
got fingers on both hands. They just can't drown me, and
that goes, boys."

"So long as Lil Artha comes in well to the front, and
the Hickory Ridge scouts win the big hike, what do we
care?" Nat spoke up. "Besides, we've had a little mite
of fun, you know, fellows."

"Fun for the boys, but how about the frogs?" laughed[131]
Elmer, as he pushed his machine through the low brush,
heading for the road again.

"Let the bullfrogs look out for themselves, that's all,"
declared Nat. "Any silly gump who will duck his head
about, when a feller's holdin' a lighted match close to his
nose, just ought to get burnt. Say, think of that guy
minus one of his eyebrows; and he's got big ones too, at
that! Won't he be the sight, though!"

So, joking and laughing, they pushed on. Presently the
road being reached, they proceeded to get a start. Fortunately
the incline was downhill, if anything, which promised
to make it easier for a mount. Had the opposite been
the case one or more of the boys might have had some
difficulty in getting started.

Elmer was away first, with a merry splutter of explosive
sounds; but he quickly shut off most of his power in order
to wait for the others. Toby came along after two efforts
at mounting; but Nat seemed to be having one of his old
troubles. This time, however, the fault apparently lay in
Nat, and not in his motor, for they could hear the racket
the engine kept up.

"Here he comes like a skyrocket!" announced Toby,
as the character of the sounds from the rear changed; and
sure enough they quickly heard Nat whooping it up.

"Clear the track, there! Get out of the road everybody,
and give me room. Hi! My old ice wagon's taken
the bitt in her mouth; she's running away with me, Elmer!
Look out there!"

Luckily Elmer had insisted that each of them light the
acetylene gas lamps belonging to their motorcycles before
attempting to make a start. Hence they were able to see
Nat bearing down upon them with a rush, and get to one
side of the road in a hurry.[132]

He went whizzing past amid a rattle and confusion, for,
as usual, Nat had paid no attention to his muffler.

"Somebody head me off!" came floating back, as the
runaway machine went whirling along the road leading
to Little Falls.

"Good gracious! What can we do?" gasped Toby.

"You stick by Lil Artha!"

Even as he shouted these words Elmer was giving his
machine its head, and quickly he vanished from the view
of the other around a bend.

It was no easy task that now presented itself to the
young patrol leader. Had it been a runaway horse there
might have been some hope of the rider controlling it;
but with a motorcycle that took what seemed to be a
fiendish pleasure in doing just the things its owner did
not want done, the case was a different matter.

Something had become jammed, so that poor Nat, having
opened his engine up wide on starting, was unable to shut
off power. And there he was, rushing along at a reckless
speed, headed for Little Falls by the most direct route.

Somebody shouted out something as Elmer sped along.
He guessed it must be Lil Artha, who had discreetly sought
the side of the road upon seeing that fierce light bearing
down upon him. But Elmer could not find time to reply.
Besides, there was Toby, who would be along presently,
and in a condition to tell the tall scout just what was
taking place.

Elmer was keeping a bright lookout ahead. He knew
that, given a fair field, he could easily overtake the runaway
motorcycle; but this thing of rushing along in the
darkness was no child's play. At any second he might
bang into some obstacle that would give him a nasty
tumble.[133]

Besides, he had to keep watch over the leading machine,
so that he might not run into Nat; which would be the
worst sort of calamity that could happen to them both.

At least he was gaining fast now; he could tell that by
the glow from the other lamp which lighted up the road
ahead.

Presently he found himself within speaking distance.
He could just barely see Nat humped there in his saddle,
giving his entire attention to keeping his runaway machine
in the road.

"Hello, Nat ahoy!" he called aloud, so that the sound
of his voice might reach the other above the clattering
of his "cantankerous" motor, as Nat himself was fond of
calling his engine, which was now on such a wild plunge.

"Hey, that you, Elmer?" came back to him; and the
patrol leader imagined there was a trace of alarm as well
as vexation in the voice.

"Yes, can't you keep over on the left side of the road?
I want to come closer to you so we can talk," Elmer called.

"All right. Half is good enough for me; so come right
along, Elmer."

In another minute they were nearly abreast, each striving
to keep to his side of the thoroughfare as best he could.

"Steady, now, Nat," said Elmer. "Be careful how
you let her yaw this way, for I'm only a length behind
you; and a mix-up wouldn't be the nicest thing going."

"I'm holding her steady, Elmer. Now, tell me how I'm
going to get the curb on her, won't you?"

So Elmer began by asking questions concerning what
seemed to have become jammed; and in this way he
quickly understood the situation. A few suggestions followed,
which, upon being put into practice, brought forth[134]
a loud cheer from the relieved owner of the runaway
motorcycle.

"It's all right now, Elmer! That last move did the
business for her! She minds her head now; see, I can
slow down just as I please. But, wow, that was a lively
dash as long as it lasted. I sure began to think I'd bump
into Little Falls like a falling comet, and run up against
a stone wall; when good-by to my neck."

"Well, suppose then we turn around, and see if we can
pick up the others. Try it first, and see if things work
smooth," and Elmer jumped from his saddle as he said
this, assisting Nat make the test.

Having made sure of this they returned along the road,
though at a much less rapid pace than they had recently
shown in covering it. The light from Toby's lamp told
them when they were nearing the walking Lil Artha; and
presently the four Hickory Ridge scouts were together.

"I tell you what," remarked Toby, heaving a sigh,
"I'll be awful glad to get you safe back home again, Nat
Scott. What you haven't tried the last few hours ain't
worth telling. And now that your old huckleberry of a
machine has taken to cutting up monkey shines a feller's
life ain't safe nohow."

Lil Artha seemed to be in the best of humor. Things
were, as he himself remarked, "breaking all right for a
fellow of his size," and he had no cause for complaint.

"Just a few little incidents to liven up the last quarter
of a pokey hike, boys," he observed, as he strode along,
with those lengthy legs covering a yard at each and every
step. "Why, I'll be entering Little Falls like a conquering
hero, with a guard of honor around me. Shouldn't
wonder but what we'll run across Mr. Garrabrant there,
keeping company with the other scout master."[135]

"That's just what you'll do," remarked Elmer over
his shoulder as he rode slowly along in the van of the
procession; "because he went ahead with that idea in
view, to be on hand to receive the first contestant who
showed up."

They enlivened the journey with all sorts of conversation
and jokes. Wearied as Lil Artha must certainly be,
after coming all these long miles since sunup, his chums
sought to make him forget the fact by keeping him in
high spirits.

Nothing happened to interfere with their plans. Those
who were inclined to act ugly toward the possible winner
were a long way in the rear, and only concerned about getting
home again with the car that belonged to the father
of one of the quartette.

It was not a great while after nine o'clock when the
lights ahead told that they were approaching a town.

"That's Little Falls, brother!" called Elmer, cheerily.

"Well, honest now, I ain't sorry to know it," declared
Lil Artha; "though, if I had to do it, I reckon I could
crawl along a little farther, p'raps a dozen or two miles.
If anything's won this walk for me, fellows, it's just been
pluck. You can tell me all you want to about athletes
and such, but in my opinion that's what counts above
condition and everything else. As long as you keep up
heart you've got a look-in; but when the sinking spell
comes, good-by."

Ten minutes later they entered among the houses. Immediately
some boys in khaki who were posted along the
road as a sort of vedette corps, began to call out to one
another, uttering cries like the fox and the bear, which
doubtless denoted the nature of their patrols.

Presently there was quite a crowd accompanying Lil[136]
Artha as he headed for the church where the local troop
of Boy Scouts had their headquarters.

Here there were many lights, and a lot of people assembled.
When Lil Artha passed through the open doorway
a tremendous outburst of applause greeted his appearance.
He doubtless felt something of the thrill of victory that
used to come to the Grecian victor in those old days of the
Marathon races.

Mr. Garrabrant beamed with pleasure when he saw that
it was a Hickory Ridge boy who had come in first.
Heartily did he shake hands with Lil Artha and congratulate
him on his pluck in making the entire distance with
hours to spare.

And when a little later on, while waiting to see if Felix
came in before the storm broke, the scout master listened
with the greatest possible interest while Elmer related
what was known about the evil intentions of those four
scheming lads from Fairfield; and also laughed when he
heard how their designs had been signally defeated by the
bravery and intelligence of Lil Artha's faithful chums.



[137]
CHAPTER XVI.

"THE FINEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO FAIRFIELD!"


After the second in the race, Felix Wagner, had come
in, one of the first things the boy from Fairfield did was
to hunt out Lil Artha, shake hands with him heartily, and
congratulate him.

"I'd like to have beat you, all right," he said with a
whimsical grimace; "but I take it no fellow had need of
feeling ashamed about playing second fiddle to such a
giant on a hike as you, Lil Artha. And that goes."

Elmer had watched this meeting with eagerness; and he
immediately turned to Mr. Garrabrant.

"That settles one thing I've been worrying about," he
declared, emphatically.

"Meaning that this Fairfield lad has had no knowledge
of the miserable game that some of his misguided friends
were engineering in his behalf; is that it, Elmer?" remarked
the gentleman, understanding what he had in
mind.

"Yes, sir," came the reply. "You see, from all accounts,
in the old days this same Felix Wagner was one
of the right bowers of Matt Tubbs. And somehow I
seemed to be making up my mind that if he had a hand
in this ugly deal, there was a screw loose somewhere in
this reformation business over there."

"But now?" asked Mr. Garrabrant, smiling.[138]

"It looks good to me, as Lil Artha would say," replied
Elmer. "If ever a fellow seemed in earnest, Felix was
when he said those words just now. And I feel positive
that when he hears the story of how some of his friends
tried to make Lil Artha ride, so as to knock him out of
the race, Felix will be furious."

Which prediction proved to be the case a little later;
but we cannot afford either the time or space to go into
particulars with regard to this.

"Now we have another job before us," remarked Mr.
Garrabrant, when ten o'clock had arrived.

"You mean looking up the cripples       those who are
ready to admit that their hope of reaching Little Falls
within the required time has died out; and who will be
only too willing to get a lift back home?" Elmer suggested.

"Why, yes, some of them must be in a pretty bad way;
and as it still threatens rain we must look them all up. I
have three cars here that can be used for the job. Would
you care to run ahead, and try to hunt them up, Elmer?"

"Yes, on one condition," came the reply.

"Oh, you can consider that it is granted before you ask;
but what is its nature?" Mr. Garrabrant inquired, laughingly.

"That I ride alone," answered the boy.

"Oh, I see," the scout master went on, nodding his
head wisely; "you dread having Toby and Nat along with
their decrepit wheels to add to your troubles."

"Yes," said Elmer, seriously; "because I can make much
better time alone, rain or not. Besides, I think the boys
ought to have a rest; and it would really be better if they[139]
put up here in Little Falls with some Boy Scout friends
until to-morrow, when they can come home."

"All right; I shall so advise them; though if they choose
to leave their motorcycles here until some future day, they
can just as well ride back in a car."

Both Toby and Nat, however, had friends in the town,
and concluded to stay over. Their machines had taken on
a new life apparently, since their association with Elmer
and they were much encouraged.

Accordingly, the leader of the Wolf Patrol started out.
Fifty miles or so does not amount to a great deal when
mounted on a good motorcycle; and if that threatened
storm would only hold off a few hours, Elmer felt that he
would have little cause for complaint.

As he rode along the thoroughfare he frequently sounded
his horn in such a way that any stragglers would know it
was meant for a signal to show themselves. It was to be
Elmer's duty to warn them that the cars would soon be
along, and that they could get back to Hickory Ridge in
that way if they preferred.

About five miles out he heard a shout, and some one
who was standing alongside the road waved his hat. It
was Matty, the leader of the Beaver Patrol.

Elmer immediately jumped off his machine and put the
question up to his fellow scout. But he really knew what
the answer would be before the other opened his mouth.

"What, me give up, when I'm within smelling distance
of my goal?" declared the determined Matty. "Not for
Joseph! I'm going on and report to the headquarters of
the Little Falls troop; and get back home to-morrow someway
or other. But I'm glad Lil Artha got the prize. He's[140]
a dandy on a hike, I tell you; and Hickory Ridge is proud
of him, sure as you're born! So long, Elmer; get word to
my folks, if you can; though I warned 'em not to look
for me to-night."

Then Matty strode off bravely, though Elmer detected
a slight limp which even his game qualities could not entirely
conceal.

A little later on he picked up Red Huggins and Phil
Dale, the latter having given up, as he was utterly
worn out. They had started a fire alongside the road and
were preparing to pass the remainder of the night after the
fashion of true scouts. In view of the possibility of rain
the boys were even then starting to make some sort of
shelter from branches and such stuff as they could find.

Of course they received the good news with tremendous
satisfaction; and declared that they would be only too delighted
to get a chance of a lift back home.

"Hope they'll let me fasten my old wheel behind, somehow?"
remarked Phil; and Elmer assured him that that
had all been arranged for.

So leaving them, with an exchange of cheers, Elmer
rode on.

One by one he came across Jack, Ty, George, and the
Fairfield fellow, Angus McDowd, the latter still in company
with young Robbins. And every one of them expressed
the greatest satisfaction when they heard how Mr.
Garrabrant did not mean that they should spend the night
away from home but would speedily be along with a number
of cars calculated to carry them back to Hickory Ridge.

Even Tom Cropsey was located, he having taken refuge
in the branches of a tree, because of a farmer's vicious[141]
dog that kept barking savagely not far away; and Tom
happened to be particularly timid about strange dogs.
His wheel being useless, and himself too cramped for walking,
he had "camped" after his own fashion.

Thus all were restored to their homes that night save
the other Fairfield boy who had sprained his ankle and
was in bed at the tavern; Matty, who declined to be
brought back until he had finished his task; and Elmer's
two companions, Toby and Nat, with their unreliable
motorcycles.

Of course it was well along into the morning before the
last automobile reached Hickory Ridge with the balance of
the contestants; and as nearly everybody had long before
gone to bed, the victor was not received with any great
acclaim; at least the factory whistles were not blown, nor
the church bells rung. But a few of the faithful scouts,
who were bound to make a night of it, had waited up at
headquarters; and these fellows gave three hearty cheers
when they saw the long-legged Lil Artha step stiffly from
the leading car.

When, on the following night, a regular meeting of the
troop was held, every fellow made sure to be in attendance;
for it had been announced that the several contestants in
the great hike, as well as the five who had gone forth on
bicycles and motorcycles, intended giving a detailed report
of what adventures had happened on the way; and it
was expected that there would be some stories worth
listening to.

The indignation of the boys was intense when they heard
how those Fairfield four had tried to block Lil Artha's
game and, by forcing him to ride, render his claim to be
a contestant under the rules null and void.[142]

"But listen, fellows," said Elmer, who presided in place
of the scout master, called out of town on sudden business;
"don't be too quick to blame the Boy Scouts of
Fairfield for that rascally piece of business. Matt Tubbs
called me up on the phone this afternoon and wanted me
to express the indignation of himself and his comrades
over the matter. He declared that they had not the faintest
indication of the affair; and that it was engineered entirely
by some 'outcasts,' who, having declined to subscribe
to the twelve cardinal principles of the new movement,
were doing everything in their power to wreck the troop
over there."

"Well, they won't succeed, that's all," declared Lil
Artha, confidently; "because my father says he knows
that the best people of both Fairfield and Cramertown are
just daft over the change that has taken place among the
boys there ever since the scouts were organized, and that
they mean to stand back of the movement through thick
and thin. They say the organization of the scouts was
the finest thing that ever happened to Fairfield."

"And, fellows," continued Elmer, "I think that on the
strength of this, not to speak of Felix saying he would have
refused to accept a tainted title if he had won after Lil
Artha was kidnaped, we ought to give our fellow scouts
over there a cheer. Yes, and send them a letter congratulating
them on the new spirit of fairness that has sprung
up among them."

It was put in the form of a motion, and carried unanimously.
So three cheers and a tiger were given with a
will; and later on the letter was written, which Elmer
himself promised to deliver to Matt Tubbs, the loan of
that fine motorcycle still holding good.[143]

And this, then, was the way the great hike went
through. Lil Artha, of course, was the pride of the
troop for his fine work; but the other fellows who had
done the best they knew how were not forgotten in the
chronicles of the event, as written in the log book of the
secretary.

The only serious accident of the affair was the sprain
which Henry Cobb had been unfortunate enough to receive,
and which was likely to make him limp for many weeks.
But it had afforded a tremendous amount of fun, and at
the same time proved that the fact of a boy belonging to
the scouts need not detract in the least from his manly
qualities.

Vacation was now nearly at an end, and presently the
scouts would be taking up their school duties for the new
year. The summer that had passed had really been the
most delightful one in all their experience; and they looked
forward hopefully to other good times ahead, when, as
scouts, they might be given the privilege of learning many
of the secrets of Nature and of building up sturdy and
manly characters under the influence of the splendid rules
governing the organization.

But there was one grumbler out of the number starting
out for Little Falls, and this was Nat. He never could
get entirely over the cruel fate that had allowed those
trapped plotters to get off "so easy" and was often
heard to mutter that if Elmer had not happened to be
along there might have been a different story to tell. But
like a lot of fellows, Nat's "bark was more savage than
his bite," and perhaps, after all, had he been allowed his
own sweet way, he might have remembered how he had[144]
faithfully promised not to harbor the spirit of revenge
when he signed the roster of the Hickory Ridge Boy
Scouts' troop.

[147]
THE INSECTS OF THE UNITED STATES.


Insects are the most abundant of the animal kingdom.
They are classified principally by the nature of their wings.
Dr. Sharp, an authority on Entomology, recognizes but nine
orders:





1. Aptera.
2. Orthoptera.
3. Neuroptera.
4. Hymenoptera.
5. Coleoptera.
6. Lepidoptera.
7. Diptera.
8. Thysanoptera.
9. Hemiptera.



Many useful products are obtained from insects. From
them we get our silk, honey and cochineal, and they help
to fertilize our flowers. On the other hand, many are detrimental
to agriculture and health.




APTERA.


These are primitive insects without wings. The Campodea,
a small insect, belongs to this order. Another
example is the "Silverfish," which is found in receptacles
holding sugar, starch, etc., in and about unclean bakeshops
and kitchens. They are known principally in houses of the
Southern States, especially in damp places.



[148]
ORTHOPTERA.


These are the straight-winged insects. They have four
wings, the front pair being usually leathery and smaller
than the hind pair.

Here belong the Grasshoppers, Katydids and Crickets.
Cockroaches, Walking-sticks, Leaf insects, Praying Mantis
also belong to this order.


The Cockroach.

Most of the Cockroaches are nocturnal. It is said that
their food is dead animal matter. The kinds of Cockroaches
found in the house are the American Cockroach,
Croton-bug and the Black Beetle. Apparently they eat
anything, animal or vegetable, and are great pests in ill-kept
houses, especially where moisture is plentiful. The
name "Croton-bug" is applied to the smaller sort, it having
made its appearance about the time when Croton water
was first used in New York City. They show a strong distaste
to light and are fond of warmth. The eggs are laid
in capsules.


The Locust.

This family are insects most destructive to crops. The
antennas are short, the hind legs large and strong, giving
them their jumping power. The most injurious of these is
the migratory locust. During the years 1874 to 1876 this
insect, it is said, did more than $200,000,000 damage to
crops in four States of the Union. Every country boy
knows the crackling sound made by these grasshoppers in
their flight. Their "song" is made by the scraping of
the legs against their wings. Locusts swarm and are not
particular as to the kind of vegetable matter which they[149]
eat; anything green which they chance upon is devoured.
The red-legged grasshopper is the one most common in
the Eastern States in late summer.

The true or green grasshoppers have long horns, are
much softer in body and "sing" more than their cousins
of the locust family. The "Katydids" belong here.


Crickets.



PRAYING MANTIS.


Crickets are closely related to the green grasshoppers.
They have long antennae. The Mole Cricket burrows in
the earth, as its name implies, digging with its powerful
forelegs. The black Field Cricket lives in small burrows
in fields and pastures. The Crickets are musical and together[150]
with their cousins of this family swell the insect
chorus of our summer nights.

A peculiar insect belonging to this family is popularly
known as the Walking-stick; in motion it does not look
unlike a twig moving about. Its body is long and slender.
In the tropics this family has many forms which so closely
resemble the leaves, and even flowers of plants and trees, as
to fool not only the casual but the close observer.

Another peculiar insect is the Praying Mantis; this name
has been given them because of the position which they
take, the legs being held as though in prayer. They are
found in the Southern States and are regarded with superstitious
awe by the ignorant.




THE NEUROPTERA.


These are the net-veined winged insects; the Dragon
flies, Mayflies, Caddis-flies belong in this order.


The Dobson.

The Dobson is one of the most curious insects in this
order. It is generally known as the hellgrammite, although
it has probably more popular names than any other insect
and some are very peculiar, for instance, Conniption-bugs,
Goggle-goy, Flip-flaps, Ho Jacks, Snake-doctor. It
is a large insect with strong-biting mouth, living in its larval
form in water.


The Snake Flies.

These are found in the Western States and prey vigorously
upon other insects and render themselves especially
important to the farmer of the far West because of their
ravages upon the Coddling Moth, which is the special
enemy of apple trees.[151]



WALKING-STICKS.
[152]


The Ant Lion.

The Ant Lion digs a little pit in loose sand and buries
itself therein with the exception of its head. Into this trap
fall small insects on which it feeds. After the victim is
sucked dry the remains are thrown out of the pit.


The Dragonflies.

These insects are also known as "Horse-stingers" and
"Devil's Darning-needles," and many superstitious beliefs
are held in regard to them, although they are perfectly
harmless. Many ignorant people still hold them
capable of sewing up bad boys' ears. The early part of
their existence is spent in the water. They prey upon
flies, mosquitoes and small insects. In the wings of these
flies are often beautiful colors. They frequent stagnant
water. The Kingbird favors them as a diet.


The Mayflies.

The Mayflies or Shadflies, like the Dragonflies, spend
their infancy under water feeding upon vegetables and
primitive forms of animal life. Their scientific name is
Ephemerida, coined from the Greek word meaning a day.
They were given this name because of their short life. Great
quantities of the larv        are eaten by fish.


Caddis Flies.

What observing country boy has not seen the queer-looking
Caddis worms in the brooks and their curious larva
cases. Put them in your aquarium, for they are interesting
to watch and study. Their wings are more or less covered[153]
with hair and this gives them a moth-like appearance. They
frequent the shady margins of streams. The larv        cases are
made of leaves, bits of sticks, sand, shells, etc., fastened by
silk which the caddis worm spins. These cases protect them
from fishes and preying insects.



DRAGON FLIES.




[154]
THE HYMENOPTERA.


The Hymenoptera is an order of insects of high rank
containing the Bees, Ants, Wasps and Gallflies. Dr. Leland
O. Howard, Chief of the Division of Entomology in the
United States Department of Agriculture, says that this
order "comprises nearly 30,000 described species; but the
enormous number of undescribed species, particularly of
the smaller parasitic forms inhabiting tropical regions and
other out-of-the-way localities, would probably swell this
number to more than 300,000. To indicate the work still
to be done in this order, it is safe to say that a day's collecting
in Central Park, New York, almost under the windows
of the great American Museum of Natural History, or in
Logan Square, Philadelphia, within 200 yards of the Academy
of Natural Sciences, would result in the capture of a
number of species new to science." Most remarkable are
the insects of this order for their seeming intelligence and
the wonderful habits and methods in their interesting colony
lives.







Bees.

Bees are distinguished from Wasps and Ants by their
hairy bodies. The common hive bee is an insect most important
to mankind, and bee-keeping, properly conducted,
is a profitable occupation. Here is a chance for boy scouts
to win money and laurels. In early summer the bees
"swarm." The bee-keeper watches for signs of this and
knows that when there is an unusual restlessness among them
and the workers become less attentive to their regular duties,
"swarming" may be expected. Suddenly more than half
the workers, with the queen of the hive, leave the old home
and fly to a new place where they "swarm." A second
or third swarm sometimes leave the hive, each with their[156]
respective queen. The first, however, is always the most
important. When hived they climb to the roof and hang
in a mass for often a day. The wax taken from the old
hive is kneaded and the foundation of the new honeycomb
started. As soon as the workers finish cells, the queen lays
eggs in them. These hatch into maggot-like baby bees which
have to be fed and taken care of. The worker must now
forage for pollen or "beebread" and nectar from flowers.
The nectar they carry in their "honey-bags" and change
it into honey. The inside workers feed the youngsters, build
the comb and clean house, even ventilating it by fanning
the air with their wings. In the hives in the swarming are
drones who do no work. They are permitted to live and
feed on the stores until this season is over, then they are
relentlessly killed by the workers. Bees were kept for their
product by the Egyptians.

The Honey Bee was imported from Europe and is not a
native of this country. The Cuckoo Bees are so called because
of their habits of living in the nests of other bees.
They apparently live there in friendly relations with the
rightful occupants of the hives.

The Carpenter Bees; these insects are so called because
of their habit of boring into the stems of plants. They
line their cells with silky membrane and build mud partitions.
The larger forms of these bees bore into tree trunks
and lumber, and even the timber of buildings.

Mason Bees build earthen cells of sand, earth, etc., glued
together. Another group of these cut pieces from leaves
with which to form their cells.









The Bumble Bees; Western farm boys have invented a
method or robbing bumble bees' nests. They take a gallon
or two-gallon jug partly filled with water and place it near
the nest. They then beat the nest and retire to a distance.[158]
The bees swarm out of the nest in their attempt to find
the guilty disturber. The jug attracts their attention; they
fly to it and the beating of their wings over the mouth of
the jug causes a roar which attracts the bees and causes
them to fly at the mouth and drop into it. The noise of those
inside increases the attraction and finally all the bees are
inside. After all the bees are thus disposed of the robbing
of the nest is then a safe matter.


Wasps.

The wasps' bodies are less hairy than the bees'. Some of
the wasps live solitary lives and other groups colonize. The
former build their nests in a burrow or attach them to trees.
These nests are supplied by the mother wasp with animal
food. The social wasp includes the paper-making varieties
and the hornets. The habits of both are similar. The nest
is never used more than one season. In India it is said that
there is a variety that builds a nest reaching a length of several
feet. The hornets suspend large, round nests often a
foot in diameter from tree branches.

The Mason Wasps build their nests of mud under outhouses,
roofs, on rocks and trees. The sting of these insects,
especially that of the hornet, is severe, but they do not sting
unless disturbed; then they display great anger and will
follow the disturber for a long distance. Although they do
considerable damage to fruit they are also helpful as destroyers
of insect life.





They capture and store in their cells a great variety of
insects, spiders, flies and plant-lice. Certain members of
this group of insects burrow into the earth and conceal their
nests by inserting a stone over which they scrape earth.
When the prey is taken the insect is carried into the burrow
and the entrance to it is again closed. Dr. S. W. Williston,[159]
writing of this insect, states that the wasp has been
observed to "use a stone as a tamping-iron to pack the
earth into the mouth of the burrow." He feared, he says,
to publish this observation because he thought he would
not be believed. It is also said by observers of these wasps
that each insect seems to have distinct individuality, for
instance, some are careless, some are industrious, some scrupulously
painstaking. One entomologist tells of a method
used by a wasp in capturing a certain spider: the wasp
would entangle itself in the spider's web and the latter
would dart out from her hiding place; the wasp would then
easily disengage herself from the web and follow the spider[160]
to its hiding place. The Cicada often becomes prey of the
wasp and its song suddenly ceases as it is quickly stung
into insensibility. If in a struggle the two fall to the ground,
the wasp drags the Cicada up a tree until she reaches a
height from which she can fly downward to her storehouse.
The colony wasps are the paper-making insects, their nests
being made from woodpulp and woodfiber secured from old
fences and unpainted woodwork which they mix with saliva
and form into a pulp with which they build their nests.



CICADA.












Ants.

The third group in this important order are the ants.
They always live in communities and build nests which are
especially devoted to the purpose of raising their young.[162]
The young are fed from the mouth of the worker ants. A
remarkable peculiarity of these insects is their practice of
making slaves. The large red ant often makes raids on
other ants, carrying off their young to their own nests where
they are brought up to perform the work of their masters.
They also domesticate plant-lice, which have on that account
been nicknamed "Ant-Cows." Instances are related
where beetles have been found in ant nests; they are
fed by the ants and in case of migration are carried away
by them to their new home. While some of these guests
are tolerated because, perhaps, the ants cannot rid themselves
of them and others are parasites, some seem to be of
the nature of pets. The black ants build mountain-like
nests, sometimes reaching three feet in height; in these nests
sometimes forty or fifty species of ants have been found.


Gall Flies.

All the members of this family produce galls. In the
spring the insect breaks the vegetable tissue by means of
her sting and deposits the eggs. When hatched the young
seem to exercise a peculiar influence on the growing tissue,
shaping it into a swelling or gall containing a series of
chambers. Certain of the galls formed on the oak trees were
formerly used in the manufacture of ink and tannin.


Ichneumon Flies.

These flies attack caterpillars especially and lay their
eggs in their bodies. The young, when hatched, feed upon
the unfortunate victim.


The Horn-tails.

The wood-eaters or horn-tails are wood-boring insects living
in the trunks of trees and stems of plants. They are[163]
called "horn-tails" because of the spine at the end of the
body. They lay their eggs in these borings and the young,
when hatched, continue to bore their way through the pith.


The Saw-flies.

The saw-flies saw their way into plant tissue and lay
their eggs in the openings thus made. Many of these flies
are very injurious to vegetation because of this habit. The
currant-worm, rose-slug and pear-slug are all members of
this family, and farmers are not on friendly terms with
these insects.




THE COLEOPTERA.


This is the order of insects which includes beetles, glowworms,
lady-birds, weevils, cock-chafers, etc. Their chief
characteristic is the hard wing covers. The wings proper
are below these. Most of this order have strong mandibles.
The diet of beetles is much varied, but they are all voracious.

The little lady-birds, about whom the nursery rhyme sings,
warning them to "fly away home," feed upon the scale
insects.

The glow-worm derives the first part of its name from
its luminosity, and the second from its worm-like appearance.
To this same family belong a number of other luminous
beetles, the name "firefly" being usually given.

The weevil is a general name for plant-eating beetles,
and they not infrequently cause great destruction to vegetable
matter. Certain weevils are interesting because of
their habit of rolling up leaves in order to construct a
shelter for their young. The nut-weevil lays her eggs in
the young nut while it is still soft and its grub bores its
way out in the fall. The cotton-boll weevil has caused
great injury to the cotton crops in the Southern States.[164]
It pierces the leaves of the plant and lays its eggs. The
young feed upon the plant. There are also corn weevils and
rice weevils, and still others that attack peas and beans.

The cock-chafers belong to a large group of dark-colored
beetles known as June bugs. They frequently enter light
rooms at night, making a loud buzzing noise. The insect
comes out of the ground in the spring and is very destructive
to the foliage of fruit and other trees. Its grubs live under
ground and feed on roots. The chief enemies of the grub are
moles and birds; of the beetles, bats and birds.




LEPIDOPTERA.


The order of Lepidoptera includes the butterflies and
moths. Their wings and body are covered with scales, frequently
bright-colored. There are several stages in the life
history of these insects just as there are in the life history
of other insects, but these stages are so pronounced and
the changes so remarkable in this order that it is well here
for us to consider the different steps which nature takes
in transforming the repulsive caterpillar into the beautiful
butterfly or moth. The first stage is the egg, from which
is hatched the caterpillar. The caterpillar, after living its
life, spins its cocoon, is transformed into the chrysalis. The
chrysalis in turn eventually becomes the butterfly.

The milkweed butterflies are large-sized butterflies; the
upper surface of the wings is bright and reddish bordered
with black, and the whole wing is veined heavily with black.
The wings are spotted with white; the caterpillar is bright
yellow with black bands. This insect often appears in large
numbers in New Jersey late in the autumn. This particular
one of the milkweed butterflies is called "The Monarch";
a smaller one of this genus is called "The Queen."[165]



BUTTERFLIES.
[166]

The California long-winged butterfly. The fore wings are
brownish-black blotched with yellow; the hind wings are a
dingy orange.

The Dircenna. The fore wings of this butterfly are
grayish-brown with transparent spots; the hind wings are
more yellowish in color.

The Cliff Fritillary. The upper side of this butterfly is
bright tawny-brown spotted with black; the hind wings have
a black border spotted with the same color as the wings.
The under side of the fore wings is orange. The caterpillar
feeds upon the passion flower of the Southern states. It
is found from southern Virginia westward to Arizona and
California.

The Regal Fritillary. The upper side of the fore wings
is a bright brown, spotted and blotched with cream color
and black; the upper side of the hind wings is black with
cream-colored spots. The caterpillar is large, nearly two
inches long; black with stripes and bands of reddish-orange.
There are six rows of spines. The caterpillar feeds on violets
and does not appear in the daytime. This is a beautiful
butterfly and is found from Maine to Nebraska, frequenting
the borders of woodlands.

The Diana. Both wings are a dark brown with wide
border of dark orange spotted with brown spots. It is found
in the Virginias, Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky.

The Silver-bordered Fritillary. This is a small butterfly
ranging over most of the northern part of the United States.
The fore wings on the under side are spotted at the margin
with silver spots.

The Baltimore. Upper side black bordered with a row
of red spots followed by three rows of yellow spots on the
fore wings and two rows on the hind wings. It is found in[167]
colonies in swamps, in the northern parts of the United
States and Canada.

The Question Sign. This butterfly is easily determined
by its large size; the wings are peculiarly shaped; it is bright
brown on the upper side, spotted but edged with darker
brown and pale blue. This is a common butterfly of the
Middle States and is often found in the early spring.

The Red Admiral. This is a common butterfly found
throughout North America. It derives its name from the
red on its fore wings and the red border on its hind wings.

The Thistle Butterfly. Wherever thistles grow may be
found "The Painted Lady," and Dr. V. J. Holland in his
Butterfly Books says, "This is undoubtedly the most widely
distributed of well-known butterflies. It is found in almost
all regions of the earth and in many tropical lands in both
hemispheres." The food plants of the caterpillar are thistles.

The Buckeye. On both the upper and lower sides of the
fore and hind wings are eye-like spots. It is a common
butterfly in the South, but is occasionally found as far North
as New England. These butterflies will fight other passing
butterflies.

The Painted Purple Butterfly is easily distinguished because
of its broad white bands across both wings.

The Blue Butterflies, the Copper Butterflies and the Hair-streaked
Butterflies are small insects, many of which are
characterized by the bright blue of the upper side of the
wings; in other forms the copper color prevails. Hair-streaked
Butterflies often have small tails on their horned
wings.

The Sulphur Butterflies and Whites are medium-sized or
small butterflies, white or yellow in color, having dark
edgings. The common white butterfly is easily classified
by its pure-white color of the under-side white wings.[168]

The Cabbage Butterfly is a common insect familiar to all.
Much good sauerkraut material is spoiled by its ravages.

Orange Tipped Butterflies. This is a large species of
pretty butterflies.

The Swallow-tail Butterflies are generally large butterflies
with the hind wings tailed.

The Ajax is one of the most beautiful of the butterflies.
Its wings are streaked with brown and white, with red and
blue spots near the tail on the hind wings.

The Tiger Swallow Tail seems to be fond of the woodlands
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Carolina, Kentucky and
Tennessee. The common Eastern swallow-tail is bright yellow
and black, and found all over the Atlantic States.

The Wood Nymphs are butterflies of moderate size with
eye-like spots on their wings, the wings being tawny brown
or gray.

We have endeavored to give our boy readers a brief description
of some of the most beautiful and some of the
most common butterflies of the United States. There are
thousands more.


Moths.

The moths are popularly distinguished from butterflies
by the belief that they fly at night; there are, however, numerous
exceptions to this distinction. The antennae of butterflies
are blunt; in moths they vary in form, being rarely
shaped like those of the butterfly. Moths are more numerous
than butterflies, and vary as to size and color. Some moths
have been known to reach a size of six or seven inches in
width and attain the most brilliant coloring of all insects.



MOTHS.


Hawk Moth. This is a large, dull-colored, powerful moth.
The caterpillars are smooth and striped, horned at the rear
end. The Death's Head Moth belongs to the same family,[170]
as do also the Oleander Hawk Moth and the Humming-bird
Hawk Moth. The last mentioned is often mistaken for a
humming bird. Caterpillars of this family are destructive
to potato, tomato and tobacco plants. The moths of this
family are known as the Sphinx Moths. The markings on
the body of the Death's Head Moth resemble a skull and
crossbone       hence its name. The body is covered with hair.
The fore wings are brown, the hind wings yellow, banded
with black. It makes a squeaking noise and is often found
in beehives where it is attracted by the honey.

The Egger Moths get their name from the peculiar egg-shell-like
surface of their cocoons.

The Lima Moths are among the largest and most beautiful
of our moths. The hind wings have a tail-like appendage.
It is pale green in color with a purple band along the front
of the fore wings.




THE ORDER DIPTERA.


This order includes all the true flies or insects having but
two wings. There is probably no other order of insects
that are more injurious to the health of human beings. The
housefly, because of its habits, is a virulent pest in the
spreading of disease and it has been discovered that certain
mosquitoes carry the germs of malarial and yellow fevers.


Mosquitoes.

Up to the year 1900 little had been known about these
insects. Since then it has been discovered that one genus
is responsible for the transfer of malarial fever and another
variety is the sole means of the spreading of yellow fever.
Mosquitoes are found in any locality where stagnant standing
water allows them the opportunity to breed. Their[171]
eggs are laid in a flat mass on the surface of the water, and
each of these masses contains from 200 to 400 eggs. The
young mosquitoes issue from the under side of the eggs,
coming to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do
by means of a long tube at the end of the body which is
thrust up above the surface of the water. In many localities
boy scouts have been interested in exterminating mosquitoes,
the most successful methods being either the abolition of
their breeding places, the flooding of surfaces of stagnant
water with kerosene, or the introduction of fish into fishless
ponds. In a mosquito crusade every receptacle for standing
water must be found and either destroyed or treated with
kerosene.


Midges.

Midges are small or minute flies; swarms of them are commonly
seen in damp localities in the summer.


Flies.

Horseflies are unusually abundant in the neighborhood of
ponds and streams.

The Robber Flies, or bee-killers, are the hawks of the insect
world, preying upon their victims on the wing. In flying
an insect is likely to become the victim to their sharp little
dagger, which they carry in their beak. It is said that they
will frequent a favorite position near a beehive and make
frequent trips back and forth, and hundreds of empty bodies
of bees are found beneath this perch.

The Dancefly is so called because of the up-and-down
movement which they make in their swarms.

The Housefly. These insects are highly injurious to human
beings because of their agency in spreading germs of
such diseases as typhoid fever and Asiatic cholera. It has[172]
been discovered recently that germs of infantile paralysis
are conveyed by the housefly.




THYSANOPTERA.


To this order belong very small insects known as "thrips."
They are found in large numbers in flowers and in the heads
of grain, chrysanthemum, hydrangea, orange-blossom, cabbage
leaf, cauliflower, squash, turnips and other plants.




HEMIPTERA


includes plant-lice, scale insects and bugs proper. One entomologist
says: "If anything were to exterminate the destroyers
of hemiptera, we, ourselves, would probably be
starved in the course of a few months," so harmful are
they to vegetation. One of the best-known insects of this
order is the cicada or harvestfly, popularly but wrongly
called the "locust," the term "locust" belonging rightfully
to the long-horned grasshoppers. The body of the
cicada is large with a blunt head. At the end of July and
early in August its song may be heard in the treetops.

The queer-shaped treehoppers also belong to this order.
When they are resting upon a twig, it is difficult, except
upon close examination, to distinguish them from a thorn
or a natural protuberance of the wood.

The Spittle Insects. After hatching from the egg the
young insects live in little frothy masses like spittle on the
stems of plants and grasses.

Scale Insects. Many of the members of this family are
very injurious to fruit trees and other trees. They feed
upon the sap.

The Oyster-shell Bark Louse is found particularly upon
apple and pear trees.[173]



SCALE INSECTS.
[174]

Plant Lice. These insects prey upon cultivated plants.
Huxley computed that the uninterrupted breeding of ten
generations of plant lice from the single insect would produce
a bulk equal to the population of the Chinese Empire,
500,000,000 of human beings. We have already spoken of
the relations between ants and plant lice; they are often
called "Ant Cows" because of the ant's habit of milking
them for the juices which they exhume.


The True Bugs.

The "Water Boatmen" may be found swimming on the surface
of water. They often go below the surface, carrying
with them a bubble of air which is held by the hairs of their
body. They hibernate in the mud at the bottom of the water.
The eggs of these insects are made into cakes and are eaten
by the Indians.

Another family of water bugs are properly called the
"back swimmers" because of their habit of swimming on
their backs. They prey upon other water insects and even
fish. They can sting with their beak.


Toad Bugs.

They have a short, wide body, protruding eyes and toad-like
color. They are found in damp places under the banks
of ponds and streams.

The Water Striders are the long-legged insects which run
over the surface of the water with such speed that it is
difficult to catch them.

The Cannibal Bugs, the Pirate Bugs, are preying insects
which feed upon other insects whose blood they suck. A
species of this insect was especially abundant in the Eastern
States in 1898. Their bites and blood-sucking habits gave[175]
cause to the "kissing-bug" scare to which the newspapers
gave great publicity.


The Ambush Bugs

is the name which Professor Comstock has given to insects
frequenting yellow flowers, with which its color agrees and
hides it from other insects visiting the flowers.


The Squash Bug

is the enemy of vegetables of the pumpkin family and has a
distinctly disagreeable odor.


The Stink Bugs

are small flat bugs which, like the Squash Bug, have a bad
odor. One of this family is still called, in Georgia, "The
Abe Lincoln" bug, and in Texas, "The Third Party" bug.


THE CINCH BUGS.

This is a bug that makes a specialty of corn and grasses as
a diet.

THE "HOW-TO-DO-IT" BOOKS

By J. S. ZERBE



Carpentry for Boys

A book which treats, in a most practical and fascinating manner
all subjects pertaining to the "King of Trades"; showing the care
and use of tools; drawing; designing, and the laying out of work;
the principles involved in the building of various kinds of structures,
and the rudiments of architecture. It contains over two
hundred and fifty illustrations made especially for this work, and
includes also a complete glossary of the technical terms used in the
art. The most comprehensive volume on this subject ever published
for boys.

                                                        

Electricity for Boys

The author has adopted the unique plan of setting forth the fundamental
principles in each phase of the science, and practically
applying the work in the successive stages. It shows how the
knowledge has been developed, and the reasons for the various
phenomena, without using technical words so as to bring it within
the compass of every boy. It has a complete glossary of terms, and
is illustrated with two hundred original drawings.


                                                        

Practical Mechanics for Boys

This book takes the beginner through a comprehensive series of
practical shop work, in which the uses of tools, and the structure
and handling of shop machinery are set forth; how they are utilized
to perform the work, and the manner in which all dimensional work
is carried out. Every subject is illustrated, and model building
explained. It contains a glossary which comprises a new system of
cross references, a feature that will prove a welcome departure in
explaining subjects. Fully illustrated.

The Wonder Island Boys

By ROGER T. FINLAY


A new series of books, each complete in itself, relating
the remarkable experiences of two boys and a man,
who are cast upon an island in the South Seas with
absolutely nothing but the clothing they wore. By the
exercise of their ingenuity they succeed in fashioning
clothing, tools and weapons and not only do they train
nature's forces to work for them but they subdue and
finally civilize neighboring savage tribes. The books
contain two thousand items of interest that every boy
ought to know.

THE BOY GLOBE TROTTERS

By ELBERT FISHER


12mo, Cloth.                                            Many Illustrations.                                            60c. per Volume
                                   


This is a series of four books relating the adventures of two boys, who
make a trip around the world, working their way as they go. They
meet with various peoples having strange habits and customs, and their
adventures form a medium for the introduction of much instructive
matter relative to the character and industries of the cities and countries
through which they pass. A description is given of the native sports
of boys in each of the foreign countries through which they travel. The
books are illustrated by decorative head and end pieces for each chapter,
there being 36 original drawings in each book, all by the author, and four
striking halftones.

1. From New York to the Golden Gate, takes in many of the principal
points between New York and California, and contains a highly
entertaining narrative of the boys' experiences overland and not a little
useful information.

2. From San Francisco to Japan, relates the experiences of the two
boys at the Panama Exposition, and subsequently their journeyings to
Hawaii, Samoa and Japan. The greater portion of their time is spent
at sea, and a large amount of interesting information appears throughout
the text.

3. From Tokio to Bombay. This book covers their interesting
experiences in Japan, followed by sea voyages to the Philippines, Hong-kong
and finally to India. Their experiences with the natives cover a
field seldom touched upon in juvenile publications, as it relates to the
great Hyderabad region of South India.

4. From India to the War Zone, describes their trip toward the
Persian Gulf. They go by way of the River Euphrates and pass the
supposed site of the Garden of Eden, and manage to connect themselves
with a caravan through the Great Syrian Desert. After traversing
the Holy Land, where they visit the Dead Sea, they arrive at the Mediterranean
port of Joppa, and their experiences thereafter within the war
zone are fully described.

ECONOMICAL COOKING

Primrose Edition

Planned for Two or More Persons

By

MISS WINIFRED S. GIBBS

Dietitian and Teacher of Cooking of the New York
Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor
Printed on Fine Quality Book Paper.                                                 Cover Design in Colors


Many Cook Books have been published, from time
to time, to meet various requirements, or to elucidate
certain theories, but very few have been written to
meet the needs of the large proportion of our population
who are acutely affected by the constantly increasing
cost of food products. Notwithstanding that by its
valuable suggestions this book helps to reduce the expense
of supplying the table, the recipes are so planned that
the economies effected thereby are not offset by any
lessening in the attractiveness, variety or palatability of
the dishes.

Of equal importance are the sections of this work
which deal with food values, the treatment of infants and
invalids and the proper service of various dishes.

The recipes are planned for two persons, but may
readily be adapted for a larger number. The book is
replete with illustrations and tables of food compositions       the
latter taken from the latest Government statistics.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
