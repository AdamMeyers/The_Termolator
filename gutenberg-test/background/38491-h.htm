<h3><span>MADRIGALS IN PRAISE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</span></h3>

<p>At the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a musical work of an
extraordinary character issued from the press of that industrious
printer Thomas Este, the history of which it will be my endeavour to
elucidate in the present communication. The title-page runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "M<span class="smcap lowercase">ADRIGALES</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">HE</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">RIUMPHES OF</span> O<span class="smcap lowercase">RIANA</span>, to 5 and 6 voices: composed
   by divers severall aucthors. Newly published by Thomas Morley,
   Batcheler of Musick, and one of the gentlemen of hir Majesties
   honorable Chappell, 1601. In London, Printed by Thomas Este, the
   assigne of Thomas Morley. <i>Cum privilegio Regiæ Majestatis.</i>"</p>

<p>The dedication is addressed&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "To the Right Honorable the Lord Charles Howard, Earle of
   Notingham, Baron of Effingham, Knight of the Noble order of the
   Garter, Lord High Admirall of England, Ireland, and Wales, &amp;c.,
   and one of her Majesties most honorable Privie Counsell."</p>

<p>As all that is known, with <i>certainty</i>, of the <i>origin</i> of this work
consists in the title-page and the dedication, I shall make no apology
for quoting the latter at length:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Right Honorable,</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "I have adventured to dedicate these few discordant tunes to be
   censured by the ingenious disposition of your Lordship's
   Honorable rare perfection, perswading my selfe, that these
   labours, composed by me and others (as in the survey hereof, your
   Lordship may well perceive), may not by any meanes passe, without
   the malignitie of some malitious <i>Momus</i>, whose malice (being as
   toothsome as the <i>adder's</i> sting), couched in the progres of a
   wayfayring man's passage, might make him retire though almost at
   his journeyes end. Two speciall motives have imbouldened me
   (Right Honorable) in this my proceeding. First, for that I
   consider, that as the body cannot bee without the shadow, so
   <i>Homer</i> (the Prince of Poets) may not be without a Zoilist: The
   second and last is (the most forcible motive), I know (not onely
   by report, but also by experiment) your Lordship to bee not onely
   <i>Philomusus</i>, a lover of the <i>Muses</i>, and of learning; but
   <i>Philomathes</i>, a personage always desirous (though in all Arts
   sufficiently skilfull) to come to a more high perfection or
   <i>Summum bonum</i>. I will not trouble your Lordship with to to
   [<i>sic</i>] tedious circumstances, onely I humbly intreat your
   Lordship (in the name of many) to patronage this work with no
   lesse acceptance, then I with a willing and kinde hart dedicate
   it. So shall I think the <i>initium</i> of this worke not onely
   happely begun, but to bee <i>finited</i> with a more happie period.</p>

<p class="i9"> "Your Honour's devoted in all dutie,</p>

<p class="i11">    "T<span class="smcap lowercase">HOMAS</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ORELY</span>."</p>

<p><i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i> consists of twenty-five madrigals, set by the
most eminent musicians of the day, and edited (as the title-page and
dedication show) by Thomas Morley, a most "rare and cunning musician,"
and moreover an especial
<a id="favourite186"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[186]</span>
 favourite with the reigning queen, in
whose honour the work is said to have been composed.</p>

<p>Sir John Hawkins, in his <i>History of Music</i>, vol. iii. p. 406., says the
"occasion" of the publication of <i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i> was this:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The Lord High Admiral, Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, was
   the only person, who, in the last illness of Elizabeth, could
   prevail on her to go into and remain in her bed; and with a view
   to alleviate her concern for the execution of the Earl of Essex,
   he gave for a prize-subject to the poets and musicians of the
   time, the beauty and accomplishments of his royal mistress, and
   by a liberal reward, excited them severally to the composition of
   this work. This supposition is favoured by the circumstance of
   its being dedicated to the Earl, and the time of its publication,
   which was the very year that Essex was beheaded. There is some
   piece of secret history which we have yet to learn, that would
   enable us to account for giving the Queen this romantic name;
   probably she was fond of it. Camden relates that a Spanish
   ambassador had libelled her by the name of <i>Amadis Oriana</i>, and
   for his insolence was put under a guard."</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, in his sketch of the Life of Thomas Morley (<i>General History
of Music</i>, vol. iii. p. 101.), speaking of this work, says,</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "As Italy gave the ton to the rest of Europe, but particularly to
   England, in all the fine arts, during the reign of Queen
   Elizabeth, it seems as if the idea of employing all the best
   composers in the kingdom to set the songs in <i>The Triumphs of
   Oriana</i> to music, in honour of our virgin queen, had been
   suggested to Morley and his patron, the Earl of Nottingham, by
   Padre Giovenale, afterwards Bishop of Saluzzo, who employed
   thirty-seven of the most renowned Italian composers to set
   <i>Canzonetti</i> in honour of the Virgin Mary, published under the
   following title: <i>Tempio Armonico della Beatissima Virgine nostra
   Signora, fabbricatole per opera del Reverendo P. Giovenale, A. P.
   della Congregatione dell' Oratorio. Prima Parte, a tre voci,
   Stampata in Roma da Nicola Mutii</i>, 1599, in 4to."</p>

<p>That by <i>Oriana</i> is meant Queen Elizabeth, there can be but little
doubt. The appellation surely does not countenance the supposition that
there "must be some secret piece of history" in the case. Queen
Elizabeth, we all know, was a woman of inordinate vanity. Even at the
age of three score and ten she delighted in the names of <i>Cynthia</i>,
<i>Diana</i>, and such like; and <i>Oriana</i>, who was the heroine of the
well-known romance <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>, and a lovely and virtuous woman to
boot, could not fail to gratify her. How D'Espes, the Spanish
ambassador, could libel her under the double title of <i>Amadis Oriana</i>,
it is difficult to imagine; but so it was, according to Camden (anno
1569). "<i>Libellos famosos spargit, in quibus Reginæ existimationem
contumeliosè atterit sub nomine Amadis Orianæ.</i>"</p>

<p>The pretty sounding tale related by Sir John Hawkins, that the work in
question was undertaken with a view to alleviate the grief of the queen
for the death of the Earl of Essex, and that prizes were given by the
Earl of Nottingham for the best composition for that purpose, is
entirely without foundation. Sir John Hawkins gives no authority for his
statement, and I believe it rests entirely upon conjecture.</p>

<p><i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i> (as we have seen) was printed at London in the
year 1601. In the same year was published at Antwerp a collection of
madrigals with the following title: <i>Il Trionfo di Dori, descritto da
diversa, et posti in Musica, da altretranti Autori a Sei Voci, In
Anversa, Appresso Pietro Phalesio</i>, 1601. From the date of these two
collections, it appears almost impossible that either should have been
an imitation of the other; and yet, by an extraordinary similarity in
point of <i>style, number, variety of composers, and burthen of the
poetry</i>, there can be but little doubt such was the case. The point will
be therefore to ascertain if either of these works was printed
previously to this date, 1601. I have no doubt that the <i>Orianas</i> is the
first and only edition of the work. On the other hand, there is good
reason (from a variety of circumstances) to suppose that the copy of <i>Il
Trionfo di Dori</i> with this date will turn out to be the <i>second</i>
edition.</p>

<p>The poetry (if such it can be called) of the <i>Orianas</i> is a paraphrase
of <i>Il Trionfo di Dori</i>. The Italian burden or conclusion is always&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">

 <p>"Cantiam Ninfe e Pastori</p>
     <p> Viva la bella Dori."</p>

</div>

<p>And the English version:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana,</p>
    <p>  Long live faire Oriana."</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Oliphant, in his collection of poetry entitled <i>La Musa
Madrigalesca</i>, is perhaps not far wrong when he says that the rhymes of
the <i>Orianas</i> would "disgrace the veriest tyro in Grub Street;" but,
nevertheless, I have extracted a few specimens, premising that they are
the best I could find among the "twenty-five":&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<p class="i5">1.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p>      "Hence! stars, too dim of light;</p>
<p>      You dazle but the sight;</p>
<p>      You teach to grope by night;</p>
<p class="i3">See here the shepherd's star,</p>
<p class="i3">Excelling you so far.</p>
<p>      Then Ph&oelig;bus wiped his eies,</p>
<p>      And Zephirus cleer'd the skies.</p>
<p>      In sweet accented cries,</p>
<p class="i3">Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana,</p>
<p class="i3">Long live fair Oriana."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p>Now a question arises, who was the <i>Bonny-boots</i> mentioned in the two
last-quoted madrigals?</p>

<p>Sir John Hawkins has the following hypothesis:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Bonny-boots seems to be a nick-name for some famous singer, who,
   because of his excellent voice, or for some other reason, had the
   permission to call the queen his lady. Possibly the person meant
   might be one Mr. Hale, of whom mention is made by Sir William
   Segar, in his account of a solemn tilt, or exercise of arms, held
   in the year 1590 before Queen Elizabeth, in the Tiltyard at
   Westminster, with emblematical representations and music, in
   which the above-mentioned Mr. Hale performed a part, by singing a
   song, &amp;c. Sir William Segar also says of this person, that he was
   her majesty's servant, a gentleman in that art excellent, and for
   his voice both commendable and admirable."&mdash;<i>Hist. of Music</i>,
   vol. iii. p. 406.</p>

<p>Some gallant, high in favour with the Lady Oriana (Queen Elizabeth), is
evidently alluded to in these madrigals; but I cannot agree with Sir
John Hawkins, that a public singer like Mr. Hale would be permitted "to
call the queen his lady." The idea is too absurd for a moment's
consideration. Another conjecture is, that the individual designated
<i>Bonny-boots</i> was the Earl of Essex; but I shall here quote two extracts
from a curious and rare work published by Thomas Morley in 1597, and
entitled "<i>Canzonets, or Little Short Aers to Five and Six Voices</i>:
Printed by Peter Short," &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>



<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<p class="i5">  1.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

 <p> "Fly love, that art so sprightly,</p>
 <p> To <i>Bonny-boots</i> uprightly;</p>
 <p>And when in Heav'n you meet him,</p>
 <p>Say that I kindly greet him;</p>
 <p>  And that his Oriana,</p>
 <p> True widow maid still followeth Diana."</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p class="i5">2.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

 <p> "Our <i>Bonny-boots</i> could toot it, yea and foot it;</p>
 <p>Say lusty lads, who now shall bonny-boot it?</p>
 <p>  Who but the jolly shepherd, bonny Dorus?</p>
 <p>He now must lead the Morris dance before us."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The conjecture that <i>Bonny-boots</i> was the Earl of Essex at once falls to
the ground; for he was not beheaded till 1601, and the title-page of
Morley's <i>Canzonets</i> bears date 1597.</p>

<p>That some conceit relative to the Lady Oriana existed long before the
appearance of <i>The Triumphs</i>, is evident. Although the latter work was
not published till the year 1601, yet in 1597 the idea had been acted
upon by Nicholas Yonge in his <i>Second Book of Musica Transalpina</i>; for
therein is the well-known madrigal by Giovanni Croce from <i>Il Trionfo di
Dori</i>, adapted to the English words, "Hard by a crystal fountain," and
ending with the burden, "Long live fair Oriana." Dr. Burney (<i>Hist. of
Music</i>, vol. iii. p. 124.) says, that according to Hearne, a madrigal
beginning with these words used annually to be sung by the fellows of
the New College, Oxon, but he was unable to find it. Other madrigals in
praise of Oriana may be found in Bateson's <i>First Set of Madrigales</i>,
1604; Pilkington's <i>First Set of Madrigales</i>, 1613; and in Vautor's
<i>First Set of Songes</i>, 1619.</p>

<p>The publication of madrigals in praise of Queen Elizabeth, after her
death, may be easily accounted for. They were (it is evident upon
examination) originally composed with the others, but sent too late for
insertion in the set; after which their respective composers had no
opportunity of publishing them until the dates above given.</p>

<p>The conclusion then I arrive at is this, that <i>Il Trionfo di Dori</i> was
printed in Italy (most probably at Rome) between the years 1588 and
1597; that N. Yonge procured a copy of it from thence (as may be
inferred from his Preface), and from it published Croce's madrigal. This
copy was most probably seen by Thomas Morley, and gave him the idea of
his <i>Triumphs of Oriana</i>. Morley was at this time an especial favourite
with the queen, who had recently rewarded him with "a faire gold
chaine." An offering then like the <i>Orianas</i> could not fail of being
acceptable to the vanity of Elizabeth, who, even at the age of
sixty-eight, was extremely susceptible of flattery&mdash;especially when
directed towards her person. It doubtless had the desired effect, and
secured for Morley the patronage of the queen and the principal
<a id="nobility188"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[188]</span>
nobility. The publication of this work is thus easily explained without
the intervention of any "secret piece of history."</p>

<h3><span>MS. NOTES IN A COPY OF LIBER SENTENTIARUM.</span></h3>

<p>As MS. notes in old books have been regarded as fit matter for this
journal, I would contribute two or three from a copy of Peter Lombard's
<i>Book of Sentences</i>, printed at Vienna in 1477. This has not only passed
through divers hands before it came into mine, but several previous
owners have left their names in it, and one of them very numerous
marginal comments. Of these the earliest appears to have been Thomas
Wallwell or T. Swallwell, a monk of Durham, who, from the handwriting,
which is of the fifteenth century, I conclude was the marginal
commentator. He has availed himself of the "Laus Deo" below the colophon
to add "q' Ts. Wallwell monachus ecclesiæ cathedralis Dunelmensis." The
words are abbreviated, but I have given them at length except the first,
which, instead of being a <i>q</i>, with a comma, is a <i>q</i> with an oblique
line through it, that I thought might baffle the printer. The comments
are very scholastic, and such as would then have been considered much to
the purpose. It is possible some reader of this journal may be able to
supply information respecting this erudite monk.</p>

<p>The next owner, judging by the handwriting, which seems little, if at
all, later than 1500, has thus recorded his ownership on the blank side
of the last leaf:</p>

<div class="poem">

 <p>  "Istius libri verus est possessor dominus Stephanus Merleye."</p>

</div>


<p>He was probably a priest, but I have discovered no annotations by him;
though, as there is scarcely a page without writing on it, there may be
some.</p>

<p>However, the note to which I would more particularly invite attention is
at the top of the first page, and in the handwriting, I think, of the
above-mentioned monk. It is in abbreviated Latin, but read in extenso it
runs thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Sententiæ Petri Lumbardi fratris Graciani qui decretum
   compilavit, et etiam Petri Comestoris, qui scholasticam historiam
   edidit et alia. Iste Petrus Lumbardus fecit istud opus, edidit
   glossas psalterii et Epistolarum et plura alia. Fuit etiam
   episcopus Parisiensis. Isti tres fratres uterini erant, et
   floruerunt anno salutis 1154, qui fuit annus ab origine mundi
   6353."</p>

<p>Over the word Graciani is interlined "monachi" in the same hand. In this
statement two things are remarkable:&mdash;1. The allegation that these three
well-known writers of the twelfth century were uterine brothers. 2. The
mundane era. The former is hardly reconcileable with the generally
received account of them, but it is not altogether new. Cave, writing of
Gratian, adverts to a story of their having been brothers in the
following words:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Non desunt plurimi qui Gratianum, Petri Lombardi, Petrique
   Comestoris germanum fuisse volunt, matremque tergeminos hos
   fratres ex furtivo concubitu conceptos uno partu edidisse, quod
   quidem nullo satis gravis autoris testimonio
   fulcitur."&mdash;<i>Scriptores Eccl.</i>, vol. ii. p. 216.</p>

<p>I am not going to advocate this story, for it is most likely false; and
the monk's statement may not be correct; but as it is less improbable,
it may be worth recording. Peter Lombard died in 1164. Gratian completed
the Decretum about 1151, and probably survived some years, but I have
not met with the date of his death. Peter Comestor died in 1198. They
may therefore have all been contemporaries, though the last must have
lived to a good old age, unless he were considerably younger than the
others.</p>

<p>With regard to the mundane era by which the writer computed, it will be
found to differ materially, not only from that now in common use among
ourselves, but also from all that are mentioned by Sir H. Nicolas in his
<i>Chronology of History</i>; for it assumes the Nativity to have occurred in
the year of the world 5199. This, however, agrees with what appears to
have been recognised as the era of the creation by the western churches
from about the beginning of the fifth century (see De Vaine's
<i>Dictionnaire Raisonné de Diplomatique</i>, voce <i>Comput</i>), though from
some cause it seems to have been almost overlooked by modern writers in
this country.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to explain the "<i>q&#821;</i>" before Ts. Wallwell. It may
have meant "quoth," or "quæsit;" but I am not satisfied with anything
that has occurred to me. It stands thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>      "<i>Laus Deo. q&#821;</i>, T<i>s</i>Wallwell</p>
<p>      Mo<span class="topnum">cs</span> ecc&#772;le cathedralis dune&#322;m."</p>

</div>

<p>"Ts." for Thomas is not usual, but those are clearly the letters: I have
tried to read the "<i>s</i>" (which may have been meant for a capital) with
the surname, but Swallwell is a stranger cognomen than that I have
attributed to the monk. Some correspondent conversant with Durham may
possibly recognise the name in one of its forms.</p>

<h3><span>CLASSIFICATION OF LITERARY DIFFICULTIES.</span></h3>

<p>Whatever may be the utility of your publication as a source of
information to individuals, each on his own point of difficulty, there
is a purpose, and one of its greatest ultimate purposes, which it must
one day answer, though not immediately&mdash;I mean the furnishing of
materials for general conclusions on the <i>difficulties of literature</i>.
The queries which
<a id="are189"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[189]</span>
are sent to you are those which an author must
put to himself in his closet; the manner in which others help him shows
the manner in which he ought, if he could, to help himself.
Occasionally, the querist betrays a want of power to reduce his own
difficulty to its proper category; occasionally, also, the respondent
fails to grapple with the real point. All this is instructive, and
reconciles those who are instructed by it to the presence of many things
which seem trivial or out of place to those who do not consider the
nature of the whole undertaking. But the instruction I speak of will be
much augmented in quantity and elevated in character, if ever the time
should come when the mass of materials collected finds an architect to
arrange it. The classification of the obstacles which an inquirer meets
with, so treated as to give a view of the <i>causes</i> of difficulty as they
arise, both from the state of our books, and of our modes of using them,
must surely one day suggest itself as a practicable result of the
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." The more this result is insisted on the more likely is it
to be realised; and though it may need twenty volumes of the work to be
completed, or even more, before anything can be done, the mere
suggestion may induce some of your readers to keep an eye upon your
pages with a view to something beyond current matter.</p>

   from the French <i>riolé</i>, diversely coloured, has not the least
   probability. The other, which deduces it from the French
   <i>rouelle</i>, <i>rotula</i>, the whirl-bone or knee-pan, is more
   plausible; though, as the glossarist observes, that sense will
   hardly suit here."&mdash;Chaucer, by Thomas Tyrwhitt, Esq. Pickering:

<p>So far the printed attempts at explaining this term <i>ruell</i>. May I
submit for the consideration of your readers, that it is related to the

would be of a similar nature.</p>

<h3><span>SIR WALTER RALEIGH IN VIRGINIA.</span></h3>

<p>I remember having read, some time ago, a statement in the public prints,
to the effect that the popular belief, as to Sir Walter Raleigh having
visited Virginia, was unfounded: the fact being, that he had projected
such a voyage, and that the vessels equipped by him for that purpose had
actually reached that country; but that the illustrious voyager himself
was prevented by some circumstance from conducting the expedition. This
statement seemed to have been elicited by one of the subjects proposed
for the decorations of the new Houses of Parliament, namely, "Sir Walter
Raleigh landing in Virginia," and the idea was exploded with so much
assurance that I had ceased to give it any credence. I find, however, in
Hallam's <i>Literature of Europe</i>, 2nd edition, vol. iii. p. 179., that
the fact of Sir Walter's having been in Virginia is relied upon by that
historian, in the following passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Harriott, the companion of Sir Walter Raleigh in Virginia, and
   the friend of the Earl of Northumberland, in whose house he spent
   the latter part of his life, was destined to make the last great
   discovery in the pure science of algebra."</p>

<p>Are there any data to support Mr. Hallam's opinion? Such is his general
accuracy, that few would be disposed to question any statement
deliberately put forward by him. In this instance, however, he may have
adopted, without inquiry, the tradition which has been current for the
last two hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>&mdash;Will some one of your Irish contributors

of St. Patrick? I cannot find that St. Patrick was married; I am aware,
however, that the silence of the usual authorities goes but a little way

Michaelmas, all who wish for engagements collect together at the
different towns and villages, whither the masters resort for the purpose
of hiring them. Those meetings which occur previous to Michaelmas day
are called <i>statute-fairs</i>, while those which take place after that day
are termed <i>mops</i>. Query, What is the derivation of this word? I have
been told that the later assemblies are so called because they consist
of the inferior servants who were not engaged before,&mdash;such as use a
<i>mop</i> instead of sweeping clean and scouring. A friend conjectures that
the name implies "an indiscriminate <i>mopping-up</i> of all sorts, the
greater number of servants having gone before, and there being only a
few left." I have no book to which I can refer for information on this
subject.</p>

Mons. Michel, in a work entitled <i>Sur les Races Maudits</i>? There seems to
be great doubt about their origin; are they remnants either of the
Saracens or the Paulicians? They still, I am told, exist in the deep
Pyrenean vallies, and are a most degraded race. Is there any analogy
between them and the Cretins of the Alps, with the difference, that in
the Alps Cretinism is regarded with kindness, in the Pyrenees with
scorn? If so, does this point to the existence of a Celtic and
non-Celtic element in the races inhabiting the respective mountain
chains? idiotcy being reverenced especially among the Celtic races.
Then,
<a id="as191"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[191]</span>
 as before the first French revolution, the Cagots had a
particular place and door set apart for them in the churches. Does not
this look like their being Paulicians forced into orthodoxy, or equally,
perhaps, Saracen Christians, similar to the Jew Christians of Spain?</p>

<h4><span>138. <i>Execution under singular Circumstances.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have read somewhere,
but failed to "make a note of it" at the time, an anecdote of a singular
occurrence at Winchester, to the following effect.</p>

<p>Some years ago a man was apprehended near &mdash;&mdash;, in Hampshire, charged
with a capital offence (sheep-stealing I believe). After being examined
before a justice of the peace, he was committed to the county gaol at
Winchester for trial at the ensuing assizes. The evidence against the
man was too strong to admit of any doubt of his guilt; he was
consequently convicted, and sentence of death (rigidly enforced for this
crime at the period alluded to) pronounced. Months and years passed
away, but no warrant for his execution arrived. In the interval a marked
improvement in the man's conduct and bearing became apparent. His
natural abilities were good, his temper mild, and his general desire to
please attracted the attention and engaged the confidence of the
governor of the prison, who at length employed him as a domestic
servant; and such was his reliance on his integrity, that he even

places at a great distance from it. After a considerable lapse of time,
however, the awful instrument, which had been inadvertently concealed
among other papers, was discovered, and at once forwarded to the high

himself. My purpose is brief relation only; suffice it to say the
unhappy man is stated under these affecting circumstances to have
suffered the last penalty of the law.</p>

<p>&mdash;If you do not deem the following Query
too trifling for your most invaluable publication, I should be much
obliged if you would insert it, in hopes some of your antiquarian

<p>From near Great Berkhampstead, Hants, to Bradenham, Bucks, about fifteen
miles (I write from memory), runs a vallum or ditch, called Grimsdyke,
Grimesditch, or the Devil's Dyke: it is of considerable boldness of
profile, being in some places twelve or fourteen feet from the crest of
the parapet to the bottom of the ditch; it keeps within two miles of the
crest of the Chiltern Hills, and is passingly mentioned in Lipscombe's
<i>History of Bucks</i>, and in the commencement of Clutterbuck's <i>History of
Hertfordshire</i>. Are there other earthworks of the same name (Grimsdyke)
in England; and what was their former use? This one in question, from
its total want of flank defence, could hardly hold an enemy in check for
long; nor does it seem to have been a military way connecting detached
forts, as, though there are earthworks (camps) on either side, it seems
to hold a tolerably straight course independent of them. And, lastly,
about the etymology of the word:&mdash;I find, in Bosworth's <i>Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary</i>, among a host of other meanings:</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "G<span class="smcap lowercase">RIMA</span>, ghost, phantom, witch, hag."</p>

<p>I may mention that there is the tradition about the dyke, common to most
works of the sort, that it was "done by the Devil in a night."</p>

<h3><span>REMARKS UPON SOME RECENT QUERIES.</span></h3>

<p>1. Without wishing to protract the discussion about <i>eisell</i>, let me
tell the correspondent who questioned whether wormwood could be an
ingredient in any palatable drink, that <i>crême d'absinthe</i> ordinarily
appears with noyau, &amp;c. in a Parisian restaurateur's list of luxurious
cordials. Whilst that <i>eisell</i> was equivalent to wormwood is confirmed
by its being joined with gall, in a page of Queen Elizabeth's book of
prayers, which caught my eye in one of those presses in the library of
the British Museum, where various literary curiosities are now so
judiciously arranged, and laid open for public inspection.</p>

<p>2. As a decisive affirmation of what <i>rack</i> meant, where the word was
the derivative of the Saxon pecan, your correspondents may accept the
following from our martyr, Frith's, <i>Revelation of Antichrist</i>. He
renders the second clause of 2 Peter ii. 17., "And racks carried about
of a tempest;" and he immediately adds, "Racks are like clouds, but they
give no rain."</p>

<p>3. In answer to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN'S</span> inquiry where there is any evidence from the
writings of Gregory I., that he could be so shameless as to panegyrise
that female monster Queen Brunéhaut, he may read some of that Pope's
flattering language in his letter addressed to her on behalf of that
Augustine whom he sent to England, as contained in Spelman's <i>Concilia</i>.
Epist. xvii. (<i>Brunichildæ, Reginæ Francorum</i>) begins as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Gratias omnipotenti Deo referimus, qui inter cætera pietatis suæ
   dona, quæ excellentiæ vestræ largitus est, <i>ita vos amore
   Christianæ religionis implevit, ut quicquid ad animarum lucrum</i>,
   quicquid ad propagationem fidei pertinere cognoscitis, <i>devota
   mente et pio operari studio</i> non cessetis.... Et quidem hæc de
   Christianitate vestra mirentur alii, quibus adhuc beneficia
   vestra minus sunt cognita; nam nobis, quibus experimentis jam
   nota sunt, non mirandum est, sed gaudendum."&mdash;Spelm. <i>Concil.</i> p.
   82.</p>

<p>And in Epist. xi.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Excellentia ergo vestra, <i>quæ prona in bonis consuevit esse
   operibus</i>."&mdash;Id. p. 77.</p>

<p>4. The etymology of Fontainebleau (Vol. iv., p. 38.). I can only speak
from memory of what was read long ago. But I think that in one of
Montfaucon's works, probably <i>Les Monumens de la Monarchie Française</i>,
he ascribed the origin of that name to the discovery of a spring amongst
the sandy rocks of that forest by a hound called <i>Bleau</i>, to the great
satisfaction of a thirsty French monarch who was then hunting there, and
was thereby induced to erect a hunting-seat near the spring.</p>

<p>5. To A. B. C. (Vol. iv., p. 57.), your questionist about the marriage
of bishops in the early ages of the Christian church, who has had a
reply in p. 125., I would further say, that as we have no biographies
describing the domestic life of any Christian bishop earlier than
Cyprian, who belonged to the middle of the third century, it is only
incidentally that anything appears of the kind which he inquires after.
It would be enough for the primitive Christians to know that their
scriptures said of <i>marriage</i>, that it was <i>honourable in all;</i> though
such as were especially exposed to <a id="persecution194"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[194]</span>
persecution, from their
prominence as officers of the church, would also remember the apostle's
advice as good for the present distress, 1 Cor. vii. As, however, your
correspondent asks what evidence there is that Gregory Nazienzen's
father had children after he was raised to the episcopate, this fact is
gathered from his own poem, in which he makes his father say to him,
"Thy years are not so many as I have passed in sacred duties." For
though these sacred duties began with his admission into the priesthood,
he was made a bishop so soon afterwards, that his younger son, Cæsarius,
must at any rate be held to have been born after the elder Gregory
became a bishop.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, however, good evidence appears in the papal law
itself, that the marriages of ecclesiastics were not anciently deemed
unlawful. In the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, or <i>Decretum aureum</i>, D.
Gratiani, Distinctio lvi. canon 2., which professes to be a rescript of
Pope Damasus (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 366-84), says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Theodorus papa filius [fuit] Theodori episcopi de civitate
   Hierosolyma, Silverius papa filius Silverii episcopi Romæ&mdash;item
   Gelasius, natione Afer, ex patre episcopo Valerio natus est. Quam
   plures etiam alii inveniuntur: qui de sacerdotibus nati
   apostolicæ sedi præfuerunt."</p>

<p>To which Gratian attaches as his own conclusion:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Hine Augustinus ait, <i>Vicia parentum</i> Filiis non imputentur."</p>

<p>Thereby throwing a slur on the said married bishops. But can. xiii., or
Cænomanensem, of the same Distinctio, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Cum ergo ex sacerdotibus nati in summos pontifices supra
   legantur esse promoti, non sunt intelligendi de fornicatione, sed
   de legitimis conjugiis."</p>

<p>I will only add that Athanasius mentions a Bishop Eupsychius (Primâ
contra Arianos) who was martyred in the reign of Julian, and that the
historian Sozomen says of him (<i>Eccl. Hist.</i>, lib. v. ch. 11.), that
when he suffered he had but recently married,

<h3><span>DOMINGO LOMELYNE. <br />
(Vol. i., p. 193.)</span></h3>

<p>As it is not to be met with in a regular way, your correspondent may be
ignorant that Domingo Lomelyne was progenitor of the <i>extinct baronets</i>
L<span class="smcap lowercase">UMLEY</span>, his descendants having softened or corrupted his name into an
identity with that of the great northern race of the latter name. They,
however, retained different coat-armour in the senior line, bearing in
common with many other English families of Italian, Champaigne, and
generally trans-Norman origin, "a chief." Guido de St. Leodigaro and one
Lucarnalsus are the earliest heroes to whom I find it assigned; but
Stephen, son of the Odo, Earl of <i>Champaigne</i> (whence Fortibus, Earl of
Albemarle), also brought it to England at a very early period; and
thence from the Holderness annex of de Fortibus (in spite of the
allegations in Wott. <i>Bar.</i>, i. 189.), Worsley perhaps copied it. The
old Lumley or Lomelyne accounts connect it with the city of <i>Naples</i>.
Your correspondent will find that Domingo Lomelyne was a <i>Genoese</i>, and
of the <i>bedchamber</i> to Henry VIII.; that he maintained at his own cost,
and commanded, a troop of horse at Boulogne in the same reign, and had a
pension of 200<i>l.</i> per annum from Queen Elizabeth in 1560. If any of
your corespondents can give me the junior ramifications of this family
diverging from the son and grandson of Domingo, I shall feel much
obliged, provided that James Lumley, living 1725, who married Catherine
Hodilow, can be satisfactorily linked with James, the son of Domingo.
James and Martin were the family names, and the family was settled in
London and Essex.</p>

<h3><span>PETTY CURY.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 24. 120.)</span></h3>

<p>Having noticed in a recent number some rather various derivations of the
name "Petty Cury," which one of the streets in Cambridge bears, I have
been led to examine the word "Cury," and think that a meaning may be
given to it, preferable to any of the three mentioned in your paper. The
three to which I refer connect the word with "cook-shops," "stables," or
some kind of a court-house ("curia"). The arguments brought forward in
their favour either arise from the similarity of the words (as "Cury"
and "écurie"), or from the probability that either cook-shops, stables,
or a court-house existed in the vicinity of the street, whence it might
derive its name. With regard to the name "Cury" being derived from the
cook-shops in the streets, this seems to have little to do with the
question; for supposing there are some half dozen such shops there
(which I do not know to be the case), it proves little as to what was
the number three or four centuries ago. Secondly, "Cury" derived from
"écurie:" this seems unsatisfactory, for, as nothing whatever is known
about our former fellows' horses, the argument in its favour simply
consists in "Cury" being similar to "écurie." The third derivation is,
that "Cury" is taken from "curia," a senate or court-house. This falls
to the ground from the considerations, that if it were derived from it
we might expect the name to be Parva Cury and not Petty Cury; and if it
be derived from it, it implies that there was some larger court existing
at that time, in contradistinction to which this was called "Parva
Curia." But no larger one (as the advocate of the derivation allows) did
exist, so that this derivation meets the fate of the former ones.</p>

<p>The most probable derivation of the word is
<a id="from195"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[195]</span>
 from the French
"curie," a <i>ward</i> or <i>district</i>, which certainly possesses this
advantage over the three former ones, that the word is exactly the same
as that of the street. The arguments in its favour are these:&mdash;In
referring to a map of Cambridge dated <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1574, I find the town divided
into <i>wards</i>, with different names attached to them. These wards are all
larger than "Petty Cury:" in the same map the name is spelt "<i>Peti
Curie</i>" (<i>i.e.</i> small ward), both words being French or Norman ones, and
the word "peti" being applied to it from its being smaller than any of
the other wards. In former times it was not unusual to give French names
to the wards and streets of a town, as may be seen any day in London, or
even in Liverpool, which is comparatively a modern place. Thus the word
from which I propose to derive the name "Cury" being the very same, and
not requiring us to form any vague suppositions either about cook-shops,
stables, or court-houses, I conclude, may be considered preferable to
the three before mentioned.</p>

<h3><span>THE DAUPHIN.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 149.)</span></h3>

<p>The communication of your correspondent Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> respecting the claims of
an individual to be the Dauphin of France and Duke of Normandy, brought
to my recollection pretensions of a similar nature made by a person who,
about twenty years ago, was resident in London; and was a teacher of
music, as I was informed. This person introduced himself to me, in a
French house of business, as the genuine Dauphin of France, the second
son of Louis XVI. In justice to the <i>soi-disant</i> Dauphin, I should state
that he did not bring forward his claims abruptly, but in the course of
a conversation held in his presence, relating to the claims of another
pretender to the same honours. The communicator of this important
intelligence of a new rival to the contested diadem, urged his claims
with so much plausibility, and pressed me so earnestly to pay him a
visit&mdash;seeing that I listened to his impassioned statement with decorous
patience and real interest&mdash;in order that he might explain the matter
more fully and at leisure&mdash;that I went to his house in the New Road,
where I saw him more than once. He told me that the woman, who had all
her life passed as his mother, informed him on her death-bed that he was
the Duke of Normandy, and had been confided to her charge and care; and
that she was told to make her escape with him by his true mother, Marie
Antoinette, when that unfortunate queen eluded the murderous pursuit of
her assailants in the furious attack made on the Tuileries on the 10th
of August, 1792. So impressed was I by the earnestness of the narrator,
and the air of truth thrown around his story&mdash;knowing also that some
doubts had been started as to the death of the Dauphin in the
Temple&mdash;that I offered, being then about to visit Edinburgh, which was
at that time the residence of the exiled monarch Charles X. and his
ill-starred family, to be the bearer to them of any memorial or other
document, which the claimant to the rights of Dauphin might wish to
submit to that illustrious body. A statement was accordingly drawn up,
and sent by me when in Edinburgh, not to Charles X., but to her royal
highness the Duchess of Angoulême; who immediately replied, requesting
an interview on my part with one of the noblemen or gentlemen of her
household, whom I met; and was informed by him from her royal highness,
that such communications exceedingly distressed her, in recalling a past
dreadful period of her life; for that there was no truth in them, and
that her brother, the Duke of Normandy, died in the Temple. With deep
and sincere protestations of regret at having been the cause of pain to
her royal highness, and made the unconscious dupe of either a knave or a
fool, instead of bringing forward an illustrious unknown to his due
place in history, I took my leave; and think this account ought to
scatter for ever to the winds all tales, <i>in esse</i> or <i>posse</i>, of
pretended Dauphins of France and Dukes of Normandy.</p>

<p>I should mention, that in my interview with the <i>soi-disant</i> Dauphin, he
showed me various portraits of Louis XVI., and then bade me look at his
own features, in every attitude and form, and say if the likeness was
not most striking and remarkable. I could not deny it; and in truth was
so impressed with his whole account, that I began to look upon the
humble individual before me with something of the reverence due to
majesty, shorn of its glories.</p>

<p class="right">  J. M.</p>


<p>P.S.&mdash;I now recollect that the name of this pretended Dauphin was Mevis,
and that he was said to have been seen in Regent Street by a friend of
mine about five years ago; and may, for aught I know, be still living.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Replies to Minor Queries.</span></h3>

<p><i>Visiting Cards</i> (Vol. iv., p. 133.).&mdash;In answer to your 87th Query, it
may serve in part to help to show "when visiting cards first came into
use," by informing you that about six or eight years ago a house in Dean
Street, Soho, was repaired (I think No. 79.), where Allison and Co., the
pianoforte makers, now of the Quadrant, formerly resided; and, on
removing a marble chimney-piece in the front drawing-room, four or five
visiting cards were found, one with the name of
<a id="Isaac196"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[196]</span>
 "Isaac Newton" on
it. The names were all <i>written</i> on the back of common playing cards;
and it is not improbable that one or more may still be in the possession
of Mr. Allison, 65. Quadrant. The house in Dean Street was the residence
of either Hogarth or his father-in-law.</p>

pleasure in calling his attention to <i>A Collection of Songs, Moral,
Sentimental, Instructive, and Amusing</i>, 4to. Cambridge, 1805. At p. 152.
of this volume, the "pleasant old ditty" of "Darby and Joan" is given at
length, accompanied with the music. The editor, the Rev. James Plumptre,

somewhat difficult to procure, your correspondent is welcome to the loan
of my copy.</p>

<h4><span><i>Marriage of Bishops</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 57. 125.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In reference to the
inquiry of your correspondent A. B. C., for any instances of bishops and
priests who, during the first three centuries, were married after
ordination, I may suggest that the Council of Nice in 325 declared it to
be then "<i>an ancient tradition</i> of the Church that they who were
unmarried when promoted to holy orders should not afterwards
marry."&mdash;Socrates, <i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, lib. i. cap. ii.; Sozomen, <i>Hist.
Eccl.</i>, lib. i. c. xxiii.</p>

<p>May not the proper translation in the text which he quotes, 1 Cor. ix.
5., be "woman," instead of "wife;" and might not the passage be more
accurately rendered by the expression "sister-woman?" Clemens
Alexandrinus says (<i>Stromat.</i>, lib. iii. edit. Poterii, Venet. 1757,
tom. i. p. 526.): "Not as wives but as sisters did the women go round
with the apostles:" and see also Matt. xxvii. 55., Mark xv. 41., and
Luke viii. 3.</p>

<h4><span><i>Winifreda</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 27.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;L<span class="smcap lowercase">ORD</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span> has furnished your
readers with a very curious list of the various printed forms in which,
at different times, this popular song has been given to the world; but
he has omitted one which I think ought to be placed on record. I allude
to a copy contained in the third number of <i>The Foundling Hospital for
Wit</i>, a rare miscellany of "curious pieces," printed for W. Webb, near
St. Paul's, 8vo. 1746 (p. 23.). This work was printed in numbers, at
intervals, the first bearing date 1743; and the sixth, and last, 1749.
My copy is particularly interesting as having the blank names filled up
in a cotemporary hand, and the authors' names, in many cases, added. The
song of <i>Winifreda</i> is assigned to "Mr. G. A. Stevens;" so that, after
all, the Edinburgh reviewer may have confounded <i>George</i> Steevens, the
"commentator," with his earlier and equally facetious namesake, <i>George
Alexander</i>.</p>

<p>George Alexander Stevens was born (if a MS. obituary in my possession
may be relied on) "in the parish of St. Andrew's Holborn, 1710." He died
(according to the <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>) "at Baldock in Hertfordshire,
Sept. 6, 1784."</p>

<h4><span><i>The Three Estates of the Realm</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 115.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;W. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> is
quite right in repudiating the <i>cockney</i> error of "Queen, Lords, and
Commons" forming the "three estates of the realm." The sovereign is
<i>over</i> the "realm;" a word which obviously designates the persons
<i>ruled</i>. W. F.
<a id="however197"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[197]</span>
 however does not exactly hit the mark when he
infers, that "the Lords, the Clergy <i>in convocation</i>, and the Commons"
are the "three estates." The phrase "assembled in Parliament" has no
application to the Convocation; which moreover does not sit at
Westminster, and was not exposed to the peril of the gunpowder plot. The
three estates of the realm are the three orders (<i>états</i>) into which all
natural-born subjects are legally divided: viz. the <i>clergy</i>, the
<i>nobility</i>, and the <i>commonalty</i>. They are represented "in Parliament"
by the "Lords Spiritual," the "Lords Temporal," and the "Commons"
(elected by their fellows). The three estates thus meet their sovereign
in the "chamber of Parliament" at the opening of every session; and
there it was that the plot was laid for their destruction.</p>

<p>W. F. is no doubt aware that originally they all <i>deliberated</i> also
together, and in the presence of the sovereign or his commissioners: and
though, for the freedom of discussion, the sovereign now withdraws, and
the Commons deliberate in a separate chamber (leaving the chamber of
Parliament to be used as "the House of Lords," both Spiritual and
Temporal), yet to this day they all reassemble for the formal <i>passing</i>
of every act; and the authority of all three is recited by their proper
names in the preamble.</p>

<p>The first and second estates are not fused into one, simply because they
continue to deliberate and vote together as all three did at the first.</p>

<p>The <i>Convocation</i> of the Clergy was altogether a different institution,
which never met either the sovereign or the Parliament: but their order
was <i>represented</i> in the latter by the prelates. It is another mistake
(therefore) to think the Bishops sit in the House of Lords as <i>Barons</i>.</p>

jest, does not appear: but Dr. Byrom, to whom application for a solution

<h4><span><i>Poulster</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 152.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The meaning of this word is undoubtedly
as D. X. surmises. The original term was <i>upholder</i>, which is still in
occasional use; next <i>upholster</i>; and, thirdly, <i>upholsterer</i>. In
Stowe's <i>Survey of London</i>, it appears in the second form: and so also
<i>poulter</i>, which still exists as a surname. "Mr. Richard Deakes,
Uphoulster," was buried at St. Dunstan's in the West, London, in 1630.
(<i>Collectanea Topog. et Geneal.</i>, v. 378.) It would be worth inquiry
<i>when</i> the incorrect duplication of termination first produced our
modern words <i>upholsterer</i> and <i>poulterer</i>? Mr. Pegge remarks, that
"Fruiter<i>er</i> seems to be equally redundant;" and that "cater-<i>er</i> is
written <i>cater</i> in the margin of the <i>Life of Gusmand de Alfarache</i>,
folio edition, 1622, p. 125. (<i>Anecdotes of the English Language</i>, edit.
Christmas, 1844, p. 79.)"</p>

<h4><span><i>Judges styled Reverend</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 151.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent. F. W.
J., before he receives an answer to his Query, "When did the judges lose
the title of Reverend and Very Reverend?" must first show that they ever
bore it. By the example he quotes he might as well argue that they bore
the title of "Très Sages," as that of "Très Reverend." The fact is,
that, <i>as a title</i>, it was never used by them, the words quoted being
nothing more than respectful epithets applied to eminent men of a past
age, by the editors or publishers of the work.
<a id="very199"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>I very much doubt also whether the style of "The Honorable" is properly
given to the judges.</p>

<p>It would be curious to trace the commencement of the practice of
addressing a judge on the bench as "My Lord." In the Year Books are
numerous instances of his being addressed simply "Syr." Off the bench
the chief alone is entitled to the designation "My Lord," and that
address can be properly given to the puisne judges only when they are on
the circuit, and then because they are acting under a special royal
commission.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Ring Finger</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 150.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the ancient ritual of
marriage, the ring was placed by the husband on the top of the thumb of
the left hand, with the words "In the name of the Father;" he then
removed it to the forefinger, saying, "and of the Son;" then to the
middle finger, adding, "and of the Holy Ghost;" finally, he left it as
now, on the fourth finger, with the closing word "Amen."</p>

<p>The name of Dr. Freund is probably known to many of our readers as that
of the most profound lexicographer of the present day, so far as the
Latin language is concerned. His larger Latin-German Lexicon is as
remarkable for its philosophical arrangement as for the philological
acquirements of its author; and of that important and valuable work a
translation, or rather an adaption, is now before us, in one handsome
octavo volume, under the title of <i>A Copious and Critical Latin-English
Lexicon, founded on the larger German-Latin Lexicon of Dr. William
Freund: with Additions and Corrections from the Lexicons of Gesner,
Facciolati, Scheller, Georges</i>, &amp;c. By E. A. Andrews. LL.D., &amp;c. Dr.
Andrews and his assistants have executed their respective portions of
the work in a most able manner; and the book, which in its getting up is
as creditable to American typography as its editing is to American
scholarship, will, we have no doubt, meet, as it deserves, with a most
extensive sale in this country.</p>

<p><i>The Churchyard Manual, intended chiefly for Rural Districts</i>, by the
Rev. W. H. Kelke, is a little volume published for the purpose of
promoting the improvement of rural churchyards, by giving them a more
truly Christian character. It is illustrated with some extremely
pleasing and appropriate monumental designs, and contains a judicious
selection of epitaphs, and is indeed altogether well calculated to
accomplish the good end at which the author aims.</p>

<p><i>Archælogical Guide to Ely Cathedral; prepared for the Visit of the Bury
and West Suffolk Archælogical Institute</i>, Sept. 1851, is a most useful
little tract, calculated not only to increase the interest of the
members of the Bury Institute, in their visit to the venerable pile
which it describes, but furnishing just the heads of information which
future visitors will require, and therefore likely to outlast the
temporary object for which it has been so ably compiled.</p>

   Rarely, if ever, has so vast an amount of philological

   knowledge which it conveys of the early and later Latin is not to
   be gathered from ordinary Latin Dictionaries. With regard to the
   manner in which it is got up, we can speak most favourably. Never
   have we seen a better specimen of American typography. Every page
   bears the impress of industry and care. The type is clear, neat,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
