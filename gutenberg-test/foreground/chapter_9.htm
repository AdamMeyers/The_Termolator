<p>Crochet work, so called from the hook, French <i>croche</i> or
<i>croc</i>, with which it is done, is not only one of the easiest but
in comparison with the cost and labour, one of the most
effective kinds of fancy-work. It is also one of the most useful,
as it can be applied to the domestic requirements of every-day
life, to wearing apparel, house-linen and upholstery; and we
are sure that the patterns contained in this chapter, which have
in addition to their other merits that of novelty, will meet with
a favorable reception.</p>

<p>Hooks, or needles, as they are generally called, made of
wood, bone or tortoise-shell are used for all the heavier kinds
of crochet work in thick wool or cotton, and steel ones for
the finer kinds. The Tunisian crochet is done with a long
straight hook, which is made all in one piece. The points
should be well polished inside and not too sharp, the backs
slightly curved, and the handles, whether of bone, steel or
wood, so light as not to tire the hand. Those represented
here, we consider the best, as regards shape. As it is most
essential that the needle should be suited to the cotton in size,
we subjoin a comparative table of the numbers of the D.M.C
threads and cottons and of the different needles.</p><p><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></p>

<p><b>Explanation of the signs *.</b>&mdash;In crochet, as in knitting,
you frequently have to repeat the same series of stitches. Such
repetitions will be indicated, by the signs *, **, ***, etc., as
the case may be.</p>

<p><b>Crochet stitches.</b>&mdash;In point of fact, there is only one,
because all crochet work consists of loops made by means of
the hook or needle, and connected together by being drawn
the one through the other.</p>

<p>Crochet work may however, be divided into two kinds,
German crochet, and Victoria or Tunisian crochet; the latter
is known also under the name of <i>tricot-crochet.</i></p>

<p>In German crochet there are eight different kinds of stitches:
(1) chain stitch, (2) single stitch, (3) plain stitch, (4) treble
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>stitch, (5) knot stitch, (6) bullion stitch, (7) cluster or scale
stitch, (8) double stitch.</p>

<p>The rows are worked, according to the kind of stitch, either
to and fro, or all from one end. In the former case, the work
has to be turned at the end of each row, and the subsequent
row begun with 1, 2 or 3 chain stitches to prevent the contraction
of the outside edge.</p>

<p>When the rows are all worked one way, the thread must
be fastened on afresh each time, which is done by putting the
needle into the first chain stitch of the preceding row, drawing
the thread through it so as to form a loop, and making one
or more chain stitches according to the height required.</p>

<p>At the end of each row, cut the thread and draw the end
through the last loop; in this manner all crochet work is
finished off. Some crochet workers make a few extra chain
stitches with the ends of the thread at the beginning and end of
each row, or fasten them off with a few stitches on the wrong
side.</p>

<p>They can also, when the occasion requires, be formed into
a fringe or tassels as a finish to the work.</p>

<p><b><a name="Position_of_the_hands" id="Position_of_the_hands"></a>Position of the hands and explanation of</b> (1) <b>chain
stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_403">403</a>).&mdash;Take the thread in the left hand between
the finger and thumb, hold the needle between the thumb and
first finger of the right hand, letting it rest on the second
finger, in the same manner in which you hold your pen, and
put it into the loop, which you hold between the finger and
thumb of the left hand. Take up the thread, lying on your
finger, with the needle and make your first stitch as you do in
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>knitting, tightening the loop just enough to leave an easy passage
through it for the needle. The end of the thread must be
held by the thumb and forefinger. The next stitches are made
by taking up the thread with the needle and drawing it through
the loop. The throwing of the thread round the needle by a
jerk of the wrist is called an 'over'.</p>

</div>

<p>(2) <b>Single stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_404">404</a>).&mdash;Put the needle in
from the right side of the
work, into the uppermost
loop of the preceding row,
take up the thread on the
needle and draw it through
both loops.</p>

<a name="fig_404" id="fig_404"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 404. Single stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>(3) <b>Plain stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_405">405</a>).&mdash;Put the needle through, as in
fig. <a href="#fig_404">404</a>, from the right side to the wrong, under the upper
side, either of a chain, or of a stitch of the preceding row,
draw the thread through it in a loop, turn the thread round
the needle and draw it through both loops on the needle. By
making the rows of plain stitches follow each other in different
ways, a great variety of stitches can be produced, as the
illustrations and written instructions here given will show.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Rose stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_406">406</a>).&mdash;This consists of rows of plain
stitches, worked backwards and forwards. Insert the needle
from the right side, under both the horizontal loops of the
preceding row.</p><p><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></p>

</div>

<p><b>Russian stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_407">407</a>).&mdash;This
is worked like the
foregoing, only that all the
rows have to be begun from
the same end, and the thread
has to be cut off at the end of
each row.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 407. Russian stitch.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Ribbed stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_408">408</a>).&mdash;Worked
backwards and forwards,
the hook being passed
through the back part only
of the stitches of the preceding
row.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="fig_408" id="fig_408"></a>

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 408. Ribbed stitch.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Chain stitch.</b>&mdash;Worked
like fig. <a href="#fig_408">408</a>, but on one side
only.</p>

<p><b>Piqu&eacute; stitch.</b>&mdash;This stitch
also is only worked on one
side. Put the needle in under
one of the vertical threads of
a stitch and complete the plain
stitch. This is a stitch that
looks very well on the wrong
side; the bars of the loop lie
quite close together, which
makes it particularly suitable
for unlined articles of clothing.
It requires a large-sized
needle to do this stitch well, especially if the material be a
heavy one.</p>

<p><b>Slanting stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_409">409</a>).&mdash;Worked entirely on the right
side. Take up the back thread of a stitch in the preceding
row, take hold of the crochet thread without turning it round
the needle and draw it through in a loop, and then finish
the stitch like a plain stitch.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Crossed stitch.</b>&mdash;The name which is given to the preceding
stitch when both the threads of the stitches in the row
before, are taken up together, instead of the back one only.</p><p><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></p>

<p><b>Russian crossed stitch</b>
(fig. <a href="#fig_410">410</a>).&mdash;To work this
stitch which runs in slanting
lines, put the needle in between
the vertical threads of the
stitches and underneath the
two horizontal ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 410. Russian crossed stitch.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Counterpane stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_411">411</a>).&mdash;Counterpanes can be
made in a less close stitch
than those just described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<a name="fig_411" id="fig_411"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 411. Counterpane stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>To produce a soft and
elastic fabric turn the thread
round the needle and insert
it under both the horizontal
threads of a loop, take up
the thread without turning
it round the needle, draw it
through in a loop, make an
over, and draw the thread
through all the three loops,
that you have on the needle.</p>

<p><b>Knotted stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_412">412</a>).&mdash;This
stitch likewise is composed
of plain stitches, which,
however differ in a slight degree
from those we have described
hitherto.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/425.jpg" width="300" height="197" alt="FIG. 412. KNOTTED STITCH." title="" />
<a name="fig_412" id="fig_412"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 412. Knotted stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>Make an over, put the
needle through the two horizontal threads of the stitch below,
make another over and draw it back through the two loops
and the first over, make another over, and draw the thread
through the last two loops.</p>

<p><b>Loop stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_413">413</a>).&mdash;Worked as follows: when you
have put the needle into the loop of a stitch below, carry the
thread, downwards from above, round a stripe of cardboard
or a flat wooden ruler, then finish the stitch in the usual way.
These long loops, each about 2 c/m. in length, can also be
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>made over the forefinger and held fast by the thumb as you
work, but it is more difficult to make them regular in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/426.jpg" width="300" height="172" alt="FIG. 413. LOOP STITCH." title="" />
<a name="fig_413" id="fig_413"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 413. Loop stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>Each row of long stitches is followed by a row of plain
stitches. The side, where the
long loops lie, becomes the
right side. If you wish this
stitch to be very thick and
handsome, wind the thread
three times round the ruler, or
finger, and secure it with a
plain stitch; in this case, you
should make one plain stitch
between every two clusters. A loose, fleecy
thread is generally used for this stitch, and
for washing articles more especially, we recommend
Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C.</p>

<p><b>Plain stitches for a chain</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_414">414</a>).&mdash;Begin
with two chain stitches, put the
needle in between the two threads of the
first chain stitch, turn the thread round the
needle and draw it through in a loop, turn
it round again and draw it through the
two loops; then, put the needle into the left
part of the stitch that was just made, turn
the thread round the needle, draw it through
the two loops and so on, to the end.</p>

<a name="fig_414" id="fig_414"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 414. Plain stitches for a chain.</span>
</div>

<p>A chain of this kind makes a very good substitute for
<i>mignardise</i> when that can not
be got of the right size and
colour for the required purpose.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Trebles</b>.&mdash;Trebles are
little columns, or bars made
of loops or stitches. They can
be worked, like all other crochet,
either to and fro, or all one
way. There are different kinds
of trebles; half or short trebles, trebles, double trebles, called
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>also 'long stitch', and quadruple and quintuple trebles, called
'extra long stitch', connected trebles and crossed trebles.</p>

<p><b>Half trebles</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_415">415</a>).&mdash;Turn
the cotton round the
needle from behind, put the
needle in between the trebles
of the preceding row, or into
one edge of a chain stitch;
make an over, bring the
needle forward again with
the thread, make another
over and draw the needle
through all three loops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p><b>Trebles</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_416">416</a> and
<a href="#fig_417">417</a>).&mdash;Begin, as for the
half treble, by turning the
thread round the needle, and
putting it in under one edge
of the stitch beneath, then
take up the thread on the
needle and bring it through
two of the loops, take it up
again, and draw it through
the two remaining loops.</p>

</div>

<p>In fig. <a href="#fig_417">417</a>, we have trebles
made in the same manner
as fig. <a href="#fig_416">416</a>, only that instead
of putting the needle under
one edge of the stitch beneath,
you put it under both, and
between the trebles of the
last row.</p>

<p><b>Double trebles or 'long
stitch'</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_418">418</a>).&mdash;Turn
the thread twice round the
needle, put it into a stitch of
the work and bring the thread
through in a loop, then take up the thread on the needle
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>and bring it through two of the loops, three times in succession.</p>

<p><b>Triple and quadruple
trebles or 'extra long stitch'</b>
(fig. <a href="#fig_419">419</a>).&mdash;For a triple treble,
twist the cotton three times
round the needle, for a quadruple
one, four times, then
form the treble in the usual
way by bringing the needle
through two of the loops at
a time. To make a series of
trebles, of gradually increasing
length, bring the needle, at
every other treble, through the
last three loops, so that before
making a triple treble you
will have to make columns, respectively,
1 treble, 1&frac12; treble,
2 trebles and 2&frac12; trebles long.
Columns like these, of different
lengths, are often required
in crochet work, for leaves and
scalloped edgings.</p>

<p><b>Connected trebles</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_420">420</a>).&mdash;Trebles, connected
together, can be worked to
and fro, and take the place of
plain stitches. Begin with a
chain, then make a treble of
the required height, form as
many loops as you made
overs for the treble, take up
the upper thread of the stitch
nearest the treble, turn the
thread round the needle, bring
it back to the right side and
draw the needle through the trebles, two at a time.</p><p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></p>

</div>

<p><b>Crossed trebles</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_421">421</a> and <a href="#fig_422">422</a>).&mdash;Trebles of this sort
produce an open stitch,
which is often used for
the footing of lace, or
for an insertion. Make
a foundation of chain,
or other stitches, and
proceed as follows:
3 chain, miss 2 stitches
of the row beneath,
make 1 treble in the
third stitch, 5 chain,
1 over, put the needle
in between the loops
of the connected trebles
and finish with
a treble. Then make a double over, put the needle into the
next loop of the preceding row, make another over, draw the
needle through the loops, make another over and join the two
next loops. This leaves 3 loops on the needle. Make an over,
put the needle into the third stitch of the row beneath, make
an over, and bring the needle back to the right side.</p>

<p>Join the 5 loops on the needle together, 2 and 2, make 2
chain, 1 over, put the needle into the upper parts of the
connected trebles and finish with a treble, and so on.</p>

<p>These trebles also can be lengthened if necessary, but in
that case, the width of the crossed treble must correspond
with the height. Generally speaking you make the trebles over
the same number of stitches as you made overs on the needle,
which should always be an even number.</p>

<p><b>Trebles for a chain</b>.&mdash;A quicker way of making a wide
footing for a crochet lace is to make the trebles in the following
manner.</p>

<p>Make 4 chain stitches, 2 overs, put the needle into the first
of the 4 chain, 1 over, draw the thread through the stitch *,
1 over, draw the thread through the next 2 loops and repeat
twice from * = ** 2 overs, put the needle into the left bottom
part of the treble, close the treble as before and repeat from **.</p><p><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></p>

<p>(5) <b>Knot stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_423">423</a>).&mdash;This stitch which is composed
of several loops forming a tuft,
can only be worked from one
side, consequently all one way.
It looks best in a coarse material
to show the interlacing
of the threads.</p>

</div>

<p>Enter the needle through
the two loops of the stitches of
the bottom row, turn the thread
round the needle, but away
from you towards the back;
bring it forward to the right
side, put the needle again
through one of the bottom
stitches, make another over
like the first and draw the
needle through all the bars at
once.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Bullion Stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_424">424</a>
and <a href="#fig_425">425</a>).&mdash;For bullion stitch,
select a needle, a little thicker
towards the handle, and finer
than you would use for any
other crochet stitch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>Begin by making a chain
of very loose stitches, then
wind the thread several times,
very evenly, round the needle.
Insert the needle into a loop
of the chain, make a single over, and draw it with the last
over upon it, through all the other overs.</p>

<p>Trebles in bullion stitch, fig. <a href="#fig_425">425</a>, are worked in just the same
manner, only that you have to turn the thread, at least 10 or
12 times round the needle and draw it through all the overs at
once. To facilitate the passage of the needle, keep the overs
in their place with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand.</p>

<a name="fig_425" id="fig_425"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 425. Bullion stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>Bullion stitch can only be worked with wool or a very fleecy
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>thread, such as Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>but trebles in bullion
stitch can be worked in
any of the D.M.C threads and
cottons.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Cluster stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_426">426</a>).&mdash;Generally
used as an insertion
between rows of plain
crochet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>Put the needle under one
stitch of the preceding row,
make an over, draw the thread
through in a loop, make another
over, put the needle in
again under the same stitch,
bring it back, make a third
over, and pass a third time
under the same stitch; bring
the needle back, make a fourth
over and pass the needle
through all the loops that are
upon it.</p>

<p>Then, after making a chain stitch, begin the same stitch over
again, placing it in the second stitch of the lower row.</p>

<p>Cluster stitch may also be finished off by retaining the two
last loops on the needle, making an over, and ending with a
plain stitch.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Double stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_427">427</a>).&mdash;A rather coarse thread, such
as Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C Nos. 6 to 12, Cordonnet 6 fils
D.M.C Nos. 3 to 10, or Fil &agrave; pointer D.M.C Nos. 10 to 30<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
is better for this stitch than a loose fleecy thread which is apt
to render it indistinct. Take up a loop right and left of a
stitch of the preceding row, so that counting the loop of the
last stitch, you have 3 loops on the needle, make an over and
draw it through the 3 loops. Then take up a loop again by
the side of the one you made on the left, and which now lies
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>on the right. Take 2 loops in the next stitch, make an over
and draw it through all the loops.</p>

<p><b>Raised stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_428">428</a>).&mdash;All the stitches that come under
this heading require a foundation of a few plain rows for the
raised trebles. In fig. <a href="#fig_428">428</a>, you will observe that the fourth stitch
in the fourth row is a double
treble, connected with a loop
of the fourth stitch of the first
row.</p>

under the treble, make 3 plain
stitches, 1 double treble, and
so on.</p>

<p>Having finished this row,
turn the work and make a
plain row. In the next row
begin with 4 plain stitches,
then make 1 double treble
between the 3 stitches that are
between the first trebles, 3
plain stitches, 2 double trebles
and so on.</p>

<p>In the 8th row of plain
stitches, the trebles must be
placed in the same order as
in the 4th.</p>

<p><b>Raised stitch with crossed trebles</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_429">429</a>).&mdash;Begin, as
in fig. <a href="#fig_428">428</a>, by 3 rows of plain stitches. The 4th row begins
with 2 plain stitches followed by: * 1 double treble joined to
the upper part of the 1st stitch of the 1st row; keep the 2 last
loops of this treble on the needle; make a double over for the
next treble, pass the needle through the fourth stitch of the
first row, make an over, turn the thread round the needle,
bring it back, finish the treble all but the last 3 loops, which
you crochet together. Miss the stitch behind the treble, make
3 plain stitches and repeat from *.</p><p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></p>

in which the trebles are to be crossed is shewn in the illustration.</p>

<p><b>Raised stitch with dots</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_430">430</a>).&mdash;After making 3 plain
rows, begin the 4th with 3 plain stitches, and proceed as
follows: * 6 trebles
into the 4th
plain stitch of
the preceding
row, leaving the
last loop of each
treble on the
needle, so that
altogether you
have 7 loops upon
it; then you
turn the thread
once round the
needle and draw
it through the
loops; miss the

the dot,
make 3 plain

you have
to make 1 plain
stitch more, and
fasten the cluster
stitches into
the loops to the

<p><b>Picots</b>.&mdash;The edges of most crochet work are ornamented
with picots, or small points of different shapes, called severally
close picots, chain picots and lace picots.</p>

<p>Close picots may be subdivided into, large and small,
pointed, and rounded, picots with rounded leaves and picots
with pointed leaves.</p>

<p><b>Small rounded picots</b>.&mdash;These may either be made separately
and then sewn on, or made at once, on to a crochet border. In
the first case, begin with 3 chain, then coming back, make 1 plain
stitch on the second and on the first chain stitch. In the second
case make: 1 chain, take the needle out of the stitch and put it
in from the right side, under both edges of the last stitch,
take up the dropped stitch, bring it to the right side, * 3
chain; then returning: 1 plain stitch on each chain, draw the
needle out, put it in from the right side into the second stitch
of the row beneath, take up the loop, bring it back to the
right side, and repeat from *.</p>

<p><b>Large rounded picots</b>.&mdash;5 chain, miss 3, 1 treble on the

<p>When you want to attach these picots at once to an existing
piece of work, drop the last loop and bring it back again
with the needle from the wrong side to the right and miss 2
stitches, instead of one, as in the case of the small picots.</p>

<p><b>Pointed picots</b>.&mdash;Cast on 6 chain, then returning, and
missing the 6th stitch: 1 single stitch, 1 plain stitch, 1 half
treble, 1 treble, 1 double treble.</p>

<p><b>Picots with rounded leaves</b>.&mdash;* 4 chain, and 3 trebles
on the first stitch, and 1 single on the same stitch on which
the trebles were, **, or 6 chain and repeat from * to **.</p>

<p>When these picots serve as a finish to a straight edge,
make 2 single stitches in the preceding row instead of 2 chain.</p><p><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></p>

<p><b>Picots with pointed leaves</b>.&mdash;6 chain, on the first chain
stitch: 3 double trebles, of which you retain the two last
loops on the hook, 1 over, draw the thread through the 4
loops, 5 chain, 1 single on the stitch on which the trebles are.</p>

work</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_437">437</a> and <a href="#fig_438">438</a>).&mdash;Printed cross stitch and embroidery
patterns can very well be copied in crochet work especially
when they are in two colours only, or rather, are drawn in
one colour, on a plain ground.</p>

<a name="fig_437" id="fig_437"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 437.
Open-work crochet made after
a tapestry pattern.</span>
</div>

<p>The way in which such patterns are copied in crochet is by
means of chain stitches and trebles, which, rising one above
the other in rows, form little squares. For each square marked
on the pattern, you must count, in the grounding, 1 treble and
2 chain stitches; in the solid parts, 3 trebles.</p>

<p>The squares formed by the chain stitches should always
begin and end with a treble.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a solid square comes between empty or
foundation squares, count 4 trebles for the solid square, because
the last treble of the last empty square touches the third treble
of the solid one.</p>

<p>Thus for 2 solid squares, side by side, count 7 trebles, and
for 3 squares, 10. Embroidery patterns worked in several colours
can be reproduced in crochet either by trebles and rows worked
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>one way only, cutting off the thread at the end of each row, or
by plain stitches, worked in rows to and fro.</p>

<p>When only three colours are used, pass two threads under
the stitches; when more than two, leave those which are not
in use, at the back of the work and only bring them to the front
as they are wanted. The thread, you lay aside, takes at the
back the place of the one in use. Of course, the threads not in
use can only can be disposed of in this way when the work has
a wrong side, otherwise they must be passed underneath the
stitches. The colours should alternate in the order the pattern
prescribes; moreover, the last stitch before you take another
colour cannot be finished with the same thread, you must pass
the new thread through the last loop and draw it up with that.</p>

<p><b><a name="Tunisian_crochet" id="Tunisian_crochet"></a>Tunisian crochet</b>.&mdash;Tunisian crochet is also called crochet-knitting
because, you have to cast on all the first row of
stitches, as in knitting.</p>

<p><b>Materials</b>&mdash;Every kind of cotton, as well as wool and silk,
can be used for Tunisian crochet: the stitches look equally
well in all these materials, but for things that require frequent
washing or cleaning, a good washing material should be selected,
such as Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C and Cordonnet 6 fils
D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, both strong and suitable in all ways.</p>
<p><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></p>
<p>As we have already said, Tunisian crochet requires to be
done with a long straight needle, with a knob at one end and
it can only be worked on the right side.</p>

<p><b>Plain Tunisian crochet</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_444">444</a>).&mdash;After making a
foundation chain of the required length, begin the first, or
loop row as it is called. Put
the needle into the 2nd chain
stitch, draw a loop through
and so on, until you have taken
up all the chain stitches on the
needle. After having made the
last stitch of the loop row,
make 1 chain stitch and then
pass to the second row that
completes the stitch. Turn the
thread round the needle, draw
it through two loops, turn the
thread round again, and again
draw it through two loops,
and so on to the end.</p>

<p><b>Materials</b>.&mdash;For washing laces, Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C
is the best; for furniture fringes, the lower numbers of Coton
&agrave; tricoter D.M.C, and for producing the appearance of filoselle,
the lower numbers of Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C are to be taken.</p>

<p><b>Stitches</b>.&mdash;Begin by a chain stitch, made with an ordinary
crochet needle, take the needle out of the loop, and insert
the left prong of the fork upwards from below, holding the
fork between the thumb and finger of the left hand. The thread
should always be in front. Then put the thread over the right
prong and the needle into the loop on the left prong, take up
the thread, draw it through the loop, put the thread over the
needle and draw it through the loop that is on the needle,
twist the loop round the left prong, turn the needle round to
the right (the thread will now be wound round the right
prong); put the needle into the loop on the left prong, throw
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>the thread over the needle, draw it through, tighten the loops
and so on.</p>

<p>These stitches may be doubled, or you may make several
trebles on each loop, or arrange the plain stitches in different
ways.</p>

<p><b><a name="Hairpin_insertion" id="Hairpin_insertion"></a>Hairpin insertion</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_451">451</a>).&mdash;Begin by making stripes
with the fork, covering each
thread with two plain stitches.
Then join the stripes together
by the loops, drawing the left
loop over the right one and
the right one over the left.
When you come to the end
of the stripes fasten off the
last loops by a few stitches.
To strengthen the edges, join
two loops together by 1 plain,
2 chain, 1 plain and so on.</p>

you have got the necessary
length of hairpin
crochet, join the
loops two and two, by
means of a coloured
thread which makes a
good contrast with
the thread of which
the hairpin crochet is
made. Work 1 plain
stitch joining 2 loops
on the right, 2 chain,
1 plain joining the 2
loops on the left; then
2 chain and come back to the right, and so on, until you have
taken up all the loops. This forms the zig-zag in the middle.</p>

made with a fork composed of one branch and 3 or 4 rulers,
round which the thread is wound in succession, so as to form
loops of different lengths. You may use for this, either a single
very coarse thread, or else several fine ones, used together as
one.</p>

</div>

<p>The heading of the fringe is plain, and heavy tassels are
fastened into the loops. The tassels are made as follows: take
a thick skein of the same thread the fringe is made of, pass it
through the loop, leaving just the length required for the
tassel, at one end, thread a needle with the same thread and
twist it round the skein, the right distance from the top to
form the head of the tassel and then cut the ends even, at the
bottom. As the loops are of different lengths, the tassels will
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>hang in steps and the fuller and heavier they are, the handsomer
the fringe will be.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_454">454</a> represents another pattern of fringe, the first part
of which is made with the same fork as the preceding one.
Instead however of winding the thread round the several
prongs in succession, you pass it alternately round the two first
and the fourth, thus making loops of two lengths only. Tassels
of a length, suited to the purpose the fringe is intended for,
depend from these loops and may be varied in the second row
by balls made to issue from the middle, or by long meshes,
which are made over the whole width of the fork and affixed
to the loops.</p>

varying in number from four to six, according to the size of
the cotton. The
edge is ornamented
with
little picots. The

three long and
three short loops

stitches that are still disengaged, 2 single on the ring and then
fasten the thread off with a few stitches.</p>

<p>When you have enough leaves, join them together by a
row of picots, working from left to right as follows: * take
the second petal on the right side of a leaf, put the thread into
the 12th stitch; make 2 plain, 1 picot, 1 plain on the stitch

and 2nd picot, 4 chain, close the picot. From this point the
preceding series of stitches takes the place of the picot that
immediately follows the sign **; proceed to ****.</p>

<p>Foundation for the footing of the lace, with a single row
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>of leaves.&mdash;When all the leaves are joined together, take the

1 plain over each loop, and complete the lace by a row of plain
stitches.</p>

<p>To make the leaves stand out from the foundation, use two
shades of thread, white and &eacute;cru, white and Jaune-Rouille
365, or white and Gris-Cendre 415.</p>

<p>The following is the way to join two rows of leaves together,
that have previously been edged with picots.</p>

<p>Fasten the thread on to the little stalk, * 3 chain, 1 plain
on the 8th stitch of the leaf, 2 chain, join to the middle picot
of the 3rd petal of the top leaf; 2 chain, 3 plain on the 5th petal

<p><b>Crochet lace</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_468">468</a>).&mdash;This is always an effective pattern,
in any number of thread. It is not new, however, and is probably
already known to many of our readers as a pillow lace.
Those who are not fond of making pillow lace, will be glad to
learn how to reproduce it in crochet, as it makes a pretty trimming,
both for wearing apparel and furniture. For furniture,
it should be made in unbleached cotton, for articles of dress, in
any of the of the finer numbers, referred to above.</p>

<p>At the end of each row of plain stitches, draw out a sufficiently
long loop to lay it back over the stitches just made, and to
work the next row of stitches over this double foundation.
These loops must be long enough, not to pucker or tighten
the scallops.</p>

<p>For the inner squares = 4 chain, close the ring.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;8 chain, 1 treble, 3 chain, 1 double treble, 3
chain, 1 treble, 3 chain, 1 double treble, 3 chain, 1 treble, 3
chain, 1 double treble, 3 chain, 1 treble, 3 chain, 1 single
stitch on the 5th of the 8 chain.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;* 1 chain, 5 plain on the first 3 chain, 5 plain
on the next 3 chain. On these 10 plain stitches, working to and
fro, 9 rows of plain stitches, decreasing by 1 in each row; after
the last stitch, come back along the side of the little triangle,
and make 1 single stitch in every row, 1 plain on the treble of
the 1st row **; repeat 3 times from * to **.</p>

<p>These small triangles must be worked over 1 single treble
and between 2 double trebles.</p>

<p>When the 4th triangle is finished, make directly, starting
from the last stitch at the point, and along the side: 3 plain,
1 picot, 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain; 1 single stitch on the treble;
all the triangles must be edged, in this same manner on both
sides; on the stitch that forms the point: 3 plain stitches.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;* 17 chain, drop the loop = bring it to the front,
through the plain stitch that lies between 2 triangles; return<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>ing,
make 10 single stitches backwards on the 10 chain.
You make stitches like this, backwards, in all the trebles that
follow, that is, the loop is dropped after each stitch, and
brought forward from the wrong side to the right = 13 chain,
join to the 5th single, counting upwards from below = 7 single
on the chain stitches; 13 chain, join to the other trebles; 6
chain, 1 single on the stitch at the point of the triangle **;
repeat 3 times from * to **. = The chain stitches for the
trebles, must be drawn up very tight.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;1 plain on each of the stitches of the preceding
row, 3 plain on the corner stitch. On each side there must be
29 plain stitches, not counting the corner ones.</p>

as the 1st treble = 2 chain, 1 double treble on the same stitch
as the two first trebles = 10 times to the next corner: 2 chain,
1 double treble, 3 double trebles, each of them with 2 chain
stitches at the corner; repeat the same on each of the 4 sides.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;1 plain on each of the stitches of the last row, 3
plain on the corner stitch = cut off the thread. Join the next
squares together at once by the last corner stitch.</p>

<p>Lower edge&mdash;You begin by making the large scallop at the
point of the square, and pass the double thread over the 3rd
treble that comes before the 3 trebles at the point of the square
and make: 1 plain stitch on each stitch of the square, up to the
3rd treble on the opposite side; then draw out a long loop
which you carry back to the beginning. In the 2nd row increase
by 2 stitches, right and left of the middle stitches, for the
rounding of the scallop, and decrease by 1 on each side. Make
10 rows in all, and in each row, decrease by 4 stitches and
increase by 2. Fasten off after the 10th row.</p>

<p>The two little scallops, right and left of the big one, are
worked in 5 rows, over 5 trebles and 4 intervals of chain
stitches, taking off 2 stitches in every row. For the small
triangle between, worked in 4 rows, you must increase on
both sides by 2 stitches.</p><p><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></p>

<p>When all the scallops are finished, edge them with 3 plain
stitches, 1 picot and 3 plain and work in all the ends of thread
from the preceding rows at the same time.</p>

<p>For the footing and the small triangles, that fill up the
spaces between the squares: 22 chain, miss 1, 10 rows of
plain stitches, worked to and fro, decreasing by 1 in every row.</p>

<p>When the triangle is finished, make on one side, 1 single
in every row; then, on the 11 remaining chain stitches,
a second triangle, like the first, which you then join to the
plain stitches, above the 5th treble; then returning along the
side of the triangle, add 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain, 1 picot, 3
plain; 1 single on each of the 22 chain stitches.</p>

<p>Edge the next side of the 2nd triangle like the first, join the
corner stitch to the 5th treble; edge the two inner sides 3
times with 3 plain stitches and 2 picots.</p>

<p>Then from right to left on the plain stitches: 6 plain, 15
chain, join them to the middle of the 2 triangles = 1 single
on each chain, 5 plain on the square; 11 chain, 1 single on
the 9th of the first 15 chain; 1 single stitch on each of the
chain stitches; 1 plain on each stitch of the square, to the
point where the squares join, 8 chain, 1 single on the 6th of
the 11 chain, 1 single on each of the 8 chain.</p>

<p>On the 2nd side: 7 plain, 5 chain, 1 single on the 6th of the
11 chain, 1 single on each of the 5 chain, 5 plain, 9 chain, 1
single on the 9th of the 15 chain, 1 single on each of the 9
chain, 6 plain on the square; fasten off.</p>

<p>Fasten on, at the 2nd of the 3 corner stitches = 17 chain,
1 plain on the corner stitch of the triangle; 8 chain, 1 plain
on the next corner stitch, 17 chain, and so on.</p>

<p>A row of plain stitches, or trebles, completes the lace.</p>

if worked on a larger scale, the number of stitches would have
to be increased every way in the proper proportion.</p>

<p>For the first coloured border, which immediately surrounds
the centre square, take a coloured thread and make 2 chain
stitches and upon these the common Tunisian stitch, fig. <a href="#fig_444">444</a>.
Increase to the right in every row by one stitch, to the number
of 6 = then put the needle into the first stitch on one side of
the square, turn the thread round and draw it through. Here
you must be careful to observe, in the first instance, that the
second part which is now to be joined to the square, should
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>always remain on the left side of the square and secondly, that
the thread with which you join the two parts together, should
lie to the left and be drawn through, from the wrong side to
the right. Having now got 7 Tunisian stitches on the needle,
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>make 18 double rows, and join the last stitch of each row to
a stitch of the square.</p>

<p>When these rows are finished, you proceed to decrease on
the right till you have only 2 stitches left; and then again to
increase as at the beginning of the stripe. At each increase,
after each double row you must pass the thread through the
corresponding stitch opposite of the same row. When you have
again got 7 stitches on the needle, join them as before to the
square. Work round the 4 sides of the square in this manner
and when you come to the last decrease, join the stitches to
those of the first increase, and fasten off. The next stripes
are to be worked in the same way; they may be made either
wider or narrower, plain, or ornamented with a cross stitch
pattern which you work upon them.</p>

</div>

<p>For the first stripe, make a foundation chain of 26 stitches;
then counting back, draw the needle through the 6th and 7th
chain stitches, drawing up all the three loops together = 2
chain, then put the needle again through 2 chain stitches, draw
up the 3 loops together = 2 chain and so on.</p>

<p>Coming back, make the loop of the first stitch and that of
the second on the chain stitches of the preceding row = begin
every row with 3 chain, which form picots along the edge of
the stripe; when the stripes are finished, take a blue thread
and make 1 plain stitch on each picot and 3 chain.</p>

<p>This blue row is followed by a white one, worked in cluster
stitch, fig. <a href="#fig_426">426</a>, with 2 chain stitches between every 2 clusters.</p>

<p>Then follows another blue row of one plain stitch on each
chain stitch of the previous row. The second blue row consists
entirely of plain stitches worked along the long sides of the
stripes, which are joined together afterwards, but not along the
short sides until the counterpane is finished; then the stitches
should border all the 4 sides. The second stripe, which should
be of the same width as the first, is worked in Tunisian crochet;
for the edge make one row of plain stitches in blue, one of
cluster stitches in white, and then again a row of plain in blue.</p>

<p>Join the stripes together on the wrong side with plain
stitches, taking up one loop on the right and one on the left,
alternately.</p>

<p>When you have joined the stripes, make the outer border,
which consists of 7 straight rows and a scalloped lace edging.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;in blue: 3 chain and 1 plain on each picot, 1
plain, and so on, down the long sides of the stripes = along
the short sides, the side of the chain stitches or that of the
previous row: 1 plain, 3 chain, miss 2, 1 plain.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;in white or unbleached: 1 cluster stitch, fig. <a href="#fig_426">426</a>, on each picot formed by the 3 chain stitches of the 1st
row; on the corner picots, you must make 3 cluster stitches.</p>

<p>3rd, 4th, 5th rows&mdash;in blue: similar to the first. Increase
at the corners by making: 1 plain, 3 chain, 1 plain on the
same stitch.</p><p><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></p>

<p>6th row&mdash;in white or unbleached: similar to the 2nd row.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;in blue: 1 treble on each of the stitches of the
previous row.</p>

<p>Lace edging.&mdash;The scallops extend over 22 stitches of the
previous row and on that account it is better to make the
corners first, to count the stitches both ways so as to distribute
the stitches that are left over, between the scallops.</p>

<p>Corner scallop.&mdash;Fasten on the thread to the left of the
second of the stitches that were added to make the turn, make
6 chain, 1 single on the 4th treble to the right = 1 single on the
next treble = turn the work = * 2 chain, 1 treble on the 6th
chain, repeat 7 times from *, in all therefore 8 trebles = after
the 8th treble: 2 chain, miss 1 treble, 1 single on the 2 next
trebles = turn the work = 2 chain, 1 cluster stitch between
each treble, in all 9 cluster stitches, then 2 chain, miss 2
trebles, 1 single stitch on the next 2 trebles = turn the work
= 2 chain, 1 cluster stitch over the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th pairs
of chain stitches in the preceding row, and 2 cluster stitches
and 2 chain over the 5th, 6th and 7th chain stitches; over the
other chain stitches again: 1 cluster stitch; then 2 chain, miss
2 trebles, join to the 3rd treble = fasten off.</p>

<p>For the scallops on the right side, divide the stitches between
the corner scallops into equal portions. Supposing that
they are divisible by 22, count 9 stitches to the right, fasten on
the thread at the 9th; * 7 chain, miss 2 trebles of the row beneath,
1 plain on the 3rd, 1 single stitch on the next = turn the
work = 2 chain, 1 treble on the 7 chain, repeat 5 times from *
and finish with 2 chain, 1 single on the 2nd lower treble, 1
single on the next treble = turn the work = 2 chain and 1
cluster stitch between each treble of the preceding row, 2
cluster stitches between the 3rd and 2nd trebles = after the 8th
stitch: 2 chain, miss 1 treble, 1 single on each of the 2 next
stitches = repeat 3 times over 2 chain stitches of the previous
row: 2 chain, 1 cluster stitch = on the 4th, 5th and 6th
chain stitches: 2 cluster and 2 chain; on the 3 last chain the
same stitches as on the 3 first = then 1 single over each of the
next 18 and repeat from *.</p>

<p>The final row consists of open picots, formed of 5 chain
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>stitches and 1 plain, between each cluster stitch; after the last
of these stitches and in the indent of the scallops on the
straight line, only 2 chain stitches and 1 plain on the 3rd stitch.</p>

<p><b>Pattern in squares for counterpanes</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_478">478</a>).&mdash;This

<p>Make a foundation chain of 18 stitches on which you work<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>
10 rows to and fro in the dark colour. The 11th and following
rows up to the 21st are worked in the light colour, then take
up the dark colour again. Each stripe should be 3 squares long.</p>

<p>The 2nd stripe is begun in the light colour, and the stitches,
made at the beginning of each row, are joined to those of the
first stripe, as the stitches of the 3rd are to those of the 2nd
and so on.</p>

<p>When you have made sufficient big squares, each consisting
of 9 small ones, border them with seven rows of plain stitches,
worked to and fro.</p>

<p>The 4 squares that form the corners are only to be bordered
in this manner on two sides; the squares along the straight
edges, on 3 sides, and only those that are intended for the
centre of the counterpane, on all 4 sides. The separate parts
are then either sewn or crocheted together on the wrong side.
The dark squares are ornamented with small stars worked
in the light colour, the light ones with scallops in the dark
colour.</p>

<p>For the small stars&mdash;4 chain, close the ring; 2 plain on
each stitch of the chain; 8 plain in all = after the 8th stitch:
8 chain, 1 plain on the 1st plain of the 8 plain stitches. Repeat
the 8 chain 7 times and fasten off, then sew the star on in the
centre of the dark square, taking care to spread out the little
points formed of chain stitches at regular distances from each
other. The scallops are worked from left to right; fasten the
thread on at the point where 4 squares touch, then make a
chain of 18 stitches and secure it at the opposite point. On the
chain stitches: 6 plain, 1 picot, 7 plain, 1 picot, 7 plain, 1 picot,
6 plain = fasten off.</p>

<p>Repeat the same scallop over the second half of the square;
when you come to the 2nd picot of the first scallop join the
two picots. When both scallops are completed, fasten them
on to the foundation by a few stitches on the wrong side.</p>

<p>The outside border of the counterpane is made separately,
and is worked inwards from without and from left to right.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;begin with the dark colour and make * 10 chain
stitches, drop the loop, put the needle into the 1st of the 10
chain, take up the loop and draw it through the stitch; 2 chain
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>and on the 10 stitches: 6 trebles quite close together. Repeat
from * and go on repeating the sequence until the lace is long
enough to trim the counterpane handsomely.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;in the light colour and similar to the 1st = only
that in joining the chain stitches together, you make the single
stitch on the chain stitches of the 1st row.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;in the dark colour and similar to the 2nd.</p>

<p>4th, 5th and 6th rows&mdash;in the light colour and from right
to left: 7 chain, 2 plain on each loop of chain stitches of the
previous row.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;in the light colour and from left to right: * 2 plain
on the treble of the lace, 11 chain, 2 plain on the next loop of
chain stitches = these 2 stitches are made on the wrong side of the
work = drop the loop, turn the work to the right, 3 plain on
the last 3 chain, 8 chain **, and repeat always from * to **.</p>

<p>One row of plain made on each chain stitch and a 2nd row
of trebles on the plain stitches completes the lace edging,
which is afterwards sewn on to the counterpane.</p>

<p>The stripes, one red, the other blue, may be worked in any
stitch. They are edged with 8 plain stitches of 3 different lengths
worked in red. * The first stitch passes only under the loops
of the stitches; the 2nd over 2 stitches; the 3rd over 1, the 4th
inwards, over 3. Repeat from *.</p>

<p>These stitches must be worked parallel to each other along
the two edges that are to be joined together.</p>

<p>The stripes are fastened together on the wrong side by
single or plain stitches.</p>

<p>The outside edge consists of 15 rows: 1st row&mdash;in red:
1 row of plain stitches on the right side of the work.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;in red, and on the wrong side of the work:
plain stitches.</p>

<p>3rd and 4th rows&mdash;in red, and on the right side of the
work: plain stitches.</p><p><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></p>

<p>5th row&mdash;in dark blue and on the right side: 1 treble, 1
chain, miss 1 plain of the row beneath, 1 treble and so on.</p>

3rd chain stitch, 2 chain and repeat from *.</p>

<p>15th row&mdash;in white: 1 plain on the picot formed by the
chain stitches; 5 chain, 1 plain.</p>

<p>Into this last row you draw clusters of lengths of red cotton
to form the fringe, and knot them together with blue, or if you
prefer it, you may finish off the coverlet with a hairpin fringe.</p>

<p><b>Counterpane composed of squares and olive shaped
figures</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_480">480</a>).&mdash;There are many who shrink from undertaking
a large piece of work because it becomes inconvenient
to handle and carry about. The counterpane here represented
has the advantage of being made up of a number of quite little
pieces, which are worked separately and joined together afterwards.</p>

<p>Two colours, which can be clearly distinguished from each
other in the engraving, should be chosen from among the
various combinations suggested; one of them should be very
light, say, cream or white for the olive shaped figures and
squares, and the other of some soft shade only darker, for the
connecting rows and the knotted fringe, described in the chapter
on <a href="./chapter_11.html">Macram&eacute;</a>.</p>

<p>The olive shaped figures begin with 9 chain stitches, on
which you make 8 plain stitches and on the 9th: 3 plain for
the corner.</p>

<p>On the second side of the chain: 8 plain and 3 besides
on the corner stitch, and so on for 3 rows; in the last row
there should be 28 stitches.</p>

<p>These 3 rows are to be considered as one only.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;3 chain, 1 treble on the plain stitch that follows
* 1 chain, 1 treble and repeat 11 times from *; 1 chain, 3
trebles with 1 chain between them on the corner stitch, **
1 chain, 1 treble, repeat 12 times from **.</p>

<p>On the last stitch at the corner, again 3 trebles with 1
chain; close the round with 1 single stitch.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;1 chain, 1 single on the chain stitch that follows
the 1st treble of the last row; 3 chain, 1 double treble between
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>the lower trebles, 1 chain and so on, until you have 35 trebles,
counting the two sets of 3 trebles at the corner.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;here you can change the colour: 1 plain on each
of the stitches of the last row; 3 plain at the corners.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;similar to the 4th.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;2 plain, 1 cluster of 2 double trebles on the same
stitch of the 4th row as the 5th stitch of the last row is on;
miss 1 plain.</p>
<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></p>
<p>Continue in this manner along the whole row, taking care
that the 9th and 22nd cluster come just at the corner.</p>

<p>7th and 8th rows&mdash;these two last rows should be worked
in the same colour as the inside of the figure.</p>

<p>Be careful always to make the increase at the point; a 9th
row in the dark colour may further be added, to connect the
figures, by passing the thread from the wrong side to the right,
between the 13 last stitches of two of the points of the figures.
The space between these olive shaped figures is filled by a
pointed square of chain stitches.</p>

<p>In the 1st and following rows you miss 5 stitches at the
point where the figures meet, and continue to decrease in this
manner until the space is filled up. The fringe is made in the
dark colour, either directly on to the plain crochet, or after a
few rows of open-work.</p>

<p><b>Squares for chair-backs</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_481">481</a>).&mdash;This is a design for
cut-work, out of an old collection by Sibmacher, which we

thrice through 2 loops, 1 triple treble to join to the middle picot
opposite, draw the needle back through the loops, and at the

the first side. There should be 18 trebles and 19 times 2 chain
between the corner trebles; all four sides should be alike.</p>

plain of the 9th scallop and finish the picot.</p>

<p>When these squares are made use of in any number and have
to be joined together, you must join 13 picots and leave the
14th free. The four empty picots in the centre are connected
by a small star.</p>

them back to the 5th of the 12 plain of the first scallop = on
the 10 chain: 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1 picot,
4 plain, = on the 12 chain: 5 plain, 1 picot, 7 plain. Repeat
12 times from *.</p>

possible describing articles in this book that are subject to the
changes of fashion, the present collar composed of squares,
stars, lozenge-shaped figures and a lace edge, is of a shape
that will never be out of date. Fine and delicate work like this
can only be executed in a very fine material, and we recommend
unbleached thread as being more effective than white.

<p>Begin with the straight-edged figures, and then make the
connecting pieces between. The four squares with half stars at
both ends of the collar and on the right and left of the centre
square, have their four sides all alike, whereas the 3 figures
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>within the scalloped edge are rather narrower on the outer
than on the inner side where they join to the foundation.</p>

<p>Inner squares: 1st row&mdash;4 chain, close the ring; 5 chain,
* 1 treble on the ring, 2 chain; repeat 6 times from * and
fasten the thread to the 3rd chain stitch.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;1 chain, 3 plain over 2 chain; 1 plain over each
treble.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;8 chain, * 1 treble on each treble of the 1st row,
6 chain. Repeat 6 times from * = 8 trebles in all, including
the first chain stitches.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;* 10 chain; returning over the chain stitches: 1
plain, 1 half treble, 4 trebles, 1 half treble, 1 plain, join to the
1st chain stitch = on the 6 chain of the 3rd row: ** 1 plain,
1 half treble, 1 treble, 3 double trebles, 1 treble, 1 half treble,
1 plain ***. Repeat once more from ** to ***, then 3 times
from * to *** = along the first leaf to the 10th stitch: 10 single.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;starting from the point: * 7 chain, 1 triple treble
on the 5th stitch of the small scallop of the 4th row: 7 chain,
1 triple treble on the next scallop, 7 chain, 1 plain on the 10th
stitch of the 2nd leaf. Repeat 3 times from *.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;1 chain, * 3 plain on the stitch that forms the
point of the leaf; 1 plain on each chain stitch and each treble
of the last row = 16 stitches in all, up to the 2nd treble = turn
the work = coming back: 1 chain, 1 double treble on the 4th
plain, 1 chain, 1 double treble, 1 chain, 1 double treble, 1
chain, 1 double treble, 1 chain, 1 double treble, 1 chain, miss
3 plain, join to the 4th plain = turn the work = make on each
chain stitch, 2 plain and on each treble 1 plain and 1 picot
over the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th treble; 8 plain **. Repeat 3
times from * to **.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;1 chain, 1 plain on the 2nd of the 3 stitches at
the point, * 9 chain, 1 double treble between the two first
picots of the semicircle formed in the last row; 8 chain, 1 triple
treble on the 3rd treble of the semicircle, 8 chain, 1 double
treble between the 3rd and 4th picots of the semicircle, 9 chain,
1 plain on the stitch at the corner.</p>

<p>8th row&mdash;19 single on the chain stitches of the 7th row,
1 chain, 3 plain on the corner stitch, 24 plain on the chain
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>stitches and trebles = turn the work = coming back: 2 chain,
1 double treble on the 20th plain; on the same stitch add: 2
double trebles with 2 chain; finish with: 2 chain, join them to
the 5th plain = turn the work = on the chain stitches: 1 plain,
1 picot, 1 plain, 1 plain on the treble. Repeat this series 4 times
= add: 4 plain on the chain stitches of the 7th row = turn
the work = 5 chain, 1 double treble on the 1st treble of the
small semicircle; then again 3 times, 3 chain, and twice 1
double treble on each of the trebles beneath = after the last
5 chain: join to the 4th plain.</p>

<p>The points in this row are made with: * 1 plain on the chain
stitches, 8 chain, miss 1 stitch = coming back: 1 single, 1
plain, 1 half treble, 1 treble 1&frac12; treble long, 3 double trebles,
1 plain on the 5 chain stitches. The 2nd point must be placed
one half of it, before, and the other half behind the picot;
make altogether 7 points = after the 7th: 8 plain on the
chain stitches of the 7th row = then work backwards, without
however turning the work: 7 chain, 1 chain on the stitch at
the top of the point and repeat 7 times from * = after the 8th
set of 7 chain stitches: 1 chain; 1 plain on the 9th plain,
bringing the thread forwards from the right side to the wrong
= 2 chain; take the thread back to the 3rd plain from the
wrong side to the right = 1 treble on each chain stitch, 1 picot
above each point, add 4 trebles and 14 chain, join them to the
4th treble that comes after the 1st picot.</p>

<p>On the 14 chain: 5 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain,
1 picot, 5 plain, 4 trebles to the next picot, 1 picot, 4 trebles;
14 plain, join them to the treble nearest the 1st scallop
and so on = make 7 scallops in all; after the 7th add 2 trebles
on the 2 chain stitches = after the 2nd treble make 2 plain,
followed by the 3 stitches at the corner = in the next scallop,
you fasten by 1 single, the 1st picot of the 1st scallop to the
3rd picot of the last scallop. When you have finished the four
sides of the figure above-described, fasten off your thread.</p>

<p>The edging of these squares should be begun on the
narrower of the inner sides and at the 3rd little scallop: * 1
plain on the middle picot of the 3rd little scallop, 7 chain, 1
double treble on the 1st picot of the 4th scallop; 7 chain,<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>
1 triple treble on the 2nd picot of the same scallop, 6 chain, 1
double treble on the 3rd picot of the same scallop, 6 chain, 1
plain on the middle picot of the 5th scallop; 10 chain, 1 treble
on the middle picot of the 6th scallop, 11 chain **, 1 quadruple
treble on the middle picot of the 7th and 1 quadruple
treble on the middle picot of the 1st scallop following and draw
the last loops of the 2 trebles up together. Repeat once from *
to **. Carry the trebles all round the figure on the picots just
referred to.</p>

<p>For the second half of the edging which becomes a little
wider: *** 10 chain, 1 treble on the 6th scallop, 11 chain,
2 quadruple trebles, the last loops of which you join to the
middle picots of the 7th and 1st scallop; 11 chain, 1 treble in
the next scallop; 10 chain, 1 treble in the 3rd scallop; 7 chain,
1 treble 2&frac12; long, 8 chain, 1 treble 3&frac12; long, 8 chain; 1 double
treble, 8 chain, 1 plain, 12 chain, 1 treble, 14 chain, **** 2
quadruple trebles, the last loops of which are joined together.
Repeat from **** to ***, that is the reverse way = finally
add 1 more whole row of plain and 3 plain stitches at the corners
= on the wider side you should have 99 stitches, not
counting the increases at the corner.</p>

<p>To make the same figure, forming a part of the large outside
scallops, repeat the same rows you have in the inner square up
to the 7th row, the first half of which you make exactly the
same as before. In the second half of the row of chain there
should be 1 chain stitch less in each intervening space than
there were in the first half.</p>

<p>8th row&mdash;make the first half of this row like the 8th row
of the inner square = over the 2nd half, one quarter of which
is 4 chain stitches narrower, the little wheels are made like the
others with 7 picots. The number of chain stitches and the
trebles of the setting are also the same, but instead of 7 points
you have to make 5 and over these, 5 small scallops instead of 7.</p>

<p>The setting, towards the top is made exactly in the same
manner as the wide part of the upper square, that is, as from
the 3rd scallop of the first semicircle to the 5th scallop of the
2nd. From this point, the series of stitches changes, so as to
form a rounded edge: * 7 chain, 1 plain on the 6th scallop;<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>
15 chain, 2 triple trebles joined by the last loops to the 7th
and 1st scallop; 14 chain, 1 plain on the 2nd of the 5 scallops;
15 chain, 1 plain on the 3rd scallop; 15 chain, 1 plain
on the 4th scallop, 15 chain **, 2 triple trebles joined by the
last loops in the 5th and 1st scallop. Repeat once again from
** to * = add 1 row of plain on each stitch of the preceding
row; 3 plain on the two top corner stitches. You will thus have
3 figures with a rounded edge on one side.</p>

<p>The second kind of square consists of 8 leaves inside and is
begun in the same way by 6 chain formed into a ring.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;5 chain, 1 treble, 2 chain, * 1 treble, 2 chain.
Repeat 6 times from * and join to the 3rd of the 5 chain.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;1 chain, 3 plain over 2 chain, 1 plain on each
treble.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;9 chain, * miss 1 stitch = coming back: 1 single,
1 plain, 1 half treble, 1 treble, 1 double treble, 1 triple treble,
1 treble over the treble of the 2nd row; 7 chain. Repeat 7
times from * = after the 8th point: 7 single along the 1st.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;* 1 plain on the stitch you missed at the point,
5 chain, 1 triple treble on the treble of the 3rd row, 5 chain.
Repeat 7 times from *.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;3 chain, 1 treble on each stitch of the 4th row;
join to the 3rd of the 3 chain.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;10 chain, 1 plain on the treble over the triple
treble of the 4th row: 10 chain, 1 plain on the treble above
the little point.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;15 plain on the 10 chain = on the 3rd scallop
only: * 7 plain, 10 chain, come back to the second scallop,
bring the thread back from the wrong side to the right between
the 7th and 8th plain stitches, 15 plain on the 3rd
scallop, 8 plain on the next scallop, 15 plain and repeat 6
times from *.</p>

<p>When the 16th scallop is finished, pass to the point of the
1st scallop by means of 7 single, then add the 10 chain to
pass to the 8th scallop above; when that is finished, fasten off,
and fasten on again to one of the 8 scallops.</p>

<p>8th row&mdash;* 21 chain, miss 1 stitch, 1 plain, 1 half treble,
1 treble, 1 treble 1&frac12; treble long, 1 double treble, 1 treble 2&frac12;
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>trebles long, 1 triple treble, 1 treble 3&frac12; trebles long, 1 quadruple
treble, 1 treble 4&frac12; trebles long, 1 quintuple treble.
After passing through the 3rd loop, make 1 quadruple treble,
between the 2 plain scallops; then finish the quintuple treble,
7 chain, 1 plain on the 2nd scallop and repeat 7 times from *.</p>

<p>9th row&mdash;* 7 plain on the 7 chain; 1 plain on each stitch
of the pyramid, 3 plain on the stitch at the point; 4 plain on
the 7 chain on the opposite side = turn the work = ** 1 chain,
miss 1 plain, 1 treble on the 2nd stitch = after the 5th treble,
leave out no more stitches between the trebles ***; place the
8th, 9th and 10th trebles on the 2nd of the increased stitches.
Repeat on the opposite side from *** to ** and join to the
4th of the plain stitches = make 17 trebles in all, then one
plain over each chain, 1 plain on each treble and 1 picot after
every 3rd plain = after the 4th and up to the 8th picot, leave
only 2 plain between: 11 picots in all = in conclusion: 3 plain
more on the 7 chain and repeat the whole 7 times from *.</p>

<p>The little wheel at the top of the square is begun with 10
chain for the ring = 16 plain on the ring, 4 chain, * 1 treble,
1 chain = repeat 14 times from *; 16 trebles in all, including
the chain stitches = then on each treble and each chain stitch:
1 plain; after 4 plain: 1 picot; connect the wheel first on the
right.</p>

<p>The 2nd picot is to be fastened to the 9th picot of the large
scallop = proceed with: 3 times 4 plain with 1 picot = after
the 3rd plain, fasten the picot to the 3rd picot of the next large
scallop and complete the small wheel. The left wheel is made
and inserted in the same manner as the right one. The wheels
at the bottom of the square require for the foundation ring:
14 chain, on which you make 21 plain = on these: 4 chain,
* 1 treble, 1 chain = repeat 19 times from *; 21 trebles in all,
including the chain stitches = 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain, 1 picot,
3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain, 4 chain, join to the 8th picot of the
2nd scallop; 4 chain, finish the picot, 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain,
8 chain, join to the 10th picot of the scallop, 8 chain, complete
the picot; 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain, 8 chain, join to the 2nd
picot of the 3rd scallop, 8 chain, close the picot, 3 chain, 1
picot, 3 plain, 4 chain, join to the 4th picot of the 3rd scallop;<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>
4 chain, complete the picot, 3 plain, 1 picot and so on, until
you have 14 picots round the wheel. Repeat the same wheel to
the left between the 4th and 5th scallop.</p>

<p>The edging of this second kind of square is also slightly
different; fasten the thread to the 6th picot of the 1st scallop
before the small wheel, then working from right to left, count:
* 10 chain, 1 treble on the 2nd empty picot of the small wheel;
8 chain, 1 triple treble on the 4th picot of the wheel = upwards:
9 chain, 1 double treble on the 6th picot of the
wheel; 9 chain, 1 plain on the 6th picot of the 8th scallop, 12
chain, 1 plain on the 7th picot of the scallop, 11 chain **, 1
quadruple treble on the 9th picot of the 8th scallop and on
the 3rd picot of the 7th; draw the last loops of the two trebles
up together. Repeat once more from ** to *, then: 1 plain on
the 6th picot of the 6th scallop; *** 12 chain, 1 sextuple
treble on the 9th picot of the 6th scallop, retain 2 loops of
the treble on the needle, make 4 more overs, join the treble to
the 3rd picot of the 5th scallop; finish the bars, 12 chain, 1
plain in the 6th picot of the next scallop = 12 chain, 1 double
treble on the 2nd picot of the 7 empty picots of the bottom
wheel; 9 chain, 1 quadruple treble on the 4th picot; 12 chain,
1 double treble on the 6th picot, 14 chain, 1 plain on the 6th
picot of the 4th scallop, 14 chain ***, 1 septuple treble, in
the 9th and 3rd picots of the 4th and 3rd scallops ****. For
the preceding treble, you pass first through 4 loops only, then
make 4 more overs for the other half of the treble, and finish
the last loops one by one. Repeat from **** to ***. One row
of plain stitches completes the square.</p>

<p>After having made the square similar to that of the upper
one, you have merely to add the large wheels at the top.</p>

<p>The setting of chain stitches and trebles is begun at the
first scallop between 2 wheels = 1 plain on the 6th picot of the
1st scallop; 14 chain, 2 quintuple trebles, of which the last
loops only are joined together, on the 9th and 3rd picot of the
1st and 2nd scallop, = 14 chain, 1 plain on the 6th picot of the
next scallop; * 14 chain, 1 treble on the 2nd empty picot of
the wheel; 10 chain, 1 quadruple treble on the 4th picot, 10
chain, 1 treble on the 6th picot; 14 chain, 1 plain on the 6th
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>picot of the 3rd scallop; 14 chain, 2 sextuple trebles on the
10th and 2nd picot of the 3rd and 4th scallop; 15 chain, 1
plain on the 6th picot of the 4th scallop; 16 chain, 2 sextuple
trebles on the 10th and 2nd picot of the 4th and 5th scallop;
16 chain, 1 plain on the 6th picot of the 5th scallop; 15 chain
** 3 septuple trebles on the 10th and 2nd picot of the 5th
and 6th scallop. Repeat from ** to *; and make 4 figures
with rounded edges. When all the figures are finished, join
them together by trebles of a suitable length.</p>

<p>Introduce the thread at the corner stitch on the widest side
of the 2nd 8 pointed star and make: 1 plain, 6 chain, miss 3
stitches, 1 plain on the 3 next stitches, 4 chain, miss 2, 1
plain on the next 3 plain stitches.</p>

<p>Make 11 loops in this manner, each consisting of 4 chain
and 3 plain, then 2 loops of 3 chain and 2 plain = then miss
as many stitches of the square at the edge of the collar as were
left empty in the second square; 2 plain and draw the loop
each time through the 2 last stitches of the opposite square
= 1 chain, 1 single on the 2nd chain stitch of the opposite
side; 1 chain, 3 plain on the edge of the first square, 1 chain,
1 single, 1 chain, miss 3 stitches, 3 plain, 5 chain, bring the
loop from the wrong side to the right = on the chain stitches:
4 plain, 2 chain, miss 3, 3 plain.</p>

<p>From this point onwards, fasten all the bars of chain stitches
to the loops produced by the same stitches in the 2nd square.
Thus, the 1st bar consisting of 5 chain, the 2nd will consist of
7 chain on which make 7 plain, and then add 2 more chain.
Nowhere must the two first chain stitches be uncovered.</p>

<p>The 3rd bar must consist of 9 chain, 9 plain and 2 chain
= the 4th of 11 chain, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 2 chain =
the 5th of 13 chain, 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain,
2 chain = the 6th of 16 chain, 6 plain, 1 picot, 6 plain, 1
picot, 6 plain, 2 chain = the 7th of 18 chain, 5 plain, 1 picot,
4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 2 chain = the 8th
of 21 chain, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot,
5 plain, 2 chain = the 9th of 24 chain, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5
plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 2
chain = the 10th of 26 chain, 6 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot,<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>
5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 6 plain, 2 chain = the 11th
and last of 28 chain, 32 plain, 2 chain, fasten off.</p>

<p>As the square with the semicircles in it, has more plain stitches
in the edge than the one with the eight-pointed star in it, the
stitches must be divided so that you miss 3 from time to time,
instead of two. When the 7 top figures are finished, join the 7
bottom ones to them, each separately, by a row of plain stitches,
made on the wrong side of the work. Below the first square
with the semicircles, comes the eight-pointed star, below
the next eight-pointed star, the square with the semicircles,
and so on.</p>

<p>A narrow edging forms the outside border, the foundation
of which is a row of plain stitches running all along the squares.
At the middle of the square you decrease by 2 stitches, and at
the point where two squares meet, by 3. When you reach the
left side and the end of the row, make 3 plain on the corner
stitch, then: * 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 14 chain, join them
to the first of the 5 first plain (drop the thread at each scallop
and bring it forward from the wrong side to the right) = on
the 14 chain: 5 plain, 1 picot, 11 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain = along
the square: 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, then 14 chain, join them
to the first plain = over the 14 chain: 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain,
14 chain, join them in turning back between the 5th and 6th
of the 10 plain of the 1st scallop; 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1
picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain; on the half-finished scallop: 5
plain, 1 picot, 5 plain ** = on the plain stitches of the edge:
4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 12 chain, come back, join to the 1st
of the 4 plain = on the 12 chain: 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 1
picot, 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain *** = repeat on the same
figure once from * to *** and once from * to **.</p>

<p>This makes 77 stitches, the number there ought to be on
the wide side of the straight-edged figures.</p>

<p>The scallops vary a little on the rounded sides. There,
you should have 110 stitches, counting from the corner to the
treble that marks the middle at the bottom. The single scallops,
between the triple scallops of the border, are also all made
over 8 stitches; the first triple scallop is made over 20 stitches,
the 2nd, 3rd and 4th triple scallop over 16 stitches.</p><p><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a></p>

<p>Make no single scallop after the 4th triple one; which is
immediately succeeded by the 5th triple scallop, over 16 stitches.</p>

<p>Altogether, round each star, there are 9 triple and 8 single
scallops. After the 8th single one, make 3 plain stitches on the
2 chain stitches of the connecting bar.</p>

<p>On the 32 plain stitches of the last bar: 8 plain, 1 picot,
4 plain, 12 chain, bring them back and join to the 5th of the
8 plain = on the 12 chain: 5 plain, 2 chain, draw the loop
through the picot in the middle of the last single scallop, 2
chain, close the picot, 8 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain = in the bar:
4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 12 chain, bring them back and fasten
them to the 1st plain = 5 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 12 chain, join
them to the 4th plain of the 1st scallop; 5 plain, 1 picot, 8
plain, 1 picot, 5 plain = in the half-finished scallop: 4 plain,
1 picot, 4 plain = in the bar: 4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain =
12 chain, bring them back and fasten them to the 1st plain.
4 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 12 chain, join them close to the
scallop above = 5 plain, 1 picot, 4 plain, 12 chain, bring
them back and join them to the 4th plain of the 2nd scallop;
5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain =
in each of the 2 half-finished scallops: 4 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain
= finish with 4 plain, 3 plain on the 2 chain and repeat from
* round all the rounded parts.</p>

<p>The lozenges that fill the empty spaces between the large
figures are made in 7 rows, on a ring formed of 4 chain.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;5 chain, 1 treble on the ring, 2 chain, 8 trebles
in all, including the bar of chain stitches.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;3 plain over 2 chain, 1 plain over each treble.</p>

on the points.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;on each side of the lozenge 3 little scallops on
8 chain, with 3 picots and 1 picot below the scallops and between
every 4 plain; the scallops at the points extend over 4
stitches only, so that the picot below is left out.</p>

<p>These lozenges are fastened on two sides to the middle
picot of the triple scallop; then, starting from the 3rd scallop
of the lozenge you make, 8 chain, join them to the middle
picot of the 1st triple scallop; coming back over the 8 chain:
5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain and finish the scallop. The next scallop,
at the point of the lozenge, is fastened by a picot of 6
chain, to the middle picot of the 6th scallop underneath the
connecting bar. Repeat the same on the 2nd side and make 6
lozenges in all.</p>

<p>The lace that finishes off the collar at the neck must be
made to stand up, and is begun by a row of trebles on the
plain stitches.</p>

<p>From the corner as far as the 2nd treble of the 4th scallop,
make triple trebles, from the 4th scallop to the 6th chain
stitch after the 5th scallop, make double trebles, from this point
to the 2nd scallop of the next semicircle, only single trebles,
then again double trebles and finish with triple trebles as at
the beginning. Decrease by 2 or 3 stitches in each square.</p>

<p>When this row of trebles is finished, fasten off, and fasten
on again on the right and on the base of the 1st treble which
you border with 4 chain, then follow: * 15 plain on the row of

the loop to the front; ** 1 plain, 1 picot, 1 plain, 1 plain on
the treble; repeat 3 times again from ** and add 4 plain on
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>the trebles = turn the work = 6 chain, 1 double treble over
the treble beneath; again 3 times 6 chain stitches and 1 double
treble; join the 4th set of 6 chain to the 4th plain = bring the
thread back to the front: 1 plain on the 6 chain = 8 chain,
miss 1, and make on the others: 1 plain, 1 half treble, 2 trebles,
1 treble 1&frac12; treble long, 2 double trebles, 1 plain stitch on the
6 chain. The next point comes above a treble; you make 7
points in all. After the 7th: 5 plain, then 7 chain, 1 plain on
each point between the points and join.</p>

<p>Join the 8th set of 7 chain on to the 4th plain of the first treble
= then add: 2 chain, draw the loop from the wrong side to
the right through the 1st plain stitch; 8 trebles, 1 picot, 4
trebles, 12 chain, bring them back over the picot, join it between
the 4th and 5th trebles; 5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain, 1 picot,
5 plain, 1 picot, 5 plain.</p>

<p>Over each point: 1 picot and over the picot 1 scallop, like
the one made in the square. On the 7th point only 1 picot =
after the last treble on the last chain: 2 chain; then go on
with the plain stitches until you have 27 and repeat from *.</p>

<p>In the semicircles that follow you leave out the first and
last little scallops, the first and the last scallop must be joined
together by the first and the last picot; in the last semicircle,
make 6 little scallops, the same as you did in the first.</p>
