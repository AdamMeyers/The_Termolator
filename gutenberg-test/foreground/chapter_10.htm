<h2><a name="Tatting" id="Tatting"></a>Tatting.</h2>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />


<p>On account of a similarity in their construction, a chapter
on tatting seems to form a natural sequence to the one on
crochet and is in some ways a preparation for that on macram&eacute;
which succeeds it.</p>

<p>The English name of tatting is said to be derived from
&laquo;tatters&raquo; and to denote the frail disconnected character of the
fabric. By the Italians it was formerly called &laquo;occhi&raquo;, whilst
in the East it still bears the name of &laquo;makouk&raquo;, from the
shuttle used in making it.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, when tatting was in great vogue,
much larger shuttles than our present ones were used, because of
the voluminous materials they had to carry, silk cord being one.</p>

<p><b>Shuttles</b>.&mdash;The tatting shuttle consists of two oval blades
of either bone, ivory, mother of pearl or tortoise-shell, pointed
at both ends, and joined together in the middle. A good shuttle
contributes materially to the rapid and perfect execution of the
work and attention should be paid in its selection to the following
particulars: that it be not more than 7 c/m. long and
2 or 3 c/m. wide: that the two ends be close enough to
prevent the thread from protruding; this is more especially
important in tatting with two shuttles and lastly, that the centre
piece that joins the two oval blades together should have a
hole bored in it, large enough for the thread to pass through.</p>

<p>In filling the shuttle, be careful not to wind on too much
<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>thread at once, or the blades will gape open at the ends and the
thread get soiled by constant contact with the worker's hands.</p>

<p><b>Materials</b>.&mdash;A strongly twisted thread such as Fil d'Alsace
D.M.C, Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C,
is best for tatting. We particularly recommend Fil d'Alsace,
as forming the best shaped knots and picots. A soft material
such as Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C, can also be used where it
suits the purpose better.</p>

<p><b><a name="First_position_of_the_hands" id="First_position_of_the_hands"></a>First position of the hands</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_486">486</a>).&mdash;The construction
of the knots or stitches, appears at first sight to present great
difficulties but will be easily mastered by attention to the
indications here given. One thing, to be constantly borne in
mind is, that when the right hand has passed the shuttle
through the loop, it must stop with a sudden jerk and hold
the thread tightly extended until the left hand has drawn up
the knot. After filling the shuttle, take the end of the thread
between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, and the
shuttle in the right, pass the thread over the third and fourth
fingers of the left hand, bring it back towards the thumb and
cross the two threads under the fingers, as indicated in fig. <a href="#fig_486">486</a>. Pass the thread that comes from the shuttle round the
little finger of the right hand, and give the shuttle the direction
shown in the engraving.</p><p><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<a name="fig_486" id="fig_486"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 486. First position of the hands.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Second and third position of the hands</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_487">487</a> and
<a href="#fig_488">488</a>).&mdash;Make the shuttle pass between the first and third fingers,
in the direction indicated by the arrow in fig. <a href="#fig_487">487</a>, and bring
it out behind the loop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<a name="fig_487" id="fig_487"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 487. Second position of the hands.</span>
</div>

<p>Here the first difficulties for beginners arise and until they
have sufficiently mastered the movements of both hands not
to confuse them, we advise them to pay careful attention to
the following instructions. As soon as you have put the shuttle
through the loop, place
the right hand on the
table with the thread
tightly extended, leaving
the left hand perfectly
passive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/502.jpg"  alt="FIG. 488. THIRD POSITION OF THE HANDS." title="" />
<a name="fig_488" id="fig_488"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 488. Third position of the hands.</span>
</div>

<p>Then, raising the
third and fourth fingers
of the left hand with
the loop upon them,
pull up the loop,
stretching the thread
tightly in so doing by
extending the fingers.
By this movement
a knot is
formed, the
first part of the
&laquo;double knot&raquo;,
which is the
most common
one in tatting.</p>

<p>Remember
that the right
hand must be
kept perfectly
still as long as
the left is in motion and that the knot must be formed of the
loop thread that is in the left hand.</p>

<p>The right hand, or shuttle thread, must always be free to
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>run through the knots; if it were itself formed into knots it
would not have the free play, needed for loosening and tightening
the loop on the left hand, as required.</p>

<p><b>Fourth position of the hands</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_489">489</a>).&mdash;The second
part of a knot is formed by the following movements: pass the
shuttle, as indicated in fig. <a href="#fig_489">489</a>, from left to right, between the
first and third fingers through the extended loop; the right
hand seizes the shuttle in front of the empty loop and extends
the thread; the left hand pulls up this second part of the knot
as it did the first.</p>

<p><b><a name="Single_or_half_knots" id="Single_or_half_knots"></a>Single or half knots. Josephine picots</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_490">490</a> and <a href="#fig_491">491</a>).&mdash;The
Josephine picot or purl, as it is also called in tatting,
consists of a series of single or half knots formed of the first
knot only. These picots may be made of 4 or 5 knots, as in
fig. <a href="#fig_490">490</a>, or of 10 or 12 knots, as in fig. <a href="#fig_491">491</a>.</p>

<p><b>Fifth position of the hands</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_492">492</a>).&mdash;When the second
knot forming the double knot has been made, the two hands
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>resume the position shown in fig. <a href="#fig_487">487</a>. Fig. <a href="#fig_492">492</a> reproduces the
same and shows us a few finished knots as well.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Position of the hands for making a picot</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_493">493</a>).&mdash;Picots
are introduced into tatting patterns as they are into
knitting and crochet. They also serve to connect the different
parts of a pattern together and render a great many pretty
combinations feasible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<a name="fig_493" id="fig_493"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 493. Position of the hands for making a picot.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Open and close picot</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_494">494</a> and <a href="#fig_495">495</a>).&mdash;These are
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>formed of single knots, leaving a loop on the extended thread,
as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_494">494</a>, and a short length of thread between the
knots; finish the second half knot and when you have pulled
it up, join it to the preceding knot. In this manner the picot
represented in fig. <a href="#fig_495">495</a> is formed quite naturally.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_494" id="fig_494"></a><a name="fig_495" id="fig_495"></a>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 495. Close picot.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In every kind of tatting the knot that comes after the picot
is independent of the loop.</p>

<p>Thus if the directions say: 2 knots, 1 picot, 3 knots, 1 picot,
2 knots, etc., you must count the knot that served to form the
loop and not make: 2 knots, 1 picot, 4 knots, etc. To join the
different rings, ovals, etc., together by means of picots, take up
the thread that runs over the left hand with a crochet needle,
inserting it into the picot downwards from above, draw the
thread through and pull it up like any other knot.</p>

<p><b>Tatting with two shuttles</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_496">496</a>).&mdash;Two shuttles are
used in tatting when the little rings are not to be connected
together at the bottom by a thread, when you want to hide the
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>passage of the thread to another group of knots and when
threads of several colours are used.</p>

<a name="fig_496" id="fig_496"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 496. Tatting with two shuttles.</span>
</div>

<p>When you work with two shuttles, tie the two threads together.
Pass one thread over the third finger of the left hand,
wind it twice round the fourth finger and leave the shuttle
hanging down.</p>

<p>Pass the second shuttle into the right hand and make the
same movements with it as you do in working with one shuttle
only.</p>

<p><b><a name="Detached_scallops" id="Detached_scallops"></a>Detached scallops</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_497">497</a>).&mdash;Make 12 double knots with
one shuttle, then tighten the thread so as to draw them together
into a half ring; the next knot
must touch the last knot of
the scallop before it.</p>
