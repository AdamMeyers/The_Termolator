<h2><a name="Tapestry_and_Linen_Embroidery" id="Tapestry_and_Linen_Embroidery"></a>Tapestry and Linen Embroidery.</h2>


<p>Tapestry is one of the oldest kinds of needlework and
one which has always been popular every where.</p>

<p>There are two distinct sorts of canvas in use for tapestry,
called respectively, 'plain (single thread) canvas', and
'Penelope (double thread) canvas'. The latter is generally preferred,
because it is easier to count the stitches upon it, but
both make an equally good foundation for the embroidery, as
the following examples will show.</p>

<p>Besides canvas, other fabrics bearing a close resemblance
to it, are often used, especially Java linen, the close texture of
which renders grounding unnecessary.</p>

<p>Cloth, velvet or plush can also be overlaid with canvas,
the threads of which are pulled away after the pattern is
finished. For work of this kind, we however prefer a material
with less dressing, such as a twisted tammy, or Colbert linen,
because the pulling out of the harsh rough threads of the canvas
is very apt to injure the material beneath.</p>

<p>Stitches, worked upon two stuffs, must be drawn very tight,
or they will look loose and untidy when the auxiliary fabric
is taken away.</p>

<p>Tapestry can be done either in a frame, or in the hand; in
the latter case, the ends of the piece of canvas should be
weighted with stones or lead, to prevent its puckering.</p><p><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></p>

<p>The stitches, which ought completely to hide the canvas,
should all lean one way and the underneath ones always from
left to right, as the letters in writing.</p>

<p><b><a name="Marking_out_the_embroidery_ground" id="Marking_out_the_embroidery_ground"></a>Marking out the embroidery ground</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_252">252</a>).&mdash;Before
beginning a piece of canvas work and tacking on the auxiliary
fabric, count how many stitches it will contain, and mark them
out in tens, with a coloured thread, as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_252">252</a>, along
two sides at least, in the length and breadth. Having ascertained
the number of stitches both ways, divide them in two, and
starting each time
from the middle
stitch, trace two
lines, one horizontal,
the other vertical,
right across the canvas.
The point of
intersection will be
the centre. This
sort of ground-plan
will be found most
useful, and should
not be pulled out
until, at least, half
the work be finished.
If moreover,
you have corners
to work, or a pattern
to reverse, in the angle of a piece of embroidery, trace a
diagonal line besides, from the corner to the centre.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Materials suitable for tapestry</b>.&mdash;Hitherto, wool and silk,
were the materials chiefly used for canvas work; a very thick
wool for carpets, as being warmer and more durable. Silk is
too delicate a fibre to resist much wear and tear, and cannot
therefore be recommended for articles that are intended for
constant use, and wool, though stronger, is subject to the
destructive agency of moths; whereas cotton, which is cheaper
than both, and quite as brilliant, is free from all these disadvantages
and is extremely easy to clean.</p><p><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></p>

<p>For most kinds of tapestry we can therefore with perfect
confidence, recommend the use of Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C
Nos. 6 to 20, Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 3 to 15, and even
Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C No. 25.<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Cross_stitch" id="Cross_stitch"></a>Cross stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_253">253</a>).&mdash;Cross stitch is the foundation of
every other stitch, and the one in most common use. It is also
called marking-stitch, being used for marking linen. It is
worked in two lines. In the first, the thread is carried diagonally
from left to right across a square of threads, and then,
downwards, underneath the two horizontal threads; in the
second, the stitches are carried from the right-hand lower
corner of the square to the upper left-hand corner, so that
the four points of the two stitches form a perfect square.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Half cross stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_254">254</a>).&mdash;If the cotton is too coarse,
or the canvas too fine, to make the double stitch, carry the
thread back along the whole line and make the half-stitches
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>across it, from left to right; the same in the case of a piece of
work, which you buy with</p>

<p><b>Gobelin stitch on plain canvas</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_255">255</a>).&mdash;This is
worked over two horizontal threads and one perpendicular. In
a frame, you can work the second row, from right to left,
otherwise, you must turn the work round, and bring out your
needle behind the last-made stitch.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Gobelin stitch on Penelope canvas</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_256">256</a>).&mdash;For the
same stitch on Penelope canvas, you need rather a coarse
needle, which will make its way easily between the threads of
the canvas.</p>

canvas.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Reps stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_257">257</a>).&mdash;Contrary to Gobelin stitch, this
stitch which is an imitation of reps, is worked in vertical lines,
over two vertical threads and one horizontal one.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Tent stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_258">258</a>).&mdash;This stitch is simply the first half
of a cross or marking stitch, worked over a single thread each
way. The illustration shows the working of a row, from right
to left, the thread being carried forward, underneath the vertical
threads. Tent stitch is used for the most part, in con<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>junction
with cross stitch, for the more delicate lines and the
shaded parts of flowers and figures.</p>

<p><b>Wide Gobelin stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_259">259</a>).&mdash;This stitch covers two
vertical and two horizontal threads, and advances one thread at
a time.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Broad cross stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_260">260</a>).&mdash;Worked over two vertical
and four horizontal threads, and very useful for filling in large
surfaces as it can be done twice as quickly as the ordinary
cross stitch. It may be varied by turning the crosses first one
way and then the other.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Double stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_261">261</a>).&mdash;Begin with a simple cross stitch
over every alternate intersection of the threads then make a
second row of stitches between those of the first, but in this
case, over two and six threads, so that they extend beyond the
first each way. In the subsequent rows, a square stitch should
be opposed to a long one and a long stitch to a square one.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Rice stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_262">262</a>).&mdash;Fill in the whole ground first, with
large cross stitches, over four threads each way, then upon
these, make the so-called rice stitches. These cross the four
points of the large cross stitches, and meet in the space between,
where they form another cross. The large cross stitches
should be worked in rather coarse cotton, the rice stitches in
one of a finer quality.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Double stitch, set two ways</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_263">263</a>).&mdash;This consists of
diagonal and upright cross stitches, alternately. Work from left
to right, and carry the thread over four vertical threads and
downwards, under two horizontal ones, then diagonally upwards,
over four threads and downwards under two, then again
over four vertical threads, and so on. Coming back, you cross
the first threads, and pass the working thread each time in a
straight line, underneath the two threads of the canvas. The
stitches of the third and fourth rows are set, as the illustration
shows, the opposite way to those of the two first, the thread
being laid the contrary way. Gold thread is generally used for
this second set of stitches; Or fin D.M.C pour la broderie, or
Chin&eacute; d'or D.M.C will be found to be the most suitable for the
purpose.<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p><p><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></p>

</div>

<p><b>Plait stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_264">264</a>).&mdash;It requires great attention to work
this stitch, to and fro; the easier way is to carry the thread
back each time, to the starting point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

<a name="fig_264" id="fig_264"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 264. Plait stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>Carry the thread from left to right, over two horizontal
threads, and downwards under four perpendicular ones, then
under two threads, from right to left, as the figure indicates.</p>

<p><b>Stem stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_265">265</a>).&mdash;Here, the stitches are worked in
separate rows, over four threads each way. The working
thread passes first under the two middle threads, from right to
left, and then under the two upper ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p><b>Leaf stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_266">266</a>).&mdash;Carry the thread diagonally over
two double threads each way, and back under one double
thread, to the row whence the stitch started. Make rows of
back-stitches in a different colour between the rows of long ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p><b>Fish-bone stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_267">267</a>).&mdash;The difference between this
and the preceding stitch is, that the working thread after
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>passing over three perpendicular and three horizontal threads,
is secured by a back-stitch over the last intersection of the
canvas threads. These back-stitches lean to the right or left,
according to the direction of the long stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p><b>Diagonal web stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_268">268</a>).&mdash;Stretch diagonal threads
across the whole surface you are going to embroider, and secure
them with rows of overcasting stitches, set, if you are working
on Penelope canvas, between the double threads of the canvas.
In the next rows the stitches must be set the opposite way,
which produces the effect of diagonal or twilled cloth.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Cashmere stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_269">269</a>).&mdash;To imitate this texture in
needlework first make one stitch over one crossing of the
canvas threads, and then two stitches over two crossings.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Florentine stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_270">270</a>).&mdash;Florentine stitch is worked
in slanting lines, the thread being carried, diagonally first over
one and then over two double threads of the canvas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p><b>Mosaic stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_271">271</a>).&mdash;The first row consists of one short
and one long stitch, alternately; the second, of short stitches
only, set between the long stitches of the first row; the third
row is a repetition of the first, and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p><b>Knotted stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_272">272</a>).&mdash;Carry the working thread over
two threads in width and six in height, bring the needle back,
four threads lower down, in front of the double threads, and
insert it behind the preceding stitch, and over the middle
threads, and then carry it down to the line of the stitches. In
the subsequent rows, the stitches extend over four threads
and encroach on two of the previous row, so that the stitches
of the second row lie between those of the first.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Star, or Smyrna stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_273">273</a>).&mdash;- Make a plain cross
stitch over four threads, each way, and then over that, another
cross stitch, standing upright. The same stitch can be made
over six or seven threads; if you work over more than four
threads, it follows that you increase the number of stitches
accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Rococo stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_274">274</a>, <a href="#fig_275">275</a>, <a href="#fig_276">276</a>).&mdash;After fastening in your
thread, lay it over four single or two double threads, as the
case may be, and carry the needle through to the left, under one
double thread; then, as fig. <a href="#fig_274">274</a> shows, bring it back over the
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>first stitch, put it in by the side of it, and bring it out below,
under half the horizontal threads covered by the first stitch.
Then make a stitch to the right, similar to the one just made
to the left.</p>

<p><b>Parisian stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_277">277</a>).&mdash;This stitch, though it is generally
worked on silk canvas, can also be worked on the different
cotton and linen materials already referred to more than once in
this Encyclopedia. It makes a very good grounding in cases
where the material is not intended to be completely hidden.
It consists of a long stitch over three threads, and a short
stitch over one thread, alternately.</p>

<p><b>Greek stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_278">278</a>).&mdash;This differs from the ordinary
cross stitch, in the oblique inclination given to the threads, and
the manner in which it is begun. Instead of taking up the two
threads that follow the first stitch, you bring your needle back
from right to left, under the vertical threads of the first stitch,
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>carry it downwards, and then from right to left, to a distance of
four threads beyond the first stitch. The next stitch is made like
the first. The rows may be joined together, either by the short
or the long stitches, but you must follow one rule throughout.
This stitch is much used in Slavonic countries, for the adornment
of linen garments, and there we have observed that the
short stitches are generally made to encounter the long ones. A
coarse material that covers the ground well, such as, Coton &agrave;
tricoter D.M.C Nos. 6 to 12, is the best one to use for this stitch.</p>

stitches, made over one, three, five, three threads respectively,
and then again over one thread, and separated from each
other by rows of Gobelin stitches, constitute what is ordinarily
known by the name of Scotch stitch.</p>

<p><b>Moorish stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_280">280</a>).&mdash;For this stitch, instead of surrounding
squares of stitches, made in the way we have just
described, with Gobelin stitch, the squares are made to touch,
rising like steps one above the other, and bordered only at the
sides by Gobelin stitch.</p><p><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></p>

<p><b>Oriental stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_281">281</a>).&mdash;Here, you make four diagonal

stitches covering two threads.</p>

<p><b>Shell stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_282">282</a>).&mdash;Carry your thread upwards over
six horizontal threads, then from right to left, under one vertical
thread and downwards over six horizontal ones. When you
have made four vertical stitches in this way, bring the needle
out behind the third double thread, counted lengthways, and
between the third and fourth, counted across, and fasten the
four long stitches together with a back-stitch, to the middle
thread of the canvas. Draw a thread of a different colour twice
through these back-stitches, so as to form small knots like
shells, and then fill in the ground between the rows of long
stitches, with back-stitches.</p>

<p><b>Jacquard stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_283">283</a>).&mdash;If you have a large plain surface
to cover, you should choose a stitch that forms a pattern
in itself. Jacquard stitch and others which we shall describe
later on, will be found to produce the effect of brocaded stuff. To
work Jacquard stitch, make six stitches underneath one another,
over two double threads, and six by the side of one another,
from left to right, over two double threads. The second row
consists of the same number of stitches, similarly worked
downwards and to the side, but over one double thread only.</p>

<p><b>Byzantine stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_284">284</a>).&mdash;Here, you make the same

<p><b>Milanese stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_285">285</a>).&mdash;In the first row, the back-stitch
is made alternately, first over four diagonal crosses and then
over one; in the second row, over three and two; in the third,
over two and three, in the fourth, over one and four. The last
long stitches should come under the last short ones and the
short ones, in the middle of the last long ones.</p>

<p><b>Plush stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_286">286</a>).&mdash;This stitch, also called Astrachan
stitch, by means of which a very good imitation of an Oriental
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>rug can be produced, consists of loops, each secured by a cross
stitch; the best way to ensure these loops being even and
regular is to make them over a narrow wooden ruler, or a piece
of whalebone.</p>

<p>The effect can be varied by cutting the loops, which gives
the surface the appearance of velvet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/295.jpg"  alt="FIG. 286. PLUSH STITCH." title="" />
<a name="fig_286" id="fig_286"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 286. Plush stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>The illustration represents the middle loops only, as cut, for
the cut and the uncut stitch can both be introduced into the
same piece of embroidery. For example, the borders in
figs. <a href="#fig_290">290</a>, and <a href="#fig_291">291</a>, are worked in open or cut plush stitch,
whilst in the centres, the stitch is left uncut. Two stitches
of a similar kind, called Smyrna and Malta stitch, suitable for
making rugs or carpets, are described in the last chapter but
one in the book.</p><p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></p>

<p><b>Chain stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_287">287</a>).&mdash;Generally speaking, this stitch is
only used for the adornment of under-linen or small articles of
fancy-work but it can also be employed in copying cross stitch
patterns. In old collections we often meet with very interesting
pieces of needlework, which were used for hangings or screens,
where the figure-subjects, are executed in chain stitch. Patterns
in many colours, gain immensely
by being worked
in this stitch, the
colours blend together
better than in any other,
and even the shape of
the stitch contributes to
soften the contrasts of
colour.</p>

<p>Chain stitch cannot,
like other stitches, be
worked to and fro, nor
can all the stitches of
one row be finished first,
as is generally possible
in cross stitch work, each
row must be begun separately, and always from the same
side, and a different needle should be used for each colour,
as the material has often to be changed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/296.jpg"  alt="FIG. 287. CHAIN STITCH." title="" />
<a name="fig_287" id="fig_287"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 287. Chain stitch.</span>
</div>

<p>The stitch is worked as follows; after fastening in your
thread, insert the needle at the same hole it came out of,
and bring it out two threads lower down. Keep the loop,
formed by the working thread, under the point of the needle.
The thread should not be drawn up tightly but left to
form a rather loose, round loop. For the next stitches, insert
the needle close to the thread that issues from the last loop.</p>

<p><b><a name="Pattern_for_borders" id="Pattern_for_borders"></a>Pattern for borders or grounding</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_288">288</a>).&mdash;This simple
but most effective design, copied from one of the most beautiful
of Oriental carpets, can be executed in, either cross stitch,
plush stitch, or chain stitch. To make a wider border still, the
diagonal lines that divide the figures shaped like an S, have
only to be prolonged, and the figures repeated.</p><p><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></p>

<p><b>Linen embroidery.</b>&mdash;The stitches used in linen embroidery
are very similar to those used in canvas work. The ordinary
cross stitch, as represented in fig. <a href="#fig_253">253</a>, is the one most
commonly used, but it is not so effective as the two-sided
stitches, which in the beautiful old needlework of the 15th,
16th and 17th centuries, have always excited our wonder and
admiration.</p>
<p><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></p><p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></p>
<p><b>Stuffs suitable for linen embroidery.</b>&mdash;Most embroidery
of this kind, and more especially the Italian, is done on very
fine linen. Such fine work however, requires more time and
patience than people, in these days, are as a rule disposed to
bestow on work intended merely for pleasure and recreation.
To meet the requirements of the day, therefore, in addition
to the finer kinds of linen, a great variety of textures, are
now manufactured, the threads of which, being thick and
round, can be easily counted. The cross stitches that are worked
on Cuba, Ceylon or Batavia linen, are large and coarse, those
on linen-canvas, Russian linen, twisted tammy, and Rhodes
linen, small and fine.</p>

<p>Linen fabrics are either white, unbleached or cream-coloured.
All three are used for embroidery, but the coloured cottons
show up best on the cream ground; on the white, they look
hard and crude, and on the unbleached, dull and faded.</p>
<p><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></p>
<p><b>Materials suitable for linen embroidery</b>&mdash;As most linen
embroidery is executed on articles that are subjected to frequent
washing, the D.M.C cottons, which are to be had in
every shade and colour, are the best for the purpose. For
coarse stuffs, coarse cotton should be used, such as knitting
cotton, Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
which will be found a very good substitute for wool; or six-cord
crochet cotton (Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C) Nos. 3, 4, 5, 10
and 15,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> which gives quite as full and brilliant a stitch, as
silk-twist. Finer cottons should be used
for the finer stuffs, such as embroidery cotton
(Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C) Nos. 6 to 200,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
and lace thread (Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C) Nos.
30 to 150.<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> In many cases, even darning
cotton (Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C) can be
used, as like Algerian silk, it can be
split or taken double, to suit the stuff.</p>

<p><b><a name="Plain_cross_stitch" id="Plain_cross_stitch"></a>Plain cross stitch on auxiliary canvas</b>
(fig. <a href="#fig_292">292</a>).&mdash;Plain cross stitch, commonly
called marking stitch, has already been described in fig. <a href="#fig_253">253</a>. But it may be well to observe, that when an auxiliary
material is used, it should be most carefully tacked upon the
stuff following the thread of the same, and a sufficient margin
left to allow of the drawing out of the canvas threads, when
the work is finished.</p>

stitches</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_293">293</a>, <a href="#fig_294">294</a>, <a href="#fig_295">295</a>).&mdash;Straight lines of cross stitch,
alike on both sides, can be worked in two journeys to and fro.
Working from left to right, begin by fastening in your thread,
never with a knot, but by two or three little running stitches,
which are hidden afterwards by your first cross stitch. Directing
your needle to the right, pass it diagonally over a double
cross of the warp and woof of the canvas, and so on to the
end of the line.</p>

Italian stitch consists of cross stitches, alike on both sides,
divided from each other by horizontal and vertical stitches.
The upper and lower stitches should all slope one way, as
in plain cross stitch.</p>

<p>Italian stitch is worked in one journey, to and fro. Fig. <a href="#fig_300">300</a>
shows how to fasten in the thread, and place the needle for
the first stitch, from right to left; fig. <a href="#fig_301">301</a>, the position of the
needle from left to right, to form the cross at the back, and
the vertical stitch to the left, on the right side; fig. <a href="#fig_302">302</a>, the

bottom of the cross, where upon you proceed as in fig. <a href="#fig_300">300</a>.

<p style="clear:both"><b>Montenegrin cross stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_304">304</a>,
<a href="#fig_305">305</a>, <a href="#fig_306">306</a>).&mdash;The Slavonic tribes of the
southern districts of E. Europe, especially
the Montenegrins, have a great partiality
for this stitch, which has been rarely
noticed, hitherto, in books on needlework.
The right side shows cross
stitches with a double
thread underneath, and
divided by vertical stitches;
the wrong side, regular
cross stitches, also divided
by vertical stitches. Coarse
cotton should be used for
this stitch; it produces a
richer effect and not only
covers the stuff better, but
also the underneath stitch
which in the Slavonic
work, is entirely hidden
by the cross stitches.</p>

<p>Begin, as letter A indicates,
with a long, slanting stitch, across
4 and 8 threads, then, bringing
your needle back from right to
left, under four threads, draw it
out, carry it over the first long
stitch, and insert it again from
left to right, under the first four
threads of the canvas. These four
stitches finished, proceed to the
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>fifth and sixth, which as B shows, cross the first four, then
repeat the first stitch.</p>

<p>The threads that form the stitches on the wrong side,
should always be opposed to

should lean to the right, the
other to the left, as shown in
fig. <a href="#fig_305">305</a>. This variation in
the inclination of the stitches,
which is regarded as a fault in
plain cross stitch, is indispensable
here, and produces
a charming effect on the wrong

<p><b>Plaited Algerian stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_307">307</a>).&mdash;The distinguishing
feature of this stitch is, that it
only advances one thread at
a time. It should be begun
on an uneven number of
threads, and like the Montenegrin stitch, should be worked
with coarse cotton. The rows may touch, either at the top
or at the bottom of the stitch, so long as you keep to one plan
throughout.</p>

<p><b>Two-sided Spanish plaited stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_308">308</a> and <a href="#fig_309">309</a>).&mdash;This
stitch has the advantage of being, not only very effective, but
also very quickly executed. It is worked in two rows, forwards
and backwards. All cross stitch patterns can be worked
in Spanish stitch. The gaps, which are occasioned by the long
stitches, have to be filled in with short ones. In itself, the
stitch consists of slanting stitches, three threads a part, alike
on both sides, and advances three threads at a time, as shown
in figs. <a href="#fig_308">308</a> and <a href="#fig_309">309</a>.</p>

<p><b>Two-sided line stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_310">310</a> and <a href="#fig_311">311</a>).&mdash;Square stitch,
Holbein stitch, line, or stroke stitch, as it is sometimes called,
and setting stitch, are all worked on one principle. Though
all these two-sided stitches are related to each other, and by
no means difficult of execution, those new to the work will
find a little practice necessary, to make the stitches follow in
their proper order. Fig. <a href="#fig_310">310</a> explains how the needle has to
pass, alternately, step by step, over and under the threads of
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>the stuff, and fig. <a href="#fig_311">311</a>, how the threads, left blank the first
time, are covered on the way back. The great difficulty is how
to place your first row of stitches so as to
ensure an unbroken course back. It is as
well before setting out, to ascertain
clearly the most direct course back, so
that you may not come to a stand-still,
or be obliged to make unnecessary
stitches on the wrong side. If you have
to pass obliquely across the stuff, as in
patterns figs. <a href="#fig_326">326</a>, <a href="#fig_327">327</a>, <a href="#fig_328">328</a>, <a href="#fig_329">329</a>, <a href="#fig_331">331</a> and

you were covering the straight threads
of a fabric.</p>

this series of stitches with a description
of a pretty, two-sided insertion, suitable
for joining stripes of work of different
widths together. In pieces of old needlework,
we often find handsome, coloured
patterns, joined together by a piece of lace or some quite different
kind of work. The insertion represented in fig. <a href="#fig_317">317</a>, is a
very good substitute for either. Fig. <a href="#fig_312">312</a> explains the first stitch
and the course of the second, from left to right, under 3 vertical
and 3 horizontal threads; the 3rd stitch to the left, over
6 vertical threads, and the beginning of the 4th stitch.
Fig. <a href="#fig_313">313</a> shows the 4th stitch completed, and the direc<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>tion
the 5th and 6th stitches have to take; fig. <a href="#fig_314">314</a>, the 6th

fig. <a href="#fig_315">315</a>, the 9th lower, horizontal stitch, over 6 vertical threads,
the 10th backward stitch, and the position of the needle for
the 11th and last stitch. Fig. <a href="#fig_317">317</a> represents a whole series
of stitches, and fig. <a href="#fig_318">318</a>, the back of the work, which though
quite a different pattern, will combine very well with any two-sided
embroidery.</p>

<p>These insertions can be worked on any stuff, but the stitches,
must be done, both ways, on a number of threads, divisible by
3. Thus, the first stitch may cover 6, 9, or 12 threads, but
never 8, 10, 12 or 14. [Transcriber's note: 12, here, appears to be an error in the original.]</p>

and can be worked in one or two colours, as preferred. If two
colours be used, the darker should be taken for the interior, the
lighter for the narrow outside edge.</p>

<p><b>Stripe in stroke stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_328">328</a>).&mdash;This is copied from a
piece of Italian work, though from a resemblance in the different
subjects to the rose, thistle and shamrock, if might have
been supposed to be of English origin. The original work was
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>executed in a most brilliant purple red which time has toned
down to the colour of Jaune-Rouille 308, or Brun-Cuir 432,
one or other of which we recommend, as being the only colours
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>with which any thing approaching the refined distinguished
look of the old embroidery, can be given to the new.</p>

<p><b>Grounding in diagonal lines</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_329">329</a>).&mdash;This pattern
can be worked, in any of the previous stitches, or in back-<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>stitch.
It is only suitable for large surfaces, on account of the
diagonal lines, and should be worked, all in one colour. It can
be varied by adding sprays to the upper sides of the slanting
stalks, like those on the lower sides, turned either the same
way, or upwards. Skilled workers will readily contrive the
middles for themselves, by combining the different subjects
and putting them together in various positions, either diagonally
or at right angles to each other, with the help of the Penelope
mirror.<a name="FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_45" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><b>Border in Greek stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_331">331</a>).&mdash;All the darker lines

<p>In the original, the cross bars that unite the leaves, are in
yellow, whilst the detached figures that separate them, are
worked, those that come between the light red leaves, in pale
blue, and those between the dark red ones, in gold thread.
The exterior part of the figure is filled in with the different
colours, indicated above; with the exception of the small squares
in Gobelin stitch, which should all be worked in plain gold,
or Chin&eacute; d'or D.M.C, green and gold. The SS in the narrow
outside border, should be worked in two shades of blue;
the outside stitches in colour 341 and the solid parts in colour
668. The little figures with the transverse bars that unite the
SS, should be set in black, and filled in, alternately, in light
and dark red, and in yellow.</p><p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></p>

<p><b>Grounding</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_332">332</a>).&mdash;This grounding was copied from
a beautiful old cushion-cover
and will be found
particularly useful in the
confection of small embroidered
articles, because the
pattern will always form a
centre point in itself. A
light, brilliant red, such as
either of the two colours
indicated beneath the
figure, will best reproduce
the tone of the original.</p>

<p>In making the little
stars that connect the different
squares, the mode
we recommended for working
stroke stitch should be
adopted, that is, beginning,
by bringing the needle out in the middle, making 7
stitches, and at the eighth, carrying the needle back under
the first, to the spot whence you started. The stitches will
then be alike on both sides.</p>

<p><b>Wallachian border</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_333">333</a>).&mdash;A piece of Wallachian
needlework, executed on rough linen, and uncommon, both in
colour and design, suggested the charming embroidery, here represented.
In place of the somewhat violent colours, which indicate
an undeveloped taste, we have substituted softer and more
refined ones. All the stroke stitches of the middle stripe and
of the two border stripes, top and bottom, as well as the
darker portions of the small dice, subdivided into eight, in
the bottom border, and of the small diagonal squares in the
top border, worked in Gobelin stitch, are in red, colour 346.
The setting of upright stroke stitches round the large centre
figures, as well as the straight lines that divide these same
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>figures into four, are
worked in yellow, colour
680.</p>

</div>

<p>The squares and the
half-squares are worked in
colour 326, green 319, and
gold thread; colour 326
is indicated in the illustration
by the darkest
shade, green 319, by the
medium shade, and the
gold thread by the lightest
shade.</p>

<p>The stitches in the
right bottom quarter and
top left one, incline upwards
from left to right,
in the two other quarters
they incline the contrary
way. The Spanish half-stitch
as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_309">309</a>,
can only be done over 4
and 2 threads and worked
one way, not to and fro.</p>

<p>The general effect is
very much heightened by
the introduction of one
or two rows of stitches,
worked in gold thread,
into the straight lines on
either side of the stripes;
all the light parts of the
design moreover, should
be worked in gold thread.</p>

<p><b>Borders in several shades of one colour</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_334">334</a> and
<a href="#fig_335">335</a>). In some beautifully embroidered Chinese hangings, that
latterly came under our notice, the principal subject was the
figure of a mandarin, in a very richly decorated dress. The
pretty pattern, given in fig. <a href="#fig_334">334</a>, was
copied from the collar and cuffs of
this dress. We should advise working
it in several shades of pink or red,
or in a single one of the colours indicated
above.</p>

<p>The grotesque heads of animals,
and the flowers and branches which
break the running pattern, and are a Chinese speciality,
distinguish this design from the more conventional patterns
of the present day.</p>

<p>We recommend these two pretty patterns, to our readers
notice, as likewise adaptable by transposition, to centres, or by
repetition, to broad stripes. With very little trouble they
can be converted, into a variety of subjects, such as it is
often difficult to find ready made, and exactly suited to the
purpose in hand.</p>

<p><b>Border in Greek stitch with a footing, composed of
branches</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_336">336</a>).&mdash;This design can be worked in Greek,
Slavonic, Montenegrin, or plaited Algerian stitch. Our illustration
worked in Greek stitch, shows how one stitch encroaches
upon another, and how the thread is carried from one
isolated stitch, to another.</p>

<p>It will be found to be an improvement if the stitches are so
made as to follow the direction of the lines. The central subject
may be repeated two or three times, according to the width of
border required. The edging is the same throughout. The use
of the 'Penelope mirror' for repeating patterns is described
in the concluding chapter of the book.</p><p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>

<p><b>Table-cover in Gobelin and stroke stitch</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_337">337</a>, <a href="#fig_338">338</a>,
<a href="#fig_339">339</a>, <a href="#fig_340">340</a>).&mdash;This tasteful little table-cover provides excellent
practice in working two sided, square stitch. The square
represented in fig. <a href="#fig_339">339</a>, forms the middle of the cloth. The
Gobelin stitches, set very closely, unite and form a star in the
centre of the principal subject. They begin in the corners, in
red and continue in green, violet and blue, successively; the
little branches in stroke stitch, on each side of the Gobelin
stitches, correspond with them in colour, and the small figures,
that form the border of the square, may be worked, indiscriminately,
in any of the colours used for the Gobelin stitches of
the centre. Four branches run inwards from the corners of the
square, and four more advance to meet, and pass them, from
the inner angles of the wide border. Four figures, copied from
the outside border, fig. <a href="#fig_339">339</a>, and worked in yellow, and the
little star, fig. <a href="#fig_337">337</a>, besides the little subjects, borrowed from
the outside border, fig. <a href="#fig_338">338</a>, are strewn lightly over the foundation,
interspersed between the branches. In fig. <a href="#fig_340">340</a>, nevertheless,
which represents the whole table-cover, the edge is
formed of the small subjects contained in the wide border and
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>not of the little stars. The Gobelin stitches in the centre of
fig. <a href="#fig_337">337</a>, are in dark green, the star stitches and the stroke
stitches on the outside in red. The wide border consists of
stars, every other row of which, is worked in red; the intermediate
rows, successively, in blue, green, and yellow. The
corners are composed of four detached stars, framed by a row
of stroke stitches, one red and one blue, alternately. This line
skirts both sides of the border, and forms the base to the
quaint figures, that terminate the design and which can be
worked in all the colours used for the inside.</p>
