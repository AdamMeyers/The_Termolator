Insertion.       Irish lace with raised ornaments.





Irish Lace.



Irish lace, also known under the name of Renaissance lace,
from its having been first made in the sixteenth century, is an
imitation of the earliest pillow laces; it ought, properly speaking,
to be called French lace, having been invented in France
and thence introduced into England and Ireland.

It is composed of braid or tape, formed into figures, joined
together by needlemade, corded or buttonhole bars and fillings
of different kinds, or by bars alone.

The lace stitches and bars are almost the same as those used
in fine Venetian point, but they are executed in a coarser material
so that this section of our work may be considered as a
preparation for the different kinds of lace, to be described in
the next chapter.

Materials (fig. 692).       The braids used for making Irish
lace are an English speciality and manufactured exclusively in
England; they are very various in shade, width and thickness,
and are to be had white, unbleached, grey and pale yellow,
narrow and wide, coarse and fine in texture, with and without
holes, open edge and picots, with large medallions and small.



Fig. 692. Patterns of the different
tapes and braids used for irish lace.


Fig. 692 represents the kinds most commonly used, in their
original size, together with a specimen picot, or purl, as they
are called in England, for the outside edge, also to be had
ready made, for those who do not care for the trouble of making
them themselves.

For the stitches and bars by which the braids are joined
together, the best material is Fil          dentelle D.M.C,[A] (lace
thread) a smooth even thread, now made in every colour to
match the braids.

Transferring designs for Irish lace.       The best way is
to trace them on oiled tracing
linen with a watery ink, free
from greasy matter. This tracing
linen, which is of English make,
is white, glazed on one side only;
the unglazed surface should be
turned uppermost, as it takes the
ink better.

As this tracing linen is quite
transparent, the pattern can be
transferred to it at once without
recourse to any other
process.

It will be found less trying
for the eyes to lay a piece of
transparent coloured paper, or
stuff, under the pattern whilst
you are copying it. The Irish lace
designs are almost all drawn with
double lines, between which
the braid is tacked on with small
back stitches. We may mention
at once that it is advisable to
make the stitches longer on the
right side than on the other, or
at any rate to make them of the
same length.

Tacking down and gathering in the braids (fig. 693).       Where
the lines of the pattern describe a curve or a circle, the
outside edge of the braid, as shown in fig. 693, must be sewn
down firmly, so as to form little folds or gathers on the inside
edge, which are first tacked down and then gathered in with
small overcasting stitches in fine thread, so as to fit exactly to
the pattern.



Fig. 693. Tacking down and drawing in the braids.


The stitches, made for the bars and the fillings, must
never be drawn so tightly as to drag out the edges of the
braids and thus spoil the outlines of the pattern. Nor should
the stitches be caught into the tracing cloth, but only rest
upon it.

When the embroidery is finished, turn the work the wrong
side up, cut every second or third tacking stitch and pull the
threads carefully out, from the wrong side, when the lace will
separate itself from the backing without difficulty; it has
then to be damped and ironed also on the wrong side. (See
the concluding chapter on the different processes for finishing
off needlework).

It is of no consequence which are made first, the bars or
the fillings; we however incline to the former, more especially
in the case of buttonhole bars, as they are easier to do than
the fillings and once done, there is less risk of puckering or
drawing the edges together, in making the fillings.

The stitches.       We shall now proceed to describe a series
of bars and stitches, which, if carefully studied, will serve as
a preparation for making all the finer kinds of laces described
in the ensuing chapter.

Without pretending to have exhausted the infinite variety
of lace stitches that exists, we hope to have brought before
our readers' notice a sufficiently numerous
selection to satisfy all tastes and capacities.

With regard to the names, the same
stitches are known by so many different ones,
that excepting in the case of those universally
accepted, we have disregarded them
altogether and merely numbered the stitches
in their order.

Plain twisted bar (fig. 694).       Secure
the thread to the braid and throw it across
from one braid edge to the other, put the
needle in downwards from above, and overcast
the first thread, so as to form the two
into a cord. If you do not make enough overcasting
stitches to tighten the two threads,
the bars will be loose and untidy and spoil
the general appearance of the work.





Fig. 694. Plain twisted bar.




Fig. 695. Double twisted bar.



Double twisted bar (fig. 695).       Throw
three foundation threads across the space to
be filled and overcast them loosely, so that
they remain visible between the stitches.

Plain buttonhole bar (fig. 696).       Throw
three threads across and cover them with
buttonhole stitches, made from right to left.



Fig. 696. Plain buttonhole bar.


In making this and the subsequent bars,
we recommend turning the needle round and holding it as it
were the reverse way, so that the eye not the point passes
first under the threads; strange as it may seem, it is easier in
this manner to avoid splitting the threads. The working thread
should always issue from the edge of the braid, one or two
threads before the foundation threads of the bar, to prevent
the bars being of unequal width, or getting twisted at the
beginning.

Buttonhole bars with pinned picots (figs. 697 and 698).
After covering half, or a third of the bar with buttonhole
stitches, pass the thread without making a loop, under the
foundation threads, and fasten the loop with a pin, fig. 697,
then slip the needle, horizontally from right to left, under the
3 threads and tighten the knot close to the
last buttonhole stitch.





Fig. 697. Buttonhole bar with pinned picots.




Fig. 698. Buttonhole bar with pinned picots.



Fig. 698 shows a picot made in the same
manner, but with several buttonhole stitches
inserted between the loop and the buttonholed
bar.

Bar with lace picot (fig. 699).       Here
the picot is made by bringing the thread
out through the loop and beginning the buttonhole
stitches, 4 or 5 in number, according
to the size of the thread, quite close to the
pin, so that they entirely cover the loop. The
pin must be stuck in the width of 4 stitches,
distant from the bar, and the foundation threads should be
completely hidden under the bar.





Fig. 699. Bar with lace picot.




Fig. 700. Bar with picot made in bullion stitch.



Bar with picot made in bullion stitch (fig. 700).       Put
the needle halfway into the last buttonhole stitch, twist the
thread ten or twelve times round it from left to right, draw
it through and tighten the thread, so that the spiral on the
thread form a semicircle, then continue the bar (see also for
the bullion stitch figs. 179 and 661).

Bar with buttonhole picot (fig. 701).       Cover rather more
than half the bar with buttonhole stitches, carry the thread
three times to the 6th stitch and back, then buttonhole these
threads that are attached to the bar in the same way as the
bar itself and finish the bar in the usual way.

These buttonhole picots are generally used for edging lace;
they may in their turn be adorned with small pinned picots to
produce a richer effect.





Fig. 701. Bar with buttonhole picot.




Fig. 702. Bar with two rows of knots.



Bar with two rows of knots (fig. 702).       Over two foundation
threads, make double knots, far enough apart to leave
room for the knots of the next row between.

These double knots consist, in
the first place, of one plain buttonhole
stitch and then one reversed,
that is, made by bringing the
needle out in front of the thread
and passing it under the loop; the
result being that the thread will
lie behind the thread and not before
it, as in an ordinary buttonhole stitch.

Branched bars (fig. 703).       Where you have a larger surface
to cover with bars, you are generally obliged to make them
with branches. For this purpose you prepare the threads as for
an ordinary bar and cover them halfway with buttonhole
stitches; then you carry on the foundation thread to the next
bar, buttonhole it also halfway, lay the next foundation thread,
and finally buttonhole all the half-covered bars till you reach
the dotted line, from whence you lay the last foundation
threads.

The last bar is worked over 2 or 4 threads, so that the
working thread can be taken back to the edge of the braid by
means of the last buttonhole stitches.





Fig. 703. Branched bars.




Fig. 704. Plain russian stitch.



Plain Russian stitch (fig. 704).       Stitches of all kinds can
be used, as well as bars, for joining braids together that run
parallel to each other, and for
filling up the spaces between.
These stitches, which serve as
an insertion, are some of them
very elementary, whilst others
require great skill and patience
to execute.

The simplest of all is the
Russian stitch, which bears
a great resemblance to the
crossed stitch, shown in fig. 39,
and the crossed back-stitch,
fig. 176.

You pass the needle from
left to right, under the edge
of the braid, then again from right to left under the opposite
edge, taking care always to leave the thread in front of the needle.

Twisted Russian stitch (fig. 705).       Instead of passing
the needle behind the thread,
pass it before it and round
it, so that the needle always
comes out again beneath
the thread, which will then be
twice twisted.





Fig. 705. Twisted russian stitch.




Fig. 706. Column stitch.



Column Stitch (fig. 706).       At
the bottom, the stitch is made like the plain Russian stitch,
and at the top, like the one in fig. 705, with the difference
that the second thread is passed three times round the first.

Insertion of single buttonhole
stitches (figs. 707 and
708).       Make very loose buttonhole
stitches along both
edges of the braid, all the
same size and the same
distance apart, and vertically,
opposite to each other.





Fig. 707. Insertion of single buttonhole stitches.




Fig. 708. Insertion of plain buttonhole stitches.



When these two rows are
finished, pick up each loop
with Russian stitch, either
single, fig. 704, or twisted,
fig. 705. Fig. 708 shows the
double Russian stitch made in
each loop; it may be trebled or
quadrupled, according to whether
you wish your insertion
to be very transparent or not.

Insertion with bead stitches
(fig. 709).       Join the opposite
rows of loops together by
four stitches. The threads of
these stitches must lie quite
flat, side by side, and not one
on the top of the other. After
the fourth stitch, you wind the
thread round the bottom loop and then carry it on to the next,
whence you repeat the four stitches as above.



Fig. 709. Insertion with bead stitches.


Cluster insertion (fig. 710).       Over the middle of two
finished plain bars and one half-finished one, a short distance
apart, you make five buttonhole stitches and overcast the remainder
of the third bar. The first bar of the next cluster
must be set quite close to the last.



Fig. 710. Cluster insertion.


Insertion with branches (figs. 711 and 712).       Throw the
thread across the middle of the space between two edges of
braid, and lengthways, from one end to the
other, pass the needle horizontally under four
or five threads of the braid, across the insertion;
then carry it in a similar manner, first to the
left and then to the right, take up the same
number of threads of the braid and connect
the three loops together by a knot, as is clearly
shown in fig. 711.





Fig. 711. Insertion with plain branches.




Fig. 712. Insertion with branches and wheels.



Fig. 712 represents a similar beginning, and
a similar interlacing of the threads, but ornamented
this time with a wheel, added after
the knot has been made over the loops.

Insertion with leaves in darning
stitch (fig. 713).       Fasten on the thread
where, according to the illustration, the first leaf in the insertion
ought to come, carry it across to the opposite side, draw
it through the edge of the braid and bring it back to the point
whence it started, lay threads across to both sides, like in
figs. 711 and 712, unite them by a knot, such as described
in fig. 711, lay the thread once more round the middle
leaf, and finish the leaf in darning stitch, working downwards
from the top, as described in the preceding chapter in figs. 646
and 647. As may be seen from the second middle leaf, your
darning stitches have to be made over five threads, subdivided
into two and three.



Fig. 713. Insertion with leaves worked in darning stitch.


Insertion with small wheels (fig. 714).       Here, you have
to make two rows of Russian
stitches opposite each other
and carry the thread to the
point of intersection, then,
you make a wheel over five
threads and pass the needle
under the completed wheel to
reach the next point of intersection.
Half wheels may also
be added at the edge of the
braid, as in figs. 658 and 659.





Fig. 714. Insertion with small wheels.




Fig. 715. Insertion with big wheels.



Insertion with big wheels
(fig. 715).       Carry the thread
horizontally across the middle
of the space intended for the
insertion, to the opposite side,
and then conduct it by means of overcasting stitches into the
corner; thence make a loose loop over to the opposite corner,
pass the needle under six or eight threads of the braid edge, slip
it under the horizontal thread first laid and behind the loop,
and finish the stitch on the other side in the edge of the braid.

Throw the thread again across the empty space and over
the first thread, bring your needle back to the middle, make a
big wheel over four threads, passing each time under the same
threads, then overcast the single thread, come back to the edge
of the braid and make the second loop, bringing out the thread
at the same place where the other stitches came out.

Insertion with cones (figs. 716 and 717).       Over plain
but very distended Russian stitch, make darning stitches backwards
and forwards, beginning at the point and reaching to
the middle, so as to form small cone-shaped figures.

To reach the point of the next cone you overcast the thread
of the Russian stitch several times.

You may also, as in fig. 717, double the Russian stitch and
make the darning stitches in such a manner that the points of
the cones touch each other and
their bases meet the edge of
the braid. The same thing,
worked the reverse way, that
is, with the points turned outwards
to the edge, produces
a not less pretty effect.





Fig. 716. Insertion with cones.




Fig. 717. Insertion with cones.



Insertion with embroidered
squares (fig. 718).       After
making rows of loose
buttonhole stitches along the
braid edges, as in figs. 707,
708, 709, run a thread through
the buttonhole stitches; this
thread serves as the foundation
to the Russian stitches by
which the two edges are joined
together. The empty square
space left between the Russian
stitches is then filled up with
buttonhole stitches, like those
in fig. 651, in the foregoing
chapter.




Fig. 718. Insertion with embroidered squares.


Insertion with half bars
(fig. 719).       Fasten on the thread in one of
the corners of the braid and conduct it by
means of overcasting stitches to the middle
of the insertion, draw it through the edge of
the braid on the right and make buttonhole
stitches over it, to the middle of the space to
be filled, then carry the thread to the left, draw
it through the left edge, a little higher up
than on the other side, and make the same
number of stitches over it as over the first.
You can vary this insertion with very good
result by making more stitches on one side
than on the other, but it should never be
more than 10 or 12 stitches wide.




Fig. 719. Insertion with half bars.


Plain net stitch. First lace stitch (fig. 720).       Make rows
of buttonhole stitches to and fro, loose enough to form loops
into which the stitches of each subsequent row are set. You
must be careful to make the same number of stitches in all the
spaces that are of the same size, and also, when you begin a
row with a whole stitch, to begin the return row with a half,
and so on, in regular rotation.

The number of stitches should vary with the width of the
pattern and the decreasing and increasing should always be
done at the edge.

The loops must be as many threads of the braid edge long,
as they are wide.





Fig. 720. Plain net stitch. First lace stitch.




Fig. 721. Double net stitch. Second lace stitch.



Double net stitch. Second lace
stitch (fig. 721).       You leave the
same distance between the stitches
here as in the preceding figure, but
in each of the loops of the first row,
you must make two buttonhole
stitches close together. It is as well
to round the loop a little less than
is usually done in net stitch.

Third lace stitch (fig. 722).       Here,
you make three buttonhole
stitches close together, joined to the next three by a loop of
thread, just long enough to hold the three buttonhole stitches
of the subsequent row.





Fig. 722. Third lace stitch.




Fig. 723. Fourth lace stitch.



Fourth lace stitch (fig. 723).       Working from left to
right, make two buttonhole stitches rather near together, and
leave twice as long a loop between them and the next two
stitches as between the two first.

In the next row, which is worked from right to left, make
one stitch in the loop between the two stitches that are close
together and three or four in the long loop.

Fifth lace stitch (fig. 724).       As in fig. 723, you begin
this stitch from left to right, but making three stitches very
close together with an intermediate loop as long as the three
stitches in one.

In the second row, you make one buttonhole stitch in each
of the loops between the three stitches and six or eight in the
long intermediate loop.





Fig. 724. Fifth lace stitch.




Fig. 725. Sixth lace stitch.



Sixth lace stitch (fig. 725).       Over
wide loops, made from left to
right in the first row, make in the
second, enough buttonhole stitches
entirely to cover the thread.

In the third row of stitches, put
the needle into the small loop between
two sets of buttonhole stitches,
so that the close stitches shall
form vertical lines across the surface
they cover.

This stitch admits of every sort of modification, such as,
for instance, making the third row of stitches on the buttonhole
stitches, in the middle of the ones on the small loop;
or making one row of close stitches first, and then three open
rows; in the former case you should always make an uneven
number of buttonhole stitches, so that you have the same number
on both sides of the needle, which you must put in between
the two threads that form the middle buttonhole stitch.

Seventh lace stitch (fig. 726).       Begin, working from right
to left, by making one row of pairs of buttonhole stitches, a
very short distance apart; in the second row you make one
buttonhole stitch between each of these pairs, and in the
third row, two buttonhole stitches in every long loop. Here,
the stitches must not be crowded together but have a small
gap left between them.





Fig. 726. Seventh lace stitch.




Fig. 727. Eighth lace stitch.



Eighth lace stitch (fig. 727).       This stitch is generally
known as the "pea-stitch" on account of the holes occasioned
by the different distribution of the stitches.

The first row consists of stitches, set rather closely together,
and all the same distance apart. In the second row, you make
one buttonhole stitch in the last stitch of the first row, then,
missing two loops and three buttonhole stitches, you make two
stitches in the next loops and so on. In the third row, you
make three stitches in the big loop, and one in the loop between
the stitches of the second row.

Ninth, and tenth lace stitch (figs. 728 and 729).       Both,
the small and the big pointed groups of stitches, begin with a
row of close buttonhole stitches.





Fig. 728. Ninth lace stitch.




Fig. 729. Tenth lace stitch.



Fig. 728 requires three rows; in the second you miss two
stitches and make two in the next loops; in the third, only one
stitch is introduced between the two loops of the lower row.

Fig. 729 requires five rows. The stitches of the first must
be set as closely together as possible; in the second row you
make four stitches and miss two of the first row, in the third
row you make three stitches, in the fourth, two and in the fifth,
one only. The long loops of the last row must not be too slack
so that the first stitches of the next scallop may quite cover them.

Eleventh lace stitch (fig. 730).       This stitch is not really
more difficult to work than those we
have been describing, but requires
rather more attention to learn.

The first row consists of plain
net stitches; in the second, you
have three buttonhole stitches in the
middle net stitch; in the third,
three buttonhole stitches in the
whole loops on either side of the
three buttonhole stitches of the second
row, and one stitch in the half
loops that precede and immediately
follow them; the fourth row is similar to the second.

In the fifth row the close stitches are changed. The three
buttonhole stitches are made in the third whole loop, before
and after those of the fourth row, so that between two groups
of three stitches you have six single buttonhole stitches and
seven loops.





Fig. 730. Eleventh lace stitch.




Fig. 731. Twelfth lace stitch.



Twelfth lace stitch (fig. 731).       Fasten on your thread,
take it by overcasting stitches over the braid edge, half a
c/m. from the corner, and make three buttonhole stitches
downwards, quite close together. The next loops, over four or
six threads of the braid, must be left long enough to be on a
level with the first stitch reaching downwards from the edge.

In the second row, you cover the long loops with three
buttonhole stitches and draw the intervening thread quite tight.

The third row is like the first, with the difference, that you
put the needle in between the two threads of the buttonhole
stitch, instead of through the loops.

Thirteenth lace stitch (fig. 732).       The stitch here represented,
as well as the two next ones are looped from left to
right and then again from right to left.

As it is more unusual to make the loops from left to right
than the reverse way, the proper position of the needle and
the course of the thread are shown in the illustrations.

Fig. 732 requires, in the first place, two buttonhole stitches
very close together in the edge of the braid, then a third
stitch covering the two first stitches and set quite close to them;
the connecting thread between these stitches must be tightly
stretched so as to lie almost vertically, that the stitches may
form straight lines.





Fig. 732. Thirteenth lace stitch.




Fig. 733. Fourteenth lace stitch.



Fourteenth lace stitch (fig. 733).       This begins, likewise,
with two buttonhole stitches, above which you make two
buttonhole stitches instead of one, as in fig. 732, producing
an open ground with vertical bars.

Fifteenth lace stitch (fig. 734).       This resembles the two
foregoing stitches and consists of three buttonhole stitches,
made over the edge of the braid or the intermediate bars, and
joined together afterwards under one transverse stitch.





Fig. 734. Fifteenth lace stitch.




Fig. 735. Sixteenth lace stitch.



Sixteenth lace stitch (fig. 735).       You begin this by a
row of net stitches worked from right to left, or as the
engraving shows, by a row of stitches called        seed stitches       .


The second row, worked from left to right, consists of
short bars, set slanting and shaped like a seed, and made the
same way as the picot in fig. 699. The first stitch is carried
through the loop of the row below, the second over both threads
and far enough from the loop to leave room for three other
stitches. The first of the four buttonhole stitches of the next
group must be set quite close to the last.

Seventeenth lace stitch (fig. 736).       Here we have the
same pattern as the preceding one without the row of net
stitches; the engraving shows us at the same time, the proper
direction of the needle and thread for the row that is worked
from right to left.





Fig. 736. Seventeenth lace stitch.




Fig. 737. Eighteenth lace stitch.



Eighteenth lace stitch (fig. 737).       This is the first of a
series of lace stitches, often met with in old Venetian lace, and
which can therefore with perfect right be called, Venetian
stitches.

Owing to the manner and order in which the rows of
stitches are connected and placed above one another, they form
less transparent grounds than those we have hitherto described.

In these grounds you begin by making the row of loops, then
you throw a thread across on the same level and in coming
back, pass the needle through the row of loops under the
thread stretched across, and under the stitch of the previous row.

Nineteenth lace stitch (fig. 738).       The close stitch here
represented is more common in Venetian lace than the loose
stitch given in fig. 737.





Fig. 738. Nineteenth lace stitch.




Fig. 739. Twentieth lace stitch.



Twentieth lace stitch (fig. 739).       By missing some loops
of the close ground in one row and replacing them by the
same number in the next, small gaps are formed, and by a
regular and systematic missing and taking up of stitches, in
this way, extremely pretty grounds can be produced.

Twenty-first lace stitch (fig. 740).       These close lace
stitches, can be varied in all sorts of other ways by embroidering
the needle-made grounds.

In fig. 740, you have little tufts in darning stitch, and in
a less twisted material than the close stitches of the ground,
worked upon the ground.

If you use Fil          dentelle D.M.C
(lace thread) for the ground, you
should take either Coton          repriser
D.M.C (darning cotton), or better
still, Coton surfin D.M.C[A] for the
tufts. The ground can also be ornamented
with little rings of buttonholing,
stars or flowerets in bullion
or some other fancy stitch.





Fig. 740. Twenty-first lace stitch.




Fig. 741. Twenty-second lace stitch.



Twenty-second lace stitch (fig. 741).       For the above three stitches
and the three that follow, the work
has to be held, so that the finished rows are turned to the worker
and the needle points to the outside of the hand. In the first
row, from left to right, take hold of the thread near the end that
is in the braid, lay it from left to right under the point of the
needle, and bring it back again to the right, over the same.
Whilst twisting the thread in this way round the needle with
the right hand, you must hold the eye of the needle under
the left thumb.

When you have laid the thread round draw the needle
through the loops; the bars must stand straight and be of
uniform length. Were they to slant or be at all uneven, we
should consider the work badly done.

In the row that is worked from left to right, the thread
must be twisted round the needle, likewise from left to right.

Twenty-third lace stitch (fig. 742).       This is begun with
the same stitches as fig. 741, worked from right to left. You
then take up every loop that comes between the vertical bars
with an overcasting stitch, drawing the thread quite out, and
tightening it as much as is necessary after each stitch. You
cannot take several stitches on the needle at the same time
and draw out the thread for them all at once, as this pulls
the bars out of their place.





Fig. 742. Twenty-third lace stitch.




Fig. 743. Twenty-fourth lace stitch



Twenty-fourth lace stitch (fig. 743).       This is often called
the Sorrento stitch.

Every group of three bars of stitches is separated from the
next by a long loop, round which the thread is twisted in its
backward course. In each of the succeeding rows you place the
first bar between the first and second of the preceding row, and
the third one in the long loop, so that the pattern advances, as
it were in steps.

Twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth lace stitches (figs. 744
and 745).       These two figures show how the relative position
of the groups of bars may be varied.





Fig. 744. Twenty-fifth lace stitch.




Fig. 745. Twenty-sixth lace stitch.



Both consist of the same stitches as those described in fig. 741. The thread that connects the groups should be tightly
stretched, so that the rows may
form straight horizontal lines.

Twenty-seventh lace stitch
(fig. 746).       Begin by making two
rows of net stitches, fig. 720, then
two of close ones, fig. 738, and one
row like those of fig. 741.

If you want to lengthen the bars,
twist the thread once or twice more
round the needle. You can also make
one row of bars surmounted by
wheels, as shown in fig. 765, then
one more row of bars and continue with close stitches.





Fig. 746. Twenty-seventh lace stitch.




Fig. 747. Twenty-eighth lace stitch.



Twenty-eighth lace stitch (fig. 747).       Between every
group of three bars, set close together, leave a space of a corresponding
width; then bring the thread back over the bars, as
in figs. 737, 738 and 739, without going through the loops.
In the second row, you make three bars in the empty space,
two over the three bars of the first row and again three in
the next empty space. The third row is like the first.

Twenty-ninth lace stitch (fig. 748).       This stitch, known
as Greek net stitch, can be used instead of buttonhole bars
for filling in large surfaces.

Make bars from left to right, a little distance apart as in
fig. 741, leaving the loops between rather slack, so that when
they have been twice overcast by the returning thread, they
may still be slightly rounded. In the next row, you make the
bar in the middle of the loop and lift it up sufficiently with the
needle, for the threads to form a
hexagon like a net mesh.





Fig. 748. Twenty-ninth lace stitch.




Fig. 749. Thirtieth lace stitch.



Thirtieth lace stitch (fig. 749).
After a row of pairs of buttonhole
stitches set closely together, with
long loops between, as long as the
space between the pairs, throw the
thread across in a line with the
extremities of the loops, fasten it
to the edge of the braid and make
pairs of buttonhole stitches, as in
the first row above it.

The loops must be perfectly regular, to facilitate which,
guide lines may be traced across the pattern, and pins stuck
in as shown in the figure, round which to carry the thread.

Thirty-first lace stitch (fig. 750).       At first sight this stitch
looks very much like the preceding one, but it differs entirely
from it in the way in which the threads are knotted.
You pass the needle under the loop and the laid thread,
then stick in the pin at the right distance for making the long
loop, bring the thread round behind the pin, make a loop
round the point of the needle, as shows in the engraving, and
pull up the knot.





Fig. 750. Thirty-first lace stitch.




Fig. 751. Thirty-second lace stitch.



Thirty-second lace stitch (fig. 751).       To introduce a
greater variety into lace stitches, netting can also be imitated
with the needle. You begin with a loop in the corner of a
square and work in diagonal lines. The loops are secured by
means of the same stitch shown in fig. 750, and the regularity
of the loops ensured, as it is there, by making them round a
pin, stuck in at the proper distance. The squares or meshes
must be made with the greatest accuracy; that being the case,
most of the stitches described in the preceding chapter can be
worked upon them, and the smallest spaces can be filled with
delicate embroidery.

Thirty-third lace stitch (fig. 752).       This stitch is frequently
met with in the oldest Irish lace, especially in the kind
where the braids are joined together by fillings not bars. At
first sight, it looks merely like a close net stitch, the ground
and filling all alike, so uniform is it in appearance, but on
a closer observation it will be found to be quite a different
stitch from any of those we have been describing.

The first stitch is made like a plain net stitch, the second
consists of a knot that ties up the loop of the first stitch. Fillings
of this kind must be worked as compactly as possible, so
that hardly any spaces are visible between the individual rows.





Fig. 752. Thirty-third lace stitch.




Fig. 753. Thirty-fourth lace stitch.



Thirty-fourth lace stitch (fig. 753).       To fill in a surface
with this stitch, known as the wheel or spider stitch, begin by
laying double diagonal threads to and fro, at regular distances
apart, so that they lie side by side and are not twisted. When
the whole surface is covered with these double threads, throw
a second similar series across them, the opposite way. The
return thread, in making this second layer, must be conducted
under the double threads of the first layer and over the single
thread just laid, and wound two or three times round them,
thereby forming little wheels or spiders, like those already
described in the preceding chapter in figs. 653 and 654.

Thirty-fifth lace stitch (fig. 754).       Begin by making a
very regular netted foundation, but without knots, where the
two layers of threads intersect each other.

Then, make a third layer of diagonal threads across the
two first layers, so that all meet at the same points of intersection,
thus forming six rays divergent from one centre. With
the fourth and last thread, which forms the seventh and eighth
ray, you make the wheel over seven threads, then slip the
needle under it and carry it on to the point for the next wheel.





Fig. 754. Thirty-fifth lace stitch.




Fig. 755. Thirty-sixth lace stitch.



Thirty-sixth lace stitch (fig. 755).       After covering all the
surface to be embroidered, with threads stretched in horizontal
lines, you cover them with loops going from one to the
other and joining themselves in the subsequent row to the
preceding loops.

The needle will thus have to pass underneath two threads.
Then cover this needle-made canvas
with cones worked in close
darning stitches, as in figs. 648,
716 and 717.

Thirty-seventh lace stitch
(fig. 756).       Here, by means of
the first threads that you lay, you
make an imitation of the Penelope
canvas used for tapestry work,
covering the surface with double
threads, a very little distance apart,
stretched both ways. The second
layer of threads must pass alternately under and over the first,
where they cross each other, and the small squares thus left
between, must be encircled several times with thread and then
buttonholed; the thicker the foundation and the more raised
and compact the buttonholing upon it is, the better the effect
will be. Each of these little buttonholed rings should be begun
and finished off independently of the others.





Fig. 756. Thirty-seventh lace stitch.




Fig. 757. Thirty-eighth lace stitch.



Thirty-eighth lace stitch (fig. 757).       Plain net stitch
being quicker to do than any other, one is tempted to use it
more frequently; but as it is a little monotonous some openwork
ornament upon it is a great improvement; such for
instance as small buttonholed rings, worked all over the ground
at regular intervals. Here again, as in the preceding figure the
rings must be made independently of each other.

Thirty-ninth lace stitch (fig. 758).       Corded bars,
branching out into other bars, worked in overcasting stitches,
may also serve as a lace ground.

You lay five or six threads, according to the course the
bars are to take; you overcast the branches up to the point
of their junction with the principal line, thence you throw
across the foundation threads for another branch, so that
having reached a given point and coming back to finish the
threads left uncovered in going, you will often have from six
to eight short lengths of thread to overcast.

Overcasting stitches are always worked from right to left.





Fig. 758. Thirty-ninth lace stitch.




Fig. 759. Fortieth lace stitch.



Fortieth lace stitch (fig. 759).       Of all the different kinds
of stitches here given, this, which terminates the series, is
perhaps the one requiring the most patience. It was copied
from a piece of very old and valuable Brabant lace, of which
it formed the entire ground. Our figure of course represents
it on a very magnified scale, the original being worked in the
finest imaginable material, over a single foundation thread.

In the first row, after the three
usual foundation threads are laid,
you make the buttonhole stitches
to the number of eight or ten, up
to the point from which the next
branch issues, from the edge of
the braid, that is, upwards.

Then you bring the needle
down again and buttonhole the
second part of the bar, working
from right to left.

A picot, like the one described
in fig. 701, marks the point where the bars join. More picots
of the same kind may be added at discretion.

Wheel composed of buttonhole bars (figs. 760, 761,
762, 763).       As we have already more than once given directions
for making wheels, not only in the present chapter, but
also in the one on netting, there is no need to enlarge on the
kind of stitches to be used here, but we will explain the course
of the thread in making wheels, composed of buttonhole bars
in a square opening.

Making and taking up the loops.




Fig. 761. Wheel composed of buttonhole bars.
The buttonholing begun.



Fig. 760 shows how the first eight loops which form the
foundation of the bars are made.

In fig. 761 you will see that a thread has been passed
through the loops, for the purpose of drawing them in and
making a ring in addition to which, two threads added to
the loop serve as padding for the buttonhole stitches; the
latter should always be begun on the braid side. Fig. 762 represents
the bar begun in fig. 761 completed, and the passage of
the thread to the next bar, and
fig. 763 the ring buttonholed
after the completion of all the
bars.

Filling in round spaces
(figs. 764, 765, 766).       The
stitches best adapted for filling
in round spaces are those that
can be drawn in and tightened
to the required circumference,
or those that admit of the number
being reduced, regularly,
in each round.



Fig. 764. Filling in a round space with net stitch.


In tacking braids on to circular
patterns, the inside edges,
as we pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, have to be
drawn in with overcasting stitches in very fine thread.

Fig. 764 shows how to fill in a round space with net
stitches. It will be observed that the loop which begins the
row, has the thread of the loop with which it terminates,
wound round it, which thread then passes on to the second
series of stitches. In the same manner you pass to the third
row after which you pick up all the loops and fasten off the
thread by working back to the braid edge over all the rows
of loops, following the course indicated by the dotted line.





Fig. 765. Filling in round spaces.
First circle of wheels begun.




Fig. 766. Filling in round spaces.
The two circles of wheels finished.



Fig. 765 shows how to finish a row of loops with wheels
worked upon three threads only. In the first row, you make a
wheel over each bar; in the second, you make a bar between
every two wheels; in the third, the wheels are only made over
every second bar; a fourth row of bars which you pick up
with a thread completes the interior of the circle, then you
work along the bars with overcasting stitches, fig. 766, to
carry the thread back to the edge of the braid where you
fasten it off.

Needle-made picots (figs. 767, 768, 769).       The edges
and outlines of Irish lace are generally bordered with picots,
which as we have already said can be bought ready-made
(see fig. 692). They are not however very strong and we cannot
recommend them for lace that any one has taken the pains
to make by hand.



Fig. 767. Connected needle-made picots.


In fig. 767, the way to make
picots all joined together is
described. You begin, as in fig. 762, by a knot, over which the
thread is twisted as indicated in
the engraving.

It is needless to repeat that
the loops should all be knotted
in a line, all be of the same
length and all the same distance
apart.

Fig. 768 represents the kind
of needle-made picots which most
resemble the machine-made ones,
and fig. 769 show us the use of
little scallops surmounted by picots,
made in bullion stitch.



Fig. 768. Isolated needle-made picots.


One or two rows of lace stitch
fig. 736, or the first rows of figs.
749, 750, can also be used in
the place of picots.



Fig. 769. Buttonhole picots with picots in bullion stitch.



Irish lace (fig. 770).       English braids or those braids
which are indicated at the foot of the engraving must be tacked
down on to the pattern and gathered on the inside edge,
wherever the lines are curved, as explained in fig. 693; in cases
however where only Lacet superfin D.M.C[A] is used, the
needle should be slipped in underneath the outside threads, so
that the thread with which you draw in the braid be hidden.



Fig. 770. Irish lace.


The braids are joined together where they meet with a few
overcasting stitches, as shown in the illustration.

Here, we find one of the lace stitches used instead of picots;
the first row of fig. 736 always makes a nice border for Irish lace.

Irish lace (fig. 771).       This pattern, which is more complicated
and takes more time and stitches than the preceding one,
can also be executed with one or other of the braids mentioned
at the beginning of the chapter; but it looks best made
with a close braid.



Fig. 771. Irish lace.
Materials: Lacet surfin D.M.C No. 5, white or         cru and Fil d     Alsace D.M.C
Nos. 40 to 150, or Fil          dentelle D.M.C Nos. 50 to 150.


The bars, which in the illustration are simply buttonholed
may also be ornamented with picots of one kind or another;
the interior spaces of the figure on the left can be filled,
instead of with corded bars, with one of the lace stitches we
have described, either fig. 720, 721, or 732, any one of which
is suitable for filling in small spaces like these.

In the figure on the right, the ring of braid may be replaced
by close buttonhole stitches, made over several foundation
threads or over one thick thread, such as Fil          pointer D.M.C
No. 10 or 20[A] to make them full and round.

You begin the ring on the inside and increase the number
of stitches as the circumference increases.


Any of the stitches, from fig. 720 to fig. 743, can be introduced
here.

Irish lace (fig. 772).       Here we find one of the fillings
above alluded to, fig. 751, used as a ground for the flowers and
leaves. For the design itself some of the closer stitches described
in this chapter, should be selected. When the actual
lace, is finished you sew upon the braid a thin cord, made of
        cru Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C, as described in the chapter on
different kinds of fancy work. Cords of this kind can be had
ready made, but the hand-made ones are much to be preferred,
being far softer and more supple than the machine-made.



Fig. 772. Irish lace.
Materials: English braid with open edge.       For the lattice work: Fil d     Alsace
D.M.C in balls Nos. 50 to 100 or Fil          dentelle D.M.C Nos. 50 to 100, white.
For the cord: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C No. 15,         cru.[A]


Irish lace (fig. 773).       This lace, more troublesome than
the preceding ones to make, is also much more valuable and
effective. The ground is composed entirely of bars, like the
ones described in fig. 761, the branches, true to the character
of the work are worked in the close stitch represented in
fig. 755, and the flowers in double net stitch, fig. 721.



Fig. 773. Irish lace.
Materials       For the cord: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 15 to 25.
For the bars and lace stitches: Fil          dentelle D.M.C No. 200.[A]


In working the above fillings, the thread must not, as in
lace made with braid, be carried on from one point to the other
by overcasting stitches along the braid edges, but should be
drawn out horizontally through the cord and back again the
same way, giving the needle in so doing a slightly slanting
direction.
