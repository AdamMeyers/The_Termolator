Stripe in flat and raised satin stitch, and madeira embroidery.





White Embroidery.


We have retained the familiar term, white embroidery,
for this kind of needlework, for convenience sake, in spite of
its inaccuracy, now that coloured materials are quite as much
used for it as white.

It is executed, either on a backing of oil-cloth, or in an
embroidery frame, called &laquo;tambour-frame&raquo;. Only skilful
workers can dispense with these, for an untrained hand can
hardly avoid puckering. If you work without a foundation, the
material must be held, quite smoothly over the forefinger, so
that the threads lie perfectly straight, otherwise, the pattern
is very apt to get pulled out of shape in the working. With
your three other fingers you hold the material fast, the thumb
resting on the work itself, beyond the outline of the pattern,
which must be turned towards the worker. It is always the
outside line of a pattern that is drawn in double lines, that
should be turned towards the palm of the hand.

Tracing patterns.&mdash;Patterns are generally to be had ready
traced, but as it is often necessary to repeat, enlarge, or
reduce them, descriptions of several modes of doing so, will
be found at the end of the concluding chapter.

Materials.&mdash;A loose, soft make of cotton, the looser the
better, and very little twisted, is the best material for embroidery.
We recommend for white embroidery in general, Coton
&agrave; broder D.M.C Nos. 16 to 150; for monograms on cambric,
Coton &agrave; broder surfin D.M.C Nos. 100, 120, 150;[A] and
for English or Madeira embroidery, Coton Madeira D.M.C
Nos. 40, 50, 60;[A] for padding, or raising the embroidery,
all the different kinds of Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C[A] can be used.

Outlining and padding.&mdash;The outlining of a pattern is
a very important preliminary. A want of precision in the ultimate
effect is often due, merely to careless outlining. This
part of the work should be done with rather a coarser cotton
than the embroidery itself. Fasten in the thread by a few
running stitches, never with a knot, a rule to be observed also
in embroidering, except in very rare cases. Finish off your
thread by drawing it through the tracing stitches, or through
some part of the pattern that is already finished. Fill in the
spaces between the lines with a padding of run threads, run
loosely, and so that they lie thickly and solidly in the centre,
and shade off on both sides. The fullness,
and roundness of embroidery,
depends on the firmness of this sub-stratum
of threads. The outlining and
the padding of the different rounded
and pointed scallops, as well as of other
figures that occur in white embroidery,
are illustrated in figs. 181, 182, 183,
184, 185, 187, 189, 190 and 191.

Blanket, or button-hole stitch
(fig. 171).&mdash;Work from left to right;
run in a foundation line, hold down the
working thread below the run line
with the right thumb; insert the needle
above and bring it out below the run
line but above the working thread;
tighten the loop thus formed, without
drawing up the stuff, and continue in
this manner, setting your stitches closely and regularly, side
by side.



Fig. 171. Blanket, or
button-hole stitch.


Straight stem stitch (fig. 172).&mdash;Work from left to right.
The needle must always be inserted above the run thread,
and brought out underneath it. In the case of a very delicate
pattern, take up only just as much stuff as the run thread
covers.



Fig. 172. Straight stem stitch.

Sloping stem stitch (fig. 173).&mdash;Work without a run
thread; insert the needle from right
to left in a slanting direction,
under 1 or 2 horizontal threads,
and 5 or 6 perpendicular ones;
so that each stitch reaches halfway
back to the last.



Fig. 173. Sloping stem stitch.

This kind of stem stitch is chiefly
used for the fine upstrokes of
letters and numbers, and for linen
embroidery.

Back-stitching (fig. 174).&mdash;Back-stitching,
that is small, even
stitches set closely together, is done
from right to left, along a straight
line, and is chiefly used for filling
in the centres of letters, leaves and
flowers.



Fig. 174. Back-stitching.

Crossed back-stitch (figs. 175
and 176).&mdash;Used, generally speaking,
only for very transparent materials;
it forms a close seam of cross-stitch,
on the wrong side, and two
straight rows of back-stitching on
the right. To work, insert the
needle as if for an ordinary back-stitch,
pass it under the stuff,
sloping it a little towards the second
outline of the pattern, and
draw it out almost in front of the
first stitch. After making a back-stitch, pass the needle up
again under the stuff and bring it out at the spot where the
next stitch is to be.



Fig. 175. Crossed back-stitch.
Right side.




Fig. 176. Crossed back-stitch.
Wrong side.


Fig. 176 shows the interlacing of the stitches on the wrong
side, and the way in which this stitch, when it is used for
filling in centres, can be worked on
the right side.

Simple knot stitch (fig. 177).
This consists of two back-stitches,
side by side, covering the same
threads; it is chiefly used for
filling in leaves, embroidered on
very thin materials, or in conjunction
with flat stitch.



Fig. 177. Simple knot stitch.

Twisted knot stitch (fig. 178).
To work hold the working thread
down with the thumb close to the
spot where you first brought it out,
twist it twice round the needle,
turn the needle round from left to
right, following the direction indicated
by the arrow, pass it through
the fabric at the place which is
marked by a dot, and draw it out
at the place where the next stitch
is to be.



Fig. 178. Twisted knot stitch.

Post stitch (fig. 179).&mdash;Something
like knot stitch and much used
for patterns, composed of small
flowers and leaves, where it often
takes the place of raised satin stitch.
The illustration represents five
leaves finished, and the sixth in
process of being worked.



Fig. 179. Post stitch.

To work, bring the needle up from the back and twist
the thread round it as many times as the length of the stitch
requires, hold the left thumb on the species of curl thus
formed, and passing the needle and thread through it, insert
it at the end of the leaf where it first came out, and draw
it out at the right place for the next stitch.

Button-hole bars (fig. 180).&mdash;When a pattern is ornamented
with open-work bars, begin by tracing the outside
parallel lines. Then button-hole the whole lower line and
the upper one, till you come to the place where the first bar
is to be; then you carry your thread across and bring up
the needle from below through one of the loops, as, shown
in the figure; lay three threads in this manner, inserting your
needle the third time one loop further on. Then cover the
three threads thickly with button-holing.



Fig. 180. Button-hole bars.

Different kinds of scallops (figs. 181, 182, 183).&mdash;The
outlining, padding and button-holing of these scallops is executed
in the manner already described. Be careful to adapt the
length of the stitches to the shape and size of the scallops. If
they are pointed (figs.
182, 183), the stitches
will have to be set
very closely together
on the inner line, and
a little play allowed
them on the outer, to
come exactly to the
point, which should
be very sharply defined.



Fig. 181. Round, button-holed scallops.



Fig. 182. Large, pointed, button-holed scallops.



Fig. 183. Small, pointed, button-holed scallops.

Rose scallops (figs.
184 and 185).&mdash;These
are, large button-holed
scallops with indented
edges, in the one case, rounded at the top and sharply pointed
at the join; in the other, pointed at the top, and joined at
the bottom by a straight bar of button-holing.



Fig. 184. Rounded rose scallops.



Fig. 185. Pointed rose scallops.

Eyelet holes (figs. 186, 187, 188).&mdash;Outline the eyelet holes
very carefully first by running a thread round them, then
cut out the enclosed stuff with a sharp pair of finely pointed
scissors, and edge the hole with plain overcasting stitches,
worked from left to right.



Fig. 186. Overcast eyelet holes.

When you have a long row of eyelet holes to make, outline
the upper and lower halves alternately, first on one side and
then on the other, using two threads, and then overcast them
in the same way. The double crossing of the working threads
between the eyelet holes makes them much stronger, than if
each hole were finished off separately, and the thread passed
underneath from one to
the other.



Fig. 187. Button-holed shaded eyelet holes.



Fig. 188. Shaded eyelet holes half overcast, half button-holed.

The lower halves of
shaded eyelet holes, (see
figs. 187 and 188), are
worked with very short
stitches, and the upper
halves with long ones; they
may be edged entirely, either with button-holing or overcasting,
or half with one and half with the other.

Six leaves in raised satin stitch (fig. 189).&mdash;Raised satin
stitch is chiefly used for working flowers, leaves, petals, dots,
initials and monograms. After tracing the outline of the design,
fill in the centres with a padding of long, close stitches
for which you can again take Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C[A]
and then, beginning always at the point of the leaf, see letter A,
cover it with flat, perfectly even stitches, worked from right-to-left.
B illustrates a leaf, divided through the middle by a line of
overcasting; C, one with a corded vein; D, a divided leaf
worked in sloping satin stitch; E, a leaf, with a corded vein
and framed in sloping satin stitch; F, a leaf worked half in
satin stitch, half in back-stitch and straight stem stitch.



Fig. 189. Six leaves in raised satin stitch.

Leaves and flowers of all descriptions, can be executed in
any of these stitches, and in different combinations of the same.

Six ways of making dots (fig. 190).&mdash;Dots, when they
are well made, are exceedingly effective in white embroidery,
particularly if they are worked in a variety of stitches.
Dot A is worked in raised satin stitch; B, in raised satin
stitch, framed in back stitch; C, in raised satin stitch, framed
in twisted knot stitch; D is composed of several post stitches
of different lengths, set in a frame of stem stitches; E is worked
in back-stitch, and F consists of a small eyelet hole, with
a corded setting, which forms the centre.



Fig. 190. Six ways of making dots.

Venetian embroidery (fig. 191).&mdash;Scallops, worked in
very high relief, called Venetian embroidery, are an imitation
on stuff of Venetian lace.

Real Venetian point is entirely needle-made; in the embroidered
imitations of it, the stuff takes the place of the
needle-made lace foundation. To make it more like the original
however, the ground is seldom left plain, but is covered with
fancy stitches, such as are represented in the illustration, or
with one or other of the damask stitches in figs. 146 to 170.
The button-hole bars may be made with or without picots.
A full description of the latter will be found in the chapters
on net embroidery, and Irish lace. The space to be buttonholed,
must be well padded, for thereon depends the roundness
of the embroidery. For this purpose take 6 or 8 threads of
Coton &agrave; repriser D.M.C No. 25,[A] and fasten them down on to
the pattern with loose stitches, laying on extra threads, and
cutting them gradually away, according to the width the line
is to be. The stuff underneath the bars should only be cut
away when the embroidery is quite finished.



Fig. 191. Venetian embroidery.

Renaissance embroidery (figs. 192 and 193).&mdash;This is the
term applied, more especially in France, to embroidery
patterns, which are worked entirely in button-holing, and
connected by button-hole bars without picots, as shewn in the
two accompanying figures. The outside edge in fig. 193, is embellished
with picots, described in the chapters just referred to.



Fig. 192. Renaissance embroidery.



Fig. 193. Renaissance embroidery.

Richelieu embroidery (fig. 194).&mdash;The name given to
embroidery of a similar kind to the former, but in which the
connecting bars, instead of being left plain as they are in the
Renaissance embroidery, are ornamented with picots.



Fig. 194. Richelieu embroidery.

Madeira work (figs. 195, 196, 197).&mdash;This kind of embroidery,
which consists chiefly of eyelet holes, and is distinguished
for the excellence of its workmanship used to be
known as English, but is now generally called Madeira work,
from the island where it originated. The scallops in figs. 195
and 197, are bordered with shaded eyelet holes, worked half
in button-hole stitch, half in overcasting; the finely scalloped
edge, in fig. 196, is entirely button-holed. In working eyelet
holes, the material must always be turned in, up to the
inside line, and completely worked in, underneath the
in order that no loose threads may be visible on the wrong side.

Swiss embroidery frame (fig. 198).&mdash;Letters, monograms,
coronets and the like, require extreme care in the
working, and can only be really well done in a frame. The
round Swiss frame, or tambour frame, is the one most
commonly used. It consists of two wooden hoops, fitting
loosely into each other; the inner one, fastened to a support
with a wooden screw let into the lower part of it, with which
to fasten the frame to the table. The outside hoop is loose.

Place the fabric to be embroidered over the smaller hoop,
the pattern in the middle, and press the other down over it so
that it is tightly stretched and fixed between the two hoops.

A leathern strap with holes and a buckle, sometimes takes
the place of the second hoop.



Fig. 198. Swiss embroidery frame.

Ordinary embroidery frame (fig. 199).&mdash;Tambour frames
can only be used for embroidering pocket-handkerchiefs
and other small articles; all larger work has to be done in
an ordinary frame. Sew a piece of strong stuff into the
frame, stretch it as tightly and evenly as possible, and cut
out a square in the middle to the size of the pattern. Then
tack your work in underneath, straight to the thread, dividing
it out carefully with pins first, to ensure its being set in
perfectly evenly. Roll or fold up the rest of the stuff over the
edges of the frame, and secure it with a few stitches or pins,
to keep it out of the way of your hand as you work.



Fig. 199. Ordinary embroidery frame.

Alphabets for monograms (figs. 200 to 205).&mdash;On account
of the difficulty of devising a good monogram for marking under-linen,
we subjoin two alphabets, by the aid of which our
workers will be able to compose their own.

The letters are of a good medium size, which can be magnified
or reduced according to the worker's own taste.

For any such modifications, we would again draw our
reader's attention to the directions given in the concluding
chapter. The three first plates represent large wide letters,
intended to contain or encompass the more elongated ones,
represented in the fourth and fifth plates, figs. 203 and 204.

The interlacing of the letters requires to be carefully done,
and our workers should study the following specimens, so
as to learn the stitches also, which are most suitable for this
branch of embroidery.

Monogram composed of letters A and D (fig. 206).&mdash;Here,
letter A is worked in flat satin stitch, in Bleu-Indigo 312,
and set in stem stitch, worked in Rouge-Turc 321. D as a contrast
to A, is embroidered in transverse bars, the left part in
pale blue and white, the right in pale blue and dark blue. The
little ornaments may be worked according to fancy, either in
white, or in one of the given colours.

D drawn from the alphabets of
monograms.
Materials: Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C
Nos. 100 to 150.
Colours: Bleu-Indigo 334, Rouge-Turc
321 and white.[A]


Monogram composed of letters V and S (fig. 207).&mdash;The
flat satin stitch in both letters is worked in white; the
setting, is in red, in short stem stitch, or if preferred, in
knotted back stitch.

Monogram composed of letters R and C (fig. 208).&mdash;These
are worked in black and grey, for mourning; the
way C is divided, admits of a variety in the stitch; for instance,
the back-stitches, in the illustration, may be replaced
by very small eyelet holes.

Monogram composed of letters G and E (fig. 209).&mdash;The
flat satin stitching and back-stitching in E, and the stem-stitched
edges of G are worked in white Coton &agrave; broder
D.M.C; the inside of G in ivory white Coton surfin D.M.C.

unbleached.


Border in Gobelin stitch (fig. 210).&mdash;Gobelin embroidery
is merely raised satin stitch, worked directly upon the pattern,
without any foundation, or padding. The effectiveness of this
kind of embroidery, which appears so complicated and is
really so easy, and the many ways in which it can be utilised,
soon brought it into favour. It can be worked on the article
itself, or on stripes, laid on afterwards, with a hem-stitch
bordering. The original of fig. 210 was in blue and red; Bleu
Indigo 312 for the grounding, Rouge-Turc 321, for the setting
in stem-stitch. The herringboning along the edges of the
pattern, top and bottom, is also in red.



Fig. 210. Border in gobelin stitch.
Materials: Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 35 in two different colours such as:
Bleu-Indigo 312 and Rouge-Cardinal 304, Rouge-Grenat 358 and 309 or,
Gris-Tilleul 393 and Rouge-Cardinal 305.[A]


Should a different selection of colours be made, it is important
to remember that in all cases a sharp contrast is
desirable.

Alphabet and numerals, left blank, and outlined by
the grounding, worked in Gobelin stitch (figs. 211 to 215).



Fig. 211. Alphabet left blank and outlined by the grounding. Letters A to N.



Fig. 212. Alphabet left blank and outlined by the grounding. Letters O to Z.



Fig. 213. Letter O, from the alphabet
given in figs. 211 and 212.




Fig. 214. Numerals left blank and outlined by the grounding.

The border worked in Gobelin
stitch, illustrated in
fig. 210, suggested to us the
idea of an alphabet and
numerals, to be executed
in a similar style, left blank,
that is to say, and outlined
by a grounding in Gobelin
stitch, which are better suited
to embroideries of the
kind than those generally
used. Our limited space prevents
us from giving all the
letters in the diagonal position
they are intended to
occupy on the article itself.
O and W only, are represented
in the right position.
No difficulty will be found
in copying the other letters,
in giving them the proper
direction.



Fig. 215. Letter W, from the alphabet
given in fig. 211 and 212.


In order to economize
room, J and H are represented
in one square, but they
are easily distinguishable
from each other.

Fig. 214 represents the
numerals, executed in the
same way. We should like to draw our readers attention to
a few other ways in which letters and numerals may be
outlined by the back-ground; for example, the solid parts
can be worked either in plain or twisted knot stitch (figs. 177
and 178); in very fine chain stitch; in old German knot or bead
stitch (fig. 873), or even in piqu&eacute; embroidery (fig. 877).

Border outlined by grounding, worked in Gobelin and
stem stitch (fig. 216). The grounding of this
pattern is worked on stiff white linen, and entirely in Rouge-Turc
321, and the outlining in Noir grand Teint 310. The same
pattern can equally well be worked on gauzes and other transparent
stuffs, but with Coton &agrave; repriser, instead of Coton &agrave;
broder D.M.C, for the solid parts. Two shades of Rouge-Grenat,
one dark and one very light, may be taken instead, or two of
Jaune-Rouille, or of Violet-Mauve, employing always the lighter
shade for the grounding and the darker for the setting.



Fig. 216. Border, outlined by the grounding worked in gobelin
and stem stitch. First part.




Fig. 216. Second part.
Materials: Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 50.&mdash;Colours: Rouge-Turc 321 and Noir
grand Teint 310.[A]


Be careful, in the grounding, not to make the red stitches
near the edge, longer than they are represented in the illustration
and to set the black stem stitches as close as possible to
the grounding.

The pattern, which could only be reproduced in the original
size, had to be divided in two, to fit the page. In copying
it, join the A and B of the first part to the A and B of the
second; the same in fig. 217, each time the pattern is repeated,
the flowers are to droop from the + as seen from the position
of the buds in the first part, at the beginning of the
drawing.

Flower garland in different kinds of stitches (figs. 217
and 218).&mdash;Most of the stitches, described at the beginning of
this chapter, will be found in this graceful garland, in the execution
of which a considerable variety of colours can be introduced.
The rose-buds may be worked in two shades of Vert-Pistache
and of Rouge-Grenat, in the stitches described in
figs. 173, 177, 189 A; the forget-me-nots, in two or even
three shades of Bleu-Indigo, in raised satin stitch and knotted
stitch; the slender green leaves in Vert-de-gris, or Gris-Tilleul,
the stamens in Jaune-Citron, and the stalks of the roses in
Brun-Acajou.



Fig. 217. Flower-garland in different kinds of stitches.First part.



Fig. 217. Second part.
Materials: Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 40.
Colours: Rouge-Grenat 326 and 335, Bleu-Indigo 312 and 334, Vert-Pistache
319 and 320, Vert-de-gris 474 and 475, Brun-Acajou 301, Jaune-citron 446.




Fig. 218. Showing the working of the outside
stitches in fig. 217.


The border that completes this charming pattern, consists
of four rows of button holing, worked in four colours. The
first row in our illustration is worked in pale pink, followed
by three shades of green, the palest of which is used for the
second row of stitches.

When these rows are worked upon a satine or cambric foundation,
it is advisable to begin by making a small drawing, in
which the height of the stitches and the distance between them
is accurately marked out, then prick the pattern through and
pounce it upon the material beneath.

When they are worked on a material, the threads of which
can be counted no such precaution is necessary.

Insertion in Gobelin and stem stitch (fig. 219).&mdash;Owing
to the shortness of the stitches, this pattern is easier to work
than the foregoing ones. The little flowers are embroidered
alternately in dark and light red; the setting varies to correspond,
the light red flower being set in dark red, and vice versa.
The interior of the leaves is in light green and the setting,
as well as the connecting bars, in dark green.



Fig. 219. Insertion in gobelin and stem stitch.
Materials: Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 35&mdash;Colours: Rouge-Cardinal 347 and
Rouge-G&eacute;ranium 352 with Gris-Tilleul 392 and 331, or Bleu-Indigo 312 and
334 with Vert-Mousse 469 and 471, or Violet-Mauve 375 and 376 with
Jaune-Rouille 364 365.[A]


Stripes of embroidery with lace insertion between (fig. 220).&mdash;We conclude this chapter, by showing how stripes of
embroidery can be used alone, or in conjunction, either with
bands of open-work, or lace, crochet, or net insertion. Such
combinations are useful for ornamenting aprons, table-cloths,
curtains etc., every description in short of household linen
and of children's garments. One great advantage, moreover,
which stripes of this kind, have over larger pieces of embroidery
is that they require neither frame nor pillow, nor wearisome
counting of stitches, but can be worked in the hand, at
all times and places.
