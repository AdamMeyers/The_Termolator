<h2><a name="Plain_Sewing" id="Plain_Sewing"></a>Plain Sewing.</h2>


<p>Many, on opening the Encyclopedia of needlework will
be disposed to exclaim as they read the heading of this first
section: What is the use of describing all the old well-known
stitches, when machines have so nearly superseded the slower
process of hand-sewing? To this our reply is that, of all
kinds of needlework, Plain Sewing needs to be most thoroughly
learned, as being the foundation of all. Those who are
able to employ others to work for them, should at least know
how to distinguish good work from bad, and those who are in
less fortunate circumstances, have to be taught how to work for
themselves.</p>

<p><b>Position of the body and hands.</b>&mdash;Before describing
different kinds of stitches, a word should be said as to
the position of the body and hands when at work. Long experience
has convinced me that no kind of needlework necessitates
a stooping or cramped attitude. To obviate which, see
that your chair and table suit each other in height, and that you
so hold your work as hardly to need to bend your head at all.
The practice of fastening the work to the knee, besides being
ungraceful, is injurious to the health.</p>

<p><b>Needles.</b>&mdash;These should be of the best quality. To test
a needle, try to break it; if it resist, and then break clean in
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>two, the steel is good; if it bend without breaking, or break
without any resistance, it is bad. Never use a bent needle, it
makes ugly and irregular stitches, and see that the eye, whether
round or egg-shaped, be well-drilled, that it may not fray
or cut the thread. Long or half-long needles are the best for
white work, long ones for dress-making, and longer ones still,
with long eyes, for darning. A stock of each, from No 5 to 12,
is advised. The needle should always be a little thicker than
the thread, to make an easy passage for it through the stuff.</p>

<p>To keep needles from rusting, strew a little stone alum in
the packets, and workers whose hands are apt to get damp,
should have a small box of it handy, to powder their fingers
with. Blackened needles can be made quite bright again by
drawing them through an emery cushion.</p>

<p><b>Scissors</b>.&mdash;Scissors are a very important accessory of the
work-table, and two varieties are indispensable; a pair of large
ones for cutting-out, with one point blunt and the other sharp,
the latter to be always held downwards; and a pair of smaller
ones with two sharp points. The handles should be large and
round; if at all tight, they tire and disfigure the hand.</p>

<p><b>Thimble</b>.&mdash;Steel thimbles are the best; bone are very
liable to break, and silver ones are not deeply enough pitted, to
hold the needle. A thimble should be light, with a rounded
top and flat rim.</p>

<p><b>The thread</b>.&mdash;Except for tacking, your thread should never
be more than from 40 to 50 c/m. long.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If the thread is
in skeins, it does not matter which end you begin with, but if
you use reeled cotton, thread your needle with the end that
points to the reel, when you cut it; as the other end will split,
and unravel, when twisted from left to right, which is generally
done, to facilitate the process of threading. The cotton should
always be cut, as it is weakened by breaking.</p>

<p><b>Knotting the thread into the needle</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>).&mdash;When the
thread becomes inconveniently short, and you do not want
take a fresh one, it may be knotted into the needle, thus:
bring it round the forefinger close to the needle, cross it on the
inside next to the finger, hold the crossed threads fast, with the<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
thumb draw the needle out through the loop thus formed,
and tighten the loop round both ends.</p>

<img src="images/003.jpg" alt="FIG. 1. KNOTTING THE THREAD INTO THE NEEDLE." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 1. Knotting the thread into the needle.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Materials</b>.&mdash;For tacking, use Coton &agrave; coudre D.M.C qualit&eacute;
sup&eacute;rieure (black and gold stamp) Nos. 2 to 6.<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> For hand-sewing,
Fil d'Alsace D.M.C Nos. 30 to 700,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C,
balls or reels, Nos. 25 to 100<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> will be found most useful. For
machine-work: C&acirc;bl&eacute; 6 fils pour machines D.M.C, Nos. 30 to
300,<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>  black and
white, or white
and blue stamp.
These can also be
used for hand-work.
Both these
and the lace-thread
(Fil &agrave; dentelle) on reels, are
superfine in quality.
The medium
sizes are the most
useful; but the
only suitable ones
for very fine and
delicate fabrics are
the Fil &agrave; dentelle
D.M.C, and Fil
d'Alsace, and the
latter only is manufactured
in the
higher numbers.</p>

<p>All these threads are to be had, wound in balls, or on
reels, the buyer may make his own choice; balls are apt to
get tangled, but the cotton preserves its roundness better than
when it is wound on reels. Linen is generally sewn with
linen-thread, but Fil &agrave; dentelle and the Fil d'Alsace are very
good substitutes.</p>
<p><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></p>
<p><b>Position of the hands</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>).&mdash;The stuff, fastened to a
cushion, must be held with the left hand, which should neither
rest on the table, nor on the cushion, the needle must be held
between the thumb and forefinger, of the right hand, and
the middle finger, armed with the thimble, pushes the needle
far enough through the stuff, for the other fingers to take hold
of it and draw it out; the thread then comes to lie between the
fourth and fifth fingers in the form of a loop, which must be
tightened gradually to avoid its knotting.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 2. Position of the hands.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Position of the hands without cushion</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>).&mdash;When
the work cannot be
fastened to a cushion
it should be
held between the
forefinger and the
thumb, and left
hanging down, over
the other fingers.
If it need to be
more firmly held,
draw it between the fourth and fifth fingers, which will prevent
it from getting puckered or dragged.</p>

<p><a name="stitches" id="stitches"></a><b>Stitches</b>.&mdash;Plain-Sewing comprises 4 varieties of stitches,
(1) running, (2) back-stitching, (3) hemming and (4) top or
over-sewing.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Running-stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_4">4</a>).&mdash;This is the simplest and
easiest of all. Pass the needle in and out of the material, at
regular intervals, in a horizontal direction,
taking up three or four threads at a time.
If the stuff allow, several stitches may
be taken on the needle at once, before the
thread is drawn out. Running-stitch is used
for plain seams, for joining light materials,
for making gathers and for hems.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="fig_4" id="fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/006.jpg" alt="FIG. 4. RUNNING-STITCH." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 4. Running-stitch.</span>
</div>


<p>(2) <b>Back-stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_5">5</a>).&mdash;Insert the needle, and draw it out
six threads further on, carry your thread back, from left to
right, and insert the needle three threads back from the point
at which it was last drawn out, and bring it out six threads
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>beyond. Stitching and back-stitching are better and more
quickly done by machine than by hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="fig_5" id="fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/007.jpg" alt="FIG. 5. BACK-STITCH." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 5. Back-stitch.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Stitching</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_6">6</a>).&mdash;The production of
a row of back-stitches, that exactly meet
one another, constitutes what is called
stitching. Only one stitch can be made
at a time, and the needle must be put
in, exactly at the point where it was
drawn out to form the preceding back-stitch,
and brought out as many threads
further on as were covered by the last back-stitch.
The beauty of stitching depends
on the uniform length of the stitches, and
the straightness of the line formed, to
ensure which it is necessary to count the
threads for each stitch, and to draw a
thread to mark the line. If you have to
stitch in a slanting line across the stuff,
or the stuff be such as to render the
drawing of a thread impossible, a coloured
tacking thread should be run in first, to
as a guide.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 6. Stitching.</span>
</div>


<p><b>Stitched hem</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_7">7</a>).&mdash;Make a double
turning, as for a hem, draw a thread
two or three threads above the edge of the first turning, and
do your stitching through all three layers of stuff; the right
side will be that on which you form your stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="fig_7" id="fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/009.jpg" alt="FIG. 7. STITCHED HEM." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 7. Stitched hem.</span>
</div>



<p>(3) <b>Hemming-stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>).&mdash;To make a good hem,
your stuff must be cut in the line of the thread. Highly dressed
stuffs, such as linen and calico; should be rubbed in the hand,
to soften them, before the hem is laid. Your first turning
should not be more than 2 m/m. wide; turn down the whole
length of your hem, and then make the second turning of the
same width, so that the raw edge is enclosed between two
layers of stuff.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="fig_8" id="fig_8"></a>
<img src="images/010.jpg" alt="FIG. 8. HEMMING-STITCH." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 8. Hemming-stitch.</span>
</div>



<p>Narrow hems do not need to be tacked, but wide ones, where
the first turning should only be just wide enough to prevent
the edge from fraying, ought always to be. In hemming you
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>insert the needle and thread directed in a slanting position
towards you, just below the edge of the hem, and push it
out two threads above, and so on to the end, setting the
stitches, two or three threads apart, in a continuous straight
line. To ensure the hem being straight, a thread may be
drawn to mark the line for the second turning, but it is not
a good plan, especially in shirt-making, as the edge of the
stuff, too apt in any case, to cut and fray, is, thereby, still
further weakened. Hems in woollen materials, which will not
take a bend, can only be laid and tacked, bit by bit. In making,
what are called rolled hems, the needle must be slipped in, so
as only to pierce the first turning, in order that the stitches
may not be visible on the outside.</p>


<p><a name="seams" id="seams"></a><b>Flat seam</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_9">9</a>).&mdash;Lay your two edges, whether straight
or slanting, exactly even, tack them together with stitches
2 c/m. long, distant 1 to 2 c/m. from the edge, and then back-stitch
them by machine or by hand, following
the tacking-thread. Cut off half the inner
edge, turn the outer one in, as for a hem
and sew it down with hemming-stitches.</p>

<a name="fig_9" id="fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/011.jpg" alt="FIG. 9. FLAT SEAM." title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 9. Flat seam.</span>
</div>

<p>Smooth the seam underneath with the
forefinger as you go, to make it lie quite
flat. Beginners should flatten down the seam with their
thimbles, or with the handle of the scissors, before they
begin to hem, as the outer and wider edge is very apt to get
pushed up and bulge over, in the sewing, which hides the
stitches.</p>

<p><b>Rounded seam</b>.&mdash;Back-stitch your two edges together, as
above directed, then cut off the inner edge to a width of four
threads, and roll the outer one in, with the left thumb, till
the raw edge is quite hidden, hemming as you roll. This
kind of seam, on the wrong side, looks like a fine cord, laid
on, and is used in making the finer qualities of underclothing.</p>

<p><b>Fastening threads off, and on</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_10">10</a>).&mdash;Knots should be
avoided in white work. To fasten on, in hemming, turn the
needle backwards with the point up, take one stitch, and stroke
and work the end of the thread in, underneath the turning.<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
To fasten on, in back-stitching or running, make one stitch
with the new thread, then take both ends and lay them
down together to the left, and work over them, so that they
wind in, and out of the next few stitches.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Top or over-sewing stitch</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_11">11</a>).&mdash;This stitch is used
for joining selvedges together. To keep the
two pieces even, it is better, either to tack or
pin them together first. Insert the needle,
from right to left, under the first thread of
the selvedge, and through both edges, and
sew from right to left, setting your stitches
not more than three threads apart. The
thread must not be drawn too tightly, so
that when the seam is finished and flattened
with the thimble, the selvedges may
lie, side by side.</p>

<p><b>Antique or old-German seam</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>
and <a href="#fig_14">14</a>).&mdash;Tack or pin the selvedges together
as above, then, pointing your needle
upwards from below, insert it, two threads
from the selvedge, first on the wrong side,
then on the right, first through one selvedge,
then through the other, setting the
stitches two threads apart. In this manner,
the thread crosses itself, between the two
selvedges, and a perfectly flat seam is produced.
Seams of this kind occur in old embroidered
linen articles, where the stuff was
too narrow to allow for any other. A
similar stitch, fig. <a href="#fig_14">14</a>, only slanting,
instead of quite straight, as in fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>, is used in making
sheets.</p>

<p><b>French double seam</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_15">15</a>).&mdash;For joining such stuffs
as fray, use the so-called French-seam.</p>

<p>Run your two pieces of stuff together, the wrong sides
touching, and the edges perfectly even, then turn them round
just at the seam, so that the right sides come together inside,
and the two raw edges
are enclosed between,
and run them together
again. See that no threads
are visible on the outside.
This seam is used chiefly
in dress-making, for
joining slight materials
together which cannot be
kept from fraying by any
other means.</p>

edges, and lay them one
upon the other, so that
the one next the forefinger, lies slightly higher than the
one next the thumb. Insert the needle, not upwards from below
but first into the upper edge, and then, slightly slanting, into
the lower one. This seam is used
in dress-making, for fastening
down linings. Fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a> shows
another kind of double seam, where
the two edges are laid together,
turned in twice, and hemmed in
the ordinary manner, with the sole
difference, that the needle has to
pass through a sixfold layer of stuff.</p>

<p><b>Sewing on gathers</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a>).&mdash;To
distribute the fulness equally,
divide the gathered portion of ma<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>terial,
and the band, or plain piece, on to which it is to be
sewn, into equal parts, and pin the two together at corresponding
distances, the gathered portion under the plain, and
hem each gather to the band or plain piece, sloping the needle
to make the thread slant, and slipping it through the upper
threads only of the gathers.</p>

<p><b>Whipping</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>).&mdash;Whipping is another form of gathering,
used for fine materials.
With the thumb and forefinger
of the left hand, roll the
edge over towards you, into a
very tight thin roll, insert the
needle on the inside of the roll
next the thumb, and bring it
out on the outside next the
forefinger, at very regular distances,
and draw up the thread
slightly, from time to time, to
form the gathers.</p>

<p><b>Ornamental hem</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>).
For an ornamental hem, make a turning, 2 or 3 c/m. deep, and
run in a thread, with small running-stitches up and down,
as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>. By slightly drawing
the thread, the straight edge will be made
to look as if it were scalloped.</p>

C&acirc;bl&eacute; 6 fils D.M.C No. 25, 30, 35 or 40.<sup><a href="#Footnote_A">[A]</a></sup>
Be careful not to stretch the cord, but to hold it in, as
you sew it, as it invariably
shrinks more than the
stuff in the first washing.
Fasten it with hemming
stitches to the edge of the
turning, taking care that
it does not get twisted.</p>

on to the right side of the article they are to be affixed to, quite
close to the edge, then folded over in half, and hemmed down on
the wrong side. Like the cord, the flap must, in the process,
be held in very firmly with the left hand. Though the back-stitching
could be more quickly done
by machine, hand-work is here preferable,
as the holding in cannot be
done by machine.</p>

c/m. long, side by side, turn in
and hem them down, on three sides:
the loop should be so folded as
to form a three-cornered point,

the two edges of the tape together
in the middle with a few cross-stitches,
and stitch the edge of
the hem of the article to the loop,
on the right side.</p>

three threads, bring the working
thread round, from right to left
under the point of the needle, and
draw the needle out through the loop,
so that the little knot comes at the
edge of the slit, and so on to the end,
working from the lower left-hand corner
to the right. Then make a bar of button-hole
stitching across each end, the
knotted edge towards the slit.</p>

gum, and lay a strand of strong thread
along the edge to make your stitches
over; one end of dress button-holes
must be round, the stitches diverging
like rays from the centre, and when
you have worked the second side, thread the needle with the
loose strand, and pull it slightly, to
straighten the edges; then fasten off, and

to tear than a slit whether
it be hemmed or merely
bound. To prevent this,
make a semicircle of button-hole
stitches at the

above that, to connect the

several threads, covered

<p>In under-linen, it often
so happens that two
selvedges meet at the slit,
which renders binding
unnecessary; in that case
take a small square of
stuff, turn in the raw
edges, top-sew it into the
slit on two sides, turn in the other two, fold over on the bias,
and hem them down over the
top-sewing, as shewn in fig. <a href="#fig_36">36</a>.
Such little squares of material,
inserted into a slit or seam, to
prevent its tearing, are called
gussets.</p>

<p><a name="sewing_on_piping" id="sewing_on_piping"></a><b>Sewing on piping</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_37">37</a>).
Piping is a border, consisting of a cord or bobbin, folded into
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>a stripe of material, cut on the cross, and affixed to the edge
of an article to give it more strength and finish. It is a
good substitute for a hem or binding on a
bias edge, which by means of the cord, can be
held in, and prevented from stretching. Cut
your stripes diagonally, across the web of the
stuff, and very even; run them together, lay
the cord or bobbin along the stripe, on the
wrong side, 5 m/m. from the edge, fold the
edge over, and tack the cord lightly in. Then
lay it on the raw edge of the article, with the
cord towards you, and with all the raw edges
turned away from you. Back-stitch the piping
to the edge, keeping close to the cord. Then
turn the article round, fold in the raw outside
edge over the others, and hem it down like
an ordinary hem.</p>
