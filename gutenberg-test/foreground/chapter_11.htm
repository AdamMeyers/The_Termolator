<h2><a name="Macrame" id="Macrame"></a>Macram&eacute;.</h2>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />


<p>Macram&eacute; is an Arabic word, signifying an ornamental fringe
or trimming, which has been adopted as the term for a certain
kind of hand-work, known also as &laquo;knotted fringe&raquo; or
&laquo;Mexican lace&raquo; and produced by the knotting, interweaving
and tying together of threads.</p>

<p>We have given the preference to the Arabic name because
of its less definite meaning, seeing that not only fringe and lace,
but trimmings of all kinds, in the shape of bands and stripes
and headings, can be worked in macram&eacute;.</p>

<p>Until its revival about ten years ago, when it was regarded
by many as a new invention, the art of macram&eacute; making had
for centuries become almost extinct and save here and there
in the convents, was quite unknown.</p>

<p>The multitude of uses to which it can be turned as a trimming,
the infinite variety it admits of and its great durability
and strength, make macram&eacute; well worth a study; the difficulties
that repel many at first sight are only on the surface and
any one who carefully follows the instructions given in the
following pages, will soon overcome them and be able without
pains to copy the charming designs that accompany them,
which remind us of the wooden lattices in the windows of
Eastern houses, doubtless familiar to many of our readers,
under the name of <i>moucharabieh</i>.</p><p><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a></p>

<p><b><a name="Materials" id="Materials"></a>Materials.</b>&mdash;These may be of almost any kind; silk, gold
thread, cord, wool or cotton, can all be employed with good
effect. Almost any of the D.M.C cottons can be used for macram&eacute;;
but the ones especially to be recommended are: Fil &agrave;
dentelle D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and Coton &agrave;
broder D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> for the finer kinds of work, and for the coarser,
Fil &agrave; pointer D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and Ganse
turque D.M.C<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>. The twist in all these is so regular as to
admit of a high degree of perfection being attained with them:
they are moreover very agreeable to the touch, a great recommendation
considering how much they have to be handled by
the worker.</p>

<p><b>Macram&eacute; cushion and other accessories</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_513">513</a> and
<a href="#fig_514">514</a>).&mdash;The only really important requisite for macram&eacute; work
is the cushion, which should be well stuffed, and weighted
with lead (fig. <a href="#fig_513">513</a>). It is convenient to have it made to screw
on to a table like the Swiss tambour frames. There are other
kinds of macram&eacute; cushions but none, in our opinion, as practical
as these because any pattern can be worked upon them
and patterns that have a heading or a border of picots can not
be worked on any others. The pegs at the ends of the cushion
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>are for fixing and winding the long threads upon, which carry
the knots, and which we shall in future call &laquo;cords&raquo;.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="fig_513" id="fig_513"></a>

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 513. Macram&eacute; cushion.</span>
</div>

<p>For making long lengths of macram&eacute; fringe, metal clamps,
with round-headed pegs attached to them top and bottom, to
fasten the cords to, as represented in fig. <a href="#fig_514">514</a>, will be found
far better than a cushion, as any number of threads can be
knotted on to them at a time by pushing them more or less
closely together on the cord.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/529.jpg"  alt="FIG. 514. CLAMPS FOR MACRAM&Eacute; FRINGE." title="" />
<a name="fig_514" id="fig_514"></a><span class="caption smcap">Fig. 514. Clamps for macram&eacute; fringe.</span>
</div>

<p>Besides the cushion and clamps, you will require, some big
glass-headed pins, made expressly for the purpose, a crochet
needle for pulling the threads through the stuff when they have
to be knotted on to an edge, and a French m&egrave;tre or yard
measure to measure the threads with; to these implements
may further be added, scissors and a metal comb and ruler
for cutting and straightening the ends of the threads.</p>

<p>The length of the threads must depend on their substance
and size; that is to say, that a knot will take up more of a
coarse stiff thread than of a fine pliable one, on which account,
to avoid the necessity of preliminary trials, the right length of
thread, for the quality and size of material, is given with each
pattern. If, for any reason, our workers should not follow the
directions given, they must bear in mind that the thicker and
stiffer the material, the more they will have to allow for the
knots and vice versa.</p>

<p><b><a name="Formation_of_the_knots" id="Formation_of_the_knots"></a>Formation of the knots</b>.&mdash;Beginners must be careful, in
macram&eacute; as in tatting, not to move or slacken the cord, or
horizontal thread that carries the knots. The knots made by
the &laquo;knotting-thread&raquo;, as it will be called in future, consist of
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>loops formed over the cord and then tightened. The knotting-thread
and the cord are constantly changing places, as you
work, loops having to be made now with the one and now
with the other.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on the threads</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_515">515</a>).&mdash;Excepting when you
work with the threads of a material obtained by unravelling and
drawing out the cross threads, you
must knot on lengths of thread on to
a cord; cut them double the length
the fringe is to be and fold them in
half, so as to form a loop by means
of which you attach them to the
cord, in the following manner. Put
the loop over the cord from the front and bring it back underneath,
put the ends down through the loop, detail <i>a</i>, and
tighten it, detail <i>b</i>, as shown in the engraving.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Knotting on the threads on to a stuff edge and formation
of a flat double knot</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_516">516</a>).&mdash;Push your crochet needle
through the edge of the stuff from the right to the wrong side
and catch hold of the loop, formed by the folding in half of
the thread that is to be knotted on; pull it out to the right
side, put the ends through, and tighten the loop, detail <i>a</i>. Detail
<i>b</i> shows two double threads, knotted on near to each other in
this way, and the first tying together of the two outer threads
for the flat knot which is formed as follows: you take the two
outer of the four threads hanging down and cross the right hand
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>one under, and the left hand one over the two centre threads.
Whilst doing this, hold the inner ones tightly stretched out on
the 3rd and 4th fingers
of the left hand, detail <i>b</i>.
The manner in which
the two threads are
brought back and tied
together again is shown
in detail <i>c</i>; the drawing
up of the threads completes
the so-called flat
double knot, detail <i>d</i>.
Detail <i>e</i>, of the same figure, shows two flat double knots, side
by side, and the first step towards the formation of a third,
connecting together
the two right threads
of the one with the
two left threads of the
other.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on threads
on to a knotted heading</b>
(fig. <a href="#fig_517">517</a>).&mdash;Make
flat double knots as in
fig. <a href="#fig_516">516</a>, detail <i>d</i>, on a
double cord and then
knot on your threads
on to the loops of the
double knots, putting the loop through from the right side, so
that it may lie at the back. Use double threads so that the
work beneath the heading may not be too open.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on threads on to a picot heading</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_518">518</a>)
&mdash;First, crochet a row of chain stitches, then make flat double

to form picots on the chain, then a second chain of crochet
drawn through the picots on one side, on to which tie triple
or quadruple lengths of thread, as shown in the engraving.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on threads with round picots</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_519">519</a>).&mdash;
Fasten the lengths of thread to the cushion with pins, about
<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>half a c/m. apart, fix the cord to one of the pegs at the left
end of the cushion, hold it tightly extended in a horizontal line
with the right hand. With the
left hand knot the threads that
are pinned down on to the cord,
looping each end twice round
it, upwards from below and then
drawing it through between the
two loops or knots thus formed,
pulling each knot to the left as
you tighten it round the cord.
Make the second row of knots in
the same way, taking care to lay
the second cord as close to the
first as possible that the vertical
threads may not be visible between. One series of knots
forms a bar; there are both horizontal and slanting bars as
will be seen later on.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on threads with a fringe heading</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_520">520</a>).&mdash;Knot
the threads
on with a picot heading,

then cut the picots
through and unravel
and comb out the
threads.</p>

<p>For this way of
knotting on threads,
a very strongly twisted
material is better than
a loose one, as when it is cut and untwisted, it makes a much
richer and fuller fringe.</p>

<p><b>Knotting on with picots and flat double knots</b> (fig. <a href="#fig_521">521</a>).
&mdash;Take two threads, pin them on close together, make a flat

ones, and loop the ends over a cord to make a horizontal
bar of knots.</p><p><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></p>

<p>1st row&mdash;knot on the threads with double round picots,
and one horizontal double bar. The colours should succeed
each other as follows: * 4 blue scallops, 4 &eacute;cru, 5 red, 4 &eacute;cru,
repeat from *.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;begin working from right to left: 1 single chain
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>with 2 single threads, fig. <a href="#fig_545">545</a>, and 7 changes of the threads;
after the 3rd change of the threads, connect the 2nd chain with
the 3rd, the 4th with the 5th. Finish off every 2 chains with
a flat double knot.</p>

<p>Make, over the first blue threads; 1 waved plait, fig. <a href="#fig_531">531</a>
detail <i>b</i>, = over the 14th &eacute;cru thread: 1 bar of double knots,
3 going and 4 returning = over the last 2 red threads: waved
knots, and repeat from * = then lay down 2 fresh cords, to
make a double horizontal bar of knots.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;with the blue threads: 5 large shell knots, fig. <a href="#fig_576">576</a>, 1 triple bar of double knots to the left and right = between
the bars 9 large shell knots = 1 triple bar of double
knots to the right and left and finish with 5 large shell knots,
as above.</p>

<p>With the &eacute;cru threads: 3 flat double knots, 1 double horizontal
bar of knots = over the last &eacute;cru thread: 3 waved
knots with 12 changes of the threads = 1 more double bar of
knots = join the cord to the outside thread of the blue triple
bar. With the red threads: 1 shell knot, figs. <a href="#fig_576">576</a> and <a href="#fig_577">577</a>,
over 12 threads; 1 double bar on both sides of the shell knot
with the outside threads, 1 single chain, consisting of 7 changes
of the threads, made with the outside red threads; join the red
thread and the light one that comes from the double bar together,
on the left.</p>

<p>The light thread is afterwards looped into the blue thread
on the right = 4 collecting knots over 6 red threads on the
right and left, 1 collecting knot over all the red threads and
one, on both sides, over 6 red threads.</p>

<p>After joining the threads on both sides, carry on the single
chain with 3 changes of the threads = over the first red thread
of the left chain, make 1 double horizontal bar with all the
disengaged threads = below the bar, 4 flat double knots = 1
single horizontal bar = 8 double knots, each over a single
thread = 1 double bar of knots.</p>

<p>From this point, continue with the &eacute;cru threads: 1 row of
double knots, 1 double horizontal bar and 1 waved plait;
then join: 2 blue threads and 2 &eacute;cru, and 2 &eacute;cru and 2 red,
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>together, to make flat double knots; the double knots between
remain of one colour.</p>

<p>The bottom border is

we refer our readers to figs.
<a href="#fig_544">544</a> and <a href="#fig_561">561</a> for the working of
it, merely remarking, that the bars are made alternately from

<p>The other single chains are made with
6 and 8 changes of the threads and crossed
under the double knots. The tassels, which
the red threads serve as a foundation to,
are begun by: 1 waved plait with two knots,
then 4 single chains, again a waved plait
and 1 berry composed of knots.</p>

<p>This berry is made over the 8 threads
that come from the chains, with a long auxiliary thread, knotted
as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_590">590</a>.</p>

<p>All patterns that are drawn on checked paper can be copied
in macram&eacute; and even in several colours. For every square, you
count either one single or one double thread, according to the
scale on which the work is to be.</p>

<p>In the case of a single thread, you count one double knot per
square, in that of a double one, 4 double knots, two in the first
and two in the second row.</p>

<p>After knotting the threads together, two and two, and pinning
them to the cushion, see letter <i>a</i>, make 2 single chains with
2 changes of the thread, letters
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, then take a very
long cord, letter <i>d</i>, and knot on
the threads. The cord forms
picots along two sides of the
square; into which you fasten
threads, letters <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, for the
single chain formed, on the two
other sides by the knotting
threads.</p>

<p>The coloured threads for
the flowers are knotted on as
the pattern requires it, taking
the place for the time being, of
those with which the foundation

<p>The top leaves of the iris shaped flower, are worked in two

stalk and the leaves in green, and the little stars, with which
the ground is powdered, in real gold thread.</p><p><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></p>

<p>Knot upon a ring consisting of one thread: * 1 thread of
white Cordonnet, 1 of Coton &agrave; broder colour 309, 1 of colour
358, 1 of colour 309 and repeat three times from *. (The embroidery
cotton is to be taken double.)</p><p><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a></p>

<p>Begin with the light red thread and make: 1 single chain
with 3 changes of the threads, 1 single chain with the dark
red thread with 4 changes of the threads. Add, or rather thread,
8 supplementary threads in succession on to the white thread,
which in fig. <a href="#fig_600">600</a>, comes in the middle of the group of knots,
and over each of these supplementary threads, make 2 double
knots with the light red thread and 2 with the dark.</p>

<p>When all the red threads are knotted over the white ones,
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>make crossed bars with the red threads by themselves, thus
producing a point at the bottom of the leaf.</p>

<p>Then, over the first white thread coming from the right,
knot all the white threads on the left of it and in the last place,
the cord itself, over the 3 red threads.</p>

<p>Make the same series of threads on the left. This is succeeded
by a second bar of white knots, the last thread of which
is left unknotted. Make 4
double knots with the 8
white threads and close the
square by a double bar. Add
a supplementary thread to
the first bar, so that you
may have 10 threads coming
from each side of the
second bar and over these
you knot the red threads,
which form a dark setting
to the leaves.</p>

<p>When this is done on
both sides, make 10 flat
double knots with a supplementary
knot, taking 4
single threads for each knot,
and decreasing the number
of knots successively to 2.
At the point of the inside
square, knot the white threads over the red ones and turn
back the second white thread to serve as a cord to the first of
the outside bars. Join the first thread on the left and the first
on the right, to form a flat knot with them in the middle, the
threads of which are then passed over the red threads; the
last white threads become the cords for the second outer bar.
Make a group of bars with the red threads and cross them 3
times, then finish with a handsome tassel and join the white
threads together all round the square with tassels. In the case
of your wishing to use these squares for making a larger
piece of work, through joining several of them together, you
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>can knot the ends of the threads into short double chains,
finishing off these again with ring knots, fig. <a href="#fig_608">608</a>, and loops;
through these loops, when you come to join on the next square,
the knotting thread is drawn, forming them thus into connecting
picots, like those which you make in tatting.</p>

<p><b>Fringe with corner</b> (figs. <a href="#fig_601">601</a>, <a href="#fig_602">602</a>, <a href="#fig_603">603</a>).&mdash;Macram&eacute;
fringes are not capable of being drawn up, as knitted, crochet,
and netted fringes
are, on the
inside, so as to
turn the corners.
Consequently,
according to the
pattern, a greater
or less number
of supplementary
threads have
to be knotted in
so as to form the
corners.</p>

<p>The working
detail, fig. <a href="#fig_602">602</a>,
shows us how
the 5 first supplementary
threads,
are looped on to
the 4th row of
knots. A group of
crossed bars requires 16 threads, which answer to 4 groups of
little squares, placed between the lozenges. The 6th supplementary
thread is put into the double connecting knot at the
corner, fig. <a href="#fig_603">603</a>, and on this, the bar of knots which runs right
and left is subsequently made. (In order to make it clearer, the
supplementary threads are represented in the engraving in a
darker shade).</p>

<p>On the two middle threads, which are a continuation of
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>the connecting knot, 7 supplementary threads have next to be

<p>In this manner the supplementary threads 7, 10, 11, 12

mounted separately on both sides.</p>

<p>The bars, formed by the knots which are made with the
supplementary threads, must be drawn tight, like any other
double bar. The space left between the cords in the engraving
is intentional, to distinguish the supplementary threads from
the others.</p>

<p>A long, coloured thread is looped on to the topmost thread,
between the two bars, and with this, knots are made over all the
14 threads that come from the bars and run inwards.</p>

<p>In the middle of the square there must be 9 flat double
knots; when these are made, you continue knotting the red
<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>thread from the right and left, down to the bottom point of the
square, and complete the figure by a single bar of knots, made
of the white thread.</p>

<p>The present pattern, which concludes our chapter on macram&eacute;
work, is one of the most difficult of all, requiring great
accuracy in every particular, but more especially, extremely
careful attention to the direction of the cords, that the groups
of double knots and the bars may be drawn up very tightly
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a>together, so as to make the pattern very distinct and give each
figure its proper value.</p>

<p>For each repetition of the subject 16
threads are wanted. You begin the half
stars, on each side of the lozenges, with
the 15th and 16th double thread of the
first figure and make 3 double knots with
3 threads over a 4th thread, fig. <a href="#fig_606">606</a>.</p>

<p>Over 2 cords on the left and 2 on the
right, consequently over 4 threads: 5 buttonhole
knots, with the 4 threads and the
disengaged threads, 1 flat double knot over
each of the 4 threads. This forms a shell
knot, on either side of which, make 3
buttonhole knots over 3 threads.</p>

</div>

<p>For the groups of bars on either side
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>of the shell, take the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th double thread
on the left, and the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th on the right. These
groups are joined by buttonhole knots.</p>

<p>Knot the 4 threads of the left group over the cord on the
right; and over them again the 2 next threads
on the right; knot the 4 threads on the left
over the 4th thread on the right; make 2 buttonhole
knots with the 4th thread over the 3
threads at the bottom and on the side.</p>

<p>Over the 4 threads, that come from the left
and right, make quadruple bars; cross the upper
threads after the second row of bars, make
2 buttonhole bars with the next thread over
the 4th thread, then finish the 3rd and 4th
bar of knots.</p>

<p>To make the olive-shaped group of knots
on both sides, take the threads, that come
out from the shells, as cords. Fig. <a href="#fig_605">605</a> shows
the adding on of the first supplementary
thread, fig. <a href="#fig_606">606</a>, that of 12 more which, knotted
on to the first, form with it, the group
of bars on the diagonal corner line. The knots,
of which the next large shell is composed, are
made with 2 more supplementary threads
and one thread from the preceding figure. Add
on 2 more supplementary threads to the
disengaged threads, which 4 then serve as
cords for the groups of bars, left and right.</p>

<p>The 4th group of bars which forms the
corner of the fringe, is made on the 4 threads
that come from the large shell, on to which
the fourth set of 12 supplementary threads is
knotted.</p>

<p>The pattern ends at the bottom with a
half star, and a double bar; beneath these,
large scallops are added, consisting of 2 half stars, 4 ovals, 1
whole star and 2 ovals.</p>

<p>All the threads that come from the groups are then collected
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a>at the top of the scallops and overcast with strong thread, so
as to form a thick round
cord along the edges of the
scallops, widening towards
the point, as more and more
threads are taken in. At the
point, these threads are
knotted into a big tassel
with another bunch of supplementary
threads added to
them. The other small tassels,
represented in fig. <a href="#fig_604">604</a>, are
made separately and then
fastened on.</p>

<p>The fringe is further
ornamented by large knotted
tassels, introduced between
the scallops, for which, a
large knotted berry, fig. <a href="#fig_590">590</a>,
over 21 cords, has first to be made.</p>

<p>Collect the 21 threads all together, to
begin with; then make: 2 rows of knots
over 12 threads, 1 over 15, 3 over 21, 1
over 15 and 2 over 12; then cut the ends
of the 21 threads to the same length, and
turn them inwards, to fill up the hollow
space inside the berry, stuffing it besides,
if necessary, with wadding to make it perfectly
firm and hard and sewing it together
at the ends.</p>

<p>To this you attach 5 large and 6 small
pendants; the smaller ones are begun with
a Chinese knot, figs. <a href="#fig_607">607</a> and <a href="#fig_609">609</a>, which
terminates in a double chain, formed into a
ring knot.</p>

<p>These ring knots take the place, in macram&eacute;,
of bead drops, in gimp trimmings; when
they are made of a double chain, you cut
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>away 3 threads, when of a single, 1 thread, conceal the ends
carefully inside the knot, make a loop with the 4th or 2nd
thread, fig. <a href="#fig_608">608</a>, and lastly, fasten off all the ends with two or
three invisible stitches.</p>

<p>Into the loop formed by the 4th thread, you hang 3 small
ring knots, made of a single chain, with a loop, top and bottom,
formed of the ends of the thread.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_609">609</a> represents the small pendant, of which six are required
for a tassel; fig. <a href="#fig_610">610</a>, the large one, of which there
should be five. The berry, or head of the tassel, is attached to a
crochet, or knotted cord, of which a description will be found
in the last chapter but one of this work.</p>
