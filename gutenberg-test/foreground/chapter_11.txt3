Macram&eacute; stripe&mdash;Arabic subject.





Macram&eacute;.



Macram&eacute; is an Arabic word, signifying an ornamental fringe
or trimming, which has been adopted as the term for a certain
kind of hand-work, known also as &laquo;knotted fringe&raquo; or
&laquo;Mexican lace&raquo; and produced by the knotting, interweaving
and tying together of threads.

We have given the preference to the Arabic name because
of its less definite meaning, seeing that not only fringe and lace,
but trimmings of all kinds, in the shape of bands and stripes
and headings, can be worked in macram&eacute;.

Until its revival about ten years ago, when it was regarded
by many as a new invention, the art of macram&eacute; making had
for centuries become almost extinct and save here and there
in the convents, was quite unknown.

The multitude of uses to which it can be turned as a trimming,
the infinite variety it admits of and its great durability
and strength, make macram&eacute; well worth a study; the difficulties
that repel many at first sight are only on the surface and
any one who carefully follows the instructions given in the
following pages, will soon overcome them and be able without
pains to copy the charming designs that accompany them,
which remind us of the wooden lattices in the windows of
Eastern houses, doubtless familiar to many of our readers,
under the name of moucharabieh.

Materials.&mdash;These may be of almost any kind; silk, gold
thread, cord, wool or cotton, can all be employed with good
effect. Almost any of the D.M.C cottons can be used for macram&eacute;;
but the ones especially to be recommended are: Fil &agrave;
dentelle D.M.C[A], Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C[A] and Coton &agrave;
broder D.M.C[A] for the finer kinds of work, and for the coarser,
Fil &agrave; pointer D.M.C[A], Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C[A] and Ganse
turque D.M.C[A]. The twist in all these is so regular as to
admit of a high degree of perfection being attained with them:
they are moreover very agreeable to the touch, a great recommendation
considering how much they have to be handled by
the worker.

Macram&eacute; cushion and other accessories (figs. 513 and
514).&mdash;The only really important requisite for macram&eacute; work
is the cushion, which should be well stuffed, and weighted
with lead (fig. 513). It is convenient to have it made to screw
on to a table like the Swiss tambour frames. There are other
kinds of macram&eacute; cushions but none, in our opinion, as practical
as these because any pattern can be worked upon them
and patterns that have a heading or a border of picots can not
be worked on any others. The pegs at the ends of the cushion
are for fixing and winding the long threads upon, which carry
the knots, and which we shall in future call &laquo;cords&raquo;.



Fig. 513. Macram&eacute; cushion.


For making long lengths of macram&eacute; fringe, metal clamps,
with round-headed pegs attached to them top and bottom, to
fasten the cords to, as represented in fig. 514, will be found
far better than a cushion, as any number of threads can be
knotted on to them at a time by pushing them more or less
closely together on the cord.



Fig. 514. Clamps for macram&eacute; fringe.


Besides the cushion and clamps, you will require, some big
glass-headed pins, made expressly for the purpose, a crochet
needle for pulling the threads through the stuff when they have
to be knotted on to an edge, and a French m&egrave;tre or yard
measure to measure the threads with; to these implements
may further be added, scissors and a metal comb and ruler
for cutting and straightening the ends of the threads.

The length of the threads must depend on their substance
and size; that is to say, that a knot will take up more of a
coarse stiff thread than of a fine pliable one, on which account,
to avoid the necessity of preliminary trials, the right length of
thread, for the quality and size of material, is given with each
pattern. If, for any reason, our workers should not follow the
directions given, they must bear in mind that the thicker and
stiffer the material, the more they will have to allow for the
knots and vice versa.

Formation of the knots.&mdash;Beginners must be careful, in
macram&eacute; as in tatting, not to move or slacken the cord, or
horizontal thread that carries the knots. The knots made by
the &laquo;knotting-thread&raquo;, as it will be called in future, consist of
loops formed over the cord and then tightened. The knotting-thread
and the cord are constantly changing places, as you
work, loops having to be made now with the one and now
with the other.

Knotting on the threads (fig. 515).&mdash;Excepting when you
work with the threads of a material obtained by unravelling and
drawing out the cross threads, you
must knot on lengths of thread on to
a cord; cut them double the length
the fringe is to be and fold them in
half, so as to form a loop by means
of which you attach them to the
cord, in the following manner. Put
the loop over the cord from the front and bring it back underneath,
put the ends down through the loop, detail a, and
tighten it, detail b, as shown in the engraving.



Fig. 515. Knotting on the threads.


Knotting on the threads on to a stuff edge and formation
of a flat double knot (fig. 516).&mdash;Push your crochet needle
through the edge of the stuff from the right to the wrong side
and catch hold of the loop, formed by the folding in half of
the thread that is to be knotted on; pull it out to the right
side, put the ends through, and tighten the loop, detail a. Detail
b shows two double threads, knotted on near to each other in
this way, and the first tying together of the two outer threads
for the flat knot which is formed as follows: you take the two
outer of the four threads hanging down and cross the right hand
one under, and the left hand one over the two centre threads.
Whilst doing this, hold the inner ones tightly stretched out on
the 3rd and 4th fingers
of the left hand, detail b.
The manner in which
the two threads are
brought back and tied
together again is shown
in detail c; the drawing
up of the threads completes
the so-called flat
double knot, detail d.
Detail e, of the same figure, shows two flat double knots, side
by side, and the first step towards the formation of a third,
connecting together
the two right threads
of the one with the
two left threads of the
other.



Fig. 516. Knotting on the threads on to a stuff edge and formation
of a flat double knot.


Knotting on threads
on to a knotted heading
(fig. 517).&mdash;Make
flat double knots as in
fig. 516, detail d, on a
double cord and then
knot on your threads
on to the loops of the
double knots, putting the loop through from the right side, so
that it may lie at the back. Use double threads so that the
work beneath the heading may not be too open.



Fig. 517. Knotting on threads onto a knotted heading.


Knotting on threads on to a picot heading (fig. 518)
&mdash;First, crochet a row of chain stitches, then make flat double
knots on the chain, far enough apart for the thread between
to form picots on the chain, then a second chain of crochet
drawn through the picots on one side, on to which tie triple
or quadruple lengths of thread, as shown in the engraving.



Fig. 518. Knotting on threads on to a picot heading.


Knotting on threads with round picots (fig. 519).&mdash;
Fasten the lengths of thread to the cushion with pins, about
half a c/m. apart, fix the cord to one of the pegs at the left
end of the cushion, hold it tightly extended in a horizontal line
with the right hand. With the
left hand knot the threads that
are pinned down on to the cord,
looping each end twice round
it, upwards from below and then
drawing it through between the
two loops or knots thus formed,
pulling each knot to the left as
you tighten it round the cord.
Make the second row of knots in
the same way, taking care to lay
the second cord as close to the
first as possible that the vertical
threads may not be visible between. One series of knots
forms a bar; there are both horizontal and slanting bars as
will be seen later on.



Fig. 519. Knotting on threads with round picots.


Knotting on threads with a fringe heading (fig. 520).&mdash;Knot
the threads
on with a picot heading,
as explained in
the preceding figure,
then cut the picots
through and unravel
and comb out the
threads.



Fig. 520. Knotting on with a fringe heading.


For this way of
knotting on threads,
a very strongly twisted
material is better than
a loose one, as when it is cut and untwisted, it makes a much
richer and fuller fringe.

Knotting on with picots and flat double knots (fig. 521).
&mdash;Take two threads, pin them on close together, make a flat
double knot, fig. 516, tying the outer threads over the inner
ones, and loop the ends over a cord to make a horizontal
bar of knots.



Fig. 521.
Knotting on threads with picots and two
flat double knots.


Knotting on threads with picots and two flat double
knots (figs. 522 and 523).&mdash;Pin the two threads on as before
and make two flat double
knots, one below the other;
detail a shows the first
knot begun, detail b the two
knots completed. Fig. 523
shows the picots secured by
a horizontal bar of knots
beneath them.










Fig. 522. &amp; fig. 523.
knotting on threads with picot and two flat double knots.


Knotting on threads
with scallops (fig. 524).&mdash;The
threads for the scallops
must be cut much longer
than those that are to be
knotted on below
them. The
buttonhole
loops must be
so made that
they turn upwards;
and
there must be
12 of them, all
made with the
left hand thread over the right hand thread, detail a. Then, knot
on two double threads underneath the scallop and besides, make
knots with the threads that come from the scallops, detail b.



Fig. 524. Knotting on threads with scallops.


Knotting on threads with loops (fig. 525).&mdash;Pin on two
threads folded in half, a little distance apart, detail a, and bind
them together
with a flat
double knot.
Pin on more
lengths close
to them, the
inner threads
of which are
held by a "collecting
knot",
as the flat double
knot is called
when it
is made over
more than two threads (see
also fig. 530). The ends of
the threads can then be looped
over one or two cords,
so as to form a single or
double bar of knots, as required.



Fig. 525. Knotting on threads with loops.


Knotting on threads
with triple scallops (fig. 526).&mdash;Knot on three single
threads in succession; first,
the middle one, then the
second, with the knot right
and left and the loop long enough to form the scallop, then
the third in the same manner.



Fig. 526. Knotting on threads with triple scallops.


Knotting on threads for ribbed picots (fig. 527).&mdash;Take
a double thread and make two slanting bars of knots, see
details a and b, then secure them, like the preceding scallops
by a horizontal bar of knots, see detail c.



Fig. 527. Knotting on threads with ribbed picots.


Knotting on threads for a gimp heading (fig. 528).&mdash;This
mode of knotting on forms a broad gimp, consisting of vertical
bars of knots, made over a single cord. On the one side, that
which is afterwards turned downwards, the cord, the ribs are
made on, forms loops, held with pins, into which meshes of
threads can be
knotted when
the gimp is finished,
for making
either a fringe
or a grounding.



Fig. 528. Knotting on threads for a gimp heading.


Patterns in
several colours
may likewise
be knotted into
gimp headings
of this kind.

Flat double
knots with half
knots (fig. 529).&mdash;These
are double
knots followed by a
third knot, or more
correctly speaking,
a half one of the
first flat knots.



Fig. 529. Flat double knots with half knots.


Collecting knots
(fig. 530).&mdash;As explained
in fig. 525,
these are flat double
knots, made over
more than two
threads. The engraving shows, in the first place on the left,
a flat double knot made over two threads, completed, and the
first crossing of the thread for the collecting knot; secondly, the
second crossing of the threads; thirdly how the collecting knot
can, if necessary, be continued over 4 threads, and fourthly,
how the collecting knot should be made to finish with a flat
double knot.



Fig. 530. Collecting knots.


Plaited and waved knots (fig. 531).&mdash;Plaited knots are
formed by a continuous repetition of the first crossing of the
threads for making a flat knot, detail a; waved knots by a
slight twist given to the plaited knots from left to right, detail
b. These plaits of waved knots are secured by joining together
the threads of opposite
meshes, two and two, by a
flat double knot.



Fig. 531. Plaited and waved knots.


Single crossed knots
and double crossed knots
(figs. 532 and 533).&mdash;Two
plain crossings of the
threads, detail a, to begin
with; after which you rapidly
reverse the threads,
turning the knot to the
wrong side, drawing it up
tightly at the same time;
this forms the first knot,
detail b. The second knot, fig. 533, is formed by 3 crossings,
detail a; reverse the threads rapidly, to form the double crossed
knot, detail b. For the following knots tie the threads together,
as for the flat double knot, detail c.





Fig. 532. Single crossed knot.




Fig. 533. Double crossed knot.



Looped picot and knotted picots (figs. 534 and 535).&mdash;Looped
picots are made along a row of knots by setting the
knots, far enough
apart for the loop
between, to form
a picot when the
knots are drawn
up close together.
In fig. 534, the detail
a represents
the picot, in its
first open stage,
detail b the same
picot when it is
finished.



Fig. 534. Looped picot.


Knotted picots,
fig. 535, are
formed after one
or more flat double knots, by a knot made in the outer thread;
to get this knot into the right place, make it on a big pin and
draw it up close to the flat knot before you take out the pin.



Fig. 535. Knotted picot.


These picots are always made on both sides and can be
repeated several times along a row of knots. Detail a shows
the crossing of the threads for the picots, detail b the picots
completed and followed by a flat knot.

Bead knots (fig. 536).&mdash;A bead knot is made by turning
back the threads after a row of flat double knots. Detail a
shows three flat double knots finished, detail b the inner
threads turned back over the flat double knots, detail c the
two knotting threads, brought between the two threads coming
from the left to the right, and detail d the bead knot finished
and followed by a flat double knot.



Fig. 536. Bead knots.


Bars of knots to the right and left (figs. 537, 538,
539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544).&mdash;After knotting on the requisite
number of threads on to a double cord, make two buttonhole
loops with the right thread round the left one, fig. 537,
then knot each thread twice over the second cord, fig. 538.
These knots must be as close together as possible. This done,
begin to make the slanting bars, inclining from left to right,
with 4 threads.





Fig. 537. Buttonhole loop to the right.




Fig. 538. Fastening the threads to the cord.



The first thread on
the left, marked 1 in fig. 540, serves as cord to the
threads 2, 3, 4, which are
looped in succession over
thread 1.





Fig. 539. Bar slanting to the right. The knot open.




Fig. 540. Bar slanting to the right. Thread 2 knotted over thread 1.



Fig. 541 represents
threads 2, 3 and 4, knotted
thread 1 and in the
second bar, thread 2 becoming
in its turn the
cord, and having threads
3, 4 and 1 knotted over
it, whilst it is being held,
tightly stretched in the right hand. The knotting should be
done with the left hand.





Fig. 541. Bar slanting to the right. Threads 3, 4, 1 to be knotted over thread 2.




Fig. 542. Bar slanting to the left.



In fig. 542, which represents a bar inclining from right to
left, threads 3, 2 and 1 are knotted over thread 4; and in fig. 543, in the second row, threads 2, 1, 4 over thread 3. Here,
it has to be the left hand that holds the thread extended from
right to left, whilst the right hand does the knotting.





Fig. 543. Bar slanting to the left.




Fig. 544. Bars joined together.



Fig. 544 explains how the double bars are bound together
by an ordinary double knot.

Single chain (fig. 545).&mdash;This is made with two single
threads, by knotting them alternately over each other, that is,
each in turns serving as cord to the other.

Double chain (fig. 546).&mdash;The double chain is made in
the same manner as the single, only with a double thread.





Fig. 545. Single chain.




Fig. 546. Double chain.



Both the double and single chain are generally used in
macram&eacute; gimps and borders as a means of conducting threads
of different colours, from one part
of a pattern to another, which could
be done in no other way; also, as a
continuation to the Chinese knot,
fig. 607, as described at the end of
this chapter.

Ribbed border (fig. 547).&mdash;Here,
the same cord runs to and
fro; the 4 threads that hang down,
form little ribbed bars running right
and left. To distinguish from the
knotting threads, the thread that
runs to and fro it, is represented in
a darker colour.



Fig. 547. Ribbed border.


Macram&eacute; fringe (figs. 548, 549, 550).&mdash;Entire length of
the threads for No. 8 of Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C: 80 c/m.



Fig. 548. Macram&eacute; fringe.
Materials: Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C Nos. 6 to 16,
Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 5 to 25,
or Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 70.
Colours: Bleu-Indigo 311, Rouge-Turc 321
and white, or Bleu tendre 710, Rouge-Maroquin
3327 and Vert-Fauve 691.

1st row&mdash;knot on the threads, as in fig. 515, and in the
following order: 1 double white thread, 2
double red, 1 double blue and so on.

2nd row&mdash;make a horizontal bar of
knots, see figs. 519, 520 and 521, over a
second cord.

3rd row&mdash;3 buttonhole knots, fig. 524,
each with 2 threads.

4th row&mdash;like the 2nd.

5th row&mdash;make slanting bars of double
knots right and left, counting 6 threads for
each bar, consequently 12 for 2. The 1st
and 12th thread serving as the cords for
the knots. In the 2nd series of knots which
forms the double slanting
bar, make another double
knot over the cord with
the thread that served as
cord in the preceding
row.

When the slanting
bars are finished, bring
them as close together
as possible, tighten the
last thread on the right
and make another double
knot with the left thread;
the position of all the
threads is clearly described
in fig. 549. Then
continue the bars in the
opposite direction, so
that the 2nd thread on
the left is stretched over
the right hand group of
threads, and the 11th
thread on the right over
the left hand group.



Fig. 549. Working detail of fig. 548.




Make 3 rows of double bars and then take always 3 threads
of a left hand group and 3 of a right hand one, tie them loosely
together in a plain knot, put in,
above the knot, a bunch of 8
threads, 15 c/m. long, fig. 550 detail
a, draw up the knot close to the
bars and wind thread of a different
colour several times round it, detail
b, to form the tassel.



Fig. 550. Working detail of fig. 548.


The other bunches of threads
which are hung on between two
bars of knots must be tied on the
same level with the first, but do
not, nevertheless, come into close
contact with the bars.

Insertion or fringe
(figs. 551 and 552).&mdash;Entire
length of the threads
for No. 8 of Coton &agrave; tricoter
D.M.C: 50 c/m., including
the fringe.

Colours: Bleu-indigo
311 and Brun-Chamois
418, or Brun-Rouille
3312 and Bleu-Gris

1st row&mdash;knot on
the threads as in fig. 515.

2nd row&mdash;1 double
horizontal bar of knots,
as in figs. 519 or 520,
over double cords.

3rd row&mdash;Take 8
threads for a group of
bars; 2 light and 2 dark
ones on each side; the
two sets of threads are numbered in fig. 552, a working detail
of fig. 551, from 1 to 4.

Begin by making all the knots over threads 1 and 2 of the
left set, so that threads 3 and 4 on the left will be outside
and threads 1 and 2 inside the group. Make the same knots over
the 3rd and 4th thread on the right, then repeat the left group
again and so on.

Repeat from the beginning, and make 2
double knots over thread 3 on the right, fig. 552, with threads 1 and 2 on the left, then
again 2 knots over thread 4 on the right.
When this series of knots is finished, make:
3 double knots over thread 1 (dark-coloured
in the engraving) with the left thread 2 and
the right threads 1 and 2; make on the left:
3 knots over thread 4 with the right thread
3 and the left threads 2 and 1, and so on.



Fig. 552. Working detail of fig. 551


When this pattern is worked for a gimp
and not a fringe, the threads are made to
end in knots, as explained in fig. 558.

Gimp made with macram&eacute; shuttles
(figs. 553, 554, 555).&mdash;Cut 8 double threads
of the length the gimp is to be.

In order not to have to add on threads in
the middle of the work, or have long ends
hanging down, which are very much in the
way, we recommend the employment of a
new macram&eacute; shuttle, a kind of spool, such
as are used in the making of
pillow lace. These shuttles simplify
the work enormously and
are made hollow so that they
can be mounted and filled on
the spindle of any sewing machine.



Fig. 553. Gimp made with macram&eacute; shuttles.

Materials: Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C Nos. 6 to 16,
Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 1 to 10, Fil &agrave; pointer
D.M.C Nos. 10 to 30, or Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C
Nos. 25 to 50.[A]
Colours: Bleu-Indigo 311 and Brun-Marron 406.[A]



Knot on the threads, as in
fig. 515, and make a single bar
of knots. Then leaving 2 threads
on the right and 2 on the left
disengaged, make 3 flat double
knots with every set of 4 threads
between. Make a slanting bar
of double knots over the 16th
right thread, with the 15th,
14th, 13th, 12th, 11th, 10th
and 9th thread; then make knots with the same threads and
with the 16th over the 15th thread. Make a similar bar on the
left, over the 1st thread, with the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th
and 8th thread.

the return of the cord.
Working detail of
fig. 553.



On both sides, and with the 4 outer threads: 4 flat double
knots, fig. 516, detail
d; 2 more bars on
the right and left, but
in the opposite direction,
and knotting all
the threads even to
the last one, fig. 555.
Take the 4 middle
threads and make 6
flat double knots and then turn the bars of knots inwards; the
return of the cord is indicated as before in fig. 555.

Macram&eacute; borders (figs. 556, 557, 558, 559).&mdash;Length of
the single threads for No. 6 of Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C: 50 c/m.

Knot the threads on for both these borders in the ordinary
way, followed by a single horizontal bar
of knots. For fig. 556, make a triple slanting
bar of knots, with 4 threads, slanting
one from right to left and one from left
to right; then make a single horizontal bar
and add another series of triple bars
slanting the opposite way; complete the
pattern by a vertical bar, lay another cord
and make a horizontal bar upon it on the
wrong side of the work and finish by tying
the threads together, two and two, as
shown in fig. 558, detail a, cut them, detail
b, and push the knot upwards, detail c.

Colours&mdash;For fig. 556: Bleu-Lapis 342 or Bleu-Gentiane
480&mdash;For fig. 557: Rouge-Turc 321 or Rouge-Cerise 3318.[A]




For fig. 557 take 8 threads for a group
of knots. Make all the bars slanting from
right to left first, fig. 559, then take the
5th thread, counting
from left to right,
for the cord, fig. 559
again, and begin the
second series of bars
of knots, slanting
from left to right.
Fasten off the
threads as already
explained in fig. 558.



Fig. 558. Working detail of
figs. 556 and 557.


The same pattern
can also be used as
an insertion: bags
for instance, look
very well made of
alternate stripes of
this insertion and
stripes made of flat knots. The openwork
stripes must be wider than the
close ones.

threads, including the
fringe, for No. 5 of Cordonnet
6 fils D.M.C:
120 c/m.

1st row&mdash;knot on
the threads, as in fig. 520, in the following
order: 4 double blue
threads, 3 single dark
brown, 1 double light
brown, 3 single dark
brown; then again 4
double blue, and so on.

2nd row&mdash;divide the
threads into groups, so
that the brown threads
come in the middle with
4 blue ones on either
side. Begin on the left
= cover the 4th blue
thread, which comes nearest to the first brown one, with flat
double knots, made over the 1st, 2nd and 3rd brown thread
and the light brown one =
cover the 3rd blue thread with
the 4 brown threads and the
4th blue, which served as the
cord in the 1st row of knots =
cover the 2nd blue thread with
the 4 brown and the 4th and
3rd blue = cover the 1st blue
with the 4 brown and the 4th,
3rd and 2nd blue.



Fig. 561. Working detail of fig. 560


In the working detail, fig. 561, the dark lines represent the
blue threads, the light ones, the
brown.

When the quadruple bar, slanting
from left to right, is finished,
make a similar one, from right to
left, then connect the 1st and 16th
thread by a double knot and pass
the first blue thread on the left
over to the right group.

2nd row&mdash;make similar groups,
reversed, so that the brown knots
come next to the last blue ones and
the blue knots again terminate the
groups of bars; the brown threads
will be stretched flat between the
preceding group and the next.

3rd and 5th row&mdash;like the first.

4th row&mdash;like the 2nd.

After the 5th row of groups, take
4 brown threads on either side of
the blue knots, and make them into a double chain, fig. 546,
consisting of 12 knots, and make 6 flat double knots with the
last threads.

Lastly, unite all the threads of one group of bars, and make
them into a handsome tassel by the addition of other threads.

Knot the threads on,
as in fig. 515 and after
finishing the horizontal bar, make from left to right, over the 1st
thread, 1 double knot made with the 2nd and with the 3rd thread.

Then, over the 2nd thread, which has now become the 1st,
make double knots with the 3rd, 1st, 4th and 5th thread; then,
over the 3rd thread, counting now from right to left, which
in the knotting on figured as the 4th: 1 double knot with the
5th and 2nd thread.

Make the same group from right to left, only at the 3rd
change of thread make 5 double knots instead of 2, and let the
last knots count for the new group of bars, turned the opposite
way.

In the middle of two opposing groups of bars, make a flat
double knot with 2 of the right threads and 2 of the left.

When the second horizontal bar is finished, turn the work
round, and go on working on the wrong side, making plain
double knots, as in fig. 571, turned in one row, all from right
to left, and in the next, from left to right.

When you have worked 10 such rows of knots, begin to
make one knot less on either side of a group, so as to form
pointed scallops of knots which you finish off with a plain bar.

5th row&mdash;collecting knots in the centre of the groups, with
the &eacute;cru threads.

6th row&mdash;similar to the 4th.

7th row&mdash;similar to the 5th.

Then take the red threads on the right and left and twist
them, each cluster separately, from left to right between the
thumb and forefinger, as you do in making a cord, then unite
them together, twisting them from left to right. Fasten off the
cord by a knot, beneath which the ends of thread form a little
tassel. Collect all the &eacute;cru threads
together and make them into a heavy
tassel with the aid of supplementary
threads.

Border with shell knots (figs. 574,
575, 576, 577).&mdash;Fill the macram&eacute;
shuttles with the requisite length of
thread. Knot the threads on, as in fig. 520, in the following order; 1 double
thread of colour 471, 6 double threads
of colour 450, 2 of colour 471, 6 of colour
450, 1 of colour 471.

From left to right and over the 1st
thread: 1 double knot with the 2nd
thread; over the 4th thread of colour 450,
and from right to left, double knots with
the 3rd, 2nd and 1st thread of the same
colour = from left to right: 1 double
knot with the 6th thread of colour 450
over the 5th, and with the 3rd thread
over the 2nd = from right to left: 5
double knots over the 8th thread of
colour 450 = from left to right: 1 double

knot over the 5th thread, 1 double knot
over the 1st thread = from right to left:
7 double knots over the 12th thread = from left to right: 3
detached double knots.

Then, from left to right, and subsequently from right to
left = with 6 green threads: 2 double bars slanting over the 2
red threads (see the top of fig. 577); unite the 4 red threads in
the middle and make a shell knot with them, fig. 575, consisting
of 6 flat knots, fig. 576; take 2 threads on the right and 2 on the
left, turn them down to the left and right, and then from the
wrong side to the right, over the threads that come from the
bars and close with a flat knot. On the sides, make double
bars and between each bar, 2 single chain knots.

The threads must be taken
double, counting as one. Knot
them on, as in fig. 524. This
exceedingly effective pattern is a
very simple one to work and can
easily be copied from the engraving
by following, for the bars,
figs. 537 to 544; for the collecting
knots fig. 530, for the large shell knots figs. 575 and 576,
and for the chain of flat double knots, fig. 536 detail a.

The tassels that complete the fringe must depend from
the last collecting knot and hang between the triple bars of
knots and beneath the collecting knot.

Colours: &Eacute;cru, Rouge-Turc 321 and Bleu-Indigo 312.[A]


1st row&mdash;knot on the threads with double round picots,
and one horizontal double bar. The colours should succeed
each other as follows: * 4 blue scallops, 4 &eacute;cru, 5 red, 4 &eacute;cru,
repeat from *.

2nd row&mdash;begin working from right to left: 1 single chain
with 2 single threads, fig. 545, and 7 changes of the threads;
after the 3rd change of the threads, connect the 2nd chain with
the 3rd, the 4th with the 5th. Finish off every 2 chains with
a flat double knot.

Make, over the first blue threads; 1 waved plait, fig. 531
detail b, = over the 14th &eacute;cru thread: 1 bar of double knots,
3 going and 4 returning = over the last 2 red threads: waved
knots, and repeat from * = then lay down 2 fresh cords, to
make a double horizontal bar of knots.

3rd row&mdash;with the blue threads: 5 large shell knots, fig. 576, 1 triple bar of double knots to the left and right = between
the bars 9 large shell knots = 1 triple bar of double
knots to the right and left and finish with 5 large shell knots,
as above.

With the &eacute;cru threads: 3 flat double knots, 1 double horizontal
bar of knots = over the last &eacute;cru thread: 3 waved
knots with 12 changes of the threads = 1 more double bar of
knots = join the cord to the outside thread of the blue triple
bar. With the red threads: 1 shell knot, figs. 576 and 577,
over 12 threads; 1 double bar on both sides of the shell knot
with the outside threads, 1 single chain, consisting of 7 changes
of the threads, made with the outside red threads; join the red
thread and the light one that comes from the double bar together,
on the left.

The light thread is afterwards looped into the blue thread
on the right = 4 collecting knots over 6 red threads on the
right and left, 1 collecting knot over all the red threads and
one, on both sides, over 6 red threads.

After joining the threads on both sides, carry on the single
chain with 3 changes of the threads = over the first red thread
of the left chain, make 1 double horizontal bar with all the
disengaged threads = below the bar, 4 flat double knots = 1
single horizontal bar = 8 double knots, each over a single
thread = 1 double bar of knots.

From this point, continue with the &eacute;cru threads: 1 row of
double knots, 1 double horizontal bar and 1 waved plait;
then join: 2 blue threads and 2 &eacute;cru, and 2 &eacute;cru and 2 red,
together, to make flat double knots; the double knots between
remain of one colour.

The bottom border is
like the top one with the
exception of the picots.

When this pattern is
to be used for an insertion
or a gimp, the threads
should be fastened off, as
indicated in fig. 558.

Macram&eacute; border (figs.
580, 581, 582).&mdash;Wind
the threads on shuttles
and knot them on, as in

Begin with the open
work on either side of the
crossed bars, figs. 581 and
582, with 4 blue threads
and by 4 changes of the
threads outwards and 3 inwards = the
same with 4 light green threads with
3 changes outwards and 2 inwards = then with the dark
green threads, with 2 changes outwards and 3 inwards =
over the 4th dark green thread, 1 double knot with the 1st
dark green thread with the 4th light green one and with the
4 blue.

Over the 3 next, dark green threads, knot the 4 light green
threads and the 4 blue, from right to left, and from left to
right, thus forming altogether 8 bars across the first bar =
then knot the 8 first threads over the last dark green one =
add a crossed bar with 7 changes of the threads outwards and
5 inwards.

Middle group, left side: 1 double knot with the first light
brown thread over the second thread; 3 double knots with the
black threads (the only ones that are to be taken double) and
2 light brown threads over the 1st and 2nd dark brown ones.

In the 2nd bar, knot the 1st dark brown thread, and in
the 3rd, the 4 dark brown ones, over the black thread. On the
right, a similar group, slanting towards the one on the left.

On the left&mdash;over the 1st light brown thread coming from
the right, 1 double knot, made with 2 light and 2 dark brown
threads, and the black one, all coming from the left.

On the right&mdash;over the 1st light brown thread coming from
the left, 1 double knot with 1 light and 2 dark brown threads
and the black one (used double).

On the left&mdash;over the light brown thread coming from the
right, 1 double knot with one light and 2 dark brown threads
and the black one.

On the right&mdash;over the light brown thread, 1 double knot
with 2 dark brown threads and the black one.

On the left&mdash;the same knots as on the right.

On the right&mdash;over the 1 dark brown thread 1 knot with
1 brown thread and the black one.

On the left&mdash;the same knots as on the right.

On the right&mdash;over the 1st dark brown thread, 1 knot with
a brown thread and the black one.

On the left&mdash;the same knots over the last thread.

On the right&mdash;over the last brown thread one knot with
the black one.

On the left&mdash;over the 4 light green threads and the 4 blue
ones, double knots with the 4 brown threads and the black
one = 1 double knot with the
1st light brown thread over
the 2nd, 3 double knots over
the 2nd dark brown thread,
with 2 light threads and 1 dark
brown = 4 double knots with
the 2 light and the 2 dark
brown threads over the black
one; after which you make 5
other bars, taking the last
thread turned inwards for the
cord. Make similar groups,
slanting from right to left,
then, beginning again on the
left, make the knots with the
4 light green threads over the
1st thread of the same colour
running from right to left.

On the right&mdash;knot 3 light
green threads over the 1st
thread coming from the left
and repeat the same group
twice, on both sides.

The third bar forms, at the
same time, the first scallop of
a triple crossed bar, which has
also to be made on the right.

The two crossed bars finish
with a triple group of bars;
the last bar of which, on the
right, consists of only one
double knot.

There remain to be made,
on both sides, crossed bars
with three whole scallops inside,
one outside, and one half
one, top and bottom.

Knot all the other threads over the 4 blue and the 4 light
green ones = in the middle, knot the right and the left threads,
alternately, till the black threads meet at the point.

Turn the group of bars, edged with blue and light green,
inwards, and finish it off by a crossed bar, with 3 scallops
inside.

This pattern is so easy that
we refer our readers to figs.
544 and 561 for the working of
it, merely remarking, that the bars are made alternately from
right to left, and from left to right,
and that 3 threads are knotted over
the cord that runs from the left
and 4, over the one from the right.

This fringe will always be
found most effective in appearance
if it be made in four shades of
one colour, knotted on in succession.

see fig. 525; for the plain bars,

point is where the threads cross
each other inside the bars and
form a check and by carefully
following the course of the knots
in fig. 587, that will be
easily overcome.

one, in which you cross the
threads without knotting
them.

Beginning on the left&mdash;over the 2nd and 3rd thread: 2
buttonhole knots, 1 picot, 2 button hole knots = over the 1st,
2nd and 3rd thread: 1 double knot with each of the 3 next
threads = over the 6th and 7th with the 5th thread: 4 buttonhole
knots with 1 picot after the 2nd knot.

With each of the 4 next threads, that is the 8th, 9th, 10th
and 11th: 1 flat double knot followed by: 1 bar of double
knots over the 12th thread as
the cord, made with the 11th,
10th and 9th thread = add
1 bar with the 11th thread as
the cord, and the 7 next ones
as the knotting threads = add
1 bar with the 10th thread
as the cord, and the 7 next
ones as the knotting threads.
Leave 3 threads free on the
right = with the 8 threads
on the left: 1 bar over the
thread before these 3 threads
= leave 3 free again on the
right = 1 quintuple bar with
the remaining threads.

* 1 flat double knot with
the 15th, 16th and 17th thread
= with the 20th thread, over
the 19th, 18th and 17th
thread: 4 buttonhole knots
with 1 picot after 2 knots =
knot 4 threads over the 13th
thread and from left to right = from left to right, 2 bars with
all the threads **.

Over the 2 threads on the left and with the 3rd thread: 4
buttonhole knots and 1 picot = with the 6 threads from the
left: 2 bars consisting of buttonhole knots and picots = a 3rd
bar with 6 double knots = join it to the last bar.

Leave 2 threads of the bar of buttonhole knots free =
with the outer thread make: 4 buttonhole knots and 1 picot
over the 2nd thread and the cord
of the bar.

Repeat from * to ** along the
bar, also from right to left.

Left group&mdash;knot the 3 last
threads over the 4th thread and
from left to right.

Right group&mdash;make, from right
to left, 1 bar consisting of 6 double
knots, over the 4th thread counting
from right to left. After these last changes
of the threads no difficulty will be found in
copying the rest of the pattern.

Double fringe (figs. 589, 590, 591, 592).&mdash;Entire
length of the threads for No. 10 of
Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C: 100 c/m., and entire
length for No. 16 of Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C:
40 c/m. Knot on, as in fig. 515, 1 thread of
Cordonnet, 4 of Coton &agrave; broder (these are to
be taken double) 2 of Cordonnet, 4 of Coton
&agrave; broder, and so on.



Fig. 589. Double fringe.
Materials: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C

Colours: White for the Cordonnet,
Rouge-Grenat 335 for the Coton
&agrave; broder.


In the second horizontal bar, you only use the red threads
of Coton &agrave; broder for knotting, not the white Cordonnet ones.
To supply their place, knot on two threads of red Coton &agrave;
broder under the white threads.

With the red threads (4 count as one) make 3 rows of collecting
knots, followed
by a single horizontal
bar. Divide the white
threads into twos and
make single chains
with them, the whole
length of the fringe;
the thread must be
changed 8 times for
each chain; then pass
the right chain under
the left one and join
them by a flat double
knot.

You then, with the
threads turned outwards, right and left,
make the single chain with 5 changes of
the threads and join them together again
by a flat knot.

The other single chains are made with
6 and 8 changes of the threads and crossed
under the double knots. The tassels, which
the red threads serve as a foundation to,
are begun by: 1 waved plait with two knots,
then 4 single chains, again a waved plait
and 1 berry composed of knots.

This berry is made over the 8 threads
that come from the chains, with a long auxiliary thread, knotted
as shown in fig. 590.



Fig. 590. Knotted berry for fig. 589.


Large shell knots, as described in figs. 591 and 592 may be
substituted in the place of the berry, fig. 590.

Macram&eacute; border (fig. 593).&mdash;Fill 24 shuttles, knotted
together, that is, 2 and 2, and knot on 3 green threads, 6 gold
and 3 green. The changing of the threads and the course of the
knots can be so easily copied from the pattern that a description
in detail is not necessary, it is sufficient to observe that all the
dark parts in the engraving should be worked in green and
the light ones in gold.

Beaded ground (fig. 594).&mdash;Knot on 4 threads for every
group of knots, and secure them by a knot and a picot, as shown
in the engraving. Work the groups of knots, as indicated in
fig. 568, and after each group is finished, thread a gold bead on
to every 2 threads. Our model is worked in &eacute;cru thread and
gold beads; the latter go very well with any colour and especially
with the more subdued shades of green, such as the Vert-Mousse,
Vert Bouteille and Gris-Tilleul of the D.M.C colour card.

Square of mosaic macram&eacute; (figs. 595 and 596).&mdash;This
little pattern illustrates the way in which tapestry and cross-stitch
patterns can be utilised for macram&eacute;.



Fig. 595. Square of mosaic macram&eacute;.
Materials: Fil &agrave; pointer D.M.C No. 30, Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 16
and Or fin D.M.C pour la broderie No. 20[A]
Colours: Rouge-Cardinal 346, Rouge-Grenat 326 and 309, Bleu-Indigo 312
and 334, Gris-Tilleul 391 and 393[A]

All patterns that are drawn on checked paper can be copied
in macram&eacute; and even in several colours. For every square, you
count either one single or one double thread, according to the
scale on which the work is to be.

In the case of a single thread, you count one double knot per
square, in that of a double one, 4 double knots, two in the first
and two in the second row.

After knotting the threads together, two and two, and pinning
them to the cushion, see letter a, make 2 single chains with
2 changes of the thread, letters
b and c, then take a very
long cord, letter d, and knot on
the threads. The cord forms
picots along two sides of the
square; into which you fasten
threads, letters e and f, for the
single chain formed, on the two
other sides by the knotting
threads.



Fig. 596. Working detail of fig. 595.


The coloured threads for
the flowers are knotted on as
the pattern requires it, taking
the place for the time being, of
those with which the foundation
is made, which are left
hanging on the wrong side
until they are wanted again.

The top leaves of the iris shaped flower, are worked in two
shades of blue; the bottom ones, in three shades of red, the
stalk and the leaves in green, and the little stars, with which
the ground is powdered, in real gold thread.

When the ground is finished, you make the same openwork
border at the sides and along the bottom, as at the top and
finish off with very full tassels, hung on over 3 double threads
and made of all the colours used in the square, tied up with
gold thread, fig. 596 letter g.

Fringe with three rows of tassels (fig. 597).&mdash;As this
kind of fringe is chiefly used for trimming carpets, curtains
and furniture, it is best to make it in the coarsest numbers of
the materials indicated at the foot of the engraving.

The pattern is so simple in its construction that it is sufficient
to refer our readers to fig. 528, for the knotting on of
the threads and to fig. 531, for the waved plait.

The little tassels between the knots, are made separately
from the rest of the work and fastened on by the thread with
which you sew them together at the top.

Macram&eacute; ground (fig. 598).&mdash;The work represented in
the engraving was made for a purse and copied from a beautiful
piece of Arabian stuff. Ganse turque D.M.C was used for
the light background
and
Coton &agrave; broder
D.M.C for
the design. It
is very easy to
copy this pattern
from the
illustration by
paying scrupulous
attention
to the
number of
knots; we do
not therefore
enter into any
detailed description
of the
same, merely
referring the
worker to figs. 528 and 596
and the accompanying
directions, for the adding on and the taking off of threads.

Macram&eacute; square (figs. 599 and 600).&mdash;Length of the single
threads of both kinds: 200 c/m.



Fig. 599. Macram&eacute; square.
Materials: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C No. 15 and Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 16
or Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C No. 25 and Coton &agrave; broder D.M.C No. 30.[A]
Colours: White, Rouge-Grenat 309 and 358, or Gris-Lin 716
and Rouge-Maroquin 3327 and 3329.[A]


Knot upon a ring consisting of one thread: * 1 thread of
white Cordonnet, 1 of Coton &agrave; broder colour 309, 1 of colour
358, 1 of colour 309 and repeat three times from *. (The embroidery
cotton is to be taken double.)

Begin with the light red thread and make: 1 single chain
with 3 changes of the threads, 1 single chain with the dark
red thread with 4 changes of the threads. Add, or rather thread,
8 supplementary threads in succession on to the white thread,
which in fig. 600, comes in the middle of the group of knots,
and over each of these supplementary threads, make 2 double
knots with the light red thread and 2 with the dark.

When all the red threads are knotted over the white ones,
make crossed bars with the red threads by themselves, thus
producing a point at the bottom of the leaf.

Then, over the first white thread coming from the right,
knot all the white threads on the left of it and in the last place,
the cord itself, over the 3 red threads.

Make the same series of threads on the left. This is succeeded
by a second bar of white knots, the last thread of which
is left unknotted. Make 4
double knots with the 8
white threads and close the
square by a double bar. Add
a supplementary thread to
the first bar, so that you
may have 10 threads coming
from each side of the
second bar and over these
you knot the red threads,
which form a dark setting
to the leaves.



Fig. 600.
Gradual increase of the threads.
Working detail of fig. 599.


When this is done on
both sides, make 10 flat
double knots with a supplementary
knot, taking 4
single threads for each knot,
and decreasing the number
of knots successively to 2.
At the point of the inside
square, knot the white threads over the red ones and turn
back the second white thread to serve as a cord to the first of
the outside bars. Join the first thread on the left and the first
on the right, to form a flat knot with them in the middle, the
threads of which are then passed over the red threads; the
last white threads become the cords for the second outer bar.
Make a group of bars with the red threads and cross them 3
times, then finish with a handsome tassel and join the white
threads together all round the square with tassels. In the case
of your wishing to use these squares for making a larger
piece of work, through joining several of them together, you
can knot the ends of the threads into short double chains,
finishing off these again with ring knots, fig. 608, and loops;
through these loops, when you come to join on the next square,
the knotting thread is drawn, forming them thus into connecting
picots, like those which you make in tatting.

Fringe with corner (figs. 601, 602, 603).&mdash;Macram&eacute;
fringes are not capable of being drawn up, as knitted, crochet,
and netted fringes
are, on the
inside, so as to
turn the corners.
Consequently,
according to the
pattern, a greater
or less number
of supplementary
threads have
to be knotted in
so as to form the
corners.



Fig. 601. Fringe with corner.
Materials: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 10 to 30 or
Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50.[A]
Colours: White and Rouge-Cardinal 348.[A]


The working
detail, fig. 602,
shows us how
the 5 first supplementary
threads,
are looped on to
the 4th row of
knots. A group of
crossed bars requires 16 threads, which answer to 4 groups of
little squares, placed between the lozenges. The 6th supplementary
thread is put into the double connecting knot at the
corner, fig. 603, and on this, the bar of knots which runs right
and left is subsequently made. (In order to make it clearer, the
supplementary threads are represented in the engraving in a
darker shade).



Fig. 602. Addition of the first supplementary threads.
Working detail of fig. 601.


On the two middle threads, which are a continuation of
the connecting knot, 7 supplementary threads have next to be
knotted, thread 7 singly, threads 8 and 9 together, threads 10,
11, 12 and 13, all singly.



Fig. 603. Addition of the second supplementary threads.
Working detail of fig. 601.


In this manner the supplementary threads 7, 10, 11, 12
and 13 connect the two cords, whilst threads 8 and 9 only, are
mounted separately on both sides.

The bars, formed by the knots which are made with the
supplementary threads, must be drawn tight, like any other
double bar. The space left between the cords in the engraving
is intentional, to distinguish the supplementary threads from
the others.

A long, coloured thread is looped on to the topmost thread,
between the two bars, and with this, knots are made over all the
14 threads that come from the bars and run inwards.

In the middle of the square there must be 9 flat double
knots; when these are made, you continue knotting the red
thread from the right and left, down to the bottom point of the
square, and complete the figure by a single bar of knots, made
of the white thread.

Knotted tassels, hanging from the points of the scallops,
and others ornamented with flat double knots made of 10
threads, suspended between the scallops, form the outside
finish to this fringe.

Fringe with pointed scallops and large tassels (figs. 604,
605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610).&mdash;Entire length of the threads

The present pattern, which concludes our chapter on macram&eacute;
work, is one of the most difficult of all, requiring great
accuracy in every particular, but more especially, extremely
careful attention to the direction of the cords, that the groups
of double knots and the bars may be drawn up very tightly
together, so as to make the pattern very distinct and give each
figure its proper value.



Fig. 605. Addition of the first supplementary threads.
Working detail of fig. 604.


For each repetition of the subject 16
threads are wanted. You begin the half
stars, on each side of the lozenges, with
the 15th and 16th double thread of the
first figure and make 3 double knots with
3 threads over a 4th thread, fig. 606.

Over 2 cords on the left and 2 on the
right, consequently over 4 threads: 5 buttonhole
knots, with the 4 threads and the
disengaged threads, 1 flat double knot over
each of the 4 threads. This forms a shell
knot, on either side of which, make 3
buttonhole knots over 3 threads.



Fig. 606. Addition of the other supplementary threads.
Working detail of fig. 604.


For the groups of bars on either side
of the shell, take the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th double thread
on the left, and the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th on the right. These
groups are joined by buttonhole knots.

Knot the 4 threads of the left group over the cord on the
right; and over them again the 2 next threads
on the right; knot the 4 threads on the left
over the 4th thread on the right; make 2 buttonhole
knots with the 4th thread over the 3
threads at the bottom and on the side.

Over the 4 threads, that come from the left
and right, make quadruple bars; cross the upper
threads after the second row of bars, make
2 buttonhole bars with the next thread over
the 4th thread, then finish the 3rd and 4th
bar of knots.

To make the olive-shaped group of knots
on both sides, take the threads, that come
out from the shells, as cords. Fig. 605 shows
the adding on of the first supplementary
thread, fig. 606, that of 12 more which, knotted
on to the first, form with it, the group
of bars on the diagonal corner line. The knots,
of which the next large shell is composed, are
made with 2 more supplementary threads
and one thread from the preceding figure. Add
on 2 more supplementary threads to the
disengaged threads, which 4 then serve as
cords for the groups of bars, left and right.

The 4th group of bars which forms the
corner of the fringe, is made on the 4 threads
that come from the large shell, on to which
the fourth set of 12 supplementary threads is
knotted.

The pattern ends at the bottom with a
half star, and a double bar; beneath these,
large scallops are added, consisting of 2 half stars, 4 ovals, 1
whole star and 2 ovals.

All the threads that come from the groups are then collected
at the top of the scallops and overcast with strong thread, so
as to form a thick round
cord along the edges of the
scallops, widening towards
the point, as more and more
threads are taken in. At the
point, these threads are
knotted into a big tassel
with another bunch of supplementary
threads added to
them. The other small tassels,
represented in fig. 604, are
made separately and then
fastened on.

The fringe is further
ornamented by large knotted
tassels, introduced between
the scallops, for which, a
large knotted berry, fig. 590,
over 21 cords, has first to be made.

Collect the 21 threads all together, to
begin with; then make: 2 rows of knots
over 12 threads, 1 over 15, 3 over 21, 1
over 15 and 2 over 12; then cut the ends
of the 21 threads to the same length, and
turn them inwards, to fill up the hollow
space inside the berry, stuffing it besides,
if necessary, with wadding to make it perfectly
firm and hard and sewing it together
at the ends.

To this you attach 5 large and 6 small
pendants; the smaller ones are begun with
a Chinese knot, figs. 607 and 609, which
terminates in a double chain, formed into a
ring knot.





Fig. 607. Chinese knot and double chain for a ring knot.




Fig. 608. Ring knot formed of a single chain.



These ring knots take the place, in macram&eacute;,
of bead drops, in gimp trimmings; when
they are made of a double chain, you cut
away 3 threads, when of a single, 1 thread, conceal the ends
carefully inside the knot, make a loop with the 4th or 2nd
thread, fig. 608, and lastly, fasten off all the ends with two or
three invisible stitches.

Into the loop formed by the 4th thread, you hang 3 small
ring knots, made of a single chain, with a loop, top and bottom,
formed of the ends of the thread.

Fig. 609 represents the small pendant, of which six are required
for a tassel; fig. 610, the large one, of which there
should be five. The berry, or head of the tassel, is attached to a
crochet, or knotted cord, of which a description will be found
in the last chapter but one of this work.
