Tatted insertion.&mdash;Double knots, single picots and josephine picots.



Tatting.



On account of a similarity in their construction, a chapter
on tatting seems to form a natural sequence to the one on
crochet and is in some ways a preparation for that on macram&eacute;
which succeeds it.

The English name of tatting is said to be derived from
&laquo;tatters&raquo; and to denote the frail disconnected character of the
fabric. By the Italians it was formerly called &laquo;occhi&raquo;, whilst
in the East it still bears the name of &laquo;makouk&raquo;, from the
shuttle used in making it.

In the eighteenth century, when tatting was in great vogue,
much larger shuttles than our present ones were used, because of
the voluminous materials they had to carry, silk cord being one.

Shuttles.&mdash;The tatting shuttle consists of two oval blades
of either bone, ivory, mother of pearl or tortoise-shell, pointed
at both ends, and joined together in the middle. A good shuttle
contributes materially to the rapid and perfect execution of the
work and attention should be paid in its selection to the following
particulars: that it be not more than 7 c/m. long and
2 or 3 c/m. wide: that the two ends be close enough to
prevent the thread from protruding; this is more especially
important in tatting with two shuttles and lastly, that the centre
piece that joins the two oval blades together should have a
hole bored in it, large enough for the thread to pass through.

In filling the shuttle, be careful not to wind on too much
thread at once, or the blades will gape open at the ends and the
thread get soiled by constant contact with the worker's hands.

Materials.&mdash;A strongly twisted thread such as Fil d'Alsace
D.M.C, Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C,
is best for tatting. We particularly recommend Fil d'Alsace,
as forming the best shaped knots and picots. A soft material
such as Coton &agrave; tricoter D.M.C, can also be used where it
suits the purpose better.

First position of the hands (fig. 486).&mdash;The construction
of the knots or stitches, appears at first sight to present great
difficulties but will be easily mastered by attention to the
indications here given. One thing, to be constantly borne in
mind is, that when the right hand has passed the shuttle
through the loop, it must stop with a sudden jerk and hold
the thread tightly extended until the left hand has drawn up
the knot. After filling the shuttle, take the end of the thread
between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, and the
shuttle in the right, pass the thread over the third and fourth
fingers of the left hand, bring it back towards the thumb and
cross the two threads under the fingers, as indicated in fig. 486. Pass the thread that comes from the shuttle round the
little finger of the right hand, and give the shuttle the direction
shown in the engraving.



Fig. 486. First position of the hands.


Second and third position of the hands (figs. 487 and
488).&mdash;Make the shuttle pass between the first and third fingers,
in the direction indicated by the arrow in fig. 487, and bring
it out behind the loop.



Fig. 487. Second position of the hands.


Here the first difficulties for beginners arise and until they
have sufficiently mastered the movements of both hands not
to confuse them, we advise them to pay careful attention to
the following instructions. As soon as you have put the shuttle
through the loop, place
the right hand on the
table with the thread
tightly extended, leaving
the left hand perfectly
passive.



Fig. 488. Third position of the hands.


Then, raising the
third and fourth fingers
of the left hand with
the loop upon them,
pull up the loop,
stretching the thread
tightly in so doing by
extending the fingers.
By this movement
a knot is
formed, the
first part of the
&laquo;double knot&raquo;,
which is the
most common
one in tatting.

Remember
that the right
hand must be
kept perfectly
still as long as
the left is in motion and that the knot must be formed of the
loop thread that is in the left hand.

The right hand, or shuttle thread, must always be free to
run through the knots; if it were itself formed into knots it
would not have the free play, needed for loosening and tightening
the loop on the left hand, as required.

Fourth position of the hands (fig. 489).&mdash;The second
part of a knot is formed by the following movements: pass the
shuttle, as indicated in fig. 489, from left to right, between the
first and third fingers through the extended loop; the right
hand seizes the shuttle in front of the empty loop and extends
the thread; the left hand pulls up this second part of the knot
as it did the first.



Fig. 489. Fourth position of the hands.


Single or half knots. Josephine picots (figs. 490 and 491).&mdash;The
Josephine picot or purl, as it is also called in tatting,
consists of a series of single or half knots formed of the first
knot only. These picots may be made of 4 or 5 knots, as in
fig. 490, or of 10 or 12 knots, as in fig. 491.





Fig. 490. Single or half knots.
Small josephine picot.




Fig. 491. Single or half knots.
Large josephine picot.



Fifth position of the hands (fig. 492).&mdash;When the second
knot forming the double knot has been made, the two hands
resume the position shown in fig. 487. Fig. 492 reproduces the
same and shows us a few finished knots as well.



Fig. 492. Fifth position of the hands.


Position of the hands for making a picot (fig. 493).&mdash;Picots
are introduced into tatting patterns as they are into
knitting and crochet. They also serve to connect the different
parts of a pattern together and render a great many pretty
combinations feasible.



Fig. 493. Position of the hands for making a picot.


Open and close picot (figs. 494 and 495).&mdash;These are
formed of single knots, leaving a loop on the extended thread,
as shown in fig. 494, and a short length of thread between the
knots; finish the second half knot and when you have pulled
it up, join it to the preceding knot. In this manner the picot
represented in fig. 495 is formed quite naturally.





Fig. 494. Open picot.




Fig. 495. Close picot.



In every kind of tatting the knot that comes after the picot
is independent of the loop.

Thus if the directions say: 2 knots, 1 picot, 3 knots, 1 picot,
2 knots, etc., you must count the knot that served to form the
loop and not make: 2 knots, 1 picot, 4 knots, etc. To join the
different rings, ovals, etc., together by means of picots, take up
the thread that runs over the left hand with a crochet needle,
inserting it into the picot downwards from above, draw the
thread through and pull it up like any other knot.

Tatting with two shuttles (fig. 496).&mdash;Two shuttles are
used in tatting when the little rings are not to be connected
together at the bottom by a thread, when you want to hide the
passage of the thread to another group of knots and when
threads of several colours are used.



Fig. 496. Tatting with two shuttles.


When you work with two shuttles, tie the two threads together.
Pass one thread over the third finger of the left hand,
wind it twice round the fourth finger and leave the shuttle
hanging down.

Pass the second shuttle into the right hand and make the
same movements with it as you do in working with one shuttle
only.

Detached scallops (fig. 497).&mdash;Make 12 double knots with
one shuttle, then tighten the thread so as to draw them together
into a half ring; the next knot
must touch the last knot of
the scallop before it.

Leave sufficient length of
thread before beginning the
next ring, for the rings not to overlap each other = make 4
double, draw the left hand thread through the 5th picot of the
preceding ring and repeat from *.

Tatted insertion (fig. 500).&mdash;Make with one shuttle a
ring like the ones in fig. 499, then leaving a length of, from 5
to 10 m/m. of thread, make a
second ring = turn the work
= leave the same length of
thread again, begin a third
ring which you join after the
4th double, to the 5th picot
of the 1st ring = turn the
work after each ring is made,
so that all the upper rings
represent the right side of
the work and all the lower
ones the wrong.

Tatted insertion (fig. 501).&mdash;To be worked with
two shuttles. Begin with one
thread and one shuttle and
make a ring, as in figs. 499
and 500; and a second close
to it; then pass the thread
over the left hand, take the
second shuttle in the right
hand and make 6 double on
the 2nd thread, after which
you again make a ring above
and one below with one
shuttle only.

shuttle: 1 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot,
2 double, 1 picot twice as long as the others, 2 double, 1 picot,
2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 long picot, 1
double = close the ring = fasten off the two threads on the
wrong side with two or three stitches.

Materials&mdash;For the tatting: Fil d&#39;Alsace
D.M.C in balls No. 30.
For the crochet: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C
No. 60.


After the first knot join the next ring to the preceding
one by the long picot, and work the remainder as has been
already described.

When you have a sufficient number of rings, pick up the
picots by crochet trebles with 3 chain stitches between them. On
this first row, crochet a second, consisting of: 2 chain, 1 picot,
2 chain, 1 single in the treble of the 1st row. To finish the bottom
part of the work, make 1 plain in the 1st picot, 3 chain; 1
plain in the 2nd picot, 3 chain, 1 plain in the 3rd picot, 1
chain, 1 plain in the 1st picot of the next ring.

One row of single crochet serves as a footing to the edging.

Tatted edging in three rows (fig. 503).&mdash;Worked with
two shuttles. The first row is
worked like fig. 495, with one
shuttle. The second and third
are worked with two.

Tatted edging in three rows.
Materials: Fil d&#39;Alsace D.M.C in balls
Nos. 30 to 70, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C
Nos. 20 to 60.


Fasten the thread of the
right hand shuttle into the first
picot; then work on this thread
the same number of double
knots and picots as in the 1st
row and join each half ring to
the picot of the row before. In
the 3rd row, insert 3 picots between
the 8 double knots of
the row above. Here the Josephine
picot may be substituted
for the plain picot.

Tatted edging (fig. 504).&mdash;Worked
with two shuttles and
two colours. After making a
string of rings like those in fig. 502, with Fil d'Alsace D.M.C
No. 30 &eacute;cru, fasten the blue and
unbleached threads of the respective
shuttles to the middle picot. Holding the light thread
in the right hand, and the dark one laid over the left hand,
work: 3 double, 1 picot, 3 double = then put the right hand
thread separately through the 2 picots of the rings and continue
to make: 3 double, 1 picot, 3 double.

Colours: &Eacute;cru and Bleu-Indigo 334, or
Jaune d&#39;Ocre 667 and Rouge-Cornouille
450, Gris-Tilleul 331 and Brun-Caroubier
356.


The next row also is made with two shuttles. Hold the light
thread in the right hand; with the dark thread, laid across
the left hand, make: * 4 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2
double = turn the work = with the right hand shuttle make:
6 double, put the thread through the little picot formed above
the middle picot of the rings, 6 double, close the ring =
turn the work = make with two shuttles: 2 double, 1 picot,
2 double, 1 picot, 4 double, put the light thread through the
2 blue picots and repeat from *. The first row of crochet for
the footing consists of chain and plain stitches only, the
second, of chain stitches and trebles.

Medallion (fig. 505).&mdash;Take two colours of thread and fill
two shuttles with the light colour
and two with the dark. Make with
one shuttle: 24 double and 12 picots,
6 of them short and 6 long; close
the ring, break off the thread and
fasten off the ends by a stitch or
two on the wrong side.&mdash;For the
next 4 rows take two shuttles.



Fig. 505. Medallion.
Materials: Fil d&#39;Alsace D.M.C in
balls Nos. 30 to 50.[A]
Colours: White and Rouge-G&eacute;ranium
352, or &eacute;cru and Vert-Mousse
471, Bleu p&acirc;le 668 and Jaune d'Or 676.


1st row&mdash;with the shuttles
containing the light colour = fasten
the ends on to a short picot and
make: * 3 double, 1 short picot, 2
double, 1 long picot, 2 double, 1
long picot, 2 double, 1 long picot,
2 double, 1 short picot, 3 double;
pass the right hand thread through
one of the short picots of the first ring, repeat the series 5
times from *.

When you reach the 6th half ring, instead of making the
second picot, put the left hand thread through the short
picot of the first half ring, then complete the last double
knots, cut the threads off, pass them through the picot of
the ring and fasten them off on the wrong side.

2nd row&mdash;with the shuttles filled with the light colour =
fasten the ends on to a long picot, then make: * 4 double, 1
picot, 4 double, pass the right hand thread through the picot
of the first row and repeat the series 17 times from *.

3rd row&mdash;with the shuttles filled with the dark colour =
fasten the ends on to one of the picots of the last row and
make: * 4 double, pass the right hand thread through the picot
of the 2nd row, make a long picot, 4 double and repeat this
series all round the medallion, until you have 18 scallops.

4th row&mdash;with the shuttles filled with the dark colour =
* 2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2
double, pass the right hand thread, from the wrong side, through
the picot of the 2nd row and begin again from *.

Insertion of tatting and crochet (fig. 506).&mdash;Fill two
shuttles, one with a light colour, say, Bleu de France 344,
the other with a darker,
such as Jaune-Rouille 365,
and two numbers coarser
than the thread you intend
to use for the crochet. Begin
with the dark colour
and make: * 4 double, 1
picot, 8 double, 1 picot, 4
double, close the ring.
With both shuttles, the
light colour in the left
hand: 4 double, 1 picot,
2 double, 1 picot, 2 double,
1 picot, 4 double, put the
right hand thread through
the picot of the first circle;
then add: 4 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot, 2 double, 1 picot,
4 double.



Fig. 506. Insertion of tatting and crochet.
Materials: Fil d&#39;Alsace D.M.C in balls Nos. 30
to 70, or Fil &agrave; dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50.
Colours: Bleu de France 344 and
Jaune-Rouille 365.


With the shuttle, filled with the dark colour: 5 double,
pass the thread through the picot of the first ring, make 8
double, 1 picot, 5 double, close the ring. Then, leaving a
short length of thread between, make: 4 double, put the
thread through the picot of the preceding ring, 8 double, 1
picot, 4 double, close the ring **; then repeat from * to **.

When you have thus made two equal lengths, join them together
with crochet, using a thread two numbers finer than the
tatting thread; if the latter for instance was Fil d'Alsace No. 30,
you would take No. 50 of the same material for the crochet&mdash;1
plain in the 1st picot, 5 chain, 1 plain in the middle picot,
5 chain, 1 plain in the 3rd and 1st picot = then, over 5
chain: 1 sextuple cluster stitch (fig. 426), 5 chain.

In the row on the opposite side of the tatting, take out
the crochet needle
at the 3rd chain
stitch and put it in
from beneath into
the corresponding
stitch of the opposite
row; in this
manner join the
two insertions together
so as to
complete the pattern.

Insertion of tatting and crochet
(figs. 507 and
508).&mdash;Worked
with one shuttle.
The tatting thread
should be two
numbers coarser than the crochet thread. Begin with 2 strings
of half rings consisting of: 4 short picots and 3 long. Leave a
length of thread between, equal to the diameter of the ring.



Fig. 507. Insertion of tatting and crochet.
Materials&mdash;For the tatting: Fil d&#39;Alsace D.M.C in balls
Nos. 30 to 70, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50,
&eacute;cru or white.[A]
For the crochet: The same materials, but two
numbers finer.


When the two strings of half rings are finished, crochet with
the fine thread: 6 plain over each length of thread between,
and at the base of the scallops.



Fig. 508. Working detail of fig. 507.


2nd row&mdash;5 chain, 1 plain in the 4th plain of the 1st row.

In the row that connects the two rows of tatting, put the
3rd chain stitch into the corresponding stitch of the opposite row.

8 chain *, 1 treble in the 2nd short picot, 7 chain, 1 treble
in the 3rd short picot, 8 chain, 1 plain in the 4th short picot,
1 plain in the short picot opposite, 3 chain, pass the thread
through the 4th of the 8 chain stitches, 4 chain and repeat from *.

For the last row make: 3 plain in each of the 3 last of
8 chain, * 1 picot of 5 chain above the treble, 4 plain in
the 4 next chain, 1 picot, 1 single in the same stitch as the
plain before the picot, 3 plain, 1 picot, 3 plain, miss the
1st and the last stitch, then make 3 plain on the next scallop
and repeat from *.
