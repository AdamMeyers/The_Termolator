Wikipedia First Paragraph for "bernoulli process"

In probability and statistics, a Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, so it is a discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and 1. The component Bernoulli variables "X" are identically distributed and independent. Prosaically, a Bernoulli process is a repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness). Every variable "X" in the sequence is associated with a Bernoulli trial or experiment. They all have the same Bernoulli distribution. Much of what can be said about the Bernoulli process can also be generalized to more than two outcomes (such as the process for a six-sided dice); this generalization is known as the Bernoulli scheme.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "bernoulli shift"

In mathematics, the Bernoulli scheme or Bernoulli shift is a generalization of the Bernoulli process to more than two possible outcomes. Bernoulli schemes are important in the study of dynamical systems, as most such systems (such as Axiom A systems) exhibit a repellor that is the product of the Cantor set and a smooth manifold, and the dynamics on the Cantor set are isomorphic to that of the Bernoulli shift. This is essentially the Markov partition. The term "shift" is in reference to the shift operator, which may be used to study Bernoulli schemes. The Ornstein isomorphism theorem shows that Bernoulli shifts are isomorphic when their entropy is equal.

In mathematics, a cylinder set is the natural set in a product space. Such sets are the basis for the open sets of the product topology and, they are a generating family of the cylinder sigma-algebra, which in the countable case is the product sigma-algebra.  Cylinder sets are particularly useful in providing the base of the natural topology of the product of a countable number of copies of a set. If "V" is a finite set, then each element of "V" can be represented by a letter, and the countable product can be represented by the collection of strings of letters.

In statistical mechanics, the ensemble average is defined as the mean of a quantity that is a function of the microstate of a system, according to the distribution of the system on its micro-states in this ensemble.  Since the ensemble average is dependent on the ensemble chosen, its mathematical expression varies from ensemble to ensemble. However, the mean obtained for a given physical quantity doesn't depend on the ensemble chosen at the thermodynamic limit. The grand canonical ensemble is an example of an open system.

An ergodic process is one which conforms to the ergodic theorem. The theorem allows the time average of a conforming process to equal the ensemble average.

In probability theory, an ergodic system is a stochastic process which proceeds in time and which has the same statistical behavior averaged over time as over the system's entire possible state space. The modern, formal statement of ergodicity relies heavily on measure theory.  The idea of ergodicity was born in the field of thermodynamics, where it was necessary to relate the individual states of gas molecules to the temperature of a gas as a whole and its time evolution thereof. In order to do this, it was necessary to state what exactly it means for gases to mix well together, so that thermodynamic equilibrium could be defined with mathematical rigor. Once the theory was well developed in physics, it was rapidly formalized and extended, so that ergodic theory has long been an independent area of mathematics in itself.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "ergodic flow"

In mathematics, ergodic flows occur in geometry, through the geodesic and horocycle flows of closed hyperbolic surfaces. Both of these examples have been understood in terms of the theory of unitary representations of locally compact groups: if Γ is the fundamental group of a closed surface, regarded as a discrete subgroup of the Möbius group G = PSL(2,R), then the geodesic and horocycle flow can be identified with the natural actions of the subgroups "A" of real positive diagonal matrices and "N" of lower unitriangular matrices on the unit tangent bundle "G" / Γ. The Ambrose-Kakutani theorem expresses every ergodic flow as the flow built from an invertible ergodic transformation on a measure space using a ceiling function. In the case of geodesic flow, the ergodic transformation can be understood in terms of symbolic dynamics; and in terms of the ergodic actions of Γ on the boundary "S" = "G" / "AN" and "G" / "A" = "S" × "S" \ diag "S". Ergodic flows also arise naturally as invariants in the classification of von Neumann algebras: the flow of weights for a factor of type III is an ergodic flow on a measure space.

In physics and thermodynamics, the ergodic hypothesis says that, over long periods of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are equiprobable over a long period of time.  Liouville's theorem states that, for Hamiltonian systems, the local density of microstates following a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer moving with the ensemble (i.e., the convective time derivative is zero). Thus, if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem does "not" imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.

Up to null sets, "X" can be written as a disjoint union "C" ∐ "D" of "T"-invariant sets where the actions of "T" on "C" and "D" are conservative and dissipative.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "metric space"

In mathematics, a metric space is a set together with a metric on the set. The metric is a function that defines a concept of "distance" between any two members of the set, which are usually called points. The metric satisfies a few simple properties. Informally:  A metric on a space induces topological properties like open and closed sets, which lead to the study of more abstract topological spaces.  The most familiar metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, a "metric" is the generalization of the Euclidean metric arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the straight line segment connecting them. Other metric spaces occur for example in elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry, where distance on a sphere measured by angle is a metric, and the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry is used by special relativity as a metric space of velocities.

Ergodic theory (Greek: ' "work", ' "way") is a branch of mathematics that studies statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems. In this context, statistical properties means properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.

In mathematics, a probability measure is a real-valued function defined on a set of events in a probability space that satisfies measure properties such as "countable additivity". The difference between a probability measure and the more general notion of measure (which includes concepts like area or volume) is that a probability measure must assign value 1 to the entire probability space.  Intuitively, the additivity property says that the probability assigned to the union of two disjoint events by the measure should be the sum of the probabilities of the events, e.g. the value assigned to "1 or 2" in a throw of a die should be the sum of the values assigned to "1" and "2".

In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple formula_1 is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a dice.  A probability space consists of three elements:  In order to provide a sensible model of probability, these elements must satisfy a number of axioms, detailed in the article.  In the example of the throw of a standard die, we would take the sample space to be formula_4. For the event space, we could simply use the set of all subsets of the sample space, which would then contain simple events such as formula_5 ("the die lands on 5"), as well as complex events such as formula_6 ("the die lands on an even number"). Finally, for the probability function, we would map each event to the number of outcomes in that event divided by 6 — so for example, formula_5 would be mapped to formula_8, and formula_6 would be mapped to formula_10.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "stationary stochastic process"

In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (or a strict/strictly stationary process or strong/strongly stationary process) is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time.  Since stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary. The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due either to the presence of a unit root or of a deterministic trend. In the former case of a unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting. In the latter case of a deterministic trend, the process is called a trend stationary process, and stochastic shocks have only transitory effects after which the variable tends toward a deterministically evolving (non-constant) mean.

Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, and physics as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography and telecommunications.

In geometric terms, a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold is a symmetric space if and only if its curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport. More generally, a Riemannian manifold ("M", "g") is said to be symmetric if and only if, for each point "p" of "M", there exists an isometry of "M" fixing "p" and acting on the tangent space formula_1 as minus the identity (every symmetric space is complete, since any geodesic can be extended indefinitely via symmetries about the endpoints).

The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property.
