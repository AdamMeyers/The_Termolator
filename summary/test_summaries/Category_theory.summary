In mathematics, in his "Tôhoku paper" introduced a sequence of axioms of various kinds of categories enriched over the symmetric monoidal category of abelian groups. Abelian categories are sometimes called AB2 categories, according to the axiom (AB2). AB3 categories are abelian categories possessing arbitrary coproducts (hence, by the existence of quotients in abelian categories, also all colimits). AB5 categories are the AB3 categories in which filtered colimits of exact sequences are exact. Grothendieck categories are the AB5 categories with a generator.

Term Summary for "algebraic k-theory"
*************************************

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "algebraic k-theory"

Algebraic "K"-theory is a subject area in mathematics with connections to geometry, topology, ring theory, and number theory. Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called "K"-groups. These are groups in the sense of abstract algebra. They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the "K"-groups of the integers.  "K"-theory was invented in the late 1950s by Alexander Grothendieck in his study of intersection theory on algebraic varieties. In the modern language, Grothendieck defined only "K", the zeroth "K"-group, but even this single group has plenty of applications, such as the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem. Intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of (higher) algebraic "K"-theory through its links with motivic cohomology and specifically Chow groups. The subject also includes classical number-theoretic topics like quadratic reciprocity and embeddings of number fields into the real numbers and complex numbers, as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher regulators and special values of L-functions.

Term Summary for "anamorphism"

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "anamorphism"

In computer programming, an anamorphism is a function that generates a sequence by repeated application of the function to its previous result. You begin with some value A and apply a function f to it to get B. Then you apply f to B to get C, and so on until some terminating condition is reached. The anamorphism is the function that generates the list of A, B, C, etc. You can think of the anamorphism as unfolding the initial value into a sequence.  The above layman's description can be stated more formally in category theory: the anamorphism of a coinductive type denotes the assignment of a coalgebra to its unique morphism to the final coalgebra of an endofunctor. These objects are used in functional programming as "unfolds".

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "associativity"

In mathematics, the associative property is a property of some binary operations. In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs.  Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed. That is, (after rewriting the expression with parentheses and in infix notation if necessary) rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:  Even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers, it can be said that "addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations".

Term Summary for "binary tree"
*************************************

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "binary tree"

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the ' and the '. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple ("L", "S", "R"), where "L" and "R" are binary trees or the empty set and "S" is a singleton set. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.  From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually arborescences. A binary tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence—a term which appears in some very old programming books, before the modern computer science terminology prevailed. It is also possible to interpret a binary tree as an undirected, rather than a directed graph, in which case a binary tree is an ordered, rooted tree. Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of "binary tree" to emphasize the fact that the tree is rooted, but as defined above, a binary tree is always rooted. A binary tree is a special case of an ordered K-ary tree, where "k" is 2.

In category theory, the concept of catamorphism (from the Greek: κατά "downwards" and μορφή "form, shape") denotes the unique homomorphism from an initial algebra into some other algebra.  In functional programming, catamorphisms provide generalizations of "folds" of lists to arbitrary algebraic data types, which can be described as initial algebras.  The dual concept is that of anamorphism that generalize "unfolds". A hylomorphism is the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "categorification"

In mathematics, categorification is the process of replacing set-theoretic theorems by category-theoretic analogues. Categorification, when done successfully, replaces sets by categories, functions with functors, and equations by natural isomorphisms of functors satisfying additional properties. The term was coined by Louis Crane.  The reverse of categorification is the process of "decategorification". Decategorification is a systematic process by which isomorphic objects in a category are identified as equal. Whereas decategorification is a straightforward process, categorification is usually much less straightforward. In the representation theory of Lie algebras, modules over specific algebras are the principle objects of study, and there are several frameworks for what a categorification of such a module should be, e.g., so called (weak) abelian categorifications.

Term Summary for "category enriched"
*************************************

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "category enriched"

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, an enriched category generalizes the idea of a category by replacing hom-sets with objects from a general monoidal category. It is motivated by the observation that, in many practical applications, the hom-set often has additional structure that should be respected, e.g., that of being a vector space of morphisms, or a topological space of morphisms. In an enriched category, the set of morphisms (the hom-set) associated with every pair of objects is replaced by an object in some fixed monoidal category of "hom-objects". In order to emulate the (associative) composition of morphisms in an ordinary category, the hom-category must have a means of composing hom-objects in an associative manner: that is, there must be a binary operation on objects giving us at least the structure of a monoidal category, though in some contexts the operation may also need to be commutative and perhaps also to have a right adjoint (i.e., making the category symmetric monoidal or even symmetric closed monoidal, respectively).

If there is a monoidal functor from a monoidal category M to a monoidal category N, then any category enriched over M can be reinterpreted as a category enriched over N.

Every coalgebra, by (vector space) duality, gives rise to an algebra, but not in general the other way. In finite dimensions, this duality goes in both directions (see below).  Coalgebras occur naturally in a number of contexts (for example, universal enveloping algebras and group schemes).

The dimension of the cokernel is called the "corank" of "f".  Cokernels are dual to the kernels of category theory, hence the name: the kernel is a subobject of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a quotient object of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).  Intuitively, given an equation "f"("x") = "y" that one is seeking to solve, the cokernel measures the "constraints" that "y" must satisfy for this equation to have a solution – the obstructions to a solution – while the kernel measures the "degrees of freedom" in a solution, if one exists.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "commutative ring r"

R or r is the 18th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its name in English is "ar" (pronounced ), plural "ars", or in Ireland "or" .  The original Semitic letter may have been inspired by an Egyptian hieroglyph for "tp", "head". It was used for by Semites because in their language, the word for "head" was "rêš" (also the name of the letter). It developed into Greek 'Ρ' ("rhô") and Latin R.  The descending diagonal stroke develops as a graphic variant in some Western Greek alphabets (writing "rho" as ), but it was not adopted in most Old Italic alphabets; most Old Italic alphabets show variants of their "rho" between a "P" and a "D" shape, but without the Western Greek descending stroke.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "comonad"

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a monad (also triple, triad, standard construction and fundamental construction) is an endofunctor (a functor mapping a category to itself), together with two natural transformations required to fulfill certain coherence conditions. Monads are used in the theory of pairs of adjoint functors, and they generalize closure operators on partially ordered sets to arbitrary categories.  A monad is a certain type of endofunctor. For example, if formula_1 and formula_2 are a pair of adjoint functors, with formula_1 left adjoint to formula_2, then the composition formula_5 is a monad. If formula_1 and formula_2 are inverse functors, the corresponding monad is the identity functor. In general, adjunctions are not equivalences—they relate categories of different natures. The monad theory matters as part of the effort to capture what it is that adjunctions 'preserve'. The other half of the theory, of what can be learned likewise from consideration of formula_8, is discussed under the dual theory of "comonads".

Monads are to monoids as comonads are to "comonoids".

The notion of monad was invented by Roger Godement in 1958 under the name "standard construction." In the 1960s and 1970s, many people used the name "triple." The now standard term "monad" is due to Saunders Mac Lane.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "continuous map"

In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, sufficiently small changes in the input of a continuous function result in arbitrarily small changes in its output. If not continuous, a function is said to be "discontinuous". Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, during which attempts such as the epsilon–delta definition were made to formalize it.   Continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of topology, which is treated in full generality below. The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are real numbers. A stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two metric spaces. In order theory, especially in domain theory, one considers a notion of continuity known as Scott continuity. Other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.

N or n is the fourteenth letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its name in English is "en" (pronounced ), plural "ens".  One of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English , because the Egyptian word for "snake" was "djet". It is speculated by many that Semitic people working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for "snake" may have begun with that sound. However, the name for the letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic alphabets is "nun", which means "fish" in some of these languages.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "covering space"

In mathematics, and more specifically algebraic topology, a covering map (also covering projection) is a continuous function formula_1 from a topological space formula_2 to a topological space  formula_3 such that each point in formula_3 has an open neighbourhood evenly covered by formula_1 (as shown in the image). In this case, formula_2 is called a covering space and formula_3 the base space of the covering projection. The definition implies that every covering map is a local homeomorphism.  Covering spaces play an important role in homotopy theory, harmonic analysis, Riemannian geometry and differential topology. In Riemannian geometry for example, ramification is a generalization of the notion of covering maps. Covering spaces are also deeply intertwined with the study of homotopy groups and, in particular, the fundamental group. An important application comes from the result that, if formula_3 is a "sufficiently good" topological space, there is a bijection between the collection of all isomorphism classes of connected coverings of formula_3 and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of formula_3.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "diagonal functor"

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the diagonal functor formula_1 is given by formula_2, which maps objects as well as morphisms. This functor can be employed to give a succinct alternate description of the product of objects "within" the category formula_3: a product formula_4 is a universal arrow from formula_5 to formula_6. The arrow comprises the projection maps.  More generally, given a small index category formula_7, one may construct the functor category formula_8, the objects of which are called diagrams. For each object formula_9 in formula_3, there is a constant diagram formula_11 that maps every object in formula_7 to formula_9 and every morphism in formula_7 to formula_15. The diagonal functor formula_16 assigns to each object formula_9 of formula_3 the diagram formula_19, and to each morphism formula_20 in formula_3 the natural transformation formula_22 in formula_8 (given for every object formula_24 of formula_7 by formula_26). Thus, for example, in the case that formula_7 is a discrete category with two objects, the diagonal functor formula_1 is recovered.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "distributive lattice"

In mathematics, a distributive lattice is a lattice in which the operations of join and meet distribute over each other. The prototypical examples of such structures are collections of sets for which the lattice operations can be given by set union and intersection. Indeed, these lattices of sets describe the scenery completely: every distributive lattice is—up to isomorphism—given as such a lattice of sets.  As in the case of arbitrary lattices, one can choose to consider a distributive lattice "L" either as a structure of order theory or of universal algebra. Both views and their mutual correspondence are discussed in the article on lattices. In the present situation, the algebraic description appears to be more convenient:  A lattice ("L",∨,∧) is distributive if the following additional identity holds for all "x", "y", and "z" in "L":  Viewing lattices as partially ordered sets, this says that the meet operation preserves non-empty finite joins. It is a basic fact of lattice theory that the above condition is equivalent to its dual:  In every lattice, defining "p"≤"q" as usual to mean "p"∧"q"="p", the inequality "x" ∧ ("y" ∨ "z") ≥ ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ ("x" ∧ "z") holds as well as its dual inequality "x" ∨ ("y" ∧ "z") ≤ ("x" ∨ "y") ∧ ("x" ∨ "z").

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a fibration is a generalization of the notion of a fiber bundle.

A fibration is like a fiber bundle, except that the fibers need not be the same space, nor even homeomorphic; rather, they are just homotopy equivalent. Weak fibrations discard even this equivalence for a more technical property.  Fibrations do not necessarily have the local Cartesian product structure that defines the more restricted fiber bundle case, but something weaker that still allows "sideways" movement from fiber to fiber. Fiber bundles have a particularly simple homotopy theory that allows topological information about the bundle to be inferred from information about one or both of these constituent spaces.

One may view a simplicial set as a purely combinatorial construction designed to capture the notion of a "well-behaved" topological space for the purposes of homotopy theory. Specifically, the category of simplicial sets carries a natural model structure, and the corresponding homotopy category is equivalent to the familiar homotopy category of topological spaces.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "grothendieck category"

In mathematics, a Grothendieck category is a certain kind of abelian category, introduced in Alexander Grothendieck's Tôhoku paper of 1957 in order to develop the machinery of homological algebra for modules and for sheaves in a unified manner. The theory of these categories was further developed in Pierre Gabriel's seminal thesis in 1962.  To every algebraic variety formula_1 one can associate a Grothendieck category formula_2, consisting of the quasi-coherent sheaves on formula_1. This category encodes all the relevant geometric information about formula_1, and formula_1 can be recovered from formula_2 (the Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem). This example gives rise to one approach to noncommutative algebraic geometry: the study of "non-commutative varieties" is then nothing but the study of (certain) Grothendieck categories.

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a Grothendieck topology is a structure on a category "C" that makes the objects of "C" act like the open sets of a topological space. A category together with a choice of Grothendieck topology is called a site.  Grothendieck topologies axiomatize the notion of an open cover. Using the notion of covering provided by a Grothendieck topology, it becomes possible to define sheaves on a category and their cohomology. This was first done in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory by Alexander Grothendieck to define the étale cohomology of a scheme. It has been used to define other cohomology theories since then, such as ℓ-adic cohomology, flat cohomology, and crystalline cohomology. While Grothendieck topologies are most often used to define cohomology theories, they have found other applications as well, such as to John Tate's theory of rigid analytic geometry.

In mathematics, a group action on a space is a group homomorphism of a given group into the group of transformations of the space. Similarly, a group action on a mathematical structure is a group homomorphism of a group into the automorphism group of the structure. It is said that the group "acts" on the space or structure. If a group acts on a structure, it also acts on everything that is built on the structure. For example, the group of Euclidean isometries acts on Euclidean space and also on the figures drawn in it. In particular, it acts on the set of all triangles. Similarly, the group of symmetries of a polyhedron acts on the vertices, the edges, and the faces of the polyhedron.

In mathematics, homotopical algebra is a collection of concepts comprising the "nonabelian" aspects of homological algebra as well as possibly the abelian aspects as special cases. The "homotopical" nomenclature stems from the fact that a common approach to such generalizations is via abstract homotopy theory, as in nonabelian algebraic topology, and in particular the theory of closed model categories.  This subject has received much attention in recent years due to new foundational work of Vladimir Voevodsky, Eric Friedlander, Andrei Suslin, and others resulting in the A homotopy theory for quasiprojective varieties over a field.

In mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces. The first and simplest homotopy group is the fundamental group, which records information about loops in a space. Intuitively, homotopy groups record information about the basic shape, or "holes", of a topological space.  To define the "n"-th homotopy group, the base-point-preserving maps from an "n"-dimensional sphere (with base point) into a given space (with base point) are collected into equivalence classes, called homotopy classes. Two mappings are homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other. These homotopy classes form a group, called the "n"-th homotopy group, formula_1, of the given space "X" with base point. Topological spaces with differing homotopy groups are never equivalent (homeomorphic), but topological spaces that "are not" homeomorphic "can" have the same homotopy groups.

In mathematics, particularly in category theory, a morphism is a structure-preserving map from one mathematical structure to another one of the same type. The notion of morphism recurs in much of contemporary mathematics. In set theory, morphisms are functions; in linear algebra, linear transformations; in group theory, group homomorphisms; in topology, continuous functions, and so on.  In category theory, "morphism" is a broadly similar idea: the mathematical objects involved need not be sets, and the relationships between them may be something other than maps, although the morphisms between the objects of a given category have to behave similarly to maps in that they have to admit an associative operation similar to function composition. A morphism in category theory is an abstraction of a homomorphism.

In mathematics, particularly in algebra, the injective hull (or injective envelope) of a module is both the smallest injective module containing it and the largest essential extension of it. Injective hulls were first described in .  A module "E" is called the injective hull of a module "M", if "E" is an essential extension of "M", and "E" is injective. Here, the base ring is a ring with unity, though possibly non-commutative.    In some cases, for "R" a subring of a self-injective ring "S", the injective hull of "R" will also have a ring structure. For instance, taking "S" to be a full matrix ring over a field, and taking "R" to be any ring containing every matrix which is zero in all but the last column, the injective hull of the right "R"-module "R" is "S". For instance, one can take "R" to be the ring of all upper triangular matrices. However, it is not always the case that the injective hull of a ring has a ring structure, as an example in shows.

In mathematics, a structure is a set endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g., operation, relation, metric, topology). Often, the additional features are attached or related to the set, so as to provide it with some additional meaning or significance.  A partial list of possible structures are measures, algebraic structures (groups, fields, etc.), topologies, metric structures (geometries), orders, events, equivalence relations, differential structures, and categories.  Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously, which allows mathematicians to study the interaction between the different structures more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set, and if a set has both a topology structure and a group structure, such that these two structures are related in a certain way, then the set becomes a topological group.

This fundamental idea first surfaced in algebraic topology. Difficult "topological" questions can be translated into "algebraic" questions which are often easier to solve.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory24.txt3:  In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.

Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane introduced the concepts of categories, functors, and natural transformations from 1942–45 in their study of algebraic topology, with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "model category"

In mathematics, particularly in homotopy theory, a model category is a category with distinguished classes of morphisms ('arrows') called 'weak equivalences', 'fibrations' and 'cofibrations'. These abstract from a conventional homotopy category of topological spaces or of chain complexes (derived category theory), via the acyclic model theorem. The concept was introduced by .  In recent decades, the language of model categories has been used in some parts of algebraic "K"-theory and algebraic geometry, where homotopy-theoretic approaches led to deep results.

In algebra, given a ring "R", the category of left modules over "R" is the category whose objects are all left modules over "R" and whose morphisms are all module homomorphisms between left "R"-modules. For example, when "R" is the ring of integers Z, it is the same thing as the category of abelian groups. The category of right modules is defined in a similar way.  Note: Some authors use the term module category for the category of modules. This term can be ambiguous since it could also refer to a category with a monoidal-category action.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "moduli space"

In mathematics, in particular algebraic geometry, a moduli space is a geometric space (usually a scheme or an algebraic stack) whose points represent algebro-geometric objects of some fixed kind, or isomorphism classes of such objects. Such spaces frequently arise as solutions to classification problems: If one can show that a collection of interesting objects (e.g., the smooth algebraic curves of a fixed genus) can be given the structure of a geometric space, then one can parametrize such objects by introducing coordinates on the resulting space. In this context, the term "modulus" is used synonymously with "parameter"; moduli spaces were first understood as spaces of parameters rather than as spaces of objects. A variant of moduli spaces are formal moduli.

In the same way, moduli spaces of curves, vector bundles, or other geometric objects are often best defined as stacks instead of schemes.

The preceding example about free groups can be generalized to any type of algebra in the sense of a variety of algebras in universal algebra. Thus, every such type of algebra gives rise to a monad on the category of sets. Importantly, the algebra type can be recovered from the monad (as the category of Eilenberg–Moore algebras), so monads can also be seen as generalizing varieties of universal algebras.

Another monad arising from an adjunction is when formula_25 is the endofunctor on the category of vector spaces which maps a vector space formula_78 to its tensor algebra formula_79, and which maps linear maps to their tensor product.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "monoid"

In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a monoid is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element.  Monoids are semigroups with identity. They occur in several branches of mathematics.   For example, the functions from a set into itself form a monoid with respect to function composition. More generally, in category theory, the morphisms of an object to itself form a monoid, and, conversely, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object.

In the above notation, "I" is the unit element and α, λ and ρ are respectively the associativity, the left identity and the right identity of the monoidal category C.  Dually, a comonoid in a monoidal category C is a monoid in the dual category C.  Suppose that the monoidal category C has a symmetry "γ". A monoid "M" in C is commutative when "μ" "γ" = "μ".

An operad in the above sense is sometimes thought of as a generalized ring. For example, Nikolai Durov defines his generalized ring as a monoid object in the monoidal category of endofuctors that commutes with filtered colimit. It is a generalization of a ring since each ordinary ring "R" defines a monad formula_39 that sends a set "X" to the free "R"-module formula_40 generated by "X".

"Associativity" means that "composition" of operations is associative
(the function formula_41 is associative), analogous to the axiom in category theory that formula_42; it does "not" mean that the operations "themselves" are associative as operations.
Compare with the associative operad, below.

Associativity in operad theory means that expressions can be written involving operations without ambiguity from the omitted compositions, just as associativity for operations allows products to be written without ambiguity from the omitted parentheses.

For instance, if formula_29 is a binary operation, which is written as formula_44 or formula_45.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory25.txt3: Similarly, if "C" is the category of abelian groups, monoid objects are rings, and the above recovers the center of a ring. Finally, if "C" is the category of categories, with the product as the monoidal operation, monoid objects in "C" are monoidal categories, and the above recovers the Drinfeld center.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory122.txt3: 
By definition, an associative algebra over a commutative ring "R" is a monoid object in the monoidal category formula_35 of modules over "R". This definition can be extended to give a definition of an operad: namely, an "operad" over "R" is a monoid object formula_36 in the monoidal category of endofunctors on formula_35 (it is a monad) satisfying some finiteness condition.

For example, a monoid object in the category of polynomial functors is an operad.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "monoid theory"

In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation.  The binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted multiplicatively: "x"·"y", or simply "xy", denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the ordered pair . Associativity is formally expressed as that for all "x", "y" and "z" in the semigroup.  Semigroups may be considered a special case of magmas, where the operation is associative, or as a generalization of groups, without requiring the existence of an identity element or inverses. As in the case of groups or magmas, the semigroup operation need not be commutative, so "x"·"y" is not necessarily equal to "y"·"x"; a well-known example of an operation that is associative but non-commutative is matrix multiplication. If the semigroup operation is commutative, then the semigroup is called a "commutative semigroup" or (less often than in the analogous case of groups) it may be called an "abelian semigroup".

In mathematics, a monoidal category (or tensor category) is a category formula_1 equipped with a bifunctor that is associative up to a natural isomorphism, and an object "I" that is both a left and right identity for ⊗, again up to a natural isomorphism. The associated natural isomorphisms are subject to certain coherence conditions, which ensure that all the relevant diagrams commute.  The ordinary tensor product makes vector spaces, abelian groups, "R"-modules, or "R"-algebras into monoidal categories. Monoidal categories can be seen as a generalization of these and other examples. Every (small) monoidal category may also be viewed as a "categorification" of an underlying monoid, namely the monoid whose elements are the isomorphism classes of the category's objects and whose binary operation is given by the category's tensor product.

One may view a simplicial set as a purely combinatorial construction designed to capture the notion of a "well-behaved" topological space for the purposes of homotopy theory.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory80.txt3: Further, if the family formula_59 is directed (i.e. for any two objects in the family, there is a third object in the family that contains the two), and formula_1 is another subobject of formula_17, we have

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory31.txt3: 
Cokernels are dual to the kernels of category theory, hence the name: the kernel is a subobject of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a quotient object of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "transformation semigroup"

In algebra, a transformation semigroup (or composition semigroup) is a collection of functions from a set to itself that is closed under function composition. If it includes the identity function, it is a monoid, called a transformation (or composition) monoid. This is the semigroup analogue of a permutation group.  A transformation semigroup of a set has a tautological semigroup action on that set. Such actions are characterized by being effective, i.e., if two elements of the semigroup have the same action, then they are equal.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory148.txt3: This may be viewed either as an action of the free monoid of strings in the input alphabet Σ, or as the induced transformation semigroup of "Q".

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory105.txt3: Later proofs contained major simplifications using finite wreath products of finite transformation semigroups. The theorem generalizes the Jordan–Hölder decomposition for finite groups (in which the primes are the finite simple groups), to all finite transformation semigroups (for which the primes are again the finite simple groups plus all subsemigroups of the "flip-flop" (see above)).

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory148.txt3: Since the notion of functions acting on a set always includes the notion of an identity function, which when applied to the set does nothing, a transformation semigroup can be made into a monoid by adding the identity function.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "transition system"

In theoretical computer science, a transition system is a concept used in the study of computation. It is used to describe the potential behavior of discrete systems. It consists of states and transitions between states, which may be labeled with labels chosen from a set; the same label may appear on more than one transition. If the label set is a singleton, the system is essentially unlabeled, and a simpler definition that omits the labels is possible.  Transition systems coincide mathematically with abstract rewriting systems (as explained further in this article) and directed graphs. They differ from finite state automata in several ways:   Transition systems can be represented as directed graphs.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory64.txt3:  Then coalgebras for the endofunctor "P"("A"×(-)) are in bijective correspondence with labelled transition systems, and homomorphisms between coalgebras correspond to functional bisimulations between labelled transition systems.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory118.txt3: 
This is the analogue in monoid theory of a (left) group action. Right "M"-acts are defined in a similar way. A monoid with an act is also known as an operator monoid. Important examples include transition systems of semiautomata. A transformation semigroup can be made into an operator monoid by adjoining the identity transformation.

From file: ././Category_theory/Category_theory64.txt3: This has applications in computer science: examples of coalgebras include lazy, infinite data structures, such as streams, and also transition systems.
