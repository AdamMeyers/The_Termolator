 (2) In incidence to the establishment of such boundary line, and upon Missouri's disclaimer herein, the territorial and sovereignty right claimed by Illinois to the body of land given identification in the evidence as "Kaskaskia Island" is hereby confirmed as against Missouri and decreed to exist in Illinois.
(3) In further incidence to the boundary establishment made, the territorial and sovereignty right claimed by Illinois to the body of land given identification in the evidence as "Beaver Island" is hereby confirmed as against Missouri and decreed to exist in Illinois.
(4) In similar incidence, the territorial and sovereignty right claimed by Missouri to each of the two bodies of land given identification severally in the evidence as "Cottonwoods" and "Roth Island" is hereby sustained as against Illinois and decreed to exist in Missouri.
(5) The boundary description decreed in paragraph (1) hereof is taken from Attachment "C" of the parties' stipulation as being agreed upon by them to be appropriate and accurate for dispositional use in the event of and in relation to the result here reached. The bodies of land as to which Illinois' rights are confirmed in paragraphs (2) and (3) hereof are located on Illinois' side of the boundary line fixed, and those as to which Missouri's rights are sustained in paragraph (4) hereof are located upon Missouri's side thereof, so that no separate description is here necessary as to any of these bodies in order to effectuate the rights decreed in respect to them.
(6) The costs of the suit shall be assessed equally against the parties.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN took no part in the entry of this decree.
