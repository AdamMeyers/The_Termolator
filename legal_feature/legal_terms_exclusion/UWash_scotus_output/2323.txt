PER CURIAM.
The motion of the American Trial Lawyers Association for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. The petition for certiorari in No. 523, Albanese v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats., is also granted.
We believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the judgment for petitioner Albanese on the ground that the trial court incorrectly charged the jury on the issue of negligence is erroneous. Gutierrez v. Waterman S. S. Corp., . In its opinion the Court of Appeals also stated that the District Court incorrectly instructed the jury as to the applicability of the Safety and Health Regulations for LongshoringFn on the question of the shipowner's liability. But we do not read that court's opinion as making this an independent ground for ordering a new trial. So we not only reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the case of Albanese but reinstate the District Court's judgment in his favor.
The petitions in No. 557, International Terminal Operating Co. v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats.; and No. 654, N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats. v. Albanese, are denied.
 It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would have denied certiorari in No. 523, Albanese v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats., but the writ having been granted, he would have set the issues for plenary consideration. He concurs in the denial of certiorari in No. 557, International Terminal Operating Co. v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats., and No. 654, N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats. v. Albanese.
