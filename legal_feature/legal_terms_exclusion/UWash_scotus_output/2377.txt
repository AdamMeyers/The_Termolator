PER CURIAM.
The writs of certiorari are dismissed as improvidently granted.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissent from the dismissal of the writs, believing that these cases having been taken for review should be adjudicated on the merits.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
