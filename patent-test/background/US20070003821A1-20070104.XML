<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention generally relates to fuel cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to an integrally molded gasket seal for a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Electrochemical fuel cells facilitate chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen to generate electrical current. The chemical reactions take place in one or more membrane electrode assemblies (&#x201c;MEA&#x201d;). Each MEA typically includes an ion exchange membrane disposed between two electrodes, which are also referred to as gas diffusion layers. Between each electrode and the membrane is a catalyst, the location of which defines an electrochemically active area of the MEA. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> One electrode functions as a cathode and the other electrode functions as an anode. Typically, hydrogen is supplied to the anode and oxygen is supplied to the cathode. The hydrogen and oxygen are directed to the electrodes in separate manifolds. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The membrane acts as a barrier to isolate the hydrogen and oxygen to prevent short-circuiting of the MEA. The membrane restricts passage of oxygen and hydrogen, but permits protons to pass between the anode and the cathode. In many MEA's, the membrane extends laterally beyond the perimeter of each electrode layer. Extending the membrane beyond the two electrodes helps to prevent passage of oxygen and hydrogen between the electrodes at the perimeter edges of the electrodes, which can short-circuit the MEA. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> To further isolate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules, a gasket seal is provided around the perimeter edge of the electrodes and over the portion of the membrane that extends beyond the electrodes. To enhance the effectiveness of the seal, the seal is impregnated within the electrodes, which are typically porous and have a uniform density. The seal is made of an elastomeric material and can include multiple beads or protrusions to further increase the effectiveness of the seal. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In operation, hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) supplied to the anode reacts with the catalyst to split the H<sub>2 </sub>molecule into two H<sup>+</sup> ions and two electrons. The electrons are conducted via the anode to an external circuit to provide current to the circuit that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to power and turn a motor. The circuit next directs the electrons to the cathode side of the fuel cell. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Simultaneously, oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) supplied to the cathode reacts with the catalyst to form two oxygen atoms. Each of the oxygen atoms have a strong negative charge. This negative charge attracts the H<sup>+</sup> ions through the membrane. The H<sup>+</sup> ions combine with an oxygen atom and two of the electrons from the external circuit to form a water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O). </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> A single MEA produces only a small voltage. To increase the amount of voltage produced, multiple MEAs are often combined in a fuel cell stack in a manner that is commonly known in the art. The multiple MEA's are typically separated by flow field plates, which are commonly referred to as separator plates. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> While existing MEAs are suitable for their intended use, they are subject to improvement. For example, portions of the elastomeric seal sometimes enter the MEA active area during the manufacturing process as the elastomer is impregnated within the MEA. The presence of elastomer in the active area is undesirable because it restricts movement of gases and other particles in the active area, thereby decreasing the effective size of the active area and decreasing the efficiency of the fuel cell. Therefore, there is a need for a device and method that prevents portions of the seal from entering the active area during the impregnation process. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Existing MEA's also experience problems due to the size of the gasket seal or the distance that the seal extends above or below the MEA. For example, if the seal is too large and thus protrudes too far above or below the MEA then the seal will not properly fit between the MEA and the neighboring separator plates of a fuel cell stack. Further, such large seals exert more stress on the seal/MEA interlock than smaller seals due to numerous factors, such as their volume and increased exposure to outside forces that can highly strain the seal, thus making it more likely that larger seals, rather than smaller seals, will become detached from the MEA or damage the MEA. Still further, larger seals may permit more hydrogen permeation as compared to smaller seals. On the other hand, larger seals are more effective than smaller seals at preventing gross leakage from the MEA into the surrounding environment. Thus, there is a need for a seal that realizes the advantages associated with both large and small seals, while at the same time overcomes the disadvantages of each. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The present invention provides for a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising first and second gas diffusion layers and an ion exchange membrane disposed between the diffusion layers. Each diffusion layer includes an inner surface facing the membrane, an outer surface opposite the inner surface, and a side surface defining a perimeter of the diffusion layers. An outboard region extends about the diffusion layers at the perimeter. The outboard region surrounds an inboard region. The outboard region has a low density region proximate to the side surface and a high density region between the low density region and the inboard portion. A seal is mounted at the low density region. The high density region prevents portions of the seal from entering the inboard region during the manufacturing process, thereby damaging the MEA. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Another aspect of the invention provides for a fuel cell membrane assembly having a first gas diffusion layer, a second gas diffusion layer, an ion exchange membrane disposed between the first and second gas diffusion layers, and a seal. Each one of the first and second gas diffusion layers include the following: an inner surface facing the ion exchange membrane; an outer surface opposite the inner surface; and a side surface between the outer surface and the inner surface defining a perimeter of the first and the second layers respectively. The seal has a first rim integral with a second rim. The first rim is mounted to the outer surface and the side surface of each of the first layer and the second layer. The second rim is laterally offset from the first and the second layers. The seal impregnates the first gas diffusion layer and the second gas diffusion layer to provide a barrier between the first and the second gas diffusion layers that is at least substantially impermeable to gas. The first rim has a smaller volume than the second rim. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> A further aspect of the invention provides for a first support plate, a second support plate, and a membrane electrode assembly positioned between the first support plate and the second support plate. The membrane electrode assembly includes a first electrode, a second electrode, an ion exchange membrane, and a seal. The first electrode is adjacent to the first support plate. The second electrode is opposite the first electrode and adjacent the second support plate. The ion exchange membrane is disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode. Each one of the first electrode and the second electrode include: an inner surface facing the ion exchange membrane; an outer surface opposite the inner surface, the outer surface of the first electrode faces the first support plate and the outer surface of the second electrode faces the second support plate; a side surface between the outer surface and the inner surface defining a perimeter of the first and the second electrodes respectively; an outboard region extending about a periphery of each of the first electrode and the second electrode at the perimeter; and an inboard region at least substantially surrounded by the outboard region. The outboard region includes a low density region proximate to the side surface and a high density region that is inboard of, and adjacent to, the low density region. The seal impregnates the low density region of the outboard region to provide a barrier between the first and the second gas diffusion layers that is at least substantially impermeable to gas. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Yet an additional aspect of the invention provides for a method for manufacturing a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly having an ion exchange membrane affixed between a first gas diffusion layer and a second gas diffusion layer. The method comprises the following steps: positioning the first and the second gas diffusion layers between two halves of a thermo-mold assembly, each mold half having a protruding region that mirrors the location of a high density region to be formed in the first and second gas diffusion layers at an outboard region that extends about a periphery of the first and second diffusion layers; closing the mold halves under heat such that the protruding regions of the mold halves compress the first and the second diffusion layers at the high density regions to increase the density of the first and second diffusion layers at the high density regions; injecting an elastomeric material that is heated to a liquid within a cavity of the closed mold, the cavity located about the periphery of the membrane electrode assembly at a low density region that is outboard of the high density region, the liquid elastomer flows within the first and second diffusion layers at the low density region; and curing the liquid elastomeric material to form an elastomeric seal that is impregnated within the first and second diffusion layers at the low density region and extends around side surfaces at the periphery of the first and second diffusion layers. </p>

It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. </p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> A fuel cell assembly according to the teachings of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at reference numeral <b>10</b>. The fuel cell <b>10</b> generally comprises a first support plate <b>12</b>, a second support plate <b>14</b>, and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) <b>16</b> disposed between the first and second support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are mounted to opposite sides of the MEA <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are substantially similar. Therefore, like reference numbers are used to designate features of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> that are similar or the same. When it is necessary to distinguish between the first and second plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, such as in the figures, the letter &#x201c;a&#x201d; is used to designate features of the first support plate <b>12</b> and the letter &#x201c;b&#x201d; is used to designate features of the second support plate <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Each of the support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> include multiple manifold ports <b>18</b>. The ports <b>18</b> can take a variety of different forms and can be provided at a variety of different locations within the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. As illustrated, the ports <b>18</b> are located along an edge of each of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and extend through each of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Each of the ports <b>18</b> are separate passageways that keep different gases of the different ports <b>18</b> isolated from each other. The ports <b>18</b> of each of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are in vertical alignment with each other. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Each of the support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> further include flow field channels <b>20</b>. The channels <b>20</b> are located within a surface of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> respectively that abuts the MEA <b>16</b>. The channels <b>20</b> are in communication with one or more of the ports <b>18</b>. The channels <b>20</b> are operable to distribute the gases supplied through the ports <b>18</b> to the MEA <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the MEA <b>16</b> generally includes a first gas diffusion layer <b>22</b>, a second gas diffusion layer <b>24</b>, an ion exchange membrane <b>26</b> disposed between the first and second gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, a seal <b>28</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for clarity) mounted to the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and MEA manifold ports <b>30</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The first and second gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are substantially the same. Therefore, like reference numbers are used to designate features of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> that are similar or the same. When it is necessary to distinguish between the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, such as in the figures, the letter &#x201c;a&#x201d; is used to designate features of the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> and the letter &#x201c;b&#x201d; is used to designate features of the second diffusion layer <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> each include an inner surface <b>32</b> and an outer surface <b>34</b> that is opposite the inner surface <b>32</b>. The inner surfaces <b>32</b> face the membrane <b>26</b>. The outer surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> faces the first support plate <b>12</b> and the outer surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the second gas diffusion layer <b>24</b> faces the second support plate <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Each of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> include a side surface <b>36</b> that is located between the inner surface <b>32</b> and the outer surface <b>34</b>. Specifically, the side surfaces <b>36</b> are located at an outer edge of the inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> respectively. The side surfaces <b>36</b> define an outer perimeter of the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> each further include an inboard region <b>38</b> and an outboard region <b>40</b>. The inboard regions <b>38</b> are at a center of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The outboard regions <b>40</b> are at a periphery of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and extend about the perimeter of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the side surfaces <b>36</b>. The outboard regions <b>40</b> surround the inboard regions <b>38</b>. Thus, the outboard regions <b>40</b> are proximate to the side surfaces <b>36</b> and the inboard regions <b>38</b> are distal to the side surfaces <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outboard regions <b>40</b> each include a low density region <b>42</b> and a high density region <b>44</b>. The low density regions <b>42</b> are at, or at least proximate to, the side surfaces <b>36</b>. The low density regions <b>42</b> extend about the entire, or substantially the entire, perimeter of the diffusion layers <b>22</b>. The low density regions <b>42</b> extend from between about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, preferably about 4 mm, inward from the side surfaces <b>36</b> toward the inboard regions <b>38</b>. The thickness of the low density regions <b>42</b>, which is the distance between the outer surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> and the outer surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the second diffusion layer <b>24</b> including the thickness of the membrane <b>26</b>, is approximately 0.48 mm. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The high density regions <b>44</b> are between each of the inboard regions <b>38</b> and the low density regions <b>42</b>. The high density regions <b>44</b> extend about the entire, or substantially the entire, perimeter of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and are more dense than the low density regions <b>42</b>. The high density regions <b>44</b> can be of most any structural form that is sufficient to provide the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with an increased density at the high density regions <b>44</b> as compared to the low density regions <b>42</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> The diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are generally porous. The diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> can be made of a variety of materials known in the art, such as carbon fiber paper, which is generally comprised of a plurality of intertwined carbon fibers. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> In applications where the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are made of carbon fiber paper, the increased density of the high density regions <b>44</b> can be due to decreased spacing between the carbon fibers in the high density regions <b>44</b> as compared to the low density regions <b>42</b>. This decreased spacing can be provided in a variety of different ways, such as by compressing or &#x201c;pinching&#x201d; the layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> during the MEA <b>16</b> manufacturing process. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In applications where the high density regions <b>44</b> are provided by compressing the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, as illustrated in the figures, the high density regions <b>44</b> have a reduced thickness or height as compared to the low density regions <b>42</b> and the inboard regions <b>38</b> when the diffusion layers <b>22</b> are viewed in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In other words, the outer surfaces <b>34</b> are closer to the inner surfaces <b>32</b> in the area of the high density regions <b>44</b> than in the area of the low density regions <b>42</b> or the inboard regions <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The thickness of the overall MEA at the high density region <b>44</b>, which is the distance from the outer surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> to the outer surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the second diffusion layer <b>24</b> including the thickness of the ion exchange membrane <b>26</b>, is approximately 0.43 mm, but can be any other suitable thickness. The high density region <b>44</b> can be located, for example, from between about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, preferably about 4 mm, inboard from the side surface <b>36</b> and can be approximately 1.5 mm in length, or any other suitable thickness. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> While the high density region <b>44</b> is illustrated as having a reduced height or thickness as compared to the low density region <b>42</b> in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the high density region <b>44</b> can have a thickness that is uniform with the remainder of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> as long as the high density region <b>44</b> has a higher density than the low density region <b>42</b>. The high density region <b>44</b> can be of a variety of different densities, such as up to about 50% more dense than the inboard region <b>38</b> and/or the low density region <b>42</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In most applications the inboard regions <b>38</b> have a density that is approximate to, or the same as, the low density regions <b>42</b> of the outboard region <b>40</b>. The inboard region <b>38</b> is therefore a low density region <b>46</b> itself. However, in some applications the inboard region <b>38</b> can have a density that is greater or less than the low density region <b>42</b> of the outboard region <b>40</b>. The thickness of the overall MEA <b>16</b> at the low density region <b>46</b>, which is the distance from the outer surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> to the outer surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the second layer <b>24</b> including the thickness of the ion exchange membrane <b>26</b>, can be approximately 0.48 mm or any other suitable thickness. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> The first and second gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are electrically conductive. As a result, the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are commonly referred to as electrodes. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The ion exchange membrane <b>26</b> is typically a polymer electrolyte membrane that conducts only positively charged ions. The membrane <b>26</b> prohibits the passage of electrons. Any suitable fuel cell membrane known in the art can be used. The membrane <b>26</b> typically includes a top surface <b>48</b> and a bottom surface <b>50</b>. The top surface <b>48</b> abuts the inner surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the first gas diffusion layer <b>22</b> and the bottom surface <b>50</b> abuts the inner surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the second gas diffusion layer <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the membrane <b>26</b> is sized to extend laterally beyond the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. In other applications, the membrane <b>26</b> can be coextensive with the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> such that it terminates at the side surfaces <b>36</b>. The membrane <b>26</b> can also be sized to terminate inboard of the side surfaces <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The portion of the membrane top surface <b>48</b> facing the inboard region <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the first gas diffusion layer <b>22</b> is coated with an anode catalyst (not shown). The portion of the bottom surface <b>50</b> facing the inboard region <b>38</b><i>b </i>of the second gas diffusion layer <b>24</b> is coated with a cathode catalyst (not shown). The catalysts can be any suitable catalyst known in the art, such as Nafion&#xae;. The portions of the ion exchange membrane <b>26</b> that oppose the outboard regions <b>40</b> of the gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may not be, but in some applications can be, coated with the catalyst. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The areas of the MEA <b>16</b> where the catalyst opposes the inboard regions <b>38</b> of the gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are the active regions of the MEA <b>16</b>. The areas of the MEA <b>16</b> where the portions of the membrane <b>26</b> not covered with the catalyst oppose the outboard regions <b>40</b> are the inactive regions of the MEA <b>16</b>. The chemical reactions generating electrons and water take place in the active regions. No reactions take place in the inactive regions. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> As most clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the seal <b>28</b> is mounted about the peripheral edge of the MEA <b>16</b>. Specifically, the seal <b>28</b> is mounted to the outer surfaces <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>at the outboard low density region <b>42</b> and to the side surfaces <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b</i>. In applications where the membrane <b>26</b> extends from beyond the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the seal <b>28</b> is also mounted to and mounted over the portion of the membrane <b>26</b> that protrudes from between the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The seal <b>28</b> applies a compression force to the membrane <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> The seal <b>28</b> impregnates the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at an impregnation region <b>52</b>. Specifically, the seal is impregnated within the outboard low density regions <b>42</b> and within the side surfaces <b>36</b>. Impregnating the seal <b>28</b> at the impregnation region <b>52</b> enhances the interface between the seal <b>28</b> and the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> As most clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the seal <b>28</b> includes an inner projection, rim, or bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>and an outer projection, rim, or bead <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The beads <b>54</b> extend completely around the seal <b>28</b>. The beads <b>54</b> are connected by an interconnecting bridge region <b>56</b> and are thus integral with each other. As illustrated, each bead <b>54</b> is substantially cylindrical. However, the beads <b>54</b> can be of most any suitable shape. While the present invention is illustrated as including two beads <b>54</b>, the seal <b>28</b> can include a single bead <b>54</b>, more than two beads <b>54</b>, or no beads <b>54</b> at all. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The beads <b>54</b> can be of various different sizes depending on numerous factors, such as the size of the fuel cell <b>10</b> and the application. Preferably, the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>has a smaller area or radius than the outer bead <b>54</b><i>b</i>. In many applications the inner bead has as radius of approximately 0.3 mm and the outer bead <b>54</b><i>b </i>has a radius of approximately 0.69 mm. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> The seal <b>28</b> can be made of a variety of different materials known in the art that are at least substantially impermeable to gas, such as oxygen and hydrogen. The seal <b>28</b> is typically an elastomer, such as a thermosetting liquid injection moldable compound. For example, the seal <b>28</b> can be made of one or more of the following materials: silicone, fluorosilicone elastomer, fluorocarbon elastomer, and ethylene propylene diene monomer elastomer. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The MEA <b>16</b> further includes MEA manifold ports <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the MEA ports <b>30</b> are integral with the seal <b>28</b> and made of the same material as the seal <b>28</b>. The MEA ports <b>30</b> are aligned with the manifold ports <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the first and second plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The MEA ports <b>30</b> are individual passageways that permit the passage of gases between the manifold ports <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> An exemplary process for manufacturing the fuel cell <b>10</b> will now be described in detail. To manufacture the MEA <b>16</b>, the gas diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are laminated to opposite sides of the membrane <b>26</b> using any of a variety of different devices and methods known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> The diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and the membrane <b>26</b> are placed in a suitable molding tool (not shown) to form the high density region <b>44</b> and install the seal <b>28</b>. The molding tool can also be used to laminate the diffusion layers <b>22</b> to the membrane <b>26</b>, as is known in the art. The molding tool can be any suitable molding tool that is commonly used in the art, such as an injection molding tool. The molding tool includes a mold with two mold halves that mirror the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> The mold includes protruding features that mirror the high density regions <b>44</b>. The protruding features extend from both halves of the mold to a distance equal to the difference in thickness between the high density region <b>44</b> and the low density regions <b>42</b> and <b>46</b>. Therefore, when the mold halves are closed and heat is applied, the protruding regions compress the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the high density regions <b>44</b>. Compressing the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> increases the density of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to form the high density regions <b>44</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> The mold halves each further include an annular recess that extends about the perimeter of the mold and mirrors the areas where the MEA manifold ports <b>30</b> are to be formed. When the mold halves are closed the recesses form a cavity at the low density regions <b>42</b>, at the portion of the membrane <b>26</b> that protrudes from between the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and form cavities in the areas where the MEA manifold ports <b>30</b> are to be formed. The cavity at the low density regions includes an inner chamber and an outer chamber. The inner chamber receives the low density region <b>42</b> and the protruding portion of the membrane <b>26</b>. The outer chamber is laterally spaced apart from the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The inner chamber is smaller than the outer chamber. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> To form the seal <b>28</b> and the MEA ports <b>30</b> the elastomer is heated to a liquid and is injected within the mold cavities formed by the recesses present in each mold half. The liquid elastomer flows within, or impregnates, the porous diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the outboard low density regions <b>42</b>. Impregnation of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with the liquid elastomer is enhanced due to the decreased density of the low density regions <b>42</b>, as compared to the high density regions <b>44</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The inner and outer chambers receive the heated elastomer to form the inner and outer seal beads <b>54</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>b </i>respectively. The smaller volume of the inner chamber provides the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>with a smaller volume or radius than the outer seal bead <b>54</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The high density regions <b>44</b> are advantageous because they restrict passage of the liquid elastomer. Compressing the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in this region <b>44</b> presses the fibers of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>44</b> closer together and closes the pores between the fibers. Therefore, no passages are available through the high density regions <b>44</b> and the liquid elastomer is confined to the low density regions <b>42</b>. Restricting the elastomer to the low density regions <b>42</b> keeps the elastomer out of the inboard regions <b>38</b> and the active areas where the presence of the elastomer may render the MEA <b>16</b> inactive. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The elastomer is next heat cured solid to form the seal <b>28</b> and the MEA ports <b>30</b>. The portion of the elastomer impregnated within the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> hardens to form a mechanical interlock between the seal <b>28</b> and the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. This mechanical interlock greatly enhances the sealing properties of the seal <b>28</b>. The hardened seal <b>28</b> also exerts pressure on the portion of the membrane <b>26</b> that protrudes within the seal <b>28</b> to increase the effectiveness of the seal <b>28</b> about the membrane <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> The completed MEA <b>16</b> is next secured between the support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to complete the fuel cell <b>10</b>. The MEA <b>16</b> is orientated such that the manifold ports <b>18</b> of the support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are aligned with the MEA manifold ports <b>30</b>. The MEA <b>16</b> is held in place between the support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> by an external loading mechanism that is known in the art (not shown). </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Multiple fuel cells <b>10</b> can be combined to form a fuel cell stack (not shown), as is known to those skilled in the art. In a fuel cell stack, the electrical output of each fuel cell <b>10</b> is combined to increase the voltage potential. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The operation of the fuel cell <b>10</b> will now be described. Hydrogen is supplied to the first support plate <b>12</b> through one of the manifold ports <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the first plate <b>12</b>. Oxygen is supplied to the second support plate <b>14</b> through one of the manifold ports <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the second plate <b>14</b>. To cool the fuel cell <b>10</b>, coolant can be supplied to one or both of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> through the manifold ports <b>18</b>. The hydrogen and oxygen are distributed through different ports <b>18</b> to insure that the hydrogen and oxygen remain separate. The MEA manifold ports <b>30</b> provide a channel for the passage of gas past the MEA <b>16</b>, which is particularly useful when the fuel cell <b>10</b> is part of a fuel cell stack to permit the distribution of oxygen, hydrogen, and air across the different fuel cells <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Hydrogen supplied to the first plate <b>12</b> via the ports <b>18</b><i>a </i>travels throughout the flow field channels <b>20</b><i>a </i>where the hydrogen is distributed to the first gas diffusion layer <b>22</b>. Therefore, the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> serves as the anode. Oxygen supplied to the second plate <b>14</b> via the ports <b>18</b><i>b </i>travels throughout the flow field channels <b>20</b><i>b </i>where the oxygen is distributed to the second diffusion layer <b>24</b>. Therefore, the second gas diffusion layer <b>24</b> serves as the cathode. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> The hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) diffuses through the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> where it reacts with the catalyst. The reaction with the catalyst yields two H<sup>+</sup> ions and two electrons. The electrons are conducted via the first diffusion layer <b>22</b> to a circuit to provide current to the circuit. The current can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to power and turn a motor. The electrons are directed via the circuit to the second diffusion layer <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Simultaneously, the oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) supplied to the second diffusion layer <b>24</b> reacts with the catalyst to yield two oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms have a strong negative charge. This negative charge attracts the H<sup>+</sup> ions through the membrane <b>26</b>. The H<sup>+</sup> ions bond with an oxygen atom and two of the electrons from the circuit to form a water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O). </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> The membrane <b>26</b> isolates the hydrogen and oxygen molecules to prevent a reaction between the two. The portion of the membrane <b>26</b> that extends beyond the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> prevents migration of oxygen and/or hydrogen around the side surfaces <b>36</b>, thereby further isolating the hydrogen and oxygen. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> The seal <b>28</b> also helps to isolate the hydrogen and oxygen and prevent escape of these gases into the surrounding atmosphere. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the seal <b>28</b> covers and seals the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the low density regions <b>42</b>. The seal is impregnated within the outer surfaces <b>34</b> and the side surfaces <b>36</b> of each of the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The seal <b>28</b> also applies a compression force to the portion of the ion exchange membrane <b>26</b> that extends beyond the first and second diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> The position of the seal <b>28</b> over the membrane <b>26</b> prevents cross migration of oxygen and gas between the first and second layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> around the membrane <b>26</b>. Impregnation of the inner seal bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>within the diffusion layers <b>22</b> at the impregnation region <b>52</b> prevents hydrogen and oxygen from escaping from the MEA <b>16</b> into the surrounding atmosphere. The outer bead <b>54</b><i>b </i>provides redundancy to further prevent the escape of hydrogen and oxygen into the atmosphere. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In some applications, the inner seal bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the outer bead <b>54</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, the inner bead <b>54</b><i>b </i>can have a smaller radius than the outer bead <b>54</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Providing an inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>with a smaller radius than the outer bead <b>54</b><i>b </i>is advantageous because it allows the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>to fit between the two support plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> without being damaged. Further, because the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>is of a reduced size, it is not subject to as much movement or disruption from external forces as a larger bead is subject to, thereby preserving the integrity of the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the integrity of the interlock between the inner bead <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the diffusion layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </p>
