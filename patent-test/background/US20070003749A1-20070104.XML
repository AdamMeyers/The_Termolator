<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to porous reticulated composite materials and methods for the production thereof. The present invention further relates to processes for the production of porous composite materials which may include the steps of providing a mixture capable of flowing which can have at least one inorganic and/or organic reticulating agent and at least one matrix material that may be a polymer or a polymer mixture, and solidifying the liquid mixture. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Porous materials can be important in different application fields in industry for use as membranes for filtration and separation of fluid mixtures, sensors, electrodes, electrical capacitors, dielectric materials in microelectronics, catalytic surfaces, in biomedicine technology for use as implantable materials or drug carriers, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Composite materials can also be important in mechanical or structural applications, e.g., in aeronautical or automotive engineering, medical engineering, membrane technology and other fields of application. The use of composite materials can provide a combination of components having different physico-chemical properties, resulting in a composite material which may have new or improved properties. Composite materials may exhibit a similar or superior stability, biocompatibility and/or strength at less overall weight when compared to non-composite materials. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Composite materials may allow for adjustment of individual material properties such as, e.g., thermal or electrical isolation, thermal coefficient of expansion, corrosive properties, absorption properties, conductivity of thermal and/or electrical energy, conduction of acoustic noise, thermal and/or chemical resistance, etc. For example, such properties may be varied by suitably selecting the components used to make the composite material. Porous composite materials may be used increasingly in coating applications, e.g., to functionalize materials with specific physical, electrical, magnetic or optical properties. Consequently, they can also be important in photovoltaic, sensor, catalytic or electrochromatic display technologies. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Porous composite materials may be prepared using conventional sintering methods. For example, powders that may include fibers, dendritic or spherically-formed precursor particles can be pressed into molds or extruded and then subjected to a sinter process. In such materials, the rigidity of the material, the pore size and/or the surface area may depend on the packaging density as well as on the size, form and/or the composition of particles in the powders. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> One potential disadvantage of conventional sintering methods may be that the adjustment of pore sizes can be difficult to control, and the mechanical properties may not be sufficiently tailored, for example, with respect to pore size, porosity or specific surface area. Parameters used in a sintering process may also have an influence on the strength, pore size and surface area of the porous materials. Pore sizes can be adjusted in additional processing steps, e.g. by deposition from the gas phase, electroplating or electroless plating, which may decrease the size of large pores by adding further material while providing a more homogeneous pore size distribution. These techniques, however, can reduce the available surface in porous materials. Other techniques that may be used can include of spray-coating of pre-sintered porous materials with a slurry, subsequent drying, and repeated sintering. These techniques may provide a pore diffusion of material from the slurry into the porous sintered structured, and to insufficient adhesion of the material deposited in the procedure, which can result from different thermal coefficients of expansion and shrinking of the deposited material. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> International Patent Publication WO 04/054625 describes a technique in which a pre-sintered porous material is coated by powdered nanoparticle material and subsequently re-sintered. International Patent Publication WO 99/15292 describes a process in which porous fiber-containing composite structures may be obtained from a dispersion of fibers with the use of binders and subsequent gasification of the mixture prior to, during or after sintering. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> A further potential disadvantage of the above-described methods may be that the sintering processes are conventionally performed at high temperatures, which can make it difficult or impossible to produce porous composites of polymers and inorganic and/or organic components if the sintering temperature is above the melting point of the polymer components. Another potential disadvantage of these methods may be that the material is processed in costly molding processes into a stable two- or three-dimensional structure, and only restricted forms may be obtainable due to the brittleness of the materials. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Conventional processing of porous materials can also require several post-treatment processing steps, and the sintering process may likely be applicable only to inorganic composites because of necessary process conditions. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Thus, there may be a need for providing porous composite materials having improved properties, and coating materials which have physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, that may be adapted to specific application requirements. Furthermore, there may be a need to functionalize porous composite materials, e.g., by a suitable combination of components, which may provide certain electrical, dielectric, magnetic and/or optical properties, for example, semiconducting, ionically conducting, magnetic or superconducting properties. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> There may also be a need for providing porous composite materials which may be produced in a cost efficient manner, and a process for manufacture thereof, which can avoid high costs for energy consumption when applying high pressures and/or high temperatures. Furthermore, there may be a need to provide porous composite materials that can have improved homogeneity as compared with conventional powder sintered materials, including coatings made from such composite materials. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Therefore, it is one of the objects of the present invention to provide a porous composite material, which may be based on organic and/or inorganic particles in combination with suitable matrix materials and which has properties which may be easily modifiable. For example, the adjustment of the thermal coefficient of expansion, the electric, dielectric, conducting or semiconducting, magnetic and/or optical properties, or further physico-chemical properties, may be facilitated by exemplary embodiments of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> A further object of the present invention is to provide adjustable network-like structural properties in a material which may be self-organizing, and the material may be structured in two or three dimensions. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fine structuring in materials such as, e.g., adjustment of porosity, which may be achieved without deteriorating the chemical and/or physical stability of the material. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Another object of the present invention is the provision of, e.g., adjustable, preferably self organizing, network-like structural properties, e.g. allowing, on the basis of the same material, to produce any possible two- and three-dimensional structure as well as a fine structure, such as the individual adjustment of porosity, preferably substantially without deteriorating the chemical and/or physical stability of the material. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a material that may be used as a coating as well as a bulk material, where the material has specific physico-chemical properties. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a method for a production of porous reticulated composite materials from inexpensive starting materials which may have broadly variable properties, in a cost-efficient manner and using relatively few process steps. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing porous composite materials which can be made from porous composite materials, where the properties of the material, e.g., thermal coefficient of expansion, electric, dielectric, conductive or semi-conductive and magnetic or optical properties can be adjusted. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> These and other objects of the invention can be achieved by exemplary embodiments of the present invention which may provide a process for the production of porous composite materials. For example, the composite material can be formed by a procedure, via which a liquid mixture that includes at least one reticulating agent and at least one matrix material that includes at least one organic polymer can be provided, and the mixture can be caused to be solidified. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the liquid mixture used in procedures as described herein may include at least one solvent and a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution, or alternatively the liquid mixture may be substantially free of solvents. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents included in the composite materials, as described above, may comprise inorganic materials such as, for example, metals, metal compounds, metal oxides, semiconductive metal compounds, and/or carbon species such as carbon fiber, graphite, soot, carbon black, fullerenes, or nanotubes. The reticulating materials may include particulate organic materials or fibers made of organic materials such as polymers, oligomers or pre-polymers, for example, a synthetic homopolymer or copolymer of an aliphatic or aromatic polyolefin, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, or a biopolymer. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> In still a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the composite material may include one or more reticulating agents provided in the form of particles, such as nano- or micro-crystalline particles. The reticulating agents may comprise at least two particle size fractions of the same or different materials, where the fractions differ in size by a factor of at least 1.1, or at least 2. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In yet a further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents included in composite materials as described above may comprise at least one inorganic material in combination with at least one organic material, or a combination of at least one particulate material with at least one material having a form selected from tubes, fibers or wires. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> In further exemplary embodiments of the invention, the matrix materials included in the composite materials and devices produced therefrom, as described above, may include oligomers, polymers, copolymers or prepolymers, thermosets, thermoplastics, synthetic rubbers, extrudable polymers, injection molding polymers, or moldable polymers such as, for example, epoxy resins, phenoxy resins, alkyd resins, epoxy-polymers, poly(meth)acrylate, unsaturated polyesters, saturated polyesters, polyolefines, rubber lattices, polyamides, polycarbonates, polystyrene, polyphenol, polysilicone, polyacetale, cellulose, or cellulose derivatives. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the liquid mixture used in procedures as described above can include further additives such as, e.g., cross linkers, fillers, surfactants, acids, bases, pore-forming agents, plasticizers, lubricants, flame resistants, biologically active compounds, therapeutically active compounds, agents for diagnostic purpose, or markers, and the liquid mixture may have, e.g., a total solids content below about 20% by weight. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, reticulating agents included in the composite materials as described above may be capable of forming a network-like structure and/or self-orienting into a three dimensional structure. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the relative amounts of the reticulating agent(s) and the matrix component(s) provided in a liquid mixture used in the exemplary procedures described herein may be selected to form a three-dimensional network in the solid phase upon removal of the solvent or during a change in viscosity of a solvent-free mixture during a solidification procedure. For example, a network may form as a result of a phase separation between the solvent phase and the solids phase that can occur during a solidification procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the composite material may be produced by a procedure which can include a solidification procedure. The solidification procedure may include a thermal treatment, drying, freeze-drying, application of a vacuum, e.g. evaporation of the solvent, or cross linking, wherein the cross linking may be induced chemically, thermally or by radiation. The solidification procedure may also include a phase separation in the liquid mixture comprising the reticulating agent and the matrix material into a solid phase and a liquid phase, or precipitation of solids from the liquid mixture, for example, before or during removal of the solvent, and/or by cross linking of the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a phase separation or precipitation which can be used in processes as described above may be induced by an increase of the viscosity of the liquid mixture, which may be produced by, for example, cross linking, curing, drying, rapidly increasing the temperature, rapidly lowering the temperature, or rapidly removing the solvent. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the matrix material may not decompose substantially during the manufacture of the composite material so that, e.g., the reticulating agents may be embedded in the formed composite material. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> According to still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a liquid mixture which may be used in processes for manufacturing a composite material as described herein may include at least one cross linker, which may be selected such that cross linking during processing of the liquid mixture before the solidification procedure does not produce a significant viscosity change in the system, and/or the cross linking reaction begins during solidification. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the reticulating agent can include soot, fullerenes, carbon fibers, silica, titanium dioxide, metal particles, tantalum particles, or polyethylene particles, and the matrix material can include epoxy resins or phenoxy resins. The liquid mixture may comprise an organic solvent, and the solidification procedure used can include removal of the solvent using a heat treatment procedure, which may provide a rapid removal of the solvent. Optionally, the resulting solvent-free material may be subsequently heat treated in an inert atmosphere at temperatures of up to about 300&#xb0; C. without decomposing the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the porous composite material resulting from the exemplary procedures described above may be impregnated, coated or infiltrated with therapeutically active agents, which can optionally be resolved or extracted from the material in the presence of physiologic fluids. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> In a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention a porous reticulated composite material or a porous coating is provided, which can be produced using the exemplary processes described above. These materials may be used, for example, for the manufacture of a medical device for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes, which can optionally comprise a marker, or as a scaffold for tissue engineering in vivo or in vitro. A composite material that is used as a scaffold may be loaded with microorganisms, viral vectors, cells or living tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In accordance with further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the degree of porosity and/or pore sizes of the composite materials may be selectively adjusted, for example by suitably selecting the amount and type of reticulating agents, their geometry and/or particle size, and/or by combining different particle sizes of the reticulating agent and the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a fine structuring of the material with regard to the degree of porosity, the pore size and the morphology may be selectively influenced, e.g., by suitably selecting solidification conditions during manufacture. Additionally, composite materials may be produced by combining reticulating agents and a suitable matrix material. For example, the mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties thereof can be selectively adjusted, e.g., by the solids content of the reticulating agent and/or the matrix material in the liquid mixture, the type of solvent or solvent mixture, the ratio of reticulating agents to matrix material and/or by suitably selecting the materials according to their primary particle size and their structure and type. For example, by suitably selecting conditions in the liquid mixture, e.g., conditions upon solidifying the mixture, the reticulating particles may be oriented in the form of a solid network which can influence and/or determine the porosity and other properties of the resulting composite material. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In additional exemplary embodiments of the present invention, components and processing conditions used to form a composite material may be selected such that the solids in a liquid mixture may form a self-organizing network structure, e.g., a reticulated structure before and/or during a solidification procedure. Suitable reticulating agents, for example mixtures of reticulating agents of different sizes and/or mixtures of reticulating agent particles with tubes, fibers or wires, may tend to self-aggregate in the liquid mixture, and this aggregation may be enhanced, for example, by suitably selecting the matrix material, the solvent, if any, as well as certain additives. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> In accordance with exemplary embodiment of the present invention process is provided, wherein a mixture capable of flowing can be prepared comprising at least one reticulating agent and at least one matrix material which may be a polymer or a combination of polymers that can be subsequently solidified. The mixture may include a liquid composition provided in the form of a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution, optionally comprising a solvent or solvent mixture. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mixture may be substantially free of any solvents and may utilize a liquid matrix material, which can be a material in a molten state, e.g., a melt of the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> The terms &#x201c;liquid mixture&#x201d; and &#x201c;mixture capable of flowing&#x201d; can refer to a mixture capable of flowing, which may contain or may exclude a solvent, and which can have melts, slurries or pasty materials having a high viscosity, or substantially dry flowable powder or particle mixtures. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> A liquid mixture may be prepared using conventional techniques, e.g., by dissolving or dispersing one or more solid components in a solvent or a matrix material in any suitable order, by mixing solids in a dry state and optionally adding one or more solvents, by melting a matrix material and dispersing one or more reticulating agents therein, optionally before adding a solvent, or by preparing a paste or slurry and subsequently diluting it with a solvent or a dispersion of other components in a solvent. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the reticulating agent and the matrix material can be a synthetic material, e.g., a material which is not of natural origin. For example, extracellular matrix materials of biological origin may be excluded from the components of the composite material. The reticulated material can be a rigid, substantially non-elastic material. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The term &#x201c;reticulating agent&#x201d; can refer to a material that can be oriented into a network or network-like structure under certain conditions described herein for converting a liquid mixture into a porous solidified composite material. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, reticulating agents can include materials that are capable of self-orienting or promoting self-orientation into a network or network-like structure. A &#x201c;network&#x201d; or &#x201c;network-like structure&#x201d; can be understood to refer to a regular and/or irregular three-dimensional arrangement which may have void space or pores within it. The porous structure of a reticulated material as described herein may, e.g., permit or promote growth of biological tissue thereon and/or proliferation of the tissue into the material.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139"> Additional fillers can be used to further modify the size and/or the degree of porosity. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, non-polymeric fillers may be used. Non-polymeric fillers can include compositions that can be removed or degraded, for example, by thermal treatment, washing out, or other techniques, without adversely affecting the material properties. Some fillers can be dissolvable in a suitable solvent and may be removed in this manner from the final material. Furthermore, non-polymeric fillers, which can be converted into soluble substances under certain thermal conditions, can also be used. Non-polymeric fillers may include, for example, anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactants, which can be removed and/or degraded under certain thermal conditions. Fillers can also include inorganic metal salts, particularly salts from alkaline and/or alkaline earth metals, such as alkaline or alkaline earth metal carbonates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, phosphites, halides, sulfides, and oxides. Other suitable fillers can comprise organic metal salts, e.g. alkaline or alkaline earth and/or transition metal salts, their formiates, acetates, propionates, malates, maleates, oxalates, tartrates, citrates, benzoates, salicylates, phthalates, stearates, phenolates, sulfonates, and amines, as well as mixtures thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"> In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, polymeric fillers can be used. Suitable polymeric fillers can include those mentioned herein above as encapsulation polymers, particularly if provided in the form of spheres or capsules. Certain examples may include saturated, linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, which can be homo- or copolymers, e.g. polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, polyisobutene, polypentene as well as copolymers and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, polymer particles formed of methacrylates or polystearine, as well as electrically conducting polymers as described herein above, e.g. polyacetylenes, polyanilines, poly(ethylenedioxythiophenes), polydialkylfluorenes, polythiophenes or polypyrroles, can also be used as polymeric fillers, e.g., for providing electrically conductive materials. </p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"> In the above-mentioned procedures, soluble fillers and polymeric fillers can be combined, where these fillers may be volatile under the thermal conditions used, e.g., in a solidification process, or they can be converted into volatile compounds during a thermal treatment. In this manner, pores formed by the polymeric fillers can be combined with pores formed by the reticulating agents and/or other fillers to achieve an isotropic or anisotropic pore distribution such as, for example, a hierarchical pore size distribution. </p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"> Suitable particle sizes of the non-polymeric fillers can be selcted based on the desired porosity and/or size of the pores of the resulting composite material. </p>

Suitable inorganic acids may include, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, or diluted hydrofluoric acid. Suitable bases may include, for example, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, carbonate, or organic amines. Suitable organic acids may include, for example, formic acid, acetic acid, trichloromethane acid, trifluoromethane acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, and mixtures thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"> Fillers can be partly or completely removed from the reticulated composite material, depending on the nature and time of treatment with the solvent. Complete removal of the filler after solidification may be preferred in certain applications. </p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"> The solidification procedure selected may depend on specific properties and composition of the liquid mixture used. Solidification may be achieved, e.g., by thermal treatment such as heating or cooling, variation of pressure, e.g. evacuation, flushing or ventilation, drying with gases, including inert gases, drying, freeze-drying, spray-drying, filtration, or chemical or physical curing or hardening, e.g., with the use of cross linkers, optionally combined with a thermal cross linking or radiation-induced cross linking, or any combinations thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"> Solidification may occur without significant decomposition of the matrix material or the combination of the reticulating agent and matrix material, e.g., without significant thermolysis or pyrolysis of the matrix material. The reticulating agent(s) may be embedded in the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"> Suitable solidification conditions such as temperature, atmosphere or pressure, can be selected to provide a substantially complete solidification based on the desired properties of the composite material being formed and the components used. </p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"> In additional exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the solidification procedure may include a phase separation of the liquid mixture into a solid phase and a liquid phase, e.g., by precipitating the solids from the liquid mixture. Such a phase separation or precipitation may facilitate or promote the development of a reticulated structure in the resulting composite material. The structural development may occur substantially before the solvents are removed, e.g., the phase separation or precipitation may be induced before removal of the at least one solvent. The phase separation or precipitation can be induced by removal of solvent, cross linking of the matrix material, and/or increasing the viscosity of the liquid mixture. </p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"> The increase in viscosity of the liquid mixture may be provided by, e.g., cross linking, curing, drying, rapidly increasing the temperature, rapidly lowering the temperature, or rapidly removing the solvent. &#x201c;Rapidly&#x201d; can refer to a time period less than about 5 hours, preferably less than about one hour, or within less than about 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes or less than about 2 minutes or less than about 1 minute after increasing of the viscosity is initiated. The time period required may depend on the mass of the liquid mixture being processed. </p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"> A thermal treatment may include heating or cooling in a temperature range between about &#x2212;78&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., and may include a heating process, a freezing process, a freeze-drying process, and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151"> The solvent can be removed from the liquid mixture prior to a thermal treatment. This can be achieved by filtration, or alternatively by a thermal treatment of the liquid mixture, e.g., by cooling or heating the liquid mixture to temperatures between about &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., between about &#x2212;100&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., or between about &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. Temperatures between about 0&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. or about 50&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. may also be used. An evaporation of the solvents at room temperature or in a stream of hot air or other gases can also be used. Drying may be performed by spray drying, freeze-drying, or similar conventional methods. </p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"> The solidification treatment may also include a thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, with or without prior removal of the solvent, which may be performed at temperatures between about 20&#xb0; C. to 4000&#xb0; C., or between about 100&#xb0; C. to 3500&#xb0; C. Temperatures between about 100&#xb0; C. and 2000&#xb0; C. or between about 150&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C. may also be used. The thermal treatment can optionally be performed under reduced pressure or vacuum, or in the presence of inert or reactive gases. </p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"> A solidification process that does not decompose any of the components can be performed at temperatures up to about 500&#xb0; C. In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it may be preferred to partially or totally carbonize, pyrolize or decompose at least one of the components of the composite material during or after the solidification process. This can be achieved at higher temperatures, which may range from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 4000&#xb0; C. These higher temperatures can be used in further exemplary embodiments of the present invention where an additional sintering step may be desired. </p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"> Sintering procedures at high temperatures, e.g., temperatures above 500&#xb0; C., may not be required or desired when forming certain composite materials, and treatment steps involving decomposition of matter, e.g., pyrolysis or carbonization steps, may preferably be avoided. The solidification procedure that may be performed in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be performed at temperatures between about 20&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C., or between about 30&#xb0; C. and 350&#xb0; C. Temperatures between about 40&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C., or below about 200&#xb0; C., e.g., between about 100&#xb0; C. and 190&#xb0; C., may also be used. </p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"> The solidification procedure can be performed in different atmospheres. For example, it can be performed in an inert atmosphere such as, for example, nitrogen, SF<sub>6</sub>, or a noble gas such as argon, or any mixtures thereof. The solidification procedure may also be performed in an oxidizing atmosphere comprising, e.g., oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen oxide. Furthermore, an inert atmosphere can be blended with reactive gases, e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane and butane, or mixtures thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"> In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the atmosphere in the solidification procedure, particularly when thermally treating the liquid mixture, can be an oxidizing atmosphere such as air, oxygen or oxygen enriched inert gases. Alternatively, the atmosphere during the solidification procedure can be substantially free of oxygen, e.g., the oxygen content may be below about 10 ppm, or even below about 1 ppm. </p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"> The solidification process can also be performed using laser applications, e.g., by using a selective laser sintering (SLS) technique, and/or may be radiation-induced, e.g., when using UV or gamma radiation to activate and cure cross linkers that can be present in the mixture. </p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"> Solid components can be precipitated from a solvent-based liquid mixture by thermal treatment, by cross linking, and/or by evaporating the solvent. A low viscosity of the liquid mixture may be preferred when forming a substantially homogeneous porous structure in the resulting composite material and/or to promote a network-like or reticulated orientation of particles in the liquid mixture, which may be accompanied by a rapid viscosity increase of the solid phase during the solidification procedure. This can be achieved by separating the solid phase from the solvent phase, where the temperature for this process may be selected based on the freezing point or the boiling point, respectively, of the solvent and the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"> If solidification is achieved by increasing the temperature of the mixture, the solvent may have a boiling point that is lower than the melting point of the matrix material by at least about 5&#xb0; C. and up to about 200&#xb0; C., between about 30&#xb0; C. and 200&#xb0; C. lower, or between about 40&#xb0; C. and 100&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the matrix material, so that there may be little or no reduction of the viscosity of the matrix material, and/or no melting or incomplete thermal decomposition of the matrix material or the reticulating agents during thermal treatment of the liquid mixture and/or during removal of the solvent. </p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"> In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a rapid lowering of the temperature may be used to solidify the liquid mixture. This can be achieved with liquid mixtures that may or may not include a solvent. In a solvent-based mixture, the solvent may have a boiling point that is at least 10&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. above the melting point of the matrix material, preferably about 20&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. higher, or more preferably about 30&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. above the melting point of the matrix material. </p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"> By providing a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution at a temperature close to that of the melting point of the matrix material, which may be a polymer, a network of the reticulating agents may be formed by rapidly lowering the temperature, resulting in a rapid increase of the viscosity of the liquid mixture. To incorporate the reticulating agents in the matrix material, the solvent phase can subsequently be removed from the liquid mixture by using, e.g., a vacuum treatment. </p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"> Cross linkers can be added to a dispersion, suspension or emulsion that may be provided as the liquid mixture. Cross linkers may include, for example, isocyanates, silanes, diols, di-carboxylic acids, (meth)acrylates, for example such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, propyltrimethoxysilane, 3-(trimethylsilyl)propyl methacrylate, isophoron diisocyanate, polyols, glycerin and the like. Biocompatible cross linkers such as glycerin, diethylentriaminoisocyanate and 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, may be preferred, e.g., if the liquid mixture is to be converted into the solid composite material at relatively low temperatures, e.g., below about 100&#xb0; C. </p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"> The composition and type of the cross linker can be selected such that the cross linking that may occur during solidification of the liquid mixture does not generate a significant viscosity change of the system before the solid composite phase has formed by phase separation or evaporation of the solvent. Cross linking may be interrupted, and components of the matrix material which are not already cross linked or only partially cross linked may be dissolved and removed by treating the system with suitable solvents, in order to modify the morphology and the overall structure of the composite material. </p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"> The liquid mixture and/or the formed composite material that may be used to form or coat the medical device may be subjected to further processing, depending on the particular intended use. For example, reductive or oxidative treatment procedures can be applied in which the solidified material or coating may be treated one or more times with suitable reducing agents and/or oxidizing agents such as, e.g., hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen, air, or nitrous oxide, or oxidizing acids such as nitric acid and the like, and optionally mixtures of these agents, to modify pore sizes and/or surface properties. Activation of surface properties with air may also be performed. This can be achieved at an elevated temperature, e.g., between about 40&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., or between about 70&#xb0; C. and 900&#xb0; C., or between about 100&#xb0; C. and 850&#xb0; C. Temperatures between, about 200&#xb0; C. and 800&#xb0; C. may also be used, or the selected temperature may be approximately 700&#xb0; C. The composite material produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention can also be modified by reduction or oxidation, or by a combination of these treatment steps at approximately room temperature. Boiling of the composite material in oxidizing acids or bases may also be used to modify surface and bulk properties. </p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"> The pore size and/or pore structure of the composite material formed can be varied according to the type of oxidizing agent or reducing agent used, the activation temperature selected, and/or the duration of the activation. The porosity can be adjusted by, e.g., washing out fillers that may be present in the composite material, as described above. These fillers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, powdered aluminum, fatty acids, microwaxes or emulsions thereof, paraffins, carbonates, dissolved gases or water-soluble salts, which may be removed, e.g., by treatment of the material with water, solvents, acids or bases, or by distillation or oxidative and/or non-oxidative thermal decomposition. Suitable treatment methods to achieve removal of fillers are described, for example, in German Patent Publication No. DE 103 22 187 and International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2004/005277. </p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"> The properties of the material produced may optionally be altered by structuring the surface with powdered substances such as, e.g., metal powder, carbon black, phenolic resin powder or fibers, including carbon fibers or natural fibers. </p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167"> The composite material may also be optionally subjected to a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process or a chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process to further modify the surface structure and/or pore structure and/or its physico-chemical properties. This can be achieved by treating the composite material or coating with suitable precursor gases that can release carbon at high temperatures. For example, a diamond-like carbon coating or film can be applied using these techniques. Other elements, such as silicon, may also be deposited onto or into the composite material using these conventional techniques. Many saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons having sufficient volatility under CVD conditions may be used as a precursor to split off carbon. Suitable ceramic precursors include, for example, BCl<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, silanes such as SiH<sub>4</sub>, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), dichlorodimethylsilane (DDS), methyltrichlorosilane (MTS), trichlorosilyldichloroborane (TDADB), hexadichloromethylsilyloxide (HDMSO), AlCl<sub>3</sub>, TiCl<sub>3 </sub>or mixtures thereof. Using CVD techniques, the size of pores in the material can be reduced in a controlled manner, or the pores may be completely closed and/or sealed. This exemplary process can allow controlled adjustment or variation of sorptive properties and/or mechanical properties of the composite material. The composite materials or coatings can be modified by a CVD process using silanes or siloxanes, optionally in a mixture with hydrocarbons, to form a carbide or oxycarbide, which can achieve increased resistance of the material to oxidation. </p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"> The materials or devices produced according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be further coated and/or modified using sputtering techniques or ion implantation/ion bombardment techniques. Carbon, silicon, metals and/or metal compounds can be applied using conventional techniques and suitable sputter targets. For example, by incorporating silicon compounds, titanium compounds, zirconium compounds, tantalum compounds or metals into the material using CVD or PVD techniques, carbide phases can be formed which may increase the stability and oxidation resistance of the material. </p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"> The composite material can also be worked mechanically to produce porous surfaces. For example, controlled abrasion of the surface layer(s) by suitable methods can lead to modified porous surface layers. One technique that may be used to achieve this can include cleaning and/or abrasion in an ultrasonic bath, where defects in the material and further porosity can be produced in a targeted manner by admixture of abrasive solids of various particle sizes and degrees of hardness, and by appropriate input of energy and a suitable frequency of the ultrasonic bath as a function of treatment time. Aqueous ultrasonic baths, to which alumina, silicates, aluminates or the like have been added, preferably alumina dispersions, may be used. Any solvent that is suitable for ultrasonic baths may also be used instead of or in combination with water. </p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170"> Ion implantation of metal ions, in particular transition metal ions and/or non-metal ions, can be used to further modify the surface properties of the composite material. For example, nitrogen implantation may be used to incorporate nitrides, oxynitrides or carbonitrides, in particular those of the transition metals. The porosity and strength of the surface of the materials can be further modified by implantation of carbon. </p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"> The composite reticulated materials can be further modified, e.g., by applying biodegradable, resorbable and/or non-biodegradable resorbable polymers, which optionally may be provided in a porous form, as a layer form or an overcoat onto the composite material. </p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"> Parylenation of the composite reticulated materials provided in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be performed before or after any activation procedure(s) described herein to further modify their surface properties and/or porosity. A device can first be treated with para-cyclophane at an elevated temperature, which may be approximately 600&#xb0; C., to form a polymer film of poly(p-xylylene) on the surface of the device. This film can optionally be converted to carbon using a subsequent conventional carbonization step. </p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"> If desired, the reticulated material may be subjected to additional chemical and/or physical surface modifications. Cleaning steps to remove residues and/or impurities that might be present can be performed on the composite material. For example, acids such as oxidizing acids, or solvents may be used, but boiling in acids or solvents may be used. Carboxylation of certain materials can be achieved by boiling in oxidizing acids. Washing with organic solvents, optionally combined with application of ultrasound energy, and optionally performed at elevated temperatures, may also be used for further processing of the devices. </p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"> The reticulated materials and devices formed therefrom may be sterilized using conventional methods, e.g., by autoclaving, ethylene oxide sterilization, pressure sterilization or gamma-radiation. The various modification and cleaning procedures described herein may be performed in any combination, depending on the components of the material formed and the desired properties. </p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"> Coatings or bulk compositions comprising the porous composite material may be structured in a suitable manner, before or after solidification, using such techniques as, for example, folding, embossing, punching, pressing, extruding, gathering, injection molding and the like. These techniques may be applied before or after the composite material is applied to the substrate or molded or formed. In this way, certain structures of a regular or irregular type can be incorporated, for example, into a coating produced using the composite material provided according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The composite material can be further processed using conventional techniques to provide a desired shape, e.g., by providing molded paddings and the like, or by forming coatings on medical devices. </p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"> The composite materials can be produced in any desired form. By applying multi-layered half-finished molded shapes, asymmetric constructions can be formed from the composite materials. The materials can be brought into the desired form by applying any appropriate conventional technique, including but not limited to casting processes such as sand casting, shell molding, full mold processes, die casting and centrifugal casting, or by pressing, sintering, injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, calendaring, fusion welding, pressure welding, jiggering, slip casting, dry pressing, drying, firing, filament winding, pultrusion, lamination, autoclave, curing or braiding. </p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"> Coatings of the reticulated material can be applied in a liquid, pulpy or pasty form, for example, by painting, furnishing, phase-inversion, dispersing atomizing or melt coating, extruding, die casting, slip casting, dipping or as a hot melt. Coatings may be applied directly in the form of the liquid mixture before solidification of the mixture is performed. If the coating material is already in a solid state, it may be applied on a suitable substrate by, e.g., powder coating, flame spraying, sintering or the like. Techniques such as, for example, dipping, spraying, spin coating, ink-jet-printing, tampon and microdrop coating or 3-D-printing may also be used to apply the liquid mixture onto a substrate. The application of the liquid mixture can be performed using a high frequency atomizing device such as, for example, the one described in International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2005/000041, or by print or roller coating using a device such as the one described, e.g., in International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/042045. Such devices and techniques may also be used to coat the medical device with additional agents, e.g. therapeutically or diagnostically active agents, or with further coatings as described herein below. A coating of the reticulated material can be provided, for example, by applying a layer of the liquid mixture to a medical device, drying it, and optionally performing a thermal treatment. </p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178"> Coated devices can be provided by a transfer process, in which the reticulated material may be applied to a device substrate in the form of a prepared lamination. The coated device can be dried, cured and the coating may then optionally be treated or further processed. A coated medical device can also be obtained using suitable printing procedures, e.g., gravure printing, scraping or blade printing, spraying techniques, thermal laminations, or wet-in-wet laminations. More than one thin layer can be applied, for example, to produce an error-free composite film. By applying the above-mentioned transfer procedures, multi-layer gradient films may be formed from different layers and/or different sequences of layers which, after the solidification procedure is performed, can provide gradient materials where the density of the reticulated material may vary with location in the film. </p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"> The liquid mixture can also be dried or thermally treated and then ground or pulverized using conventional techniques, for example, by grinding in a ball mill or a roller mill and the like. The pulverized composite material can be provided, for example, as a powder, a flat blank, a rod, a sphere, or a hollow sphere in different grainings, and can be processed using conventional techniques into granulates or extrudates in various forms. Hot-pressure-procedures, optionally accompanied by suitable binders, can be used to form the medical device or parts thereof from the reticulated material. </p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"> Additional processing options may include, for example, the formation of powders by other conventional techniques such as spray-pyrolysis or precipitation, or the formation of fibers by spinning techniques such as gel spinning. </p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"> By selecting the components and the processing conditions, the processes described herein allow, e.g., for the production of bioerodible or biodegradable materials, devices or coatings, and/or coatings of reticulated materials which may be dissolvable or which may be peeled off from substrates in the presence of physiologic fluids. For example, coatings may be produced which can be used in the medical field for coronary implants such as stents, where the coating may comprise a therapeutically and/or diagnostically active agent. </p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182"> In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the composite material can comprise at least one active agent for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes. The therapeutically and/or diagnostically active agent may be included in the medical device as a component of the reticulating agent, the matrix material or an additive, or it may be applied onto or into the composite material, e.g., after the solidification procedure is performed. </p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183"> A diagnostically active agent may include, for example, a marker, a contrast medium or a radiopaque material, and can be formed at least in part from one or more materials having signaling properties, e.g., materials that can produce a signal detectable by physical, chemical or biological detection methods. Examples of such materials are described above as reticulating agents. Further suitable diagnostic agents having signaling properties are described in, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/322,694, filed Dec. 30, 2005, and International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2005/013732. Certain matrix materials may also have signaling properties and thus may be used to provide a marker or a contrast medium. The composite reticulated material may also be suitably modified, for example, to allow for a controlled release of the diagnostic agent. The terms &#x201c;diagnostically active agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;diagnostic agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;agent for diagnostic purpose&#x201d; and &#x201c;marker&#x201d; can refer to such diagnostically active agents as described herein above. </p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"> Markers or agents having signaling properties can produce signals detectable by physical, chemical or biological detection techniques such as, e.g., x-ray techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, computer tomography techniques, scintigraphy techniques, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques, ultrasonic techniques, radiofrequency (RF) techniques, and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"> For example, metal-based reticulating agents which may be used as markers can be encapsulated in a polymer shell, and thus can be prevented from interfering with the composite material itself or a device on which it is coated. For example, a device can be made from an implant material, which may also comprise a metal, and interference between the two metal-containing compositions may lead to, e.g., electrocorrosion or similar undesirable effects. Coated implants may be produced which contain encapsulated markers, where the coating can remain on the implant permanently or for an extended period of time. </p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186"> Therapeutically active reticulating agents, if used, may be encapsulated in bioerodible or resorbable materials, which may optionally allow a controlled release of the active ingredient under physiologic conditions. Also, coatings or composite materials having a known and/or controlled porosity may be infiltrated or loaded with therapeutically active agents, which can be resolved or extracted in the presence of physiologic fluids. Thus, medical devices or implants may be provided which are capable of controllably releasing active agents. Examples of such devices include, and are not limited to drug eluting stents, drug delivery implants, drug eluting orthopedic implants and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"> The exemplary processes described herein may be used to produce, e.g., porous bone or tissue grafts (erodible and non-erodible), porous implants or joint implants, or porous traumatologic devices such as nails, screws or plates. Such devices may optionally be coated, and can further be provided, e.g., with enhanced engraftment properties, therapeutic functionality, and/or excitable radiating properties, e.g., for performing local radiation therapy of tissues and organs. </p>

Such optical coatings may be used for, e.g., advanced touch screens, large area displays, flexible displays, solar voltaic collectors with high specific surface area, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"> Average pore sizes of the composite materials provided in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be determined by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) techniques, adsorptive techniques such as gas adsorption or mercury intrusion porosimetry, or by chromatographic porosimetry. Porosity and specific surface areas may be determined by N<sub>2 </sub>or He absorption techniques, e.g., using an exemplary BET technique. Particle sizes, including those of the reticulating agents, may be determined using a CIS Particle Analyzer (Ankersmid), a TOT technique (Time-Of-Transition), an X-ray powder diffraction technique, a laser diffraction technique, or a TEM (Transmission-Electron-Microscopy) technique. Average particle sizes in suspensions, emulsions or dispersions may also be determined using, e.g., dynamic light scattering techniques. Solids contents of liquid mixtures may be determined using, e.g., gravimetric techniques or humidity measurements. </p>

Subsequently, the paste was converted into a dispersion by adding the remaining parent solution using a Pentraulik&#xae; dissolver for 15 minutes to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. </p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"> The dispersion was observed to contain a total solids content of about 3.5%, which was determined using a humidity measurement device (Sartorius MA 50).
