<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> In the field of wireless communications, a first wireless communication station may include multiple transceivers able to communicate, for example, with a second wireless communication station, a wireless access point, or a wireless servicing station or base station. For example, a first transceiver of the first wireless communication station may send and receive wireless signals in accordance with a first wireless communication standard or protocol, e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard; whereas a second transceiver of the wireless communication station may send and receive wireless signals in accordance with a second, different wireless communication standard or protocol, e.g., IEEE 802.16 standard. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The first wireless transceiver may interfere with the second wireless transceiver, e.g., due to possible phase noise, crosstalk, ElectroMagnetic Interference (EMI), or the like. Such interference may be reduced using an active component, e.g., a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), or a passive component, e.g., a filter, which may produce a cleaner signal. Unfortunately, the active component may consume significant power, whereas the passive component may reduce the signal quality and the transceiver's sensitivity. </p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Transceiver <b>141</b> may include, or may be operatively associated with, an interference reducer <b>151</b> able to reduce the noise of a wireless signal generated by transceiver <b>141</b> or able to otherwise reduce interference between two wireless communication signals. The interference reducer <b>151</b> may include, for example, an active component, e.g., an adaptive bias Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), and/or a passive component, e.g., a filter. Additionally or alternatively, transceiver <b>142</b> may include, or may be operatively associated with, an interference reducer <b>152</b>, and transceiver <b>143</b> may include, or may be operatively associated with, an interference reducer <b>153</b>. In one embodiment, interference reducers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and/or <b>153</b> may be an integral part or component of transceivers <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and/or <b>143</b>, respectively, for example, a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) having changeable bias, a Power Amplifier (PA) having changeable bias, a mixer having changeable bias, or the like. In another embodiment, interference reducers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and/or <b>153</b> may be a dedicated component operatively associated with transceivers <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and/or <b>143</b>, respectively. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Interference reducers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and/or <b>153</b> may have multiple operational modes. In one embodiment, for example, interference reducers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and/or <b>153</b> may be in an active mode in which the interference reducer is operational, or a non-active mode in which the interference reducer is substantially non operational. In another embodiment, for example, interference reducers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and/or <b>153</b> may have various operational modes, e.g., controllable by an adaptive bias VCO or other active component responsive to a supplied power level, as described below. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, prior to transmitting or receiving data, transceiver <b>141</b> may send a signal to IRC <b>123</b> indicating a property of the intended transmission or reception, e.g., an indication of a transmission or reception mode, or an indication that the intended transmission or reception is in accordance with a pre-defined standard or protocol; the uplink signal may be referred to herein as &#x201c;transmission/reception mode indication&#x201d; or &#x201c;activity mode indication&#x201d;. For example, transceiver <b>141</b> may send to IRC <b>123</b> a first signal over an uplink <b>171</b>, indicating that transceiver <b>141</b> is about to transmit or receive in accordance with the 802.11 standard. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> IRC <b>123</b> may store, e.g., in a mode list <b>124</b>, the transmission/reception mode indication received from transceiver <b>141</b>. The mode list <b>124</b> may be implemented, for example, as part of IRC <b>123</b> or memory unit <b>114</b>, and may be substantially empty upon activation of station <b>101</b>. If no other transmission/reception mode indications, e.g., originating from transceivers <b>142</b> and/or <b>143</b>, are already stored in memory unit <b>114</b>, then IRC <b>123</b> may send to transceiver <b>141</b> a signal over a downlink <b>181</b>., indicating that transceiver <b>141</b> need not activate the interference reducer <b>151</b>; the downlink signal may be referred to herein as &#x201c;mode selection signal&#x201d;. Transceiver <b>141</b> may receive the mode selection signal, and in response may deactivate interference reducer <b>151</b>, and may transmit in accordance with the 802.11 standard. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Then, prior to transmitting or receiving data by transceiver <b>142</b>, transceiver <b>142</b> may send to IRC <b>123</b> a transmission/reception mode indication over an uplink <b>172</b>, e.g., indicating that transceiver <b>142</b> is about to transmit or receive in accordance with <b>802</b>.<b>16</b> standard. IRC <b>123</b> may store, e.g., in mode list <b>124</b>, the transmission/reception mode indication received from transceiver <b>142</b>. IRC <b>123</b> may check if the transmission or reception intended by transceiver <b>142</b> may interfere with concurrent transmissions or receptions of transceiver <b>141</b> and/or transceiver <b>143</b>, e.g., based on prior transmission/reception mode indications. For example, IRC <b>123</b> may determine that memory unit <b>114</b> stores a prior transmission/reception mode indication, indicating that transceiver <b>141</b> transmits or receives in accordance with the 802.11 standard. Then, IRC <b>123</b> may determine whether there is possible interference between, for example, the signal transmitted or received using the transmission/reception mode of transceiver <b>141</b> and the signal intended for transmission or reception using the transmission/reception mode of transceiver <b>142</b>. Based on the determination results, IRC <b>123</b> may send one or more mode selection signals to transceivers <b>141</b> and/or <b>142</b>, e.g., indicating a requirement or instruction to activate, deactivate and/or modify an operational parameter of one or more interference reducers. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> For example, in one embodiment, IRC <b>123</b> may determine that no interference is expected if transceiver <b>142</b> transmits or receives wireless signals in accordance with the 802.16 standard while transceiver <b>141</b> transmits or receives wireless signals in accordance with the 802.11 standard. In such case, IRC <b>123</b> may send to transceiver <b>142</b> a mode selection signal over a downlink <b>182</b>, indicating that transceiver <b>142</b> need not activate the interference reducer <b>152</b>. Transceiver <b>142</b> may receive the mode selection signal, and in response may deactivate the interference reducer <b>152</b>, and may transmit in accordance with the 802.16 standard without noise reduction. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Conversely, IRC <b>123</b> may determine that interference is expected if transceiver <b>142</b> transmits or receives wireless signals in accordance with the 802.16 standard while transceiver <b>141</b> transmits or receives wireless signals in accordance with the 802.11 standard. In such case, IRC <b>123</b> may send to transceiver <b>142</b> a mode selection signal over downlink <b>182</b>, indicating that transceiver <b>142</b> is required or instructed to activate the interference reducer <b>152</b>. Additionally or alternatively, IRC <b>123</b> may send to transceiver <b>141</b> a mode selection signal over downlink <b>181</b>, indicating that transceiver <b>141</b> is required or instructed to activate the interference reducer <b>151</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Similarly, prior to transmitting or receiving data by transceiver <b>143</b>, transceiver <b>143</b> may send to IRC <b>123</b> a transmission/reception mode indication over an uplink <b>173</b>. IRC <b>123</b> may check for possible interference, and may send to transceiver <b>143</b> a mode selection signal over a downlink <b>183</b>, e.g., indicating a requirement or instruction to activate, deactivate and/or modify an operational parameter of interference reducer <b>153</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In some embodiments, IRC <b>123</b> may check for possible interference between signals of the different transmission/reception modes based on a pre-defined algorithm, table, lookup table, list, or the like. In one embodiment, for example, IRC <b>123</b> may include, e.g., in a lookup table <b>125</b>, pre-defined or pre-stored data indicating that transmission or reception of wireless signals using a first standard or protocol is expected to interfere with transmission or reception of wireless signals using a second standard or protocol, and hence may require activation of one or more interference reducers, or may require a certain setting of an operational parameter of one of more interference reducers. Additionally or alternatively, IRC <b>123</b> may include, e.g., in lookup table <b>125</b>, pre-defined data indicating that transmission or reception of wireless signals using a first standard or protocol is not expected to interfere with transmission or reception of wireless signals using a third standard or protocol, and hence may not require activation of one or more interference reducers. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> In some embodiments, IRC <b>123</b> may be implemented, for example, using hardware components and/or software components, e.g., able to estimate possible interference or able to determine expected interference. In some embodiments, for example, IRC <b>123</b> may be implemented as part of processor <b>111</b>, as part of transceiver <b>141</b>, or as a separate component of station <b>101</b> or system <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In some embodiments, a mode selection signal may include, for example, an indication to activate an interference reducer or noise reducer, an indication to deactivate an interference reducer or noise reducer, an indication to modify or set a property, e.g., a power or voltage level, of an interference reducer or noise reducer, an indication to bypass an interference reducer or noise reducer, or the like. </p>
