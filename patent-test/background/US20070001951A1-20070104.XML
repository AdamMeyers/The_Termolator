<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates generally to the field of power management; and, more specifically, to techniques for reducing power consumption of displays. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Computer systems are becoming increasingly pervasive in our society, including everything from small handheld electronic devices, such as personal data assistants and cellular phones, to application-specific electronic devices, such as set-top boxes, digital cameras, and other consumer electronics, to medium-sized mobile systems such as notebook, sub-notebook, and tablet computers, to desktop systems, workstations, and servers. Computer systems typically include one or more processors. A processor may manipulate and control the flow of data in a computer. To provide more powerful computer systems for consumers, processor designers strive to continually increase the operating speed of the processor. As processor speed increases, the power consumed by the processor tends to increase as well. When the power is based on batteries, high power consumption may reduce the battery life. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> One approach to reducing overall power consumption of a computer system is to change the focus of power reduction from the processor to other devices that have a significant impact on power. These other devices may include, for example, a display, an input/output (I/O) device, a memory, etc. Studies have shown that the display may consume as much as 30% to 40% of the total platform average power. In order to achieve a continuing goal of extending the battery life, techniques are being developed to reduce the power consumption of the display. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In some embodiments, a display system may include a color cylinder and a light source. The color cylinder may include at least three color segments. As the color cylinder rotates, light from the light source is filtered by one of the three color segments. The filtered light is used to control color of information to be displayed on a liquid crystal display (LCD). </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known structures, processes, and devices are shown in block diagram form or are referred to in a summary manner in order to provide an explanation without undue detail. </p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000"> Display System </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a prior art display system. The display system may be a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Typically, from the front, LCD monitor <b>101</b> may include a first polarizer <b>115</b>A, a first glass substrate <b>105</b>A, color filters <b>106</b>, a liquid crystal (LC) matrix <b>110</b> and spacer balls <b>111</b>, a second glass substrate <b>105</b>B, a second polarizer <b>115</b>B, a light guide <b>103</b>, and a light diffuser <b>104</b>. The color filters <b>106</b> may be etched onto the first glass substrate <b>105</b>A. The second glass substrate <b>105</b>B may include pixels electronics <b>114</b>. The pixel electronics <b>114</b> may include transistors and storage capacitors (not shown) and are used to control light passing through the LC matrix <b>110</b>. On each side of the LC matrix <b>110</b> may be an alignment film (not shown). </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> A light source <b>120</b> (also referred to as a back light) is positioned near the light guide <b>103</b>. Light from the light source <b>120</b> is transmitted by the light guide <b>103</b> and the light diffuser <b>104</b> to the light polarizer <b>115</b>B. The light polarizer <b>115</b>B may then distribute the light uniformly to the LC matrix <b>110</b>. Display data may be delivered to the LCD monitor <b>101</b> by a graphics controller <b>150</b> associated with a processor <b>160</b> within computer system <b>100</b>. Although not shown, the computer system <b>100</b> may also include other components (e.g., memory, bus, etc.) that may be used to control information to be displayed on the LCD monitor <b>101</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The LC matrix <b>110</b> (also referred to as a thin film transistor (TFT) matrix) may include multiple cells, as illustrated in an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Each cell may represent a pixel (picture element) such as, for example, pixel <b>175</b>. Each pixel from the LC matrix <b>110</b> may be associated with pixel electronics. Typically, each pixel is comprised of three sub-pixels. For example, the pixel <b>175</b> may include sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C. The higher the resolution of the LCD monitor <b>101</b>, the higher the number of pixels (and accordingly the number of sub-pixels) and the higher the number of pixel electronics. For example, for an LCD display with XGA (extended graphics array) resolution, the number of pixels may be 1024&#xd7;768&#xd7;3 with the last multiplier reflecting the number of sub-pixels. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Each sub-pixel may be associated with a primary color (e.g., red, green, or blue). The pixel electronics <b>114</b> may include a transistor that acts as a switch to control the light passing through each of the sub-pixels. The light that passes through may then go through the color filter <b>106</b> which may filter all colors except for the primary color that the sub-pixel is associated with. The color filter (also referred to as micro-filters) <b>106</b> may be integrated into the first glass substrate <b>105</b>A. For example, the sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C may be associated with a red, green, and blue filter, respectively. This is illustrated in an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The amount of light that the pixel electronics <b>176</b>A allow passing through the sub-pixel <b>175</b>A (associated with the red filter) depend on the properties of the data to be displayed at the pixel <b>175</b>. For example, when the data <b>180</b> is to be displayed (at the pixel <b>175</b>) in a specific color, the pixel electronics <b>176</b>A, <b>176</b>B and <b>176</b>C may allow different levels of light to pass through to the three sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C, respectively. In this example, the combination of the different light level passing through the sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C (and filtered by the red, green and blue filters, respectively) may be viewed by a user as the desired color. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> It may be noted that the data <b>180</b> may be delivered to the pixel <b>175</b> at every frame interval (also referred to as a frame refresh rate), and the color of the data is displayed to the user via the red, green and blue filters at the same time during the frame interval. For example, when the frame refresh rate is 60 Hz, the colors red, green, and blue may also be transmitted via the sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C simultaneously at 60 Hz and until the next frame refresh. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the sub-pixels <b>175</b>A, <b>175</b>B and <b>175</b>C may be separated from one another by vertical grid lines <b>185</b>A and <b>185</b>B. There may also be horizontal and vertical grid lines separating adjacent pixels. These grid lines may be wires associated one or more sub-pixels within the liquid crystal matrix <b>110</b>. For example, the wires may be used to carry signals to the pixel electronics <b>176</b>A, <b>176</b>B and <b>176</b>C. When there are more pixels (e.g., higher resolution), there are more wires. The number of wires may occupy a large percentage of the LC matrix <b>110</b> and may substantially block the light that is delivered by the light polarizer <b>115</b>B. In addition to the wires, the pixel electronics <b>176</b>A, <b>176</b>B and <b>176</b>C may also block the light that is delivered by the light polarizer <b>115</b>B. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> Let aperture ratio be defined as a percentage of an LCD display that may not be blocked by any pixel electronics and grid lines, the following formula may provide an approximation of such a ratio:

 where A<sub>pixel </sub>is the transmissive area of the pixel, A<sub>TFT </sub>is the area occupied by the TFT (or pixel electronics) in each pixel, and A<sub>Line </sub>is the area occupied by the row and column grid lines for each pixel. For a high definition LCD display having a resolution of 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels, the aperture ratio may be approximately 60%. To compensate for the low aperture ratio, the intensity of the light source <b>120</b> may need to be increased to increase the brightness resulting in higher power consumption.

 Color Cylinder 
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates one example of a color cylinder, in accordance with one embodiment. Color cylinder <b>200</b> may include a cavity and may be coupled to a light source assembly (or light source) <b>210</b>. The color cylinder <b>200</b> may be coupled to the light guide <b>104</b> and the light diffuser <b>104</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The light source <b>210</b> may be positioned at substantially along the center axis and the length of the color cylinder <b>200</b>. For one embodiment, the color cylinder <b>200</b> may be cylindrical in shape and its circumference may include color segments. There may be at least three color segments, each associated with a primary color. For example, the color segments <b>205</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> are associated with the color red, green and blue (or red, blue, and green) respectively. Alternatively, the number of color segments may be in multiples of three in similar pattern. For example, the number of color segments may be six (6) or nine (9) following the pattern red, green, and blue. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> For one embodiment, the color segments <b>205</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> may each occupy approximately one third of the circumference of the color cylinder <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Alternatively, the size of each of the color segments may be different from one another. For example, the color cylinder <b>200</b> may have a larger red color segment and blue segment. The color segments may serve as global color filters of the light transmitted by the light source <b>210</b>. It may be noted that this is different from having the multiple color micro-filters being associated with the glass substrate <b>105</b>A as described above. Having the color filters implemented in the color cylinder <b>200</b> may eliminate the need for the micro-filters integrated on the glass substrate <b>105</b>A and reduce the manufacturing complexity and the associated costs. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> For one embodiment, the light source <b>210</b> may be based on CCFL (Cold cathode fluorescent lighting) technology. It may be noted that there may be multiple CCFL light sources. In this situation, there may be one color cylinder for each CCFL light source, and the operation of the cylinders may need to be coordinated so that the same color is distributed by the light polarizer <b>115</b>B (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> For another embodiment, the light source <b>210</b> may be based on LED (light emitting diode) technology. It may be noted when the light source <b>210</b> includes one or more LEDs, the LEDs may all emit the same color. For one embodiment, the color of the light from the light source <b>210</b> may be white. One advantage of using white light LEDs or CCFL light is that they are relatively inexpensive comparing to other types of light sources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates color cylinder <b>250</b> as one alternative embodiment having triangular shape and three color segments <b>255</b>, <b>256</b> and <b>257</b>. Other embodiments may be possible as long as they have color segments and a cavity to house a light source such as the light source <b>210</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> For one embodiment, the color cylinder <b>200</b> may rotate along its axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The rotation may be clockwise or counter clockwise. The rotation may allow a different primary color to be transmitted by the combination of the light source <b>210</b> and the color cylinder <b>200</b> to the light polarizer <b>115</b>B. The light polarizer <b>115</b>B may help distribute the primary color light evenly to a LC matrix <b>110</b>. The color cylinder <b>200</b> may rotate at a certain rotation speed to enable the same primary color light to be transmitted to the light polarizer <b>115</b>B for a certain length of time (referred to herein as color segment interval). It may be noted that at any one time, only one primary color is transmitted to the light polarizer <b>115</b>B. The other two primary colors may be absorbed.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of an improved pixel, in accordance with one embodiment. Pixel <b>300</b> is different from the pixel described in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> because pixel <b>300</b> may not include three sub-pixels and wires separating the sub-pixels. Furthermore, because there are no sub-pixels, the overall number of pixels is reduced by approximately three times. The pixel <b>300</b> may need only one pixel electronics <b>305</b> (instead of three) to control the light passing through the pixel <b>300</b>. When the light polarizer <b>115</b>B distributes a primary color light from the combination of the light source <b>210</b> and the color cylinder <b>200</b>, the pixel electronics <b>305</b> may cause the primary color light to be blocked or pass through. Thus, at any one time, the user may see the display as all red, all green, or all blue. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The reduction in the number of pixels by there times, and the reduction in the number of grid lines (e.g., wires) may significantly reduce the blockage of light from the light polarizer and enhance the brightness of the display.

 Note that the total number of pixel electronics and grid lines are divided by three. With the LCD display having 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels, the aperture ratio may be &#x3e;80%. Thus for a similar display brightness, the power consumption associated with the light may be reduced by more than 20% in this example.

 Speed of Rotation of the Color Cylinder 
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> It is recognized that by increasing the speed of displaying each of the three primary colors one after another and by varying the amount of light that is allowed to pass through a pixel, a user may perceive the pixel as being shown in different colors. For one embodiment, the time for the color cylinder <b>200</b> to complete one rotation may be the same as the frame interval, as described above. Thus, because the color cylinder <b>200</b> may include three color segments, a color segment interval may be approximately the same as one third of the frame interval when the color segments have approximately the same size. As the color cylinder <b>200</b> rotates, a different primary color may be transmitted to the light polarizer <b>115</b>B at every color segment interval. It may be noted that the rotation of the color cylinder <b>200</b> may consume a certain amount of power. However, this may be small compared to the power savings associated with the light source <b>210</b> using the techniques described. </p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000"> Sub-Frames </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a frame controller and sub-frames, in accordance with one embodiment. For one embodiment, a data frame may be divided into at least three sub-frames. For example, frame <b>400</b> may be divided into three sub-frames <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B and <b>400</b>C. Alternatively, there may be multiples of three sub-frames. For one embodiment, each of the sub-frames may be associated with a primary color. For example, the sub-frame <b>400</b>A may include data to be displayed in the color red; the sub-frame <b>400</b>B may include data to be displayed in the color green; the sub-frame <b>400</b>C may include data to be displayed in the color blue. The frame division may be performed by logic referred to herein as frame controller <b>415</b>. The frame controller <b>415</b> may be associated with an improved LCD monitor having the pixels as described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and a color cylinder as described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Alternatively, the frame controller <b>415</b> may be associated with the graphics controller <b>150</b>. The frame controller <b>415</b> may be implemented in software, hardware or a combination of both software and hardware. </p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000"> Synchronization </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The frame controller <b>415</b> may receive rotation information associated with a color cylinder (e.g., color cylinder <b>200</b>). The rotation information may include color segment information <b>410</b>. The frame controller <b>415</b> may use the rotation information and the color segment information <b>410</b> to synchronize with a sub-frame to be displayed. For example, when the color segment information <b>410</b> indicates that the current color segment is red (block <b>410</b>A), the frame controller <b>415</b> may deliver the sub-frame <b>400</b>A, etc. It may be noted that the data associated with the sub-frame <b>400</b>A can include those that may be displayed in a color that needs the color red as a primary color. Depending on how much of the color red is needed at the pixel level, the pixel electronics <b>305</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may control the level of the red light to pass through. As mentioned above, in this example a user may see the display as all red. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> For one embodiment, the data associated with each sub-frame may be displayed for a time interval that is approximately equal to the color segment interval. For example, when the frame controller <b>415</b> synchronizes the color segment information <b>410</b> with the sub-frame to be displayed, the time that the primary color is distributed by the light polarizer <b>115</b>B may be similar to the time the sub-frame associated with the same primary color is shown on the improved LCD display. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the time that the red color is distributed by the light polarizer <b>115</b>B (block <b>410</b>A) may be similar to the time that the sub-frame associated with the red color is displayed (block <b>400</b>A). It may be noted that as the rotation of the color cylinder (e.g., cylinder <b>200</b>) transitions from the red segment (block <b>410</b>A) to the green segment (block <b>410</b>B), the frame controller <b>415</b> may transition from the sub-frame <b>400</b>A to the sub-frame <b>400</b>B. It may also be noted that when there are multiples of three color segments or when the sizes of the color segments are not similar, the frame controller <b>415</b> may need to be synchronize the sub-frames accordingly. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> To support the displaying of the three sub-frames within a frame interval, the LC material employed in the LCD matrix <b>110</b> may need to be faster than they are in the traditional LC matrix. For example, in the traditional LCD monitors, an LC response time of 20-25 ms may be considered adequate. To support the techniques described herein, the LC response time may need to be at least three-times as fast (e.g. &#x2dc;8 ms). </p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000"> Process </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a process that may be used to control the displaying of the sub-frames, in accordance with one embodiment. The process assumes that the color cylinder is rotating and that the sequence of the color segments is red segment, green segment and blue segment. Other sequence may also be used. In this example, as shown in block <b>505</b>, the red color segment of the color cylinder is currently used as a color filter. This information is received by the frame controller <b>415</b> and used to cause the sub-frame associated with the red color to be displayed, as shown in block <b>510</b>. At block <b>515</b>, a test is performed to determine if the color cylinder rotates from the red color segment to the green color segment. If the transition to the green color segment has not taken place, the process flows to block <b>510</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> continues to display the sub-frame associated with the red color. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> If the transition from the red segment to the green segment takes place, the process flows to block <b>520</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> displays the sub-frame associated with the green color instead of the sub-frame associated with the red color. At block <b>525</b>, a test is performed to determine if the color cylinder rotates from the green color segment to the blue color segment. If the transition to the blue color segment has not taken place, the process flows to block <b>520</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> continues to display the sub-frame associated with the green color. If the transition from the green segment to the blue segment takes place, the process flows to block <b>530</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> displays the sub-frame associated with the blue color instead of the sub-frame associated with the green color. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> At block <b>535</b>, a test is performed to determine if the color cylinder rotates from the blue color segment to the red color segment. This situation occurs when the color cylinder completes one rotation. If the transition to the red color segment has not taken place, the process flows to block <b>530</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> continues to display the sub-frame associated with the green color. If the transition from the blue segment to the red segment takes place, the process flows to block <b>510</b> where the frame controller <b>415</b> displays the sub-frame associated with the red color instead of the sub-frame associated with the blue color. It may be noted that the total length of time that the three sub-frames are displayed may be approximately the same as the frame interval. Thus, it may be possible that when the process returns to block <b>510</b>, the frame controller <b>415</b> may display a different sub-frame associated with the red color. </p>
