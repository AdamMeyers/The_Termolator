<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to a single-lens reflex camera system n which an image pickup lens can be changed, and particularly relates to a setting and a control of a diaphragm value during photographing. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Description of Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Among the conventional single-lens reflex camera systems, there was a system in which a photographing diaphragm value is set in an operator that is mounted on a single-lens reflex camera body (hereinafter, called a body unit), and also there was a system in which the photographing diaphragm value is set in an operator mounted on a lens unit that is changeable with respect to the body unit. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In the system in which various kinds of operations are performed in an operator that is mounted on the body unit, the setting of the diaphragm value in a diaphragm driving mechanism that is mounted on the lens unit is performed in the operator in the body, and thus the photographer may be confused until he/she becomes accustomed to the operations. Whereas, in the system in which the diaphragm value is set in the operator that is mounted on the lens unit, the diaphragm driving mechanism and the operator are mounted on the lens unit, and thus the photographer is not likely to be confused as mentioned above. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Moreover, conventionally, considering the compatibility with the system in which the diaphragm value can be set in the lens unit, some systems in which the diaphragm value also can be set in the operator in the body unit exist. However, in such systems, since the diaphragm driving mechanism and a diaphragm value setting portion in the lens unit are linked mechanically, there are problems in that the setting may be limited (for example, the diaphragm value setting portion must be provided at a certain position in the lens unit), or the operation may be complicated. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> JP 7(1995)-311405 A discloses a technique that improves the operation of the diaphragm setting by providing the diaphragm value setting portion in the lens unit. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> However, in the configuration disclosed in JP 7(1995)-311405 A, there is a problem in that, when the lens unit that does not include the diaphragm value setting portion is attached to the body, the diaphragm value cannot be set. For example, there is a problem of incapability of photographing in a diaphragm priority mode. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Therefore, with the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to enable to set the diaphragm value easily, even in the case where the lens unit on which the operator that is capable of diaphragm adjustment, such as a diaphragm ring, is not mounted is attached to the body unit. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In order to attain the above-mentioned object, the single-lens reflex camera body of the present invention has a configuration to which a first lens unit provided with a diaphragm ring that is capable of adjusting a diaphragm value by a rotating operation, and a second lens unit that is not provided with the diaphragm ring can be attached/detached selectively, the single-lens reflex camera body comprising: a rotation operator which accepts a rotating operation to adjust a diaphragm value of the first lens unit or the second lens unit that is attached to the single-lens reflex camera body; and a controller which transmits the diaphragm value that is adjusted at the rotation operator to the first lens unit or the second lens unit that is attached to the single-lens reflex camera body, and having a configuration where an operating direction of the diaphragm ring when a rotating operation is performed at the diaphragm ring to adjust the diaphragm value is the same as an operating direction of the rotation operator when the rotating operation is performed at the rotation operator. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Moreover, the lens unit of the present invention is capable of being attached/detached with respect to the single-lens reflex camera body and capable of performing data communication with the single-lens reflex camera body, the lens unit comprising: a diaphragm portion that is disposed on an optical axis of an incident optical image, and can limit a light amount to be passed through; and a diaphragm setting portion that controls to drive the diaphragm portion, based on data of the diaphragm value transmitted from the single-lens reflex camera body. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Furthermore, the single-lens reflex camera system of the present invention is a single-lens reflex camera system comprising a single-lens reflex camera body and a lens unit, wherein the single-lens reflex camera body comprising: a rotation operator which accepts a rotating operation to adjust a diaphragm value of a first lens unit or a second lens unit that is attached to the single-lens reflex camera body; and a controller which transmits the diaphragm value that is adjusted at the rotation operator to the first lens unit or the second lens unit that is attached to the single-lens reflex camera body, and having a configuration where an operating direction of a diaphragm ring when a rotating operation is performed at the diaphragm ring to adjust the diaphragm value is the same as an operating direction of the rotation operator when the rotating operation is performed at the rotation operator, the lens unit being the first lens unit provided with the diaphragm ring that is capable of adjusting a diaphragm value by a rotating operation; or the second lens unit that is not provided with the diaphragm ring, being capable of being attached/detached with respect to the single-lens reflex camera body and capable of performing data communication with the single-lens reflex camera body, and comprising: a diaphragm portion that is disposed on an optical axis of an incident optical image, and can limit a light amount to be passed through; and a diaphragm setting portion that controls to drive the diaphragm portion, based on the diaphragm value transmitted from the single-lens reflex camera body. </p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The release switch <b>124</b> is composed of a push button, by which a half push and a full push can be performed. The half push means an operation for pushing the push button in a stroke direction only by a small distance (for example, about a half of the entire stroke distance of the push button). The full push means an operation for pushing the push button by the entire stroke distance. In the release switch <b>124</b>, the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is turned on when performing the half push, and the switch <b>124</b><i>b </i>is turned on when performing the full push. </p>

The numeric values of 2 to 2000 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> denote values of the shutter speed that are preset in the body unit <b>1</b>. For example, &#x201c;2&#x201d; denotes the shutter speed of &#xbd; seconds, and &#x201c;2000&#x201d; denotes the shutter speed of 1/2000 seconds. Moreover, &#x201c;A&#x201d; denotes a mode in which the camera system automatically sets the shutter speed based on an ambient light amount, the diaphragm value and/or the like. By setting &#x201c;A&#x201d; at a mark <b>121</b><i>a</i>, the camera system automatically can set the shutter speed to be most appropriate, depending on a light amount in a photographing environment and a zoom ratio.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> After completing the displacement of the sub-mirror <b>108</b> and the main mirror <b>109</b>, the signal processor <b>101</b> instructs the image pickup device driver <b>113</b> to drive the image pickup device <b>106</b>, and instructs the mechanism controller <b>103</b> to operate the shutter <b>107</b>. The mechanism controller <b>103</b> opens the shutter <b>107</b> during a time corresponding to a shutter speed that is calculated based on the light amount information measured by the photometric sensor and the target diaphragm value, thereby exposing the image pickup device <b>106</b> to light. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> After the completion of the exposure of the image pickup device <b>106</b> to light, the signal processor <b>101</b> controls the image pickup device driver <b>113</b>, and reads out pickup data from the image pickup device <b>106</b>. The read-out pickup data is converted into digital image data in the signal processor <b>101</b>. The digital image data is output to the displaying portion <b>105</b>, and the displaying portion <b>105</b> can display the image.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, while the body unit <b>1</b> and the lens unit <b>2</b> are in operation pausing states (A<b>1</b>, B<b>1</b>), when the release button <b>124</b> is half-pushed so as to turn on the switch <b>124</b><i>a</i>, the body unit <b>1</b> and the lens unit <b>2</b> are subjected to startup processes (A<b>2</b>, B<b>2</b>). During the startup processes, the lens unit <b>2</b> transmits various kinds of lens information to the body unit <b>1</b>. Herein, the lens information transmitted from the lens unit <b>2</b> includes: information AV_Ring on the presence/absence of the diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> and the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b>; diaphragm value information Open AV at the time of opening; minimum diaphragm value information Min_AV; and setting information AV_Ring_Value of the diaphragm value setting portion that is mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> Next, the body unit <b>1</b> detects a focus in order to perform the focusing operation (A<b>3</b>).

After the completion of the driving of the focusing lens portion <b>205</b>, the lens unit <b>2</b> transmits operation completion information Move_Fin to the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> The body unit <b>1</b> detects the focus again after receiving the completion information Move_Fin, and calculates the Df amount (A<b>6</b>).

The lens unit <b>2</b> receives the resetting command AP_Rst, and allows the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> to be in the open state (B<b>6</b>).

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> Firstly, while the single-lens reflex camera system is in the operation pausing state (Step S<b>1</b>), the sequence processor <b>100</b> waits until the release button <b>124</b> is half-pushed so as to turn on the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>(Step S<b>2</b>). When the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is turned on, electricity is supplied to each of the circuits and the like in the system. Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> so as to perform a startup operation (Step S<b>3</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> Next, the body unit <b>1</b> communicates with the lens unit <b>2</b>, and lens information that is stored in the lens unit controller <b>200</b> is transmitted to the sequence processor <b>100</b> (Step S<b>4</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> The sequence processor <b>100</b> analyzes the received lens information, and judges the presence or absence of the diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> and the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b> (Step S<b>5</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In the case where the diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> and the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> are mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b>, the lens unit controller <b>200</b> obtains a set diaphragm value from the diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> (Step S<b>6</b><i>a</i>). Next, the lens unit controller <b>200</b> sends the set diaphragm value to the sequence processor <b>100</b>. Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the target diaphragm value to the set diaphragm value that is selected at the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>. Moreover, when an A-position is selected at the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the target diaphragm value at a value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; (Step S<b>6</b><i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> Whereas, when the diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> and the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> are not mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b>, the sequence processor <b>100</b> obtains the set diaphragm value that is set at the rotation operator <b>123</b> (Step S<b>7</b><i>a</i>). Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the target diaphragm value at the set diaphragm value that is set at the rotation operator <b>123</b>. Moreover, when the diaphragm setting in the body unit <b>1</b> is at the A-position, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the target diaphragm value at the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; (Step S<b>7</b><i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> judges whether the target diaphragm value is the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; or not (Step S<b>8</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"> In the case where the target diaphragm value is not the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; (that is, the case where the diaphragm value is set at a numeric value), the sequence processor <b>100</b> judges whether the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> is set at the A-position or not (Step S<b>10</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> In the case where the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> is set at the A-position, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transfers the camera system to be in a diaphragm priority mode (A mode), and sets a control TV value at the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; (Step S<b>13</b>). The control TV value denotes a shutter speed at the time when actually performing a shutter operation, and can be set by a shutter setting portion <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Herein, the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d; denotes a shutter speed that is set automatically by the camera system. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> Whereas, when the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> is not at the A-position, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transfers the camera system to be in a manual mode (M mode), and sets the control TV value at the value of the shutter speed that is set at the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> (Step S<b>14</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> Moreover, in Step S<b>8</b>, in the case where the target diaphragm value is &#x201c;FF&#x201d;, the sequence processor <b>100</b> judges whether the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> is set at the A-position or not (Step S<b>9</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"> In the case where the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b> is set at the A-position, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transfers the camera system to be in a program mode (P mode), and sets the target diaphragm value at the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d;. Moreover, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the control TV value at the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"> Whereas, in the case where the shutter speed setting portion is not set at the A-position, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transfers the camera system to be in a shutter speed priority mode (S mode), and sets the target diaphragm value at the value &#x201c;FF&#x201d;. In addition to this, the sequence processor <b>100</b> sets the control TV value at the value of the shutter speed that is set at the shutter speed setting portion <b>121</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> As mentioned above, by setting the diaphragm and the shutter speed, any one of the P mode, the S mode, the A mode and the M mode is set. Next, the body unit <b>1</b> detects a focus by controlling the focus detector <b>104</b> (Step S<b>15</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> The sequence processor <b>100</b> judges whether the detected Df amount is in a focusing range or not (Step S<b>16</b>). When the Df amount is out of the focusing range, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transmits a command Move_DFXX to the lens unit controller <b>200</b> so as to drive the focusing lens portion <b>205</b> by the Df amount (Step S<b>17</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"> Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> waits for the driving completion information Move_Fin of the focusing lens from the lens unit <b>2</b>, and, when the lens unit <b>2</b> transmits the driving completion information Move_Fin, the process is returned to Step <b>15</b>, thereby repeating the focus detecting operation (Step S<b>18</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"> When the Df amount is decreased to be extremely small over the course of time and comes into the focusing range (Result Y in Step S<b>16</b>), the sequence processor <b>100</b> terminates the focus detecting operation in the focus detector <b>104</b>, and detects brightness (photometric value) of the subject to be photographed (Step S<b>19</b><i>a</i>). The sequence processor <b>100</b> determines the target diaphragm value and the control TV value, depending on the detected photometric value and the exposing mode (any of the P mode, the S mode, the Amode and the M mode) (Step S<b>19</b><i>b</i>). Next, the sequence processor <b>100</b> detects whether the switch <b>124</b><i>b </i>is on or not (Step S<b>20</b>), and if the switch <b>124</b><i>b </i>is still off, the sequence processor <b>100</b> subsequently detects whether the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is off or not (Step S<b>21</b>). If the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is off, it is considered that the photographer stopped pushing the release button <b>124</b> so as to discontinue the photographing operation. At this time, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transmits the operation pausing command L_spd to the lens unit <b>2</b> (Step S<b>33</b>). Thereby, the lens unit <b>2</b> performs the operation pausing process, and subsequently comes into the operation pausing state. Moreover, the body unit <b>1</b> also performs the operation pausing process (Step S<b>34</b>), and comes into the operation pausing state (Step S<b>35</b>). Thereafter, the sequence processor <b>100</b> returns to Step S<b>2</b>, and waits until the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is turned on again. </p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"> Moreover, in Step S<b>20</b>, when being operated so as to turn on the switch <b>124</b><i>b</i>, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transmits a command Move_APAV to the lens unit <b>2</b>, and controls the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> so that the diaphragm amount thereof is the target diaphragm value (Step S<b>22</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"> The sequence processor <b>100</b> performs the mirror-up control (Step S<b>23</b>) after transmitting the command to the lens unit <b>2</b>. After the completion of the mirror-up control, the sequence processor <b>100</b> achieves a shutter control, and performs the exposing operation (Step S<b>24</b>). Subsequently, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transmits, to the lens unit <b>2</b>, a command AP_Rst to allow the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> to perform resetting driving to be at the opening position (Step S<b>25</b>). Next, the mechanism controller <b>103</b> performs the mirror-down control and a control to place the shutter at the initial position (reset shutter charge) (Step S<b>26</b>). The signal processor <b>101</b> reads out the image data from the image pickup device <b>106</b> (Step S<b>27</b>). Subsequently, the image data that is read out from the image pickup device <b>106</b> is subjected to image processing at the signal processor <b>101</b> (Step S<b>28</b>). Thereafter, the signal processor <b>101</b> allows the displaying portion <b>105</b> to display the image data that has been subjected to the image processing (Step S<b>29</b>). Next, the signal processor <b>101</b> records the image data into the information medium via the memory unit <b>102</b> (Step S<b>30</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"> Moreover, after transmitting the command AP_Rst to the lens unit <b>2</b>, the sequence processor <b>100</b> waits until the lens unit <b>2</b> transmits the information AP_RstFin on the completion of the resetting operation (Step S<b>31</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"> When receiving the information AP_RstFin, the sequence processor <b>100</b> subsequently judges whether the release button <b>124</b> is half-pushed so as to turn on the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>or not (Step S<b>32</b>). When the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is turned on, the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref> to <b>4</b>E is repeated again from the focus detecting operation (Step S<b>15</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"> Moreover, when the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is off, it is considered that the photographer has released his/her finger from the release button <b>124</b> so as to complete the photographing operation. In this case, the sequence processor <b>100</b> transmits the operation pausing command L_spd to the lens unit <b>2</b> (Step S<b>33</b>). Thereby, the lens unit <b>2</b> is subjected to the operation pausing process, and then comes into the operation pausing state. Furthermore, the body unit <b>1</b> also performs the operation pausing process (Step S<b>34</b>), and comes into the operation pausing state (Step S<b>35</b>). Thereafter, the sequence processor <b>100</b> returns to Step S<b>2</b>, and waits until the switch <b>124</b><i>a </i>is turned on again. </p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000"> [Setting of Diaphragm Value]</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"> Next, a method for setting the diaphragm value in the single-lens reflex camera system will be described. There are roughly two types of methods for setting the diaphragm value in the single-lens reflex camera system of the present embodiment. Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, when a diaphragm setting member such as the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> is mounted on the lens unit <b>2</b>, the diaphragm value can be set in the lens unit <b>2</b> by rotating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>. On the other hand, when the lens unit having no diaphragm ring is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>, the diaphragm value can be set in the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"> Next, the diaphragm setting method will be described in detail, however, since the diaphragm setting method by using the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> is known as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the description thereof will be omitted. Hereinafter, a configuration that allows to set the diaphragm value in the body unit <b>1</b> will be described below. </p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view showing the body unit <b>1</b>, which illustrates a face (backside face) thereof on the photographer side at the time of photographing. On the backside face of the body unit <b>1</b>, the displaying portion <b>105</b>, the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> and the rotation operator <b>123</b> are provided. The below description is based on the precondition that the lens unit <b>2</b> having no diaphragm setting portion <b>207</b> or the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"> The diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> is composed of a push button. By operating the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b>, the camera system can be transferred into a diaphragm setting mode (a mode that can perform the diaphragm setting at the rotation operator <b>123</b>). In the present embodiment, by operating the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> once, the diaphragm setting mode can be effective, and by operating the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> once more, the diaphragm setting mode can be ineffective. Herein, the diaphragm setting mode denotes a mode that can set the diaphragm value in the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"> The rotation operator <b>123</b> is disposed on the backside face of the body unit <b>1</b>, and can be rotated in a direction of an arrow E or an arrow F. Herein, the rotation operator <b>123</b> may be configured to generate clicking touches at a certain interval, thereby improving the operation feel. Moreover, in the present embodiment, by disposing the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> near a left edge of the backside face of the body unit <b>1</b> and disposing the rotation operator <b>123</b> near a right edge of the backside face, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the photographer can operate the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> by using a finger of his/her left hand, and can rotate the rotation operator <b>123</b> by using a finger of his/her right hand. According to such an arrangement, the photographer can use his/her both hands so as to perform a favorable operation. However, the positions of the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> and the rotation operator <b>123</b> are not limited to these. Moreover, the present embodiment has a configuration where the diaphragm setting mode is switched to be effective/ineffective each time when operating the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b>, but may have a configuration where the diaphragm setting mode is effective only while the photographer continues to push the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, firstly, in the case where the lens unit <b>2</b> is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>, when setting the diaphragm value, the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> is operated so as to transfer into the diaphragm setting mode. </p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"> Specifically, by pushing the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b>, the displaying portion <b>105</b> displays an image imitating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the image, a diaphragm value <b>125</b> that can be set (the diaphragm value that is printed on the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>) is included. Moreover, a mark <b>126</b> is displayed near the diaphragm value <b>125</b>, and the presently set diaphragm value is displayed as its position thereof is in accordance with the position of the mark <b>126</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> llustrates that the present diaphragm value is &#x201c;F4.0&#x201d;. In the displayed image, &#x201c;50 mm F1.4&#x201d; denotes a lens spec of the lens unit <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"> After transferring into the diaphragm setting mode, by rotating the rotation operator <b>123</b> in the direction of the arrow E or the arrow F, the image imitating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> that is displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is scrolled in the same direction as the rotating direction of the rotation operator <b>123</b>. Herein, in the present embodiment, the diaphragm value can be increased by rotating the rotation operator <b>123</b> in the direction of the arrow E, and can be decreased by rotating the rotation operator <b>123</b> in the direction of the arrow F. That is, the direction of the arrow F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is made substantially the same as the direction of the arrow K shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, and the direction of the arrow E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is made substantially the same as the direction of the arrow L shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"> Moreover, the position of a desired diaphragm value, among the displayed diaphragm values, is made in accordance with the position of the mark <b>126</b>, and then the body unit <b>1</b> transmits a command to the lens unit <b>2</b> to drive the diaphragm portion <b>206</b>. By the input command, the lens unit <b>2</b> drives the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> and sets the diaphragm value to the desired value. </p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"> As mentioned above, the direction of the arrow F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is made substantially the same as the direction of the arrow K shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, and the direction of the arrow E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is made substantially the same as the direction of the arrow L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, whereby the photographer can perform the operation with the same sense, by using either the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> or the rotation operator <b>123</b>. Thus, the operation does not deteriorate. </p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref> to <b>6</b>C show a transition of the image displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> while performing a diaphragm value setting operation. Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the rotation operator <b>123</b> is rotated from the initial state of being set at &#x201c;F4.0&#x201d; in the direction of the arrow E (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) by an angle corresponding to two clicks, and then the displayed diaphragm value is moved in a direction of an arrow G by two scales so as to be set at &#x201c;F2.8&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The rotation operator <b>123</b> is rotated from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> in the direction of the arrow E by an angle corresponding to five clicks, and then the displayed diaphragm value is moved in a direction of an arrow H by five scales, thereby being set at the automatically setting mode that is printed as &#x201c;A&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"> Moreover, the rotation operator <b>123</b> is rotated in the direction of the arrow F, and then the image displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is scrolled in a direction that is reverse to the direction of the arrow G or the arrow H. </p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"> Moreover, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the image displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> cannot be scrolled, even when the rotation operator <b>123</b> is further rotated in the direction of the arrow E. </p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"> As mentioned above, by allowing the displaying portion <b>105</b> to display the image imitating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>, and making the scrolling direction (the direction of the arrow G or the arrow H) of the displayed image substantially the same as the rotation operating direction (the direction of the arrow E or the arrow F) of the rotation operator <b>123</b>, the diaphragm value can be set with the same sense as that of rotating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>, even when a lens unit having no diaphragm value setting portion is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart showing the diaphragm value setting operation in the body, when the lens unit having no diaphragm setting portion is attached. </p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, firstly, when the camera system is in the operation pausing state (Step S<b>51</b>), the diaphragm setting portion <b>122</b> is operated (Step S<b>52</b>), thereby displaying the set diaphragm value that has been set previously (Step S<b>53</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"> Next, when the rotation operator <b>123</b> is rotated clockwise by an angle corresponding to one click (Step S<b>54</b>), the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> in the lens unit <b>2</b> is controlled so as to increase the set diaphragm value by 0.5 grades (Step S<b>56</b>). Moreover, the display of the diaphragm value <b>125</b> on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is scrolled clockwise, and a newly set diaphragm value is displayed so that a position thereof is in accordance with the position of the mark <b>126</b> (Step S<b>57</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"> Moreover, the rotation operator <b>123</b> is rotated counterclockwise by an angle corresponding to one click (Step S<b>55</b>), and then the diaphragm portion <b>206</b> in the lens unit <b>2</b> is controlled so as to decrease the set diaphragm value by 0.5 grades (Step S<b>58</b>). Furthermore, the display of the diaphragm value <b>125</b> on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is scrolled counterclockwise, and a newly set diaphragm value is displayed so that a position thereof is in accordance with the position of the mark <b>126</b> (Step S<b>59</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"> Herein, the diaphragm value that can be set is limited to a range from the open diaphragm value (diaphragm value=1.4) to the minimum diaphragm value (diaphragm value=22), which is not illustrated in the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> though. Moreover, the rotation operator <b>123</b> can be set at the A-position (the automatically setting mode), when being further rotated counterclockwise by an angle corresponding to one click from the state of indicating the open diaphragm value. </p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"> As mentioned above, according to the present embodiment, the body unit <b>1</b> is provided with the rotation operator <b>123</b> that can set the diaphragm value, whereby the diaphragm value can be set, even in the case where the lens unit having no diaphragm ring is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"> Moreover, it is configured that, when setting the diaphragm value in the body unit <b>1</b>, the displaying portion <b>105</b> displays the image imitating the diaphragm ring <b>208</b>, and the display is scrolled so as to be linked with the operation of the rotation operator <b>123</b>, and furthermore, a scrolling direction thereof is made substantially the same as the operating direction of the rotation operator <b>123</b>, whereby the operation can be improved. </p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"> Moreover, in the case where the first lens unit (the lens unit having no diaphragm ring <b>208</b>) is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>, when setting the diaphragm value, the operation of the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> is made effective and the operation of the rotation operator <b>123</b> is made ineffective, whereby the set value of the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> always corresponds with the set value of the diaphragm portion <b>206</b>, which is not likely to mislead the user about the operation. </p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"> The present embodiment has a configuration where, when setting the diaphragm value, in the case where the first lens unit is attached to the body unit <b>1</b>, the operation of the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> is made effective and the operation of the rotation operator <b>123</b> is made ineffective, but may have a configuration where both of the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> and the rotation operator <b>123</b> are made effective. According to such a configuration, the user can select the more appropriate operating means from the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> and rotation operator <b>123</b> for the operation. In the case of adopting this configuration, by setting the operator that is operated for the last time, which is either the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> or the rotation operator <b>123</b>, to be operated at the time of the next operation with higher priority, the operation is improved further. Moreover, since the operating direction (rotating direction) of the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> and the operating direction (rotating direction) of the rotation operator <b>123</b> are made substantially the same, the user can operate with the same sense by using either the diaphragm ring <b>208</b> or the rotation operator <b>123</b>, whereby the operation does not deteriorate. Moreover, if the first lens unit is replaced with the second lens unit (the lens unit having no diaphragm ring), the operating direction of the rotation operator <b>123</b> is not changed, whereby the operability does not deteriorate. </p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"> Moreover, the information on the diaphragm value (diaphragm data) displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is not limited to the displayed image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the other figures. For example, in a state where the displaying portion <b>105</b> displays a through image, the numeric value representing the diaphragm value may be displayed superimposed on the through image by using an on-screen display function. In the case of displaying in such a way, it may be configured so that the numeric value displayed on the displaying portion <b>105</b> is changed sequentially in accordance with the operation of the rotation operator <b>123</b>. According to such a configuration, brightness of the through image also is varied so as to be linked with the operation of the rotation operator <b>123</b>, and thus the user can visually recognize brightness of the image to be photographed, while recognizing the diaphragm value. </p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"> The present invention enables use of a lens having the diaphragm value setting portion with high operability in a lens unit, and facilitates the setting of the diaphragm value visually also in a lens having no operator in a lens unit, which accordingly can be applied to a single-lens reflex camera system. </p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"> The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments disclosed in this application are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not limiting. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. </p>
