<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to a wall structure for bordering a combustion chamber of a burner. The present invention also relates to a burner equipped with such a wall structure. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> With the help of such a burner, a gaseous oxidizer is burned with a gaseous fuel in a combustion reaction that takes place in the combustion chamber. Such a burner may be used, for example, in a fuel cell for burning a hydrogen-product gas mixture at the anode and an oxygen-product gas mixture at the cathode to reduce unwanted hydrogen emissions by the fuel cell. Such a burner is known, for example, from German Patent DE 10 2004 033 545.1 of Jul. 9, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> It is essential for such a burner that the oxidizer gas and the fuel gas must be added separately to the combustion chamber in order for the highly reactive gases to be able to react with one another only in the combustion chamber. To this end, a wall structure of the burner which borders the combustion chamber on at least one side has first openings for supplying one gas and second openings separate from the former for supplying the second gas. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The present invention is concerned with the problem of providing an improved embodiment for a wall structure and/or a burner of the type defined in the preamble, which is characterized in particular by ease of manufacturing. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present invention is based on the general idea of shaping a top plate and a bottom plate to form the wall structure and mounting them together so that a channel system is formed between the plates. The top plate facing the combustion chamber then contains first openings that communicate with the channel system. In addition, in contact zones where the two plates are in contact, the top plate has second openings which also pass through the bottom plate and communicate with a feed space that is separate from the channel system. In this way, with a simple and inexpensive structure two separate gas paths are implemented in the wall structure, opening into the combustion chamber through separate openings in the top plate. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In another embodiment, the wall structure may have an enclosure at the side which encloses the feed space and the channel system and in particular the panels on the sides. Due to this enclosure, it is possible to seal the channel system and the feed system. The wall structure forms a completely prefabricated module with the enclosure, which simplifies assembly of the burner equipped with this wall structure. The enclosure may be equipped with a first feed pipe which communicates with the channel system. Likewise the second feed pipe may be provided, communicating with the feed space. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The wall structure can be manufactured especially advantageously by first providing the top plate with the first openings and then joining it to the bottom plate to form the channel system. A soldered joint, for example, is suitable for this purpose. Then the second holes are formed. Next, the feed pipes can be mounted on the enclosure, e.g., again by means of soldered joint. A soldered joint with a reduced soldering temperature is preferably used so as not to endanger the soldered joint between the top plate and the bottom plate when soldering.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wall structure <b>1</b> of a burner, which is not shown otherwise, in which the wall structure <b>1</b> serves to border a combustion chamber <b>2</b> of the burner. The wall structure <b>1</b> includes a top plate <b>3</b> and a bottom plate <b>4</b>. In addition, the wall structure <b>1</b> also has a base plate <b>5</b>, an enclosure <b>6</b> and, for example, two feed pipes, namely a first feed pipe <b>7</b> and a second feed pipe <b>8</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The top plate <b>3</b> is exposed to the combustion chamber <b>2</b>. The bottom plate <b>4</b> is arranged on a side of the top plate <b>3</b> facing away from the combustion chamber <b>2</b> within the wall structure <b>1</b> in such a way that the bottom plate <b>4</b> is in contact with the top plate <b>3</b> in contact zones <b>9</b>. The shaping of the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> is selected specifically so that a channel system <b>10</b> is formed between the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b>. In addition, the bottom plate <b>4</b> separates the channel system <b>10</b> from a feed space <b>11</b>, which is designed on a side of the bottom plate <b>4</b> in the wall structure <b>1</b> facing away from the combustion chamber <b>2</b>. In comparison with the bottom plate <b>4</b>, said feed space <b>11</b> is bordered by the base plate <b>5</b>. The enclosure <b>6</b> surrounds the top plate <b>3</b>, the channel system <b>10</b>, the bottom plate <b>4</b>, the feed space <b>11</b> and the base plate <b>5</b> so that it is closed at the circumference. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> For simplified airtight installation of the top plate <b>3</b> in the enclosure <b>6</b>, the enclosure <b>6</b> is provided with an upper step <b>28</b> into which the top plate <b>3</b> can be inserted. Similarly, the enclosure <b>6</b> expediently also has a bottom step <b>29</b> into which the base plate <b>5</b> can be inserted. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The top plate <b>3</b> has first openings <b>12</b> which pass through the top plate <b>3</b> and communicate with the channel system <b>10</b>. In the area of the contact zones <b>9</b>, the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> together have second openings <b>13</b> which pass through the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> and communicate with the feed space <b>11</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The two feed pipes <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are each mounted on the enclosure and pass through it. The first feed pipe <b>7</b> communicates with the channel system <b>10</b> while the second feed pipe <b>8</b> communicates with the feed space <b>11</b>. In this way a first gas path is formed in the wall structure <b>1</b>, leading from the first feed pipe <b>7</b> through the channel system <b>10</b> and through the first openings <b>12</b> into the combustion chamber <b>2</b>. A second gas path, which likewise leads from the second feed pipe <b>8</b> into the combustion chamber <b>2</b> through the feed space <b>11</b> and through the second openings <b>13</b>, is separate from the former. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> At least one supporting foot <b>14</b> by means of which the bottom plate <b>4</b> is supported on the base plate <b>5</b> may be provided for reinforcing the wall structure <b>1</b> in the feed space <b>11</b>. This minimum of one supporting foot <b>14</b> may preferably be manufactured in one piece with the bottom plate <b>4</b>. In addition, the particular supporting foot <b>14</b> may be soldered to the base plate <b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> are joined in the area of the contact zones <b>9</b>, e.g., by means of a first soldered joint. The feed pipes <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are also expediently attached to the enclosure <b>6</b>, preferably by means of a second soldered joint. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The wall structure <b>1</b> is preferably manufactured as described below. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The top plate <b>3</b> is first provided with the first openings <b>12</b>, e.g., by punching or drilling. Then the top plate <b>3</b> is permanently joined to the bottom plate <b>4</b>, e.g., by the first soldered joint. Then the second openings <b>13</b> are produced, e.g., by punching or drilling. Only then are the base plate <b>5</b> and the feed pipes <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> attached, e.g., via the second soldered joint. The second soldered joint has a lower solder temperature than the first soldered joint. This ensures that the first soldered joint produced previously, in particular between the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b>, will not be damaged when producing the second soldered joint. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The channel system <b>10</b> is created by the shaping of the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b>. To do so, the top plate <b>3</b> and/or the bottom plate <b>4</b> has/have a corrugated or rectangular structure. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only the bottom plate <b>4</b> has a corrugated or rectangular structure, while the top plate <b>3</b> essentially has a planar structure. The bottom plate <b>4</b> thus has hill structures <b>5</b> and valley structures <b>16</b> for definition of the channel system <b>10</b>. Contact with the top plate <b>3</b> is established by means of the hill structures <b>15</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The channel system <b>10</b> includes several longitudinal channels <b>17</b> running parallel to one another and at least one, preferably two transverse channels <b>18</b>, whereby the respective transverse channel <b>18</b> runs across the longitudinal channels <b>17</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The longitudinal channels <b>17</b> communicate with one another by way of the respective transverse channel <b>18</b>. Two transverse channels <b>18</b> are preferably provided, these channels being arranged on the longitudinal ends of the longitudinal channels <b>17</b>. In addition at least one other transverse channel <b>18</b> may also be provided, this one being arranged between the longitudinal ends of the longitudinal channels <b>17</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The longitudinal channel <b>17</b> into which the first feed pipe <b>17</b> opens is expediently designed as a pre-distribution space and has a larger volume than the other channels <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bottom plate <b>4</b> and the enclosure <b>6</b> are made of one piece. The bottom plate <b>4</b> and the enclosure <b>6</b> preferably form a one-piece cast part. In attaching the top plate <b>3</b> to the bottom plate <b>4</b>, the top plate <b>3</b> is attached to the enclosure <b>6</b> at the same time. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottom plate <b>4</b> and the enclosure <b>6</b> are separately manufactured components, whereby in particular the enclosure <b>6</b> is a cast part while the bottom plate <b>4</b> may essentially also be a deep-drawn part. The bottom plate <b>4</b> is expediently attached to the enclosure <b>6</b>, e.g., by means of a soldered joint. To this end, the enclosure <b>6</b> may be equipped with a middle step <b>32</b> on which the separate bottom plate <b>4</b> rests and by means of which the bottom plate <b>4</b> is soldered to the enclosure <b>6</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> the bottom plate <b>4</b> is composed of multiple individual parts. The bottom plate <b>4</b> here includes a middle part <b>19</b> which has the corrugated or rectangular structure, and two side parts <b>20</b> connected to the middle part <b>19</b>. The middle part <b>19</b> which has a corrugated or rectangular structure again has the valley structures <b>16</b> that are opened in the direction of the top plate <b>3</b> and the hill structures <b>15</b> that are open toward the feed space <b>15</b>. The middle part <b>19</b> is produced by folding or deep drawing, for example. In the middle part <b>19</b> the hill structures <b>15</b> are open on their end faces due to the method of producing the middle part <b>19</b>. The side parts <b>20</b> have several closures <b>21</b>, each closing a hill structure <b>15</b> at the side. The closures <b>21</b> are bent at an angle from a channel bottom <b>31</b>, which is also part of the side part <b>20</b>. This channel bottom <b>31</b> borders one of the channels of the channel system <b>10</b>, namely one of the transverse channels <b>18</b> to the feed space <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the wall structure <b>1</b> with the attached bottom plate <b>4</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the enclosure <b>6</b> is made up of a top part <b>22</b> and a bottom part <b>23</b>. The top part <b>22</b> faces the combustion chamber <b>2</b> while the bottom part <b>23</b> faces away from the combustion chamber <b>2</b>. The two parts <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> of the enclosure <b>6</b> are interconnected by a flange <b>24</b>. In addition, soldered joint or a weld may be provided in the area of the flange <b>24</b>. To form the flange <b>24</b>, a collar of a part, namely the bottom part <b>23</b> here, is flanged over around a collar of the other part which protrudes outward, namely the top part <b>22</b> here. To secure the bottom plate <b>4</b> in the wall structure <b>1</b>, it protrudes into the flange <b>24</b> and is also flanged. In the preferred embodiment illustrated here, the top plate <b>3</b> and the top part <b>22</b> are manufactured in one piece, e.g., by deep drawing. The bottom part <b>23</b> and the base plate <b>5</b> may also be manufactured in one piece, preferably by deep drawing. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, only the bottom plate <b>4</b> is provided with the corrugated or rectangular structure while the top plate <b>3</b> has a planar structure. It is also possible to have an embodiment in which only the top plate <b>3</b> is provided with a corrugated or rectangular structure while the bottom plate <b>4</b> has a planar structure. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref>, both the bottom plate <b>4</b> and the top plate <b>3</b> may be provided with a corrugated structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment in which the hill structures <b>15</b> and the valley structures <b>16</b> of the bottom plate <b>4</b> run parallel to hill structures <b>25</b> and valley structures <b>26</b> of the top plate <b>3</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> are placed one on top of the other in such a way that the contact zones are arranged on the hill structures <b>5</b> of the bottom plate <b>4</b> and on the valley structures <b>26</b> of the top plate <b>3</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In contrast with that, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a variant in which the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> are placed one on top of the other so that the contact zones are again in contact with the hill structures <b>15</b> of the bottom plate <b>4</b> but on the other hand are also in contact with the hill structures <b>25</b> of the top plate <b>3</b>. To implement this, the hill structures <b>25</b> and valley structures <b>26</b> of the top plate <b>3</b> are definitely designed to be weaker than those of the bottom plate <b>4</b>. In this embodiment, in contrast with a top plate <b>3</b> having a planar structure, the contact surface, in which the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> are in contact with one another in the contact zones <b>9</b>, may be increased in size, which improves the sealing of the contact zones <b>9</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> are arranged in relation to one another, so that the hill structures <b>25</b> and valley structures <b>26</b> of the top plate <b>3</b> are inclined with respect to the hill structures <b>15</b> and valley structures <b>16</b> of the bottom plate <b>4</b>. In the example shown here, the hill and valley structures of the two plates <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> run perpendicular to one another. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the combustion chamber <b>2</b> may be enclosed by a combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> at the sides. Expediently this combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> is attached to the wall structure <b>1</b>. This combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> is preferably attached to the enclosure <b>6</b>, e.g., by being soldered to it. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> may be inserted into the enclosure <b>6</b> for this purpose. For example, the upper step <b>28</b> of the enclosure <b>6</b> may be lengthened accordingly for this purpose. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Alternatively, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> may be placed on the enclosure <b>6</b>. To do so, the combustion chamber wall <b>27</b> is provided with a correspondingly widened collar <b>30</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The embodiments of the top plate <b>3</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 8</figref> can also be combined at least partially with the integral design of the enclosure <b>6</b> and the bottom plate <b>4</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and with the additional embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> In a particular embodiment, the wall structure <b>1</b> may be attached directly to a fuel cell on the side facing away from the combustion chamber <b>2</b>, preferably in such a way that an end plate or a closing plate of the fuel cell forms the base plate <b>5</b>. Such an end plate or closing plate includes a gas outlet on the cathode end of the fuel cell. Accordingly, in this design, the oxygen-product gas mixture of the fuel cell on the cathode side can enter the feed space <b>11</b> directly. The second feed pipe <b>8</b> is then dispensable or may be used to supply cold air to the oxygenated gas in order to lower the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 10</figref>, the two feed pipes <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are connected to the enclosure <b>6</b> at the sides. It is likewise possible for at least the second feed pipe <b>8</b> to be connected to the base plate <b>5</b> from beneath and thus to the feed space <b>11</b>. It is likewise fundamentally possible for the first feed pipe <b>7</b> to be connected to the bottom plate <b>4</b> from the bottom through the base plate <b>5</b> and thus to the channel system <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> The gas that contains the fuel is preferably supplied through the channel system <b>10</b> during operation of the burner equipped with the wall structure <b>1</b>, while the gas that contains oxygen is supplied through the feed space <b>11</b>. In the preferred application of the burner for burning the exhaust gases of a fuel cell, this is especially expedient because the oxygen-product gas mixture on the cathode end is available with a higher volume flow than the hydrogen-product gas mixture on the anode side. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> To reduce the temperature in the combustion chamber <b>2</b>, it is fundamentally possible to add a suitable cooling gas to one gas flow or the other. Cool air is preferably used as the cooling gas which is then mixed with the gas that contains oxygen. This may be accomplished, for example, through an additional cold air pipe (not shown here) which is preferably also connected to the feed space <b>11</b>, e.g., via the enclosure <b>6</b> or via the base plate <b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> To distribute the gas supplied to the channel system <b>12</b>, preferably the gas that contains the fuel, as uniformly as possible among the first openings <b>12</b>, it may be expedient to design the individual channels <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the channel system <b>10</b> to have different dimensions. </p>
