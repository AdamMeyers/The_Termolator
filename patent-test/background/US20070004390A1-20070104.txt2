DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 FIG. 1 schematically shows a mobile communication apparatus 100 comprising a processor 102, a transceiver 104 connected to and controlled by the processor 102 and being arranged to wirelessly communicate with a communication network, a user interface 106 connected to and controlled by the processor 102 and being arranged to interact with a user of the mobile communication apparatus 100, and a memory 108 connected to and controlled by the processor 102 and being arranged to comprise contact information 110. For example, the user interface 106 can comprise one or more displays, a keypad, a keyboard, a speaker, a microphone, a touch sensitive input device, a joystick, a rotating input device, or any other user interface means commonly used at mobile communication apparatuses. At least a part of the contact information 110 is arranged in a tree structure comprising a plurality of logical levels, as will be described below. The contact information 110 can comprise one or more groups arranged according to said tree structure. The groups can have different number of logical levels. The tree structure enables the processor 102 to present contact information by the user interface 106 in an improved manner. 
 FIG. 2 shows an example of a group 200 of contact information arranged in a tree structure with a plurality of logical levels 202, 203, 204, 205. The contact information is contained in items of the tree structure, where each item can comprise contact information and/or a link to items on a lower logical level. The logical link between the items are assigned by a user, and an item can be assigned logical link from one or more items in a higher logical level. The term higher and lower logical level only denotes which item is linked from another item, and the logical level of an item do not have to be fixed. 
 FIG. 3 shows an example how a user can use the tree structure to feasibly arrange her contact information within a group of contact information. The top logical level item 300 can be associated with a company, here called C. The top item 300 can comprise contact information common for the entire company, such as switchboard telephone number, address to head office, web address, etc. This contact information can be comprised in sub-items (not shown) of the top item 300, or directly in the top item 300. Further, the top item 300 comprises links to items 302, 304 on a lower logical level, where the lower level items 302, 304 can be different sites of the company, here item 302 being associated with site A and item 304 being associated with site B. In this example, site A may comprise a factory and an administrative office, which each have an associated contact information item 306, 308 on a further lower logical level. Similarly, site B may comprise an R      D department associated with contact information in an item 310 and being logically linked to the item 304 of site B. Further, contact information about Ms. D, a contact person at site B, is associated with an item 312 which is linked to the item 304 of site B. Contact information about Mr. E, who belongs to the R      D department, but normally is situated at the office at site A, is associated with item 314, which is linked from the site A office item 308 and from R      D department item 310. Items 316, 318, 310, which are linked to contact information item 314 about Mr. E can comprise e-mail address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, etc. Further contact persons, e.g. Mr. J, can be associated with contact information items, e.g. item 322, linked to higher logical level items, e.g. R      D department item 310, and comprise contact information. 
 FIG. 4 shows an example how a user can use the tree structure to feasibly arrange her contact information within a group of contact information. The top logical level item 400 can be associated with a family, here called Johnson. The top item 400 can comprise contact information common for the entire family, such as home address, web address, etc. This contact information can be comprised in sub-items, which here is exemplified with home telephone number item 402 linked to the top item 400, of the top item 400, or directly in the top item 400. Further, the top item 400 comprises links to items 404, 406 on a lower logical level, where the lower level items 404, 406 can be different members of the family, here item 404 being associated with John Johnson and item 406 being associated with Mary Johnson. In this example, John may have a work telephone and a mobile telephone, which each have an associated contact information item 408, 410 on a further lower logical level. Similarly, Mary may also have a work telephone and a mobile telephone associated with contact information in items 412, 414 and being logically linked to the item 406 of Mary. Further, contact information about Mary in item 406 can comprise a photo, red-letter days, etc. Mary may have a mobile telephone mounted in her car with a special telephone number, which is comprised in item 416, which is linked to Mary's mobile phone item 412. Mary and John may also have a mobile phone mounted in their boat, and the telephone number to that mobile phone is comprised in item 418, which is linked to both John's and Mary's mobile phone items 410, 412. Mary's e-mail address at work, telephone number to Mary's assistant at work, Mary's mobile telephone number at work, etc can be comprised in items 420, 422, 424, which are linked to Mary's work contact information item 414. This way, it is more feasible for a user to choose the right contact information at any situation for keeping contact with either John or Mary. 
 It should be noted that an item can be linked more than one group, e.g. as if Mr. J associated with item 322 above happens to be John Johnson associated with item 404 above, then John's contact information items are linked both to the group of company C and the group of the Johnson family. 
 Any contact information, such as home telephone numbers, work telephone numbers, mobile telephone numbers, private e-mail addresses, work e-mail addresses, home addresses, and/or work addresses, can be structured in this way. Further, images, text, symbols, sounds, red-letter days, and/or web addresses can also be incorporated in this structure for enabling more personalized, informative, and accessible contact information. 
 As an example the tree structure can be seen as a family album, where the items of each family comprises images, e.g. portraits, which are presented with relations, e.g. husband, wife, kids, brother in law, grandparents, etc, and a user can browse the tree structure on basis of the relations and see the images of the family members. The items can also be represented by symbols, texts, etc, whichever the user finds most convenient. Similarly, the tree structure can be seen as a company roll, where the items of each company comprises images, e.g. portraits, which are presented with relations/roles, e.g. CEO, COO, executive vice president, CTO, manager of department X, CFO, supervisor whithin Y, legal council, etc, and the user can browse the tree structure on basis of the relations and roles and see e.g. the portraits of the persons. The items can also be represented by symbols, texts, name of department, etc. When the user, during browsing, finds the right person, the item can be selected, and contact information according to what described above can be accessed, or, if the user so prefers, be linked to another tree structure of the selected person, e.g. showing his/her family tree, hunting party, sports association, etc, which can be further browsed in a similar way. Many other examples of tree structure bases, such as different organizations, friendship relations, etc, can be used for organizing contact information. 
 During browsing, a group of contacts can be selected, e.g. for a group SMS, where the tree structure and its relations are utilized for easily making the group. 
 A system architecture for managing a system 500 according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 5. A Home Location Register (HLR) 502 contains a database (not shown) including relevant subscriber information for provision of telecommunication service. A CCITT specified network 504 interconnects the individual parts of the system 500. A contact information gateway 506 is a switching unit routing a message or a call to a mobile communication apparatus 508-512. If contact information is to be stored at network side, a Contact Information Service Center 514 (CINC) and the contact information gateway 506 handles and routes the contact information between the CINC 514 and the network 504. From the network 504, the contact information is routed to the mobile communication apparatuses 508-512 via a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 516 to a Base Station Controller (BSC) 517 and a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 520, 521, or a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 518 and a Node B 522. Alternatively, the contact information is routed to the mobile communication apparatuses 508-512 via a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 526, 528 to the BSC 517 and the BTS 520, 521, or the RNC 518 and the Node B 522, respectively. The BTS 520, 521 or the Node B 522 establish the air connection to the mobile communication apparatuses 508-512. 
 According to an embodiment of the present invention, a network operator or other third party company handling a contact information server 524 could offer a contact information function between persons not knowing each other. For example a network operator may have a contact information server 524 supporting a feature where the user may send a contact information request from his mobile communication apparatus 508-512 to the contact information server 524 by using a special phone number. This contact information server 524 can then automatically provide contact information structured according to the present invention, e.g. for a company and contact persons at that company, together with web address, fax number, etc. 
 FIG. 6 shows an example according to the present invention, where a mobile communication apparatus 600 views contact information on a display 602. The contact information can be presented on the display 602 according to a tree structure 604 on the display 602 of the mobile communication apparatus 600. It can then be feasible to have a display view that comprises all items of the tree structure 604. To be able to see the items in a reasonable size, a scrolling function of the display view can be provided to view a user selected part of the items, where a scroll bar 606 helps a user to navigate the display view. Scrolling can be enabled both horizontally and vertically, depending on the size of the tree structure 604, the size of the display 602, and the preferred sizes of the presented items.
