<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> A printed circuit board (PCB) may be labeled, for example, by spraying a silk screen ink onto a surface of the PCB. The ink may be applied to identify the PCB using text, numbers, or other printed symbols and indicia. However, the silk screen ink, like other surface marking methods, may be removed using a variety of mechanical and chemical methods and techniques, for example, chemical solvents to dissolve the ink or other marking. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Additionally, the ink printing and other types of markings on a PCB may not be easily read in the low light conditions that tend to exist inside of an electronic housing such as those that commonly contain PCBs. Thus, printed ink and other types of PCB surface markings may be inadequate at providing a method of identifying the PCB in an operational environment. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> There is a general need for a method and system to mark and identifying PCBs.</p>

Top and bottom light permeable resin layers <b>115</b>, <b>130</b> may comprise an uncured fiberglass-epoxy resin and are also referred to as prepreg. Top and bottom light permeable resin layers <b>115</b>,<b>130</b> may have a conductor layer <b>110</b> attached to at least one planar surface thereof. In some embodiments, top and bottom light permeable resin layers <b>115</b>, <b>130</b> may have a conductor layer attached to both sides thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> PCB <b>105</b> also includes a core layer <b>125</b> between conductor layers <b>120</b>. Core layer <b>125</b> may include a thin dielectric layer of cured fiberglass-epoxy resin that is separated from other layers (e.g. core layers and/or prepreg) by conductor layers <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In accordance herewith, core layer <b>125</b> and prepreg layers <b>115</b>, <b>130</b> are light permeable. That is, core layer <b>125</b> and prepreg layers <b>115</b>, <b>130</b> allow a percentage of light from a source on a first side thereof to illuminate (i.e., travel) therethrough. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In some embodiments herein, a void is provided in conductor layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> of PCB <b>105</b>. The void in the conductor layers are vertically aligned with light permeable layers <b>115</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>. The void allows light to pass through conductor layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>.

The components attached to PCB may include electrical and electronic components such as, for example, resistors, integrated circuits, device leads, and other devices. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side elevation view of an exemplary apparatus <b>400</b>, in accordance with some embodiments herein. Apparatus <b>400</b> includes a PCB <b>405</b> (e.g., a multilayer PCB) and a source of illumination <b>410</b>. Illumination source <b>410</b> may be a LED, a fiber-optic light source, or other light source. Illumination source <b>410</b> is supported in proximity to PCB by support structure <b>420</b>. Support structure <b>420</b> may form a part of illumination source <b>410</b> (e.g., leads) or be a separate structure from illumination source <b>410</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In some embodiments, support structure <b>420</b> may provide a mechanism for mounting illumination source <b>410</b> in proximity to one side of PCB <b>405</b>. In some embodiments, support structure <b>420</b> may provide an electrical connection between illumination source <b>410</b> and a power source for powering the illumination source.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> In some embodiments, support structure <b>420</b> may have an electrical conductor on or therein to connect illumination source <b>410</b> to a power supply. The electrical conductor may include a conductive trace, a wire, or other electrical connection device or method. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Light rays <b>415</b> are generated by illumination device <b>410</b> and are directed up towards an underside of PCB <b>405</b>. A mark formed in PCB according to some embodiments herein allows light rays <b>415</b> to pass through PCB <b>405</b> in an area occupied by light permeable layers (e.g. core layers and prepreg layers) and voids through conductor layers. Accordingly, viewing PCB from a top side thereof provides a mark (e.g., word, logo, design, number, etc.) that appears to be illuminated. The appearance of being illuminated may be particularly enhanced in an instance the surrounding top layer of PCB is dark in color and/or the PCB is located in a relatively dark environment. Consistent in some embodiments hereof is an illumination source that shines from one side of a PCB, through both the PCB light permeable layers (e.g. core layers and prepreg layers) and the voids in the conductor layers, and out of an opposing side of the PCB. The light simultaneously shines through the light permeable layers and the voids in the conductor layers. </p>
