<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates in general to substrate manufacturing technologies and in particular to apparatus for measuring a set of electrical characteristics in a plasma. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> In the processing of a substrate, e.g., a semiconductor wafer, MEMS device, or a glass panel such as one used in flat panel display manufacturing, plasma is often employed. As part of the processing of a substrate (chemical vapor deposition, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, etch, etc.) for example, the substrate is divided into a plurality of dies, or rectangular areas, each of which will become an integrated circuit. The substrate is then processed in a series of steps in which materials are selectively removed (etching) and deposited (deposition) in order to form electrical components thereon. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> In an exemplary plasma process, a substrate is coated with a thin film of hardened emulsion (such as a photoresist mask) prior to etching. Areas of the hardened emulsion are then selectively removed, causing parts of the underlying layer to become exposed. The substrate is then placed in a plasma processing chamber on a substrate support structure comprising a mono-polar or bi-polar electrode, called a chuck. Appropriate etchant source gases (e.g., C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>F, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, Ar, Xe, He, H<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, etc.) are then flowed into the chamber and struck to form a plasma to etch exposed areas of the substrate. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Subsequently, it is often beneficial to measure the electrical characteristics in a plasma (i.e., ion saturation current, electron temperature, floating potential, etc.) in order to ensure consistent plasma processing results. Examples may include detecting the endpoint of a chamber conditioning process, chamber matching (e.g., looking for differences between chambers which should nominally be identical), detecting faults and problems in the chamber, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a simplified diagram of an inductively coupled plasma processing system is shown. Generally, an appropriate set of gases may be flowed from gas distribution system <b>122</b> into plasma chamber <b>102</b> having plasma chamber walls <b>1117</b>. These plasma processing gases may be subsequently ionized at or in a region near injector <b>109</b> to form a plasma <b>110</b> in order to process (e.g., etch or deposit) exposed areas of substrate <b>114</b>, such as a semiconductor substrate or a glass pane, positioned with edge ring <b>115</b> on an electrostatic chuck <b>116</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> A first RF generator <b>134</b> generates the plasma as well as controls the plasma density, while a second RF generator <b>138</b> generates bias RF, commonly used to control the DC bias and the ion bombardment energy. Further coupled to source RF generator <b>134</b> is matching network <b>136</b><i>a</i>, and to bias RF generator <b>138</b> is matching network <b>136</b><i>b</i>, that attempt to match the impedances of the RF power sources to that of plasma <b>110</b>. Furthermore, vacuum system <b>113</b>, including a valve <b>112</b> and a set of pumps <b>111</b>, is commonly used to evacuate the ambient atmosphere from plasma chamber <b>102</b> in order to achieve the required pressure to sustain plasma <b>110</b> and/or to remove process byproducts. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simplified diagram of a capacitively coupled plasma processing system is shown. Generally, capacitively coupled plasma processing systems may be configured with a single or with multiple separate RF power sources. Source RF, generated by source RF generator <b>234</b>, is commonly used to generate the plasma as well as control the plasma density via capacitively coupling. Bias RF, generated by bias RF generator <b>238</b>, is commonly used to control the DC bias and the ion bombardment energy. Further coupled to source RF generator <b>234</b> and bias RF generator <b>238</b> is matching network <b>236</b>, which attempts to match the impedance of the RF power sources to that of plasma <b>220</b>. Other forms of capacitive reactors have the RF power sources and match networks connected to the top electrode <b>204</b>. In addition there are multi-anode systems such as a triode that also follow similar RF and electrode arrangements. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Generally, an appropriate set of gases is flowed through an inlet in a top electrode <b>204</b> from gas distribution system <b>222</b> into plasma chamber <b>202</b> having plasma chamber walls <b>217</b>.

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to a few preferred embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed by the inventor herein that a set of electrical characteristics of a plasma in a plasma processing system may be determined by measuring ion flux with a sensor that is substantially coplanar with the plasma chamber surface or, alternatively, a sensor that is recessed into a plasma chamber wall. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> Flux is generally defined as the rate at which a given quantity passes through a fixed boundary per unit time. For a plasma processing system, ion flux commonly signifies the energy per unit time (or power) created by ions in a plasma passing through a plasma chamber surface or boundary. Subsequently, this plasma-surface (or boundary) interaction may be analyzed in order to determine a set of electrical characteristics in the plasma itself. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Coplanar refers to the position of the sensor in relation to a plasma chamber surface, wherein a measuring surface of the sensor and the surface of the plasma chamber are substantially on the same plane. Recessed refers to the position of the sensor in relation to a plasma chamber surface, wherein the surface of the plasma chamber is between the measuring surface of the sensor and the plasma. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Unlike other indirect measurement techniques, such as the use of a non-coplanar or non-recessed interferometer which are subject to distortion, a coplanar or recessed sensor can directly measure a condition inside the plasma chamber. For example, a coplanar ion flux probe may be used to detect the endpoint of a chamber conditioning process, to measure plasma properties (e.g., ion saturation current, electron temperature, floating potential, etc.), for chamber matching (e.g., looking for differences between chambers which should nominally be identical), for detecting faults and problems in the chamber, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> In an embodiment, the parts of the probe exposed to plasma and reactive gases are composed of materials which do not contaminate the plasma with particles or unwanted chemicals. For example in a dielectric etching system, suitable materials would include silicon, silicon dioxide, and fluoropolymers. In addition, in order to properly function, the connection between the conductive surface of the probe and the powering/sensing electronics (e,g, transducers, etc.) should have a low and stable resistance, when cycled between room temperature and elevated temperatures (routinely at or above 200&#xb0; C.) commonly found in plasma processing. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a simplified diagram of a probe is shown, according to an embodiment of the invention. In general, the probe is comprised of a collection disk structure, a conductive path, and an insulation barrier. The collection disk structure <b>302</b> faces the plasma and is generally constructed of a conductive surface area <b>303</b> that is coplanar with or recessed with respect to a plasma chamber surface. In an embodiment, collection disk structure <b>302</b> is comprised of metalized silicon. Collection disk structure <b>302</b> is further coupled to conductive path <b>306</b> which, in turn, is commonly connected to power/sensing electronics [not shown] that may measure I-V characteristics of the ion flux probe, as slow transient currents charge and discharge the capacitance. In an embodiment, the back surface (i.e. the surface in contact with conductive path <b>306</b>) is sputtered with a metal. In an embodiment, conductive path <b>306</b> is comprised of aluminum. In an embodiment, conductive path <b>306</b> is comprised of stainless steel. In an embodiment, collection disk structure <b>302</b> is further coupled to conductive path <b>306</b> via a leaf spring <b>308</b>. In an embodiment, leaf spring <b>308</b> is substantially cylindrical. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Further isolating collection disk structure <b>302</b> and conductive path <b>306</b> from the plasma chamber [not shown] is insulation barrier <b>304</b>.

In an embodiment, insulation barrier <b>304</b> comprises ceramic such as aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, etc. In an embodiment, insulation barrier <b>304</b> comprises an air (vacuum) gap which is small enough to prevent plasma forming within the gap, but large enough to prevent arcing between conductive path <b>306</b> and plasma chamber [not shown]. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a simplified diagram of a probe is shown, in which direct contact is made between a conductive path and a collection disk structure, according to an embodiment of the invention.

The collection disk structure <b>402</b> faces the plasma <b>110</b> and is generally constructed of a conductive surface area <b>403</b> that is coplanar with or recessed with respect to a plasma chamber surface. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In an embodiment, collection disk structure <b>402</b> is comprised of metalized silicon. In general, metalized silicon is preferable to more commonly used probe materials, such as tungsten and aluminum oxide, which may contaminate the plasma.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In an embodiment, the temperature of the probe is substantially the same as the temperature of the plasma chamber.
