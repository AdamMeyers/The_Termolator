<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to a socket for an electrical part accommodating an electrical part such as semiconductor device (which may be called hereinlater &#x201c;IC package&#x201d;). </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> A conventional example of such a socket for an electrical part is, for example, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. HEI 8-88063 as an IC socket. This IC socket has a socket body to which a number of contact pins are arranged, and contact portions of these contact pins contact side surfaces of solder balls as spherical terminals of an IC package. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The contact pins are formed from a sheet of plate by punching and then bending the plate so that the contact pin has, at its upper end portion, a contacting surface having wide area so as to abut against the side surface of the solder ball when assembled. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The contact pins of the structure mentioned above are divided into two or three groups, in which the contact pins in the respective groups are formed with elastic contact pieces, by which opposing forces are caused to thereby prevent the terminals from being offset in every direction including lateral and transverse directions and hence to suitably ensure mutual contacting positions of the contact pins between the respective terminals. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> However, in such conventional structure of the contact pins, since the contact pins are formed by punching out the plate and then bending the punched out plate member, these workings involve many working steps, and in addition, in the bending working, it is obliged to select a material for the plate member that can endure the bending working, which limits the materials to be selected. For example, as such material, beryllium copper is generally utilized, but this material has a fear of being deteriorated in elasticity because of influence of heat. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Moreover, since the contact pin is displaceable in a direction perpendicular to the contact surface having a predetermined width, it is necessary to ensure a large movable area in the socket. In addition, the contact surface of the contact pin is contacted in a surface-to-surface fashion to the spherical terminal to thereby establish electrical connection, and then, there is a fear of making worse the electrical conductivity in a case where the surface of the spherical terminal is coarse. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> An object of the present invention is to substantially eliminate defects or drawbacks encountered in the prior art mentioned above and to provide a socket for an electrical part capable of easily forming contact pins with a reduced working process and with increased number of materials selectively usable, reducing movable range of the contact pin and ensuring electrical connection between the contact pin and a spherical terminal. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The above and other objects can be achieved according to the present invention by providing a socket for an electrical part including a socket body provided with an accommodation portion in which an electrical part having spherical terminals is accommodated, and contact pins arranged so as to be contacted to and separated from the terminals, respectively, and a movable member for elastically deforming the contact pins in a horizontal direction, wherein each of the contact pins has one elastic piece in the form of plate having conductivity and elasticity so as to be elastically deformable along a plate surface direction, and the contact pin has a contact portion in the form of plate formed at an upper portion of the elastic piece, the contact portion having a side edge portion which is contacted to or separated from a side surface of the spherical terminal. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> According to this aspect of the present invention, the contact pin has a single flat plate-shaped elastic piece which is deformed in a direction along the plate surface, and accordingly, in comparison with an elastic piece which is deformed in a perpendicular direction to the plate surface, the moving range thereof can be reduced. Moreover, in a case where a pair of electrical pieces is disposed, even if they are deformed along the plate surface direction, they have a wide width in the plate thickness direction and, hence, they move in a wide movable range. In comparison, in the present invention, since only the single elastic piece is provided, the width in the plate thickness direction can be reduced and, hence, the movable range thereof can be also reduced, thus realizing narrow pitch of the contact pins. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In addition, in the present invention, the side edge portion of the contact portion formed to the upper end of the elastic piece contacts or separates from the side surface of the spherical terminal such as a solder ball. Accordingly, in comparison with the contact pin in which the contact portion contacts the spherical terminal at its surface, not side edge portion, since the side edge portion thereof slightly bites the spherical terminal, the electrical conductivity between the contact pin and the spherical terminal can be ensured. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In preferred embodiments or examples in the above aspect, the contact pins may be arranged such that contacting directions of the contact pins differ from each other so that horizontal forces to be applied from the contact pins to the terminals are equilibrium as a whole structure of the socket body. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The adjacent contact pins may apply operation forces to the corresponding spherical terminals in directions reverse to each other. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> It may be desired that the contact pin contacts the terminal such that the side edge portion of the contact portion of the contact pin contacts the side surface of the terminal in the direction along a diameter direction thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> It is desirable that the contact portion of the contact pin has an inclining portion which contacts a surface of a lower half portion of the spherical terminal except a lowest portion thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> It may be desired that the socket is an IC socket and the terminal is a solder ball. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The contact pin may be composed of a base portion, a solder tail portion extending downward from the base portion, a single elastic piece extending upward from the base portion so as to be elastically deformable, and a contact portion formed to an upper portion of the elastic piece, the contact portion being provided with an inclining portion contacting the spherical terminal. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> According to the above characteristic features of the preferred examples, the forces applied from all the contact pins can be made equilibrium in the entire structure of the socket by the simple change in the structure thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> That is, in the conventional structure, the spherical terminal is clamped from both sides by the paired contact portions of the elastic pieces, and in such structure, equal forces are applied to the spherical terminal in the opposing directions from both sides thereof with being clamped by the paired elastic pieces. Accordingly, even if forces are applied from a number of contact pins, the horizontally equilibrium condition can be maintained (i.e., balanced) in the entire structure of the socket for the electrical part. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> On the other hand, when the single elastic piece is contacted to the spherical terminal only from one direction, all the forces are applied to the spherical terminals from one same direction, which will act to the electrical part to move it on one same direction. In such case, a stopper member is needed to stop or limit the movement of the electrical part. Taking this matter into consideration, in the present invention, the contact pins are arranged so that the contacting directions of the elastic pieces to the spherical terminals differ from each other to keep the equilibrium condition of the applied forces. According to such arrangement, there is no need for disposing any stopper member, thus making compact the entire structure of the socket. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Furthermore, the contact pin is formed by punching out a plate member having electrical conductivity and elasticity so as to have a single elastic piece in the form of plate, which is elastically deformable along the plate surface direction. The elastic piece has the contact portion at its upper end portion so that the side edge portion thereof contacts the side surface of the spherical terminal. Accordingly, any bending working, which is required in the conventional technology, is not needed and the contact pin can be formed only by punching out the flat plate member, thus reducing the number of workings and easily forming the contact pin. In addition, it is not necessary to use a material which is strong against the bending working, thus widely selecting the material, and in addition, by utilizing a material having less stress relaxation, the initial contacting pressure can be substantially maintained even after the heating process. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Still furthermore, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the adjacent contact pins in a number of contact pins are arranged so as to apply the force to the spherical terminal from opposing directions by, for example, alternately arranging the contact pins having the same shape so as to face opposing directions, the contact pins can be easily formed without forming contact pins having different shapes, and in addition, the arrangement thereof can be easily performed, thus being convenient and advantageous. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Still furthermore, according to the present invention, since the side edge portion of the contact portion of the contact pin can contact the side surface of the spherical terminal along the diameter direction thereof, the possibility of causing injury can be reduced. That is, if the contacting direction of the contact portion of the contact pin is offset from the diameter direction of the spherical terminal, the contact portion may act to scrub the side portion of the terminal, and thus, there is a fear of causing burr or injury to the spherical terminal. On the contrary, as in the present invention, when the side edge portion of the contact portion contacts the side surface of the spherical terminal along the diameter direction, the side edge portion of the contact portion slightly bites the spherical terminal even if the terminal is formed of a soft material, thus preventing the burr or injury from causing. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Still furthermore, according to the present invention, the inclining portion is formed to the contact portion of the contact pin so that the inclining portion contacts the lower half of the spherical terminal except the lowest end, and therefore, when the elastic force of the elastic piece acts to the inclining portion, the inclining portion slides along the lower half of the spherical terminal except the lowest end thereof, thereby achieving the wiping effect. Moreover, since the contact portion of the contact pin never contact the lowest end of the terminal, the lowest end is not injured, and hence, no bad influence is applied when the spherical terminal is electrically contacted to the printed circuit board. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Furthermore, according to a modified aspect of the present invention, there is provided a socket for an electrical part comprising: </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> a socket body to which an accommodation portion is formed so as to accommodate the electrical part and to which a number of contact pins are provided so as to be contacted to or separated from terminals of an electrical part; </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> a movable member formed to the socket body so as to deform the contact pin through vertical movement thereof; and </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> an operation member for vertically moving the movable member, </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> wherein the contact pin is provided with a single elastic piece in form of plate having conductivity and elasticity so as to be elastically deformable by the movement of the movable member along a plate surface direction, and the contact portion of the contact pin has a side edge portion which is contacted to or separated from a side surface of the spherical terminal. </p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> On the other hand, the movable member <b>17</b> is composed of, as shown in FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>11</b>, a movable member body <b>17</b><i>b</i>, in the form of flat plate, having a plurality of insertion holes <b>17</b><i>a</i>, and a projection piece <b>17</b><i>c </i>projecting upward from an end edge portion of the movable member body <b>17</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> Further, the guide member <b>19</b> in the form of frame is disposed above the movable member <b>17</b> and inside the projection piece <b>17</b><i>c</i>.

The guide member <b>19</b> is formed with an opening <b>19</b><i>d </i>through which a latch member <b>28</b> is inserted in or out as mentioned hereinlater. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> The latch member <b>28</b> has, as shown in FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b>, a rotation shaft <b>28</b><i>a </i>and is provided for the socket body <b>13</b> to be rotatable around this rotation shaft <b>28</b><i>a</i>. The latch member <b>28</b> also has, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pair of pressed portions <b>28</b><i>b </i>(portions to be pressed by the pressing portion <b>17</b><i>d </i>of the movable member <b>17</b>) on both side portions thereof.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> When the movable member <b>17</b> is moved downward, the pressing portion <b>17</b><i>d </i>of the movable member <b>17</b> presses the portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the latch member <b>28</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> Incidentally, the operation member <b>21</b> has a frame-like rectangular shape and is disposed around the guide member <b>19</b> to be vertically movable around the socket body <b>13</b>. The operation member <b>21</b> has a pressing surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>for pressing a surface <b>17</b><i>e </i>to be pressed formed to the upper surface of the projection piece <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the movable member <b>17</b>, and when the operation member <b>21</b> is pressed against the urging force of the coil spring <b>25</b>, the movable member <b>17</b> is lowered. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> The IC socket <b>11</b> of the structures mentioned above will operate in the manner mentioned hereunder. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> In order to set the IC package <b>12</b> to the IC socket <b>11</b>, the operation member <b>21</b> is first moved downward. Then, the movable member <b>17</b> is pushed also downward by the movement of the operation member <b>21</b> and lowered against the urging force of the coil spring <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> According to the lowering movement of the movable member <b>17</b>, the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is displaced in a direction apart from the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the latch <b>28</b> is then opened. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> That is, when the movable member <b>17</b> is lowered, the portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the latch <b>28</b> is pressed and the latch <b>28</b> is rotated to the position shown with two-dot-dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> against the urging force of the spring <b>29</b>. According to this motion, the press portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the latch <b>28</b> is retired from the IC package accommodation/take-out line. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Moreover, when the movable member <b>17</b> is moved from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sliding portion <b>15</b><i>h </i>of the elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is pressed by the peripheral wall section of the insertion hole <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the movable member <b>17</b> and the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is hence deformed. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Under this state, the IC package <b>12</b> is guided by the guide piece <b>19</b><i>b </i>and accommodated to a predetermined position on the support piece <b>19</b><i>a</i>, and the respective solder balls <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the IC package <b>12</b> are inserted into portions near the displaced contact portions <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pins <b>15</b>, respectively, in a non-contact state, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> Thereafter, when the operation member <b>21</b> is released from the downward pressing force, the movable member <b>17</b> is moved upward by the urging force of the coil spring <b>25</b> and the latch <b>28</b> is rotated in the closing direction by the urging force of the spring <b>29</b>, whereby the IC package <b>12</b> is pressed by the movable member <b>17</b> to thereby prevent the IC package <b>12</b> from floating. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> Further, when the movable member <b>17</b> is moved upward, the pressing force of the sliding portion <b>15</b><i>h </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is released, and the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>thereof is moved toward the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and then, the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>contacts the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>and slides therealong. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> According to such motion, the solder balls <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the IC package <b>12</b> and the printed circuit board are electrically connected through the contact pins <b>15</b>, respectively. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> On the other hand, when the IC package <b>12</b> is dismounted from the accommodated state, the operation member <b>21</b> is lowered through the movement of the movable member <b>17</b>. According to this movement, the latch member <b>28</b> is retired from the IC package accommodation/take-out area and the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is separated from the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, so that the IC package <b>12</b> is easily removed with a weak force in comparison with a case that the solder ball is clamped between a pair of contact portions. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> In the IC socket of the characters mentioned above, by simply improving the structure, the forces applied to all the contact pins <b>15</b> can be made equilibrium to the entire structure of the socket. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> That is, in an IC socket of the conventional structure in which the solder ball is clamped from its both sides by a pair of elastic pieces of the contact pin, equal forces are applied in two opposite directions to the solder ball with the solder ball being clamped from both sides by the paired elastic pieces, so that even if forces are applied by a number of contact pins, the parallel equilibrium condition can be maintained as the entire structure of the socket, thus being well balanced. However, as in the present invention, when the single elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> contacts from only one direction to the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, only the single directional force is applied to the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> Therefore, when the force is applied from the same direction, the force is also applied to the IC package <b>12</b> to move it in this direction, and in such case, a stopper is needed to stop the movement of IC package <b>12</b>. Accordingly, in the present invention, in order to obviate this matter, the contact pins <b>15</b> are arranged such that the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> contacts each solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>from a different (for example, opposing) direction respectively so as to make equilibrium the total forces to be applied to the solder balls <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Thus, there is no need for disposing any stopper member for stopping the movement of the IC package <b>12</b>, thus simplifying the structure. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> Furthermore, the contact pins <b>15</b> are formed by punching out a plate-shaped material having conductivity and elasticity into a flat plate shape so as to have the single elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>elastically deformable in a direction of the plate surface, and the side edge portion of the plate-shaped contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>formed to the upper end portion of the elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>is contacted to or separated from the side surface of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, it is not necessary to carry out the plate bending working as seen in the conventional structure, and only necessary to punch out the plate member, so that the contact pins can be easily manufactured with reduced working process, and in addition, since no bending working is needed, it is not necessary to manufacture the contact pins from a material that can endure the burden of the bending working and various materials can be selectively used. In addition, by using a material having less stress relaxation by heat, the initial contacting pressure can be substantially maintained after the heat application. In this embodiment, by using titanium copper alloy or tin nickel copper alloy, the contact pins having less stress relaxation by heat and contact pressure having less change from the initial value in pressure after the heat application can be provided. Further, the contact pins <b>15</b> are formed by, first, carrying out the pressing working in the state in which a plurality of contact pins are connected through connection portions <b>15</b><i>o </i>with the adjacent contact pins <b>15</b> being directed in the reverse directions, and then, removing the contact portions <b>15</b><i>o. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> Furthermore, the contact pin <b>15</b> in this embodiment has the single elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>in flat plate shape and elastically deformable in the plate surface direction, so that the movable range thereof can be made smaller in comparison with the contact pin which is elastically deformable in the vertical direction to the plate surface. Moreover, in comparison with the contact pin even having a pair of elastic pieces which is deformable in the plate surface direction, in which the paired elastic pieces are disposed in an overlapped state, the thickness in the plate thickness direction becomes large, and hence, the movable range thereof also becomes large. On the contrary, in the present invention, the contact pin has only one elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c</i>, so that the thickness in the plate thickness direction is small, and hence, the movable range thereof can be made small, thus making small the pitch of the contact pins. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> Still furthermore, in the present invention, the contact pin <b>15</b> is formed such that the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>formed to the plate-shaped contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>formed to the upper end of the elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>is contacted to or separated from the side surface of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and accordingly, in comparison with the structure in which the contact portion is contacted at its surface, not side edge portion, to the solder ball, the side edge portion of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the present invention slightly bites the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, thereby ensuring the electrical connection between the contact pin <b>15</b> and the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> Still furthermore, in the structure of the present invention, the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>formed to the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> contacts the lower spherical portion, except the lowest end, of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, so that when the elastic force of the elastic piece <b>15</b><i>c </i>acts to the inclining portion <b>15</b>, the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>slides along the lower spherical portion except the lowest end of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, thus achieving the wiping effect and improving the electrical conductivity. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> Moreover, since the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> never contact the lowest end of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the lowest end is not damaged and any adverse influence is not caused at a time of the electrical contact of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>to the printed circuit board. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> In addition, in the present invention, since the contact pin <b>15</b> is constructed such that the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>contacts the side surface of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>along the diameter direction, the causing of injury or damage to the solder ball can be reduced. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the contacting direction of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>is shifted from the diameter direction of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>as shown with two-dot-chain line, the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>acts as if it scrubs the side portion of the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>, so that there is a fear such that a burr or large flaw may be caused to the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>as shown with two-dot-chain line. On the other hand, in the structure in which the side edge portion (i.e. inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e</i>) of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>contacts the side surface of the solder ball along its diameter direction, even if the solder ball is softened, the side edge portion of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>merely slightly bites, thereby preventing the large injury or the like from being caused to the solder ball. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> Furthermore, the adjacent contact pins <b>15</b> of a number of contact pins <b>15</b> serve to apply forces in the directions different from each other, so that the contact pins <b>15</b> can be easily arranged. That is, such contact pins <b>15</b> can be formed through the press working in the state such that the contact pins are directed in the directions different from (i.e. opposite to) each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and can be arranged to the socket body <b>13</b> in this pressed arrangement as it is. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> Of course, a number of contact pins <b>15</b> directed in the same direction may be formed and they are arranged by alternately changing the direction. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> In addition, since the operation force of the contact pin <b>15</b> is half in comparison with a contact pin provided with a pair of elastic pieces, the operation member <b>21</b> can be driven with less force, so that many contact pins could be arranged. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> Further, the shape of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of the contact pin <b>15</b> is not limited to the shape of the embodiment described above and many other alternated shapes such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B</figref> and <b>17</b>C may be adopted. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> That is, the inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>formed to the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> has a length smaller than that of the described embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, and has an inclination angle larger than that thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> The inclining portion <b>15</b><i>e </i>formed to the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> has a perpendicular portion <b>15</b><i>m </i>so as to contact the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>at its side surface. Furthermore, the contact portion <b>15</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> also has an inclining portion <b>15</b><i>n </i>slightly inclined in a direction reverse to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, and the contact portion having this inclining portion <b>15</b><i>n </i>contacts the solder ball <b>12</b><i>b </i>at a portion slightly higher than the center of the spherical solder ball <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> show illustrated examples of the contact pins alternated in their directions or arrangements. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> That is, in the embodiment described hereinbefore, the adjacent contact pins <b>15</b> are arranged such that the operating forces of the adjacent contact pins <b>15</b> act in opposite directions to each solder ball <b>12</b><i>b</i>. However, the present invention is not limited to such arrangement and many other arrangements of the contact pins may be adopted as long as the forces of the contact pins take equilibrium condition. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the contact pins <b>15</b> are arranged so that the operation forces are directed in one direction such as &#x201c;A&#x201d; direction and the other ones are arranged such that the operation forces are directed in the reverse direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; opposite to the &#x201c;A&#x201d; direction with the center line O in the arrangement area E being the boundary of these arrangements, and on the other hand, the operation forces may be directed in the opposite (facing) directions as shown with the arrows &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, the contact pins <b>15</b> are arranged so that the operation forces are directed in one direction such as &#x201c;A&#x201d; direction and the other ones are arranged such that the operation forces are directed in the reverse direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; opposite to the &#x201c;A&#x201d; direction with the diagonal center line O in the arrangement area E being the boundary of these arrangements, and on the other hand, the operation forces may be directed in the opposite (facing) directions as shown with the arrows &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d;. </p>
