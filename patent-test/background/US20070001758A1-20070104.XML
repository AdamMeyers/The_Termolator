<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This invention relates to a method and apparatus for compensating for transconductance mismatch in multiple differential amplifiers. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Multiple differential amplifiers, for example, double differential amplifiers used as instrumentation amplifiers, typically include two input differential transconductance stages connected in shunt configuration. The combination of their current outputs drives a main amplifier. The output from the main amplifier is connected to a negative feedback resistor network, which sets the gain for the combined signal. An advantage of fully differential signal paths is to reject the common mode noise or interference. The implementation of double differential input amplifier circuits as a realization of this practice is well established. The instrumentation amplifier operates by nulling the difference between the outputs of the differential transconductance stages. Their outputs will match when their inputs match so that the circuit, which nulls their difference, must drive the input which it controls to match the voltage of the one it does not control. In such a configuration the two transconductance inputs must be accurately matched. However, lithographic tolerances in mask production of monolithic semiconductor devices together with planar irregularities inherent in the manufacture of such devices limit the matching of such structures. Furthermore, temperature gradients across the circuit during operation may degrade the matching of transconductances and lead to distortion. As a result, presently, while offset error can be and is compensated for, transconductance mismatch is not. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved method an apparatus for compensating for transconductance mismatch in multiple differential amplifiers which enables the use of lower tolerance components resulting in lower area requirements and greater yield. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The invention results from the realization that multiple differential amplifiers, e.g. double differential amplifiers and greater can be compensated for transconductance mismatch by first connecting to a differential switched input of a null amplifier, the differential signal input of the main amplifier, inverted, for compensating for offset errors and transconductance mismatch in the null amplifier; and storing in a null storage device connected to an auxiliary input of the null amplifier, the output of the null amplifier representing the compensation for the offset error and transconductance mismatch of the null amplifier; and second, connecting the differential switched input of the null amplifier to the differential feedback input of the main amplifier and storing in the main storage device connected to an auxiliary input of the main amplifier, the output of the null amplifier representing the compensation for the main amplifier transconductance mismatch and offset error. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DISCLOSURE OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Aside from the preferred embodiment or embodiments disclosed below, this invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Thus, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangements of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. If only one embodiment is described herein, the claims hereof are not to be limited to that embodiment. Moreover, the claims hereof are not to be read restrictively unless there is clear and convincing evidence manifesting a certain exclusion, restriction, or disclaimer. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> There is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a prior art, multiple differential amplifier <b>10</b> including transconductance amplifiers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, summing circuit <b>16</b>, gain amplifier <b>18</b>, and feedback circuit <b>19</b> including feedback resistor <b>20</b>, and gain resistor <b>22</b>. Feedback circuit <b>19</b> is connected to a reference <b>23</b> which may be ground, zero, or any suitable reference. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> In operation a fully differential input signal is provided on differential inputs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> to transconductance amplifier <b>12</b>. Its output is summed in summing circuit <b>16</b> with the output from transconductance amplifier <b>14</b> whose differential input signal on lines <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> is provided by the feedback circuit <b>19</b>, including feedback resistor <b>20</b> and gain resistor <b>22</b>. Any difference between the output of transconductance amplifiers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> will be reflected in the output from summing circuit <b>16</b>. This output is amplified by gain amplifier <b>18</b> and provided to the output <b>32</b>. This output is fed back through feedback circuit <b>19</b>. With resistors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> acting as a voltage divider the scaled down feedback signal is provided at inputs <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> to transconductance amplifier <b>14</b>. When the feedback signal on differential inputs <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> is equivalent to that of the input signal on differential inputs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> the output of summing circuits <b>16</b> is zeroed, and the output of gain amplifier <b>18</b> remains unchanged, so that the output signal at output <b>32</b> is a direct function of the input signal at differential inputs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Since this double differential amplifier <b>10</b> has a fully differential input common mode noise is eliminated. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show a schematic diagram of a prior art differential amplifier system <b>36</b> which includes two such differential amplifiers <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>aa </i>configured to eliminate offset errors. One of the amplifiers <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is a null amplifier; the other <b>10</b><i>aa </i>is the main amplifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents the system in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> operation; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the system in phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b> operation. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> each of the amplifiers <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>aa </i>are shown as having only two inputs, but this is for simplification and ease of understanding only, as each actually has four inputs as shown with respect to amplifier <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> operation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the differential signal inputs <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>a </i>to null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a </i>are shorted together so that the input signal is zero. Any signal at the output <b>40</b> represents the offset error of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a</i>. This value is stored in storage device <b>42</b> which may, for example, be a holding capacitor and delivered to an auxiliary input <b>44</b> of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a</i>. As a result null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a </i>now provides an output at <b>40</b> which is compensated for offset error. Main amplifier <b>10</b><i>aa </i>also has a storage device such as a hold capacitor <b>46</b> associated with it and connected to an auxiliary input <b>48</b> of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>aa. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a </i>is now connected to the same signal inputs as main amplifier <b>10</b><i>aa </i>is at differential signal inputs <b>24</b><i>aa </i>and <b>26</b><i>aa</i>. Now null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a </i>having already been compensated for offset error provides its output on line <b>40</b> to be stored on hold capacitor <b>46</b> and delivered to auxiliary input <b>48</b> of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>aa </i>to compensate for its offset error so that the output of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>aa </i>appearing at <b>32</b><i>a </i>is also compensated for offset error. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> While the shorting of the input to null amplifier <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with the prior art works well to determine and compensate for the offset error it obscures or prevents compensation for the transconductance mismatch because with a shorted or zero input the mismatch between the transconductance amplifiers does not appear. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> However, in accordance with this invention that problem is overcome as both the transconductance mismatch as well as the offset error is compensated for. This is done by applying in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> the same input (for example the input signal) in inverted form to both transconductance amplifiers <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>instead of shorting together its inputs. This still effects a balanced input which allows the offset error to be determined and compensated for but it also provides a non-zero input so that any mismatch in transconductance of amplifiers <b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>will appear. Thus, the output of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is stored in a null storage device, hold capacitor <b>42</b><i>b</i>, and supplied to auxiliary input <b>44</b><i>b</i>, represents compensation for both the offset error and the transconductance mismatch of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b</i>. In phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> in main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb </i>the differential feedback inputs <b>28</b><i>bb </i>and <b>30</b><i>bb </i>of transconductance amplifier <b>12</b><i>bb </i>are connected to feedback circuit <b>19</b><i>b </i>and the differential switched inputs <b>24</b><i>bb</i>, <b>26</b><i>bb </i>are connected directly to the input. Also in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> the differential signal input is provided directly to differential inputs <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of transconductance amplifier <b>12</b><i>b</i>, but inverted to the other differential signal inputs <b>24</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>of transconductance amplifier <b>14</b><i>b </i>in null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b</i>. In phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the input signal is delivered to inputs <b>24</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>and inputs <b>24</b><i>bb</i>, <b>26</b><i>bb </i>of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb</i>, while inputs <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>and inputs <b>28</b><i>bb</i>, <b>30</b><i>bb </i>of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb </i>are connected to feedback circuit <b>19</b><i>b</i>. The output of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>is now stored in main storage device, hold capacitor <b>46</b><i>b</i>, and delivered to auxiliary input <b>48</b><i>b </i>of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb </i>to compensate for transconductance mismatch as well as offset error. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The two different phase operations, phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, demonstrate the conditions of the system <b>36</b><i>a </i>in each of those phases. In actuality these two states or conditions are effected by means of switching system <b>50</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which includes signal switching circuits <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, feedback switching circuits <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and nulling switching circuits <b>60</b>, and <b>62</b> which are operated in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> and phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b> as indicated in the drawing. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The phase signals, phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> <b>70</b>, phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b> <b>72</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, are provided by a clock circuit <b>74</b>. In phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, switch <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are in the position shown so that null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>receives the input signal at inputs <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the inverted input signal at inputs <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>. At this time also in phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> switch <b>60</b> is in the position as shown so that the compensating output from null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>is stored on hold capacitor <b>42</b><i>b </i>and provided to auxiliary input <b>44</b><i>b </i>of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>thereby compensating for its own transconductance mismatch and offset error. In phase &#x3c6; <b>1</b> switches <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>62</b> are open as shown. In phase &#x3c6; <b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, switches <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are open and switches <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are closed so now the feedback inputs of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb </i>are provided to the feedback inputs <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Switches <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are open as is switch <b>60</b> but now switch <b>62</b> is closed and so the output of null amplifier <b>10</b><i>b </i>is stored on hold capacitor <b>46</b><i>b </i>and provided to auxiliary input <b>48</b><i>b </i>of main amplifier <b>10</b><i>bb</i>, thereby compensating for its transconductance mismatch as well as its offset error. While storage devices <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>46</b><i>b </i>are shown as hold capacitors any suitable storage device will do. For example, this signal may be run through an analog to digital converter then stored in a digital storage where it can be operated on more easily and then returned through a digital to analog converter for input to the amplifiers <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>bb</i>.
