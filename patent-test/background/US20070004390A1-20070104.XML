<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a mobile communication apparatus <b>100</b> comprising a processor <b>102</b>, a transceiver <b>104</b> connected to and controlled by the processor <b>102</b> and being arranged to wirelessly communicate with a communication network, a user interface <b>106</b> connected to and controlled by the processor <b>102</b> and being arranged to interact with a user of the mobile communication apparatus <b>100</b>, and a memory <b>108</b> connected to and controlled by the processor <b>102</b> and being arranged to comprise contact information <b>110</b>. For example, the user interface <b>106</b> can comprise one or more displays, a keypad, a keyboard, a speaker, a microphone, a touch sensitive input device, a joystick, a rotating input device, or any other user interface means commonly used at mobile communication apparatuses. At least a part of the contact information <b>110</b> is arranged in a tree structure comprising a plurality of logical levels, as will be described below. The contact information <b>110</b> can comprise one or more groups arranged according to said tree structure. The groups can have different number of logical levels. The tree structure enables the processor <b>102</b> to present contact information by the user interface <b>106</b> in an improved manner. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a group <b>200</b> of contact information arranged in a tree structure with a plurality of logical levels <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>. The contact information is contained in items of the tree structure, where each item can comprise contact information and/or a link to items on a lower logical level. The logical link between the items are assigned by a user, and an item can be assigned logical link from one or more items in a higher logical level. The term higher and lower logical level only denotes which item is linked from another item, and the logical level of an item do not have to be fixed. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example how a user can use the tree structure to feasibly arrange her contact information within a group of contact information. The top logical level item <b>300</b> can be associated with a company, here called C. The top item <b>300</b> can comprise contact information common for the entire company, such as switchboard telephone number, address to head office, web address, etc. This contact information can be comprised in sub-items (not shown) of the top item <b>300</b>, or directly in the top item <b>300</b>. Further, the top item <b>300</b> comprises links to items <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> on a lower logical level, where the lower level items <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be different sites of the company, here item <b>302</b> being associated with site A and item <b>304</b> being associated with site B. In this example, site A may comprise a factory and an administrative office, which each have an associated contact information item <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> on a further lower logical level. Similarly, site B may comprise an R&#x26;D department associated with contact information in an item <b>310</b> and being logically linked to the item <b>304</b> of site B. Further, contact information about Ms. D, a contact person at site B, is associated with an item <b>312</b> which is linked to the item <b>304</b> of site B. Contact information about Mr. E, who belongs to the R&#x26;D department, but normally is situated at the office at site A, is associated with item <b>314</b>, which is linked from the site A office item <b>308</b> and from R&#x26;D department item <b>310</b>. Items <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>310</b>, which are linked to contact information item <b>314</b> about Mr. E can comprise e-mail address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, etc. Further contact persons, e.g. Mr. J, can be associated with contact information items, e.g. item <b>322</b>, linked to higher logical level items, e.g. R&#x26;D department item <b>310</b>, and comprise contact information. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example how a user can use the tree structure to feasibly arrange her contact information within a group of contact information. The top logical level item <b>400</b> can be associated with a family, here called Johnson. The top item <b>400</b> can comprise contact information common for the entire family, such as home address, web address, etc. This contact information can be comprised in sub-items, which here is exemplified with home telephone number item <b>402</b> linked to the top item <b>400</b>, of the top item <b>400</b>, or directly in the top item <b>400</b>. Further, the top item <b>400</b> comprises links to items <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> on a lower logical level, where the lower level items <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> can be different members of the family, here item <b>404</b> being associated with John Johnson and item <b>406</b> being associated with Mary Johnson. In this example, John may have a work telephone and a mobile telephone, which each have an associated contact information item <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> on a further lower logical level. Similarly, Mary may also have a work telephone and a mobile telephone associated with contact information in items <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> and being logically linked to the item <b>406</b> of Mary. Further, contact information about Mary in item <b>406</b> can comprise a photo, red-letter days, etc. Mary may have a mobile telephone mounted in her car with a special telephone number, which is comprised in item <b>416</b>, which is linked to Mary's mobile phone item <b>412</b>. Mary and John may also have a mobile phone mounted in their boat, and the telephone number to that mobile phone is comprised in item <b>418</b>, which is linked to both John's and Mary's mobile phone items <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>. Mary's e-mail address at work, telephone number to Mary's assistant at work, Mary's mobile telephone number at work, etc can be comprised in items <b>420</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, which are linked to Mary's work contact information item <b>414</b>. This way, it is more feasible for a user to choose the right contact information at any situation for keeping contact with either John or Mary. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> It should be noted that an item can be linked more than one group, e.g. as if Mr. J associated with item <b>322</b> above happens to be John Johnson associated with item <b>404</b> above, then John's contact information items are linked both to the group of company C and the group of the Johnson family. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Any contact information, such as home telephone numbers, work telephone numbers, mobile telephone numbers, private e-mail addresses, work e-mail addresses, home addresses, and/or work addresses, can be structured in this way. Further, images, text, symbols, sounds, red-letter days, and/or web addresses can also be incorporated in this structure for enabling more personalized, informative, and accessible contact information. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> As an example the tree structure can be seen as a family album, where the items of each family comprises images, e.g. portraits, which are presented with relations, e.g. husband, wife, kids, brother in law, grandparents, etc, and a user can browse the tree structure on basis of the relations and see the images of the family members. The items can also be represented by symbols, texts, etc, whichever the user finds most convenient. Similarly, the tree structure can be seen as a company roll, where the items of each company comprises images, e.g. portraits, which are presented with relations/roles, e.g. CEO, COO, executive vice president, CTO, manager of department X, CFO, supervisor whithin Y, legal council, etc, and the user can browse the tree structure on basis of the relations and roles and see e.g. the portraits of the persons. The items can also be represented by symbols, texts, name of department, etc. When the user, during browsing, finds the right person, the item can be selected, and contact information according to what described above can be accessed, or, if the user so prefers, be linked to another tree structure of the selected person, e.g. showing his/her family tree, hunting party, sports association, etc, which can be further browsed in a similar way. Many other examples of tree structure bases, such as different organizations, friendship relations, etc, can be used for organizing contact information. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> During browsing, a group of contacts can be selected, e.g. for a group SMS, where the tree structure and its relations are utilized for easily making the group. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> A system architecture for managing a system <b>500</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A Home Location Register (HLR) <b>502</b> contains a database (not shown) including relevant subscriber information for provision of telecommunication service. A CCITT specified network <b>504</b> interconnects the individual parts of the system <b>500</b>. A contact information gateway <b>506</b> is a switching unit routing a message or a call to a mobile communication apparatus <b>508</b>-<b>512</b>. If contact information is to be stored at network side, a Contact Information Service Center <b>514</b> (CINC) and the contact information gateway <b>506</b> handles and routes the contact information between the CINC <b>514</b> and the network <b>504</b>. From the network <b>504</b>, the contact information is routed to the mobile communication apparatuses <b>508</b>-<b>512</b> via a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>516</b> to a Base Station Controller (BSC) <b>517</b> and a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) <b>520</b>, <b>521</b>, or a Radio Network Controller (RNC) <b>518</b> and a Node B <b>522</b>. Alternatively, the contact information is routed to the mobile communication apparatuses <b>508</b>-<b>512</b> via a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) <b>526</b>, <b>528</b> to the BSC <b>517</b> and the BTS <b>520</b>, <b>521</b>, or the RNC <b>518</b> and the Node B <b>522</b>, respectively. The BTS <b>520</b>, <b>521</b> or the Node B <b>522</b> establish the air connection to the mobile communication apparatuses <b>508</b>-<b>512</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> According to an embodiment of the present invention, a network operator or other third party company handling a contact information server <b>524</b> could offer a contact information function between persons not knowing each other. For example a network operator may have a contact information server <b>524</b> supporting a feature where the user may send a contact information request from his mobile communication apparatus <b>508</b>-<b>512</b> to the contact information server <b>524</b> by using a special phone number. This contact information server <b>524</b> can then automatically provide contact information structured according to the present invention, e.g. for a company and contact persons at that company, together with web address, fax number, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example according to the present invention, where a mobile communication apparatus <b>600</b> views contact information on a display <b>602</b>. The contact information can be presented on the display <b>602</b> according to a tree structure <b>604</b> on the display <b>602</b> of the mobile communication apparatus <b>600</b>. It can then be feasible to have a display view that comprises all items of the tree structure <b>604</b>. To be able to see the items in a reasonable size, a scrolling function of the display view can be provided to view a user selected part of the items, where a scroll bar <b>606</b> helps a user to navigate the display view. Scrolling can be enabled both horizontally and vertically, depending on the size of the tree structure <b>604</b>, the size of the display <b>602</b>, and the preferred sizes of the presented items. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The invention has mainly been described above with reference to a few embodiments.
