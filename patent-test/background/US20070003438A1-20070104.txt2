BACKGROUND 
 Sample mini columns are known which can bind an analysis object material in a sample to a substructure within the column by having a funnel for storing sample at the top end of a column, introducing sample into the funnel, and injecting sample into the column by sealing the top part of the funnel and increasing the pressure (for example, refer to WO98/03264). Intemational Laid-Open Patent Publication No. WO98/03264 discloses an auto analyzer that injects a solvent into a column through an inlet nozzle to dissociate an analyte from a substructure by connecting the inlet nozzle to the top end of the column, and introducing the solvent containing the analyte into a detection device through an outlet nozzle connected to the bottom end of the column so as to automatically detect the analyte in order to analyze an analyze analyte material held in a column. 
 This auto analyzer is provided with an inlet nozzle and outlet nozzle for each of a plurality of columns. The inlet nozzle is connected to a pump via a rotating valve, and liquid is fed into an object column from the pump via the rotating valve and inlet nozzle by switching the rotating valve. The outlet nozzle is connected to a detecting device through a rotating valve, and liquid is fed to the detecting device from the object column via the outlet nozzle and rotating valve. 
 In the above auto analyzer with columns, however, a plurality of columns are provided, and the flow paths from the pump to the detection device via the columns are complicated in order to analyze an analyte material held in a different column switching the flow path from a column using rotating valves, such that in order to analyze an analyte material in a different column, the residue of the previous analyte remaining in the complex of flow paths must be washed therefrom.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 Although the present invention is described in details hereinafter based on the embodiments shown in the drawings, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. 
 Column 
 FIG. 1 is a top view of a column used in the present embodiment, FIG. 2 is a side view of the column shown in FIG. 1, and FIG. 3 is a cross sectional A-A view of the column shown in FIG. 1. 
 As shown in the drawings, the column 1 is cylindrical in shape and made of vinyl chloride resin, and has in its interior a support holding part 2 for holding a support 6 used for isolating a target substance in a liquid sample, a liquid introducing part 3 for introducing a liquid sample to the support holding part 2, and a liquid storing part 4 for receiving and storing a liquid sample from the support holding part 2. The column 1 is a precision cut, solid molded part of vinyl chloride resin. When mass produced, solid molding may also be accomplished by a molding process. Polyprene resin and polyacetal resin with scant protein absorption may be used instead of vinyl chloride resin. The column 1 is disposable as the column 1 is composed of above material. 
 The liquid storing part 4 of the column 1 has a 300        L capacity, and a top of the liquid storing part 4 has an opening 5 for collecting liquid sample by an external source. The column has a diameter of 10 mm, and a length of 35 mm. A column diameter of 1       15 mm is desirable, as is a column length of 10       50 mm. The support is a cylindrical monolithic silica gel measuring 2.7 mm in diameter by 3 mm in height. The monolithic silica gel has different particle supports, and has a structure of a three-dimensional network framework with integrated empty spaces. The support 6 is inserted into the support holding part 2 from the bottom opening, and supported by an elastic pressure provided by an anchor pipe 8 through an O-ring 7. 
 The anchor pipe 8 is press-fitted from the bottom opening of the column 1, and the pipe 8 and the hole of the O-ring 7 form a liquid introducing part 3. 
 The bottom end of the column 1 is provided with a charging flange 9 for charging and anchoring the column 1 in a sample preparing unit described later. The flange 9 is a planed flange with horizontal notch, such that the bilateral width of the disk-like flange of diameter D is (W      D). 
 Sample Preparing Unit 
 FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the sample preparing unit of the present embodiment. 
 As shown in the drawing, a sample preparing unit 11 is provided with an L-shaped support plate 12, and fixedly attached to the support plate 12 are a fluid manifold 13, syringe 14, and speed reducing stepping motor 15. 
 A screw shaft 16 is connected to the output shaft of the stepping motor 15. A drive arm 17, which screws onto the screw shaft 16, is connected to the tip of a piston 18 of the syringe 14. When the screw shaft 16 is rotated by the stepping motor 15, the piston 18 is moved vertically. The syringe 14 and fluid manifold 13 are connected via delivery tube 18 through connectors 19 and 20. The syringe 14 is also connected to a liquid holding chamber 34 described later by a delivery tube 20b via a connector 20a. The syringe 14, stepping motor 15, screw shaft 16, drive arm 17, and piston 18 configure a syringe pump. 
 Liquid Manifold 
 FIG. 5 is a top view of the fluid manifold, and FIG. 6 is a cross sectional B-B view of FIG. 5. As shown in these drawings, the fluid manifold 13 is formed of vinyl chloride resin, and is provided with a column connecting part 21 for connecting to the liquid introducing part 3 of the column 1, and a liquid sample receiving part 22 for receiving a liquid sample. 
 The fluid manifold 13 is provided with an internal flow path 23, and at the bottom surface is provided with an electromagnetic valve 24 that operates between the liquid sample introducing part 22 and the flow path 23, and an electromagnetic valve 25 that operates between the flow path 23 and the column connecting part 21. The fluid manifold 13 has a threaded connector hole 26 (FIG. 5) for connecting the connector 20 to the side surface, and the threaded hole 26 connects to the flow path 23. 
 FIG. 7 is a flow circuit diagram of the sample preparing unit 11, and shows the syringe 14 connected to the fluid manifold 13 via the connector 20. The liquid holding chamber 34 is connected to the syringe 14 via an electromagnetic valve 33 provided on the fluid operating part 71 (refer to FIG. 8) described later, and a positive pressure is applied from a positive pressure source 35 to the liquid holding chamber 34. 
 The method by which the column 1 is loaded in the fluid manifold 13 is described below. 
 As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, a column receiving concavity 27 is formed on the top surface of the fluid manifold 13 in order to accommodate the bottom end of the column 1, and an O-ring 28 is fitted on the circumference of the bottom surface while allowing passage through the center of the bottom of the concavity 27 to the column connecting part 21. Attached to the top surface of the fluid manifold 13 are two pressing plates 29 and 30 having L-shaped cross sections are attached in parallel with a gap wider than W and narrower than D therebetween as shown in FIG. 1, and centered on the column receiving concavity 27. 
 The column 1 is loaded in the column receiving concavity 27 so that the flange 9 passes between the pressing plates 29 and 30, and rotated 90 degrees in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction. Thus, the D diameter part of the flange 9 engages the pressing plates 29 and 30, and the flange 9 is attached by the pressing plates 29 and 30 via the elasticity of the O-ring 28. To remove the column 1, the column 1 is pressed and rotated 90 degrees in either left or right directions. 
 When the column 1 is loaded in the fluid manifold 13 of the sample preparing unit 11, the concavity 27 of the manifold 13 is filled with liquid to prevent the introduction of air bubbles, and fluid may overflow depending on the capacity when the tip of the column 1 is inserted in the concavity 27, as described later. In order to prevent this liquid from flowing to the margins, an overflow storage concavity 31 (refer to FIGS. 5 and 6) is formed at the perimeter of the column loading concavity 27, and a concavity 32 which is deeper than the concavity 31 is provided at part of the concavity 31. 
 When the sample preparing unit 11 is installed in an auto measuring mechanism as described later, the overflow liquid is suctioned and drained from the concavity 32 by a dispensing pipette 62.

 Measurement Preparation 
 When starting a measurement, a stock solution is preloaded in the fluid manifold 13 of the sample preparing unit 11 as described below. In the flow path shown in FIG. 7, first, stock solution is introduced to the syringe 14 from the stock solution chamber 34 by opening the electromagnetic valves 24 and 33, and the stock solution flows to the liquid sample receiving part 22 via the electromagnetic valve 24. Then, the electromagnetic valves 24 and 33 are closed and the electromagnetic valves 25 and 33 are opened, and stock solution flows from the stock solution chamber 34 and is delivered to the column receiving concavity 27 via the electromagnetic valve 33, syringe 14, and electromagnetic valve 25, such that the stock solution fills the concavity 27. 
 Thereafter, the electromagnetic valves 25 and 33 are closed. 
 In this condition, the column 1 is mounted. 
 An antibody that specifically bonds to the enzyme that is the activity measurement object is solid phased beforehand in the support (monolithic silica gel) within the column 1. Then, stock solution 103 is loaded in the column 1 so as to prevent any contact of the antibody with the air, and caps 101 and 102 are respectively attached to the top and bottom of the column 1 which is then sealed (FIG. 12). First, the bottom cap 102 of the column 1 is removed, and brought near the column loading concavity 27 of the sample preparing unit 11. At this time, a droplet 104 forms at the tip due to the weight of the liquid in the column 1 (FIG. 13). Then, the droplet 104 at the tip of the column 1 and the liquid filling the column loading concavity 27 come into contact as the column 1 is inserted into the concavity 27, whereupon the column 1 is rotated 90 degrees and fixed in place. Thereafter, the top cap 101 of the column 1 is removed. Thus, measurement preparation is completed.

 Then, approximately 150        l of stock solution is injected into the column receiving concavity 27 by the dispensing pipette 62. An air gap is formed within the column connecting part 21. 
 In this condition, the column 1 is mounted. 
 An antibody that specifically bonds to the enzyme that is the activity measurement object is solid phased beforehand in the support (monolithic silica gel) within the column 1. Then, stock solution 103 is loaded in the column 1 so as to prevent any contact of the antibody with the air, and caps 101 and 102 are respectively attached to the top and bottom of the column 1 which is then sealed (FIG. 12). First, the bottom cap 102 of the column 1 is removed, and brought near the column loading concavity 27 of the sample preparing unit 11. At this time, a droplet 104 forms at the tip due to the weight of the liquid in the column 1 (FIG. 13). Then, the droplet 104 at the tip of the column 1 and the liquid filling the column loading concavity 27 come into contact as the column 1 is inserted into the concavity 27, whereupon the column 1 is rotated 90 degrees and fixed in place. Thereafter, the top cap 101 of the column 1 is removed. Thus, measurement preparation is completed.

 Thus, the enzyme activity of the target enzyme contained in the specimen is measured. 
 The sample is prepared, for example, by a general method that homogenizes and centrifuges biological tissues. 
 In the present invention, when a target enzyme is captured and the enzyme activity measured, sepharose beads and the like may be used instead of monolithic silica gel as the support placed in the column. 
 Furthermore, CDK-1 (cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1) is offered as an example of a target enzyme. When CDK-1 is the target enzyme, the antibody used will be CDK-1 antibody.
