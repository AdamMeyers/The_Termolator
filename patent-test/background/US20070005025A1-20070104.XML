<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> Bowel cleansing procedures typically involve the purging of the colon using an enema. An enema may be packaged as an over-the-counter therapeutic product for use by a consumer. Such a ready-to-use enema includes a liquid in a dispenser, which is typically a flexible bottle equipped with a nozzle. The liquid is administered by inserting the nozzle into the rectum of the patient, and squeezing the bottle to force the liquid through the nozzle and into the patient's colon. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The force required to squeeze the liquid from an enema dispenser affects the ease with which a user may administer the liquid. The self-administration of a conventional enema may be especially difficult for elderly patients, due to the squeeze force required to deliver a complete dose of the enema liquid. Although it would be advantageous to decrease the amount of squeeze force required to administer an enema, such a modification may adversely affect other desirable features of the product. In particular, it is desirable to prevent any reflux of liquid back into the bottle after the enema liquid has been delivered, and it is desirable to prevent leakage of the enema liquid from the dispenser prior to use. A simple reduction in the resistance to flow of the liquid through the dispenser may compromise these features. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> It is desirable to provide an enema that is easier to administer, and that prevents reflux of liquid into the bottle after use and leakage of the enema liquid prior to use. It is also desirable to provide enema dispensers that can be used to more easily administer a variety of different enema liquids. It is also desirable to provide enema dispensers that can be used to more easily administer a range of doses of enema liquids. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The present invention provides an enema that can be administered with a lower amount of force. The enema includes a liquid in a dispenser having a bottle, a nozzle attached to the bottle, and a valve. The valve may be a membrane having a slit and a thickness of at most 0.90 millimeter (mm). The valve may be attached to the bottle or may be attached to the nozzle. The present invention also includes a method of bowel cleansing, including inserting the enema into a rectum and applying a compression force to the enema bottle. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> It has been surprisingly found that a valve having a thickness less than the conventional thickness may provide for a reduction in the squeeze force required to dispense a liquid from an enema dispenser. Although the liquid may experience a lower resistance to flow during administration, there may be little or no increase in reflux of liquid back into the enema bottle after the enema liquid has been administered. In addition, there may be little or no increase in leakage of the enema liquid prior to administration. The dispenser design may provide these advantageous properties for a variety of enema liquids and for a range of doses of these liquids. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents an enema <b>100</b> including an enema dispenser <b>110</b>, an enema liquid <b>120</b> in the dispenser, and optional shield <b>130</b>. The dispenser <b>110</b> includes a bottle <b>112</b> and a nozzle <b>114</b>. The bottle <b>112</b> may have a variety of shapes and sizes, and preferably contains a unit dose of the enema liquid <b>120</b>. The nozzle <b>114</b> is attached to the bottle <b>112</b> at the opening of the bottle, and includes a passageway for the enema liquid. At least a portion of the exterior of the nozzle <b>114</b> may have a lubricant to facilitate proper insertion of the nozzle into the patient. The shield <b>130</b> fits over the nozzle <b>114</b>, protecting the nozzle and/or sealing the dispenser prior to use. The shield may help maintain a lubricant in place on the nozzle prior to use. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> The enema liquid <b>120</b> may be any liquid that promotes a bowel movement when introduced into the colon. Examples of enema liquids include water; hypertonic aqueous salt solutions; solutions or suspensions of cathartic agents, such as bisacodyl or phenolphthalein; and mineral oil. Preferably a unit dose of the enema liquid <b>120</b> is present in the bottle <b>112</b> of the dispenser <b>110</b>. The volume of the unit dose depends on the type of enema liquid, the specific formulation of active and inactive ingredients in the liquid, and the type of patient for which the enema is intended. Preferably the total volume of the enema liquid <b>120</b> in the bottle <b>112</b> is greater than the volume of the unit dose, since a small amount of the liquid typically remains in the bottle after the enema has been administered to the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In one example, the enema liquid <b>120</b> is a hypertonic aqueous salt solution containing water, dibasic sodium phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and monobasic sodium phosphate (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). An enema containing this type of composition is referred to as a &#x201c;saline enema.&#x201d; Typical amounts of these ingredients for unit dose administrations to adults are from 6.84 to 7.56 grams dibasic sodium phosphate and from 18.24 to 20.16 grams monobasic sodium phosphate. The concentration of the dibasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.02 to 0.10 grams per milliliter (g/mL), and the concentration of the monobasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.10 to 0.25 g/mL. In a typical phosphate enema liquid formulation, the concentration of the dibasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.04 to 0.08 g/mL, and the concentration of the monobasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.12 to 0.20 g/mL. Preferably the concentration of the dibasic sodium phosphate is from 0.05 to 0.07 g/mL, and the concentration of the monobasic sodium phosphate is from 0.14 to 0.18 g/mL. For enemas based on this typical formulation, the unit dose for an adult may be from 85 to 130 mL, and the total liquid volume may be from 100 to 150 mL. For enemas based on this typical formulation, the unit dose for a child may be from 45 to 65 mL, and the total liquid volume may be from 50 to 75 mL. Typical amounts of these ingredients for unit dose administrations to children are from 3.42 to 3.78 grams dibasic sodium phosphate, and from 9.12 to 10.08 grams monobasic sodium phosphate. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In another phosphate enema liquid formulation, the concentration of the dibasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.01 to 0.05 g/mL, and the concentration of the monobasic sodium phosphate may be from 0.05 to 0.12 g/mL. This formulation range is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/846,488, filed May 13, 2004, entitled &#x201c;Large Volume Enema.&#x201d; In the large volume phosphate enema liquid formulation, the concentration of the dibasic sodium phosphate preferably is from 0.03 to 0.04 g/mL, and the concentration of the monobasic sodium phosphate preferably is from 0.07 to 0.09 g/mL. For enemas based on this formulation, the unit dose for an adult may be from 170 to 260 mL, and the total liquid volume may be from 200 to 300 mL. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In another example, the enema liquid <b>120</b> is an aqueous suspension of 4,4&#x2032;-(2-pyridylmethylene)bisphenol diacetate(bisacodyl). The concentration of bisacodyl may be from 0.05 to 0.1 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL), and preferably is from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/mL. For bisacodyl enemas based on this formulation, the unit dose for an adult may be from 25 to 35 mL, and the total liquid volume may be from 30 to 45 mL. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> In another example, the enema liquid <b>120</b> is mineral oil. For mineral oil enemas, the unit dose for an adult may be from 85 to 130 mL, and the total liquid volume may be from 100 to 150 mL. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a bottle <b>200</b> including a body <b>210</b>, a neck <b>220</b> and an opening <b>230</b>. The body <b>210</b> has a length <b>212</b> and a width <b>214</b>. The neck <b>220</b> has a length <b>222</b>, a proximal end <b>224</b> at the junction with the body <b>210</b>, a distal end <b>226</b> at the opening <b>230</b>, and optional screw threads <b>228</b>. The proximal end <b>224</b> of the neck has a width <b>225</b>, and the distal end <b>226</b> of the neck has a width <b>227</b>. The length <b>212</b> may be from 4 to 12 centimeters (cm), and the width <b>214</b> may be from 2.5 to 6 cm. The length <b>222</b> may be from 2 to 5 cm, the width <b>225</b> may be from 1 to 3 cm, and the width <b>227</b> may be from 0.7 to 2.5 cm. The width <b>227</b> corresponds to the diameter of opening <b>230</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The bottle <b>200</b> preferably is a flexible material. Examples of flexible materials for the bottle <b>200</b> include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, ethylene-propylene-diene copolymers (EPDM), styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymers (NBR, or Buna-N), neoprene elastomer (polychloroprene and its copolymers), polyurethane elastomer, and silicone elastomer. Examples of flexible polyethylenes include LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE. Preferably the flexible material is latex-free and sterile. It may be desirable for the bottle to be transparent or translucent, permitting the liquid contents to be viewed. It may be desirable for the bottle to contain printed information, such as brand information, instructions for use, and/or an expiration date. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The opening <b>230</b> and the area of the neck <b>220</b> near the opening preferably are sized and shaped to provide a liquid-tight seal with a nozzle, such as nozzle <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Optional screw threads <b>228</b> may coordinate with screw threads inside the nozzle to secure the nozzle to the opening <b>230</b>. It may be desirable for the opening <b>230</b> and the area of the neck <b>220</b> near the opening to be configured uniformly for bottles that otherwise may have a variety of shapes and sizes. Such a uniform configuration may provide for a single type of nozzle to be used with a variety of different bottles. </p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> An enema dispenser valve may be any object that inhibits flow of the liquid into or out of an enema dispenser.

Once the critical compression force is applied, the enema liquid can flow through the valve and out of the dispenser. Preferably the critical compression force is greater than the forces typically encountered during normal handling of the enema prior to administration. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The valve also minimizes or prevents liquid flow from the surrounding environment into the dispenser, which may have the possibility of occurring after administration of the enema liquid to a patient. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, the valve minimizes or prevents liquid flow from the distal opening <b>546</b> back into the bottle <b>530</b>. Without the valve, liquid might reflux back into the dispenser due to the pressure of the liquid in contact with the exterior of the dispenser and/or the vacuum created in the interior of the dispenser during the delivery of the enema liquid. Preferably the valve prevents the flow of liquid back into the dispenser for combinations of external liquid pressure and internal vacuum pressure typically encountered during normal administration of the enema. </p>

The membrane <b>610</b> is a disc of flexible material. Examples of flexible materials for membrane <b>610</b> include polyisoprene, polybutadiene, ethylene-propylene-diene copolymers (EPDM), styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymers (NBR, or Buna-N), neoprene elastomer (polychloroprene and its copolymers), polyurethane elastomer, and silicone elastomer. The flexibility of materials is quantified by the Shore A durometer value, which is measured according to ASTM D2240 00. The membrane may have a hardness of less than 150 Shore A, preferably less than 100 Shore A, and more preferably from 40 to 80 Shore A. Preferably the membrane is latex-free and sterile.

Preferably the slit permits liquid flow in only one direction, allowing flow from the dispenser when a critical force is applied, and preventing flow back into the dispenser. The length <b>622</b> of the slit is limited by the diameter <b>630</b> of the valve. For example, the length <b>622</b> may be from 10 to 90% of the diameter <b>630</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> A valve including a membrane, a slit, and a thickness of at most 0.90 mm may provide a reduction in the force required to dispense an enema liquid from an enema dispenser. This reduction in the force required to dispense an enema liquid from the dispenser may be quantified in terms of the squeeze force of the enema. Squeeze force is measured by the following test. An enema is placed horizontally in a holder secured to a base of a test stand. The holder is a longitudinal cross section of a hollow cylinder having a radius of curvature of 2 inches (5.08 cm), an arc of 130-degrees, a length of 5.875 inches (14.92 cm), and capped at a right angle at each end with a 130-degree section of a washer having an outer diameter of 2 inches (5.08 cm) and an inner diameter of 13/16 inch (2.06 cm). Examples of test stands include mechanical test stands, pneumatic test stands, motorized test stands, and digital test stands. Specific examples of test stands include those available from Chatillon&#xae; (AMTEK TCI Division, Largo, Fla.), Cole-Parmer&#xae; Instrument Company (Vernon Hills, Ill.), and Imada, Inc. (Northbrook, Ill.). The test stand is equipped with a force gauge connected to a movable crosshead, where the crosshead is a rigid half-cylinder having a length of 3.25 inches (8.26 cm), a diameter of 2 inches (5.08 cm), and a chamfer on each semicircular end of 0.125 inch (0.318 cm) by 45 degrees. Examples of force gauges include those that operate mechanically, electronically or electro-mechanically, and may include an analog or a digital display of the force measurement. The nozzle of the enema is attached to one end of a tube, with the other end placed in a graduated cylinder positioned below the holder. The crosshead is lowered at a rate of 2 inches per minute (5.08 cm/min) to contact and compress the enema. The force measurements from the force gauge are recorded at the initiation of flow and at particular displaced volumes as measured in the graduated cylinder. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The compression force applied to the enema may be measured at the initiation of liquid flow. The compression force may also be measured once particular liquid volumes or percentages of the liquid volume originally contained in the enema are displaced. If the squeeze force is expressed as the compression force at a total displaced liquid volume, the units for squeeze force include lb-f@ x oz., Newtons@ x mL, and dynes@ x mL, where &#x201c;x&#x201d; is the total volume of liquid displaced at the measured compression force. If the squeeze force is expressed as the compression force at a percentage of displaced liquid volume, the units for squeeze force include lb-f@ y %, Newtons@ y %, and dynes@ y %, where &#x201c;y&#x201d; is the volume of liquid displaced as a percentage of the total volume of liquid originally contained in the enema. Examples of volume percentages at which compression measurements may be taken include 0% (flow initiation), 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the liquid volume originally contained in the enema. </p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> When incorporated into an enema dispenser, a valve including a membrane, a slit, and a thickness of at most 0.90 mm may provide a reduction in the force required to dispense an enema liquid from the dispenser. This effect may be greater for saline enemas. Within the saline enema system, the reduction in squeeze force was provided for enemas containing different dose sizes and/or containing different concentrations of the phosphate ingredients. A valve including a membrane having a slit and a thickness of from 0.70-0.80 mm may reduce the force required to administer a variety of enema liquids relative to an enema containing a conventional valve. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> The advantageous reduction in squeeze force for an enema having a valve including a membrane, a slit, and a thickness of at most 0.90 mm may be provided without permitting reflux of liquid back into the dispenser after use. In addition, the advantageous reduction in squeeze force may be provided without permitting leakage of the liquid prior to use. It may be desirable for the thickness to be at least a minimum thickness, so as to ensure this prevention of reflux and leakage. Examples of minimum thicknesses include 0.05 mm, 0.10 mm, 0.60 mm and 0.70 mm. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> The resistance of an enema dispenser to reflux of liquid back into the dispenser is measured by the following test. An enema is placed horizontally in a bath of water containing a dye, with the nozzle below the liquid surface. The enema bottle is squeezed by hand to expel a liquid volume corresponding to a unit dose of the enema liquid. The hand pressure is then released, with the nozzle maintained beneath the liquid surface, and the dispenser is observed for any colored water being drawn into the dispenser. The squeezing, releasing and observation steps are repeated four more times or until all liquid has been expelled from the dispenser. </p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> A series of FLEET&#xae; bisacodyl enemas for adult use were equipped with membrane valves having a diameter of 1.98 cm, a single slit having a length of 1.23 cm, and a thickness of 1.02, 0.89, 0.76 or 0.64 mm. The membrane valves were made of a sterile elastomer having a hardness of from 66-76 Shore A. Each enema contained 37 mL of an aqueous suspension of bisacodyl (0.33 mg/mL), and of the 37 mL of total liquid, 30 mL is considered a unit dose. These enemas were tested for squeeze force by the procedure of Example 1, with force measurements recorded at the initiation of flow and at displaced volumes of 5 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL and 20 mL as measured in the graduated cylinder. The squeeze force measurement was repeated for a total of 3 samples for each type of enema. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph of the average squeeze force measurements for these enemas. One sample of each type of enema was also tested for reflux. No reflux was observed for any of the enemas tested. </p>
