BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 (a) Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to an inner core structure of a golf club bag and more particularly to an inner core which is installed in an interior of a golf club bag for preventing more than ten golf clubs from being interleaved in the bag such that they are difficult to retrieve, their shafts and handles are scratched with each other and damaged, and their club heads are collided in an opening of bag, and for easily identifying, retrieving, and emplacing during playing a golf. 
 (b) Description of the Prior Art 
 As the improvement of living standard, the casual exercise has become one of the important priorities used to mediate mind and body in the current society. In the casual exercises, golf playing is provided most with the effects of doing an exercise and keeping a body fit. 
 In playing a golf, other than swinging the golf, one must also walk in a large golf course. Therefore, for an aged person or an office worker with a greater working pressure, the mind and body can be mediated through walking, in addition to releasing the pressure by swinging the golf. Accordingly, playing the golf has now become one of the most popular exercises. 
 In playing the golf, other than the golf, the most essential part is golf clubs. Depending on the techniques for swinging the clubs, there are many different kinds of golf clubs. Therefore, every golfer is mostly in possession of more than ten golf clubs. As a price of golf club is usually not cheap, the protection to the golf club is very important. 
 In general, more than ten golf clubs with different swinging techniques will be carried in playing the golf; therefore, these golf clubs must be emplaced in a golf club bag to facilitate carrying and moving during walking. 
 However, upon emplacing the golf clubs in a conventional golf club bag, all of the golf clubs are usually collected in the same golf club bag, allowing that a collision occurs to the shafts and club heads during walking and moving, thereby causing a damage to the shafts and club heads, which will hurt a golfer and cost him or her a great fortune. 
 Accordingly, there is a vendor who installs a plurality of holes on an inner top of golf club bag, such that each golf club can be inserted into a hole separately, and a collision between the shafts can be reduced, in order to attract a large population of golfers. However, for this kind of structure, the shafts will be still rattling in the holes due to a movement of walking, thereby causing the shafts and club heads to collide in an interior of and at an opening of the golf club bag, which does not completely solve the problem. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 Accordingly, the primary object of present invention is to provide a golf club bag with an inner core which includes an upper ring, a lower ring, a plurality of supporting frames connecting the upper ring and the lower ring, and a plurality of tubes between the upper ring and the lower ring, wherein the upper ring is provided with a plurality of through-holes, and the lower ring is provided with a plurality of pillars in different heights. The pillars are corresponding to the through-holes and each tube is located between the through-holes and the pillars, thereby forming a nest of tube. When the golf clubs are inserted in an interior of golf club bag through the through-holes, each golf club can be emplaced in the mutually independent nest of tube, which will not interfere with each other and is provided with a convenience of retrieving and emplacing. In addition, as the pillars, which provide a function of cushion, can enable the club heads of golf clubs to be configured in different heights at an opening of the golf club bag, the collision can be reduced, and the golf clubs can be protected whether during playing the golf or transporting the golf club bag. More particularly, the golf clubs can be easily identified, and can be conveniently retrieved and emplaced, while playing the golf. 
 Another object of the present invention is to further install an elastic C-shape loop, which is provided with a clipping hole at a center thereof, in each through-hole of upper ring, such that when each golf club is inserted into the clipping hole, it can be fixed through the clipping hole, thereby preventing from rattling or rotating. In addition, the club heads can be maintained at a fixed spacing in association with the effect of configuring the golf clubs in the interior of golf club bag in different heights. 
 Still another object of the present invention is to facilitate a golfer to identify and select the golf clubs due to a staging and helical configuration of the golf clubs. 
 To enable a further understanding of the said objectives and the technological methods of the invention herein, the brief description of the drawings below is followed by the detailed description of the preferred embodiments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a golf club bag is provided with an inner core structure comprising an upper ring 10, a lower ring 20, a plurality of supporting frames 30, and a plurality of tubes 40, wherein the upper ring 10 is installed with a plurality of through-holes 11, the lower ring 20 is installed with a plurality of pillars 21 which are corresponding to the through-holes 11 on the upper ring 10, two ends of supporting frame 30 are fixed at edges of the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20 separately to maintain a proper distance between the upper ring 10 and the lower ring, and each tube 40, which is in a hollow shape, is located between the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20, and is provided with a top end which is corresponding to a bottom of the through-hole 11 of upper ring 10 and is aligned with a center of the through-hole 11, and a bottom end which is sheathing on an outer edge of pillar 21 of lower ring 20, thereby forming a nest of tube. 
 Referring to FIG. 3, upon implementing, the supporting frame 30 is primarily provided with hooks 31 at a top and a bottom end thereof, which are extended toward side walls of the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20, respectively. On the other hand, inserting holes 12, 22 are located at the side walls of upper ring 10 and lower ring 20, allowing the hooks 31 to be inserted into. The supporting frames 30 can be fixed on the side walls of upper ring 10 and lower ring 20 by inserting the hooks 31 into the inserting holes 12, 22, and a proper spacing can be maintained between the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20 by the supporting frames 30. In the mean time, the through-holes 11 of upper ring 10 can be kept on a same center of axis with that of the pillar 21 of lower ring 20. 
 Referring to FIG. 4, when each hollow tube 40 is installed between the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20, as the top end of each tube 40 is corresponding to the bottom of the through-hole 11, and the bottom end of each tube 40 is sheathing on the pillar 21, a nest of tube is formed. Therefore, a difference in heights will be generated in an interior of each tube 40 due to a variation in heights of each pillar 21, thereby causing a difference in heights to the club heads which are exposed out of the upper ring 10, when each golf club is emplaced in an interior of nest of tube constituted by the tube 40 through the through-hole 11 of upper ring 10, by a variation in heights of the pillars 21. Accordingly, a collision will not occur to the club heads, which will in turn maintain integrity of the club heads, such that the club heads will not be deformed or damaged by collision. 
 Moreover, the side walls of lower ring 20 are further provided with a plurality of spring leaves 23 which can be deformed elastically and are protruded out of exteriors of side walls. When the entire inner core structure is emplaced inside the golf club bag, the golf club bag will be pushed outward through the spring leaves 23, so as to maintain a proper distance between a lining of the golf club bag and the inner core structure, thereby preventing the tubes 40 from deformation due to a direct pressing to the inner core structure by the golf club bag. 
 In addition, referring to FIG. 1, FIG. 2, and FIG. 5, an elastic C-shape loop 50 can be further installed in the through-hole 11 of upper ring 10, and a clipping hole 51 can be also located at a center of the loop 50, with a guiding hole 52, which is gradually opened from the clipping hole 51, located on an outer wall of the loop 50. When the golf club is inserted into the tube 40 through the through-hole 11, the shaft of golf club can be fixed in the clipping hole 51 through the guiding hole 52 of loop 50, such that the clipping hole 51 can be tightly fitted with the shaft, followed by pressing the loop 50 into the through-hole 11 to fix the shaft at a central position of through-hole 11 through the loop 50 and restrict a movement of the shaft, thereby enabling the entire golf club to be not easily rotated or rattled, which will prevent the club heads from collision during walking or moving, and will form an effect of double protection by generating a difference in heights of golf clubs at an exterior of upper ring 10 in association with the pillars 21 of lower ring 20. 
 On the other hand, referring to FIG. 6, to enhance the protection effect, the two ends of tube 40 are not necessarily to be in contact with the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20, but a fixing ring 60 can be sheathed on exteriors of tubes 40, at one or a plurality of vertical positions between the upper ring 10 and the lower ring 20, and is mutually latched with each supporting frame 30, so as to maintain a center of axis of tube 40 to be at a same center line with each through-hole 11 and pillar 21. After the golf club is passed through the through-hole 11, it can be accurately inserted into the tube 40 which is at a same center line with the through-hole 11, and its tail end can be accurately located on the pillar 20, so as to generate a difference in heights to the club heads at exteriors of the upper ring 10, and to prevent the club heads from collision, which will also achieve a same effect. In addition, as the golf clubs are configured on the inner core structure in a staging and helical shape, they can be easily identified; thereby facilitating a golfer to identify, retrieve, or emplace while playing the golf. 
 It is of course to be understood that the embodiments described herein is merely illustrative of the principles of the invention and that a wide variety of modifications thereto may be effected by persons skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
