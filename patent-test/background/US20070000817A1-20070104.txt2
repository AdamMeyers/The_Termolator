A screening arrangement in a vibrating screen for screening of material, such as crushed stone, gravel or the like. The screening arrangement is a cross-tensioned or longitudinally tensioned screening media including elements arranged on top of the screening media for stirring or mixing the screened material, the stirring elements being raised portions, which are arranged transversely to the travel direction of the screened material. 




















FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a screening arrangement in a vibrating screen for screening of material, such as crushed stone, gravel or the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a screening arrangement being a cross-tensioned or a longitudinally tensioned screening media. 
BACKGROUND 
 In mining and stone industries, it is in many cases important to fractionate crushed stone and gravel into fractions of stones with different sizes. Normally, a deviation from the size is permitted according to industry standards, e.g., 10 percent oversized particles and 15 percent undersized particles. 
 In most cases, fractionating is done by supplying an unfractionated stream of crushed stone or gravel to a vibrating screen provided with a screening deck including screening holes for allowing stones smaller than the screening holes to pass through the holes. The vibration pattern and the inclination of the vibrating screen are arranged so that the crushed stones continuously flow in one direction on the screen, ultimately leaving it on one side or falling through the holes in the screening deck. 
 To improve the screening of the unfractionated material and to get a thicker material layer on the screening deck some screening devices are provided with raised portions, see e.g., SE-C2-524 179 and EP-B1-0 680 386. In SE-C2-524 179, stiffening longitudinal beams are arranged on top of the screening deck to reduce the wear on the screening holes and to make undersized particles to pass faster through the screening deck. In EP-B1-0 680 386, a curved surface in the form of longitudinal ridges has been arranged on top of the screening deck, where the curved surface is a fine screening screen. The curved surface aims to provide a larger screening surface and to prevent material from being screened to migrate toward the lower sides of the screen. 
 Another application of a non-flat screening deck is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,607,080 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,610, where systems for separating particles from a mix of particles and fluids by a screen with shale shakers used in the drilling industry are shown. The screen is designed with a flat screening deck and with ramps so that a portion of the fluids will pass over the ramp, whereas the screen will separate the particles from the remaining portion containing both particles and fluid. 
 The problem with the above prior art solutions and screening devices having only a flat screening deck is that none of them reduces the traveling speed of the material to be stratified as it passes over the screening deck. Furthermore, they do not include elements for stirring or mixing the material to improve the screening. 
 Faced with the above prior art screening systems and the disadvantages and problems therewith, the object with the present invention is to provide a solution to improve screening efficiency in a simple way with a screening assembly for a vibrating screen for screening of unfractionated material, such as crushed stone and gravel. 
SUMMARY 
 According to a first aspect, a screening arrangement in a vibrating screen for screening of material, the screening arrangement being a cross-tensioned or longitudinally tensioned screening media and comprising elements arranged on top of the screening media for stirring or mixing the screened material. The stirring elements being raised portions on the surface of the screening media, where the raised portions are arranged transversely to the travel direction of the screened material.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
 FIG. 1 schematically shows a screening media 100 for a vibrating screen for screening of crushed stones, gravel or the like. The screening media 100 is a cross-tensioned screening media that is arranged in a vibrating screen by way of fastening arrangements 170 in each end of the screening media that fasten the screening media 100 to the walls 200 of the vibrating screen. The screening media 100 comprises a screening surface 101, wires 102 and raised portions 103. 
 The screening media 100 is further provided with a beginning portion 104 and an end portion 105. The beginning portion 104 defines the portion of the screening media 100, where the material to be screened enters the screening media 100. The end portion 105 defines the portion of the screening media 100, where the material leaves the screening media 100. A longitudinal direction of the screening media 100 is indicated with an arrow A in FIG. 1. The longitudinal direction of the screening media is also the traveling direction for the material, i.e. stones or gravel, on the vibrating screen. 
 FIG. 2 shows a front view of the screening media 100 having projecting wires 102 at each longitudinal side of the screening media 100. FIG. 3 shows a top view of the screening media 100. In both FIGS. 2 and 3, only a few of the wires 102 and the raised portions 103 are indicated, but it is obvious for a man skilled in the art that wires 102 and raised portions 103 are arranged at intervals from the beginning portion 104 and the end portion 105. 
 FIG. 4 shows a side view of the screening media 100 in its entire length. The screening media 100 comprises a screening surface 101, wires 102 and raised portions 103. The screening surface 101 is provided with through holes (not shown) for fractionating crushed stone and gravel into fractions of stones with different sizes. 
 The wires 102 and raised portions 103 are arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the screening media 100 and at a distance between each other along the entire length of the screening media 100. Between each raised portion 103, the screening surface 101 is arranged. At every raised portion 103, at least one wire 102 is arranged. The wires 102 are connected to an attaching device to fasten the screening media 100 to the walls of the vibrating screen. 
 To make the length of the screening media 100 flexible, the screening media 100 is provided with certain shortening positions 106-109, see FIG. 4, i.e. positions where the screening media 100 is prepared to be cut off. At the positions 106-109, several raised portions 103 can be arranged, where at least one of the raised portions 103 at the positions 106-109 is provided with two wires 102. If the screening media is shortened, the portion of the screening media left of the shortening positions 106-109 and the raised portion 103, having two wires 102 incorporated (as shown in FIGS. 7, 9 and 10), are cut off. Thus, the modified and shortened screening media has a new beginning portion defined by the raised portion 103 having two wires 102 incorporated at the cut-off position 106-109. 
 The raised portions 103 may have slightly different shapes as shown in FIGS. 7 and 9-12, but all shapes preferably have some common features, i.e. having a slightly increasing slope along the longitudinal direction of the screening media 100 to a top portion of the raised portion 103 and having a steep slope or almost a vertical end portion. The length, height, start portion and end portion of the raised portion 103 affect the stirring effect of the raised portion 103 and are selected to achieve the most effective stirring of the material to be screened. The shape of the raised portions 103 is also affected by the thickness of the screening surface. This is shown in FIG. 6, where the raised portion 103 is arranged on a plateau. 
 The raised portions 103 can also be arranged so that not every raised portion 103 has the same shape to create different stirring effects along the screening media. For example every second raised portion 103 may have the same shape, e.g., a higher shape, and those therein between may have another shape, e.g., a lower shape. The raised portions could also be arranged so that the raised portions 103, having two wires 102 incorporated are longer and lower, whereas the raised portions 103, having one wire 102 incorporated, are shorter and higher. In the shown embodiments, the raised portions 103, having two wires 102 incorporated are longer (see FIG. 7), whereas the raised portions 103, having one wire 102 incorporated, are shorter (see FIG. 7). 
 FIG. 6 shows an enlargement C of FIG. 5 of the end portion 105. FIG. 7 shows an enlargement D of FIG. 5 of the beginning portion 104. FIG. 9 shows an enlargement E of FIG. 8 of the screening media 100 including the shortening positions 107-108. FIGS. 10-11 show an enlargement F of FIG. 8 of the screening media 100 including the shortening position 109. FIG. 12 shows an enlargement G of FIG. 8 of a raised portion 103. 
 The screening media 100 comprises different materials. Both the screening surface 101 and the raised portions 103 are typically made of polymeric materials, e.g., polyurethane (PU) or rubber. Both the screening surface 101 and the raised portions 103 can be made of the same material, but in a preferred embodiment, the raised portions 103 are manufactured of relatively unresilient PU, whereas the screening surface 101 is manufactured of a more resilient PU. The preferred materials for the raised portions 103 have a hardness that preferably is in the range from about 50&#xb0; Shore A to about 95&#xb0; Shore A, and the preferred materials for the screening surface 101 have a hardness of about 30&#xb0; Shore A to about 95&#xb0; Shore A. 
 Preferred materials are, e.g., PU, rubber, PVC, polyethylene, polyamide, polyester, urethane rubber, suitable natural rubber compounds, other rubber materials or the like for both the raised portions 103 and the screening surface 101. The wires 102 are typically made of steel, Kevlar, Twaron, polyester or aramid fibers. The term &#x201c;wire&#x201d; has been used throughout the description and the appended claims with meaning of an arrangement having reinforcing and tensioning functionality and the &#x201c;wires&#x201d; are made of any of the above-disclosed materials. 
 The screening media can also be provided with wires at every second position of the raised portions, but not at the shortening positions. It also possible to have a screening media, where the raised portions are arranged at every second wire position. 
 The screening media can also be longitudinally tensioned, either by only rotating the screening media shown in e.g., FIG. 1 or by arranging the wires parallel with the longitudinal direction A of the screening media and arranging the spaced raised portions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction A. 
 In FIG. 13 is shown screening media 100 that is mounted in a vibrating screen. The screening media 100 is attached to the sidewalls 200 of the vibrating screening by a hook arrangement 160, 170. Hooks 170 is arranged at the ends of the of the screening media 100, see FIG. 14, and corresponding and interacting hooks 160 are arranged on the sidewalls 200. The hooks 160 are provided with bolt and nuts arrangement 180 to tension the screening media 100 between the sidewalls 200 of the screen. The screen is further provided with support beams or barriers 190 between the sidewalls 200 of the vibrating screen having their longitudinal direction parallel to the sidewalls 200 of the vibrating screen. The support beams or barriers 190 are arranged at different heights in order to support the cross-tensioned screening media 100 between the sidewalls of the vibrating screen, forming the cross-tensioned screening media 100 to have a crowned or slightly upwardly curved shape and to support the cross-tensioned when being mounted. 
 In FIG. 13, a holding-down arrangement 150 is shown, which is used if the vibrating screens are very wide. The holding-down arrangement 150 is arranged with down holding element, e.g., longitudinal beam fixed by bolts or the like, for holding down the middle of the cross-tensioned screening media 100 so that the crowned shape is not too high, which eitherwise could cause the material to be screened to deviate to the sides giving a bad screening result. Thereby, two crowned shapes are arranged with the cross-tensioned screening media 100 over the width of the vibrating screen. In a narrower screen, the holding-down arrangement 150 is naturally omitted, since it is not needed. 
 The presently disclosed embodiments are considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive. The scope is indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents thereof are intended to be embraced.
