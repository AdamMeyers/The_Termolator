CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 
 The present document incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese priority document, 2005-190491 filed in Japan on Jun. 29, 2005. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a positioning controlling apparatus, a positioning control method, a program for making a computer execute this method, an image forming apparatus, and a recording medium. 
 2. Description of the Related Art 
 In recent years, it is a very important task, from a viewpoint of image quality, to accurately move a paper conveying system by a desired distance and stop the system at this position, in an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine and a printer, particularly, in an image forming apparatus having an inkjet printing mechanism. 
 There has been developed a technique of decreasing the cost of generating a circuit and facilitating a change in control design, by digital control of software process using a low-cost general-purpose central processing unit (CPU) and a low-cost digital signal processor (DSP) in place of an analog control circuit. 
 A moved amount of a paper conveyor roller system that conveys recording paper in the above image forming apparatuses can be obtained at a relatively low cost, by obtaining information corresponding to a rotation angle of the conveyor roller, with a rotary encoder fitted to the conveyor roller. The encoder generates pulses with the edges settled beforehand. While the encoder includes an analog type and a digital type, the digital type encoder can stably obtain rotation angle information with a sensor. Precision of the obtained rotation angle information depends on resolution of the encoder. 
 FIG. 6 is an explanatory diagram of motor control of a paper conveying system performed by a conventional positioning controlling apparatus. In a paper conveyor belt apparatus 7, a drive roller 372 connected to a timing belt 470 from a motor 270 rotates to move a conveyor belt 371. A rotary encoder 571 is set on the drive roller 372. 
 A sensor 572 detects an output from a rotary encoder 571. A positioning controlling apparatus 17 outputs an obtained control instruction to a motor 270, based on position information detected by the sensor 572, and applies torque to the motor 270. The control instruction has a different format depending on a motor driver, such as a current instruction and a voltage instruction. 
 A control algorithm of this motor control includes a speed feedback control up to a position near a target value, and a position feedback control which is performed near a stop position. In the speed feedback control, the controlling apparatus measures a current speed and controls the current speed to make the difference between the current speed and a target speed zero. 
 In the position feedback control, the controlling apparatus multiplies a predetermined gain to a difference between the current position and the target position, thereby obtaining a target speed. The controlling apparatus performs a speed feedback based on the target speed, thereby simultaneously setting the speed and the position difference to zero. 
 However, near a stop position, behavior of the system based on the same instruction is different, depending on a twist of a rotation axis such as a motor axis, a drive roller axis, and a pulley to which each belt is applied. This behavior is greatly affected when the twist becomes large. Particularly, the behavior is different depending on a rotation direction of the system. 
 Torque is applied to the system in a direction returning from the twist. Therefore, it is not necessary to output an instruction to apply large torque in this direction. When torque larger than is necessary is applied, oscillation can be generated. On the other hand, relatively large torque needs to be applied in a direction opposite to the direction of returning from the twist. When this torque is small, time of converging to a target position can be delayed. 
 However, conventionally, it is not necessary to perform such a fine control in a sub-scan direction. This is because image degradation due to a         blur         of an image forming material such as ink at the image formation time, is more prominent than the positioning deviation, thereby overlooking the precision in positioning in the sub-scan direction. However, recently, ink for an inkjet printer has high granularity to meet a demand for an improved image quality. As a result, high precision is also required for paper feeding in the sub-scan direction. 
 In a conventional image forming apparatus such as an inkjet printer, a high-precision position deviation correction has not been particularly necessary as explained above. Therefore, there are few conventional examples of high-precision position correction. In other technical field, a positioning control technique in a servo control method for driving a feed rod of machine tool is proposed in Japanese Patent Specification No. 3271440. According to this servo control method for driving a feed rod of machine tool, in order to correct a positioning error due to a backlash, a state switching time is predicted by taking a delay in a position instruction and a position output into consideration, and a servo control is performed by switching an integration time constant. 
 However, the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Specification No. 3271440 is applied for cutting metal or the like having high hardness in the machine tool and solves a similar problem in a technique assuming occurrence of a huge torque. Therefore, this technique is not suitable to control the behavior of a speed change near a stop position, as a method of correcting a positional deviation of a rotation axis of a general image forming apparatus in which a large torque like metal cutting does not occur.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 Exemplary embodiments of a positioning controlling apparatus, a positioning control method, a program for making a computer execute this method, an image forming apparatus, and a recording medium according to the present invention will be explained in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiments are explained according to first and second embodiments, and a plurality of modifications. 
 A positioning controlling apparatus and a paper conveying apparatus using this positioning controlling apparatus according to the first embodiment are explained in detail below. The paper conveying apparatus conveys paper, using the positioning controlling apparatus that moves a conveyor belt in a sub-scan direction by a predetermined distance, in an inkjet image forming apparatus. 
 FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of the paper conveying apparatus according to the first embodiment. A paper conveying apparatus 1 according to the first embodiment includes a digital speed controlling apparatus 10, a paper conveyor belt apparatus 300, and a moving distance detecting apparatus 500. 
 The paper conveyor belt apparatus 300 has a drive motor 200, a conveyor belt 301, a drive roller 302, a driven roller 303, and a timing belt 400. The drive motor 200 rotates the drive roller 302 via the timing belt 400. The drive roller 302 rotatably supports a conveyor belt 301 with the drive roller 302 and a driven roller 303, thereby rotating the conveyor belt 301. The drive motor 20 uses a direct current motor, for example. 
 The moving distance detector 500 has a rotary encoder 501 and a sensor 502. The moving distance detector 500 detects a current moving distance of the conveyor belt 301. The moving distance detector 500 can be a digital rotary encoder fitted to the drive motor 200, a rotary encoder fitted to the drive roller 302, a linear encoder fitted to the surface of the conveyor belt 301, or the like. These encoders can obtain a moving distance in only an integral multiple of a predetermined minimum unit. The rotary encoder 501 outputs a moving distance as an integral value of an encoder pulse unit. The rotary encoder 501 fitted to the drive roller 302 is explained below. However, the type of the rotary encoder is not limited to this. 
 The rotary encoder 501 outputs a moving distance as an integral value of an encoder pulse unit. The sensor 502 detects the encoder pulse output from the rotary encoder 501, and outputs the encoder pulse to the positioning controlling apparatus 10. 
 The positioning controlling apparatus 10 has a position determining unit 100, a target speed calculator 101, a current speed calculator 102, a speed error calculator 103, an automatic controller 104, a speed determining unit 105, and a gain switch 106. 
 The position determining unit 100 compares a moving distance detected by the moving distance detector 500 with a target position, and determines whether the conveyor belt 301 is in a positioning control area in which the positioning controlling apparatus 10 performs the positioning control to stop the conveyor belt 301. The positioning control area is provided for the positioning controlling apparatus 10 to bring the conveyor belt 301 to near a stop position at the beginning and then finely control the position of the conveyor belt 301 accurately to the stop position. The positioning control area is an area of a distance of dozens of microns from the stop position. 
 The current speed calculator 102 inputs a moving distance from the moving distance detector 500, calculates a current speed based on the input moving distance, and outputs the calculated current speed to the speed error calculator 103 and the speed determining unit 105. 
 The speed determining unit 105 inputs the current speed from the current speed calculator 102, determines whether the input current speed is positive or negative, and outputs a result of the determination of positive or negative, to the gain switch 106. 
 The gain switch 106 inputs a result of the determination from the speed determining unit 105, selects a gain corresponding to a determined positive or negative of the current speed, from among plural gains, and outputs the selected gain to the target speed calculator 101. 
 The target speed calculator 101 inputs moving distance information from the moving distance detector 500, calculates a moving speed of the conveyor belt 301, and inputs the gain switched by the gain switch 106. The target speed calculator 101 generates a target speed by multiplying the input gain to the calculated moving speed of the conveyor belt 301, and outputs the generated target speed to the speed error calculator 103. 
 The speed error calculator 103 inputs the target speed from the target speed calculator 101, and inputs the current speed from the current speed calculator 102. The speed error calculator 103 generates a speed error as a difference between the input current speed and the input target speed, and outputs the speed error to the automatic controller 104. 
 The automatic controller 104 inputs the speed error from the speed error calculator 103, calculates a motor drive output, and outputs a motor drive amount as a drive instruction, to the drive motor 200. 
 Each unit that constitutes the positioning controlling apparatus can be configured by programming a general-purpose computer or a general-purpose digital signal processor (DSP). 
 Operation of the paper conveying apparatus 1 that uses the positioning controlling apparatus 10 is explained next. The target speed calculator 101 calculates a target speed at each time, using a control starting time as a basis, a current moving distance of the belt, and a current speed. 
 FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of one example of a target speed generation algorithm that is used by the target speed calculator 101. The target speed calculator 101 uses this target speed generation algorithm having substantially a trapezoidal shape, as a target speed generation method. The target speed generation algorithm shown in FIG. 2 employs a sampling time since it is a digital control. The target speed calculator 101 accelerates a target speed at an equal acceleration rate from the control starting time till a predetermined time t1, and switches the acceleration to an equal-speed control upon reaching a predetermined speed v2. Thereafter, the target speed is subjected to a deceleration control expressed by a function of a moving distance, when the moving distance reaches a predetermined level (p3). The target speed is controlled at an equal-speed again when the current speed reaches v4. 
 When the moving distance reaches a predetermined level p5, the target speed is again subjected to a deceleration control expressed by a function of the moving distance. When the moving distance reaches p6, a position control mode starts, and this mode continues thereafter. A predetermined area near the target position is set as a positioning control area. In the positioning control area, the positioning controlling apparatus 10 controls the position of the conveyor belt 301 so that the position converges to a target stop position. 
 The position determining unit 100 determines whether the moving distance has reached the positioning control area, based on the moving distance detected by the sensor 502 of the moving distance detector 500, as described above. The current speed calculator 102 obtains the current speed of the conveyor belt 301 based on a difference between adjacent sampling times of the moving distance input from the moving distance detector 500. 
 When the position determining unit 100 determines that the conveyor belt 301 is not in the positioning control area, the target speed calculator 101 calculates a target speed, based on a target speed obtained with reference to FIG. 2. The speed error calculator 103 calculates an error between the target speed calculated by the target speed calculator 101 and the current speed calculated by the current speed calculator 102. 
 On the other hand, when the position determining unit 100 determines that the conveyor belt 301 is in the positioning control area, the target speed calculator 101 calculates a target speed by multiplying the gain input from the gain switch 106, to the difference between the target position and the current position. The speed determining unit 105 determines whether the current speed input from the current speed calculator 102 is in the same direction as the rotation direction of the drive motor 200 (positive), or is in the opposite direction to the rotation direction of the drive motor 200 (negative). The speed determining unit 105 outputs a result of the determination of positive or negative, to the gain switch 106. 
 The gain switch 106 holds plural different gains, selects a corresponding gain following the input determination result, and outputs the selected gain to the target speed calculator 101. For example, the gain switch 106 holds two gains of g1 and g2 (g1      g2). When the input determination result is positive, torque returning from twist is applied. Therefore, g1 having a relatively small value is selected. When the input determination result is negative, torque corresponding to the torque returning from twist needs to be applied. Therefore, g2 having a relatively large value is selected. 
 The speed error calculator 103 calculates a difference between the target speed and the current speed calculated by the current speed calculator 102, and outputs the difference to the automatic controller 104. The automatic controller 104 controls the drive motor 200, based on the input speed error. 
 The automatic controller 104 calculates a motor output using a predetermined controller calculation following the input speed error. The automatic control calculation includes a proportional (P) control, a proportional integral (P) control, a proportional integral derivative (PID) control, and a state feedback control. Among the controls, while a stable control result can be obtained by the PI control, the control is not limited to this method. 
 As described above, in the positioning control area, the drive motor 200 is driven using a calculated speed error by switching a gain, thereby stably and promptly positioning the conveyor belt 301 to a target position. 
 FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a positioning control procedure according to the first embodiment. The position determining unit 100 determines whether a moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is in the positioning control area (step S101). When it is determined that a moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is not in the positioning control area (step S101: No), the target speed calculator 101 calculates a target speed in the area outside the positioning control area, based on the algorithm shown in FIG. 2 (step S102). The state that the conveyor belt 301 is not in the control area is the state before the position p6 in FIG. 2. 
 When the current speed calculator 102 calculates the current speed (step S103), the speed error calculator 103 calculates an error between the calculated target speed and the calculated current speed (step S104). Since the conveyor belt 301 is not in the positioning area, a simple calculation for speed error is performed following the algorithm shown in FIG. 2, without switching between the gains. 
 The automatic controller 104 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed error calculated by the speed error calculator 103, thereby performing controller process (step S105). As explained above, when the conveyor belt 301 is in the area outside the positioning control area, the speed error is calculated from a target speed obtained by using the algorithm as a speed characteristic determined using a lapse time as a variable, thereby controlling the drive roller. In the area outside the positioning control area, the conveyor belt 301 is quickly brought to the positioning control area near the stop area, without fine adjustment of the speed. 
 On the other hand, when the position determining unit 100 determines that the moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is in the positioning control area (step S101: Yes), that is, when and after the position determining unit 100 determines that the conveyor belt 301 has moved to the position p6 in FIG. 2, fine positioning process is started. First, the current speed calculator 102 calculates the current speed of the conveyor belt 301 (step S106). The moving distance detector 500 can detect the speed from lapse of time corresponding to the moving distance. 
 The speed determining unit 105 determines whether the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 is positive (step S107). When it is determined that the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 is positive (step S107: Yes), that is, when the speed determining unit 105 determines that the drive roller 302 is in the same direction as that set as the sub-scan direction, the gain switch 106 switches the gain to the positive gain (step S108). The target speed calculator 101 multiplies the positive gain to the current speed, thereby obtaining a target speed. The current speed can be detected as a position difference. Therefore, the current speed can be calculated by multiplying the positive gain to the current position difference (step S109). The speed error calculator 103 calculates an error between the current speed and the target speed (step S104). The automatic controller 104 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed difference, and controls the conveyor belt 301 (step S105). 
 On the other hand, when the speed determining unit 105 determines that the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 is not positive (step S107: No), that is, when it is determined that the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 is opposite to the direction set as the sub-scan direction, the gain switch 106 switches the gain to the negative gain (step S110). Then, the target speed calculator 101 multiplies the negative gain to the current speed to obtain a target speed. 
 The current speed can be detected as a position difference. Therefore, the current speed can be calculated by multiplying the negative gain to the current position difference (step S111). The speed error calculator 103 calculates an error between the current speed and the target speed (step S104). The automatic controller 104 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed difference, and controls the conveyor belt 301 (step S105). 
 A prescribed gain can be also obtained based on an absolute value of the difference, as well as based on the positive or negative sign of the difference. A finer gain switch becomes possible. 
 As explained above, the positioning controlling apparatus according to the first embodiment can stably and promptly converge the error due to a torque variation applied to the drive roller 302 that drives the conveyor belt 301, to a target position, by switching the gain to a different gain following the rotation direction of the drive roller. 
 A positioning controlling apparatus and a paper conveying apparatus using this positioning controlling apparatus according to the second embodiment are explained below. A paper conveying apparatus 2 conveys paper, using the positioning controlling apparatus that moves a conveyor belt in a sub-scan direction by a predetermined distance, in an inkjet image forming apparatus. 
 FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram of the paper conveying apparatus to which the positioning controlling apparatus according to the second embodiment is applied. The paper conveying apparatus 2 includes a positioning controlling apparatus 12, a paper conveyor belt apparatus 300, and the moving distance detector 500. Like reference numerals denote like parts having the same configurations and performing the same operation as those in the first embodiment, and their explanation is omitted or is simplified. Points that are different from those in the first embodiment are mainly explained. 
 The drive motor 200, the paper conveyor belt apparatus 300, the timing belt 400, and the moving distance detector 500 have configurations similar to those in the first embodiment, and therefore, their explanation is omitted. 
 The positioning controlling apparatus 12 has the position determining unit 100, a target speed calculator 121, the current speed calculator 102, a speed error calculator 123, an automatic controller 124, a position difference determining unit 125, and a gain switch 126. 
 The position determining unit 100 compares a moving distance detected by the moving distance detector 500 with a target position, and determines whether the conveyor belt 301 is in a positioning control area in which the positioning controlling apparatus 12 performs the positioning control to stop the conveyor belt 301. 
 The current speed calculator 102 inputs a moving distance from the moving distance detector 500, calculates the current speed based on the input moving distance, and outputs the calculated current speed to the speed error calculator 123. 
 The position difference determining unit 125 inputs a moving distance from the moving distance detector 500, calculates a difference between the input current position and the target position, determines whether the calculated difference is positive or negative, and outputs a result of the determination of positive or negative, to the gain switch 126. 
 The gain switch 126 inputs a result of the determination about positive or negative of the difference from the position difference determining unit 125, and outputs a gain corresponding to a result of the determination about positive or negative, to the target speed calculator 121. 
 The target speed calculator 121 inputs the moving distance from the moving distance detector 500, and inputs the gain from the gain switch 126. The target speed calculator 121 generates a target speed based on the input moving distance and the input gain, and outputs the generated target speed to the speed error calculator 123. 
 The speed error calculator 123 inputs the target speed from the target speed calculator 121, and inputs the current speed from the current speed calculator 102. The speed error calculator 123 generates a speed error as a difference between the input current speed and the input target speed, and outputs the speed error to the automatic controller 124. 
 The automatic controller 124 inputs the speed error from the speed error calculator 123, calculates a drive output of the drive motor 200, and outputs the drive output to the drive motor 200. 
 The positioning controlling apparatus according to the second embodiment constitutes a general closed-loop speed controlling apparatus, except the position difference determining unit 125 and the speed error calculator 123, as is well known to those skilled in the art. 
 Each unit that constitutes the positioning controlling apparatus 12 can be configured by programming a general-purpose computer or a general-purpose digital signal processor (DSP). 
 Operation of the paper conveying apparatus 2 that uses the positioning controlling apparatus 12 according to the second embodiment is explained next. The target speed calculator 121 calculates a target speed at each time, using a control starting time as a basis, a moving distance as a current moving amount of the belt, and a current speed. When the conveyor belt 301 is in an area outside the positioning control area, the target speed calculator 121 uses a target speed generation algorithm having substantially a trapezoidal shape as shown in FIG. 2, for a target speed generation method, similarly to the first embodiment. 
 In the target speed generation algorithm shown in FIG. 2, time in the lateral axis shows a sampling time since it is a digital control. In this target speed generation algorithm, the target speed calculator 121 accelerates a target speed at an equal acceleration rate from the control starting time till a predetermined time t1, and switches the acceleration to an equal-speed control upon reaching a predetermined speed v2. Thereafter, the target speed is subjected to a deceleration control expressed by a function of a moving distance, when the moving distance reaches a predetermined level (p3). The target speed is controlled at an equal-speed again when the current speed reaches v4. When the moving distance reaches a predetermined level p5, the target speed is again subjected to a deceleration control expressed by a function of the moving distance. When the moving distance reaches p6, a position control mode starts, and this mode continues thereafter. The area indicated by time after the position p6 is a positioning control area. Since the positioning control area is the same as that explained in the first embodiment, explanation thereof is omitted. 
 The position determining unit 100 determines whether the moving distance has reached the positioning control area, based on the moving distance detected by the moving distance detector 500. 
 In the positioning control area, the gain input from the gain switch 126 is multiplied to a difference between the target speed and the current speed to obtain a target speed, thereby performing the speed control. The current speed calculator 102 obtains the current speed of the conveyor belt 301, based on the difference between adjacent sampling times of the moving distance input from the moving distance detector 500. 
 The speed error calculator 123 calculates a difference between the target speed generated by the target speed calculator 121 and the current speed generated by the current speed calculator 102, and outputs the speed error. 
 The position difference determining unit 125 determines the gain as positive when the difference between the input current position and the target position is in an overshoot state, determines the gain as negative when the difference is not in the overshoot state, and outputs a result of the determination to the gain switch 126. 
 The gain switch 126 holds plural different gains, selects a corresponding gain following the input determination result among plural gains, and outputs the selected gain to the target speed calculator 121. For example, the gain switch 126 holds two gains of g1 and g2 (g1      g2). When the input determination result is negative, that is, not in the overshoot state, torque returning from twist is applied. Therefore, g1 having a relatively small value is selected. When the input determination result is positive, that is, in the overshoot state, torque corresponding to the torque returning from twist needs to be applied. Therefore, g2 having a relatively large value is selected. 
 The automatic controller 124 calculates the output of the drive motor 200 using a predetermined control calculation, following the speed error input from the speed error calculator 123, even when the conveyor belt 301 is within or outside the positioning control area. The automatic control calculation includes the P control, the PI control, the PID control, and the state feedback control. Among the controls, while a stable control result can be obtained by the PI control, the control is not limited to this method. 
 FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a positioning control procedure according to the second embodiment. The position determining unit 100 determines whether a moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is in the positioning control area (step S201). When it is determined that a moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is not in the positioning control area (step S201: No), the target speed calculator 121 calculates a target speed in the area outside the positioning control area, based on the algorithm shown in FIG. 2 (step S202). The state that the conveyor belt 301 is not in the control area is the state before the position p6 in FIG. 2. 
 When the current speed calculator 102 calculates the current speed (step S203), the speed error calculator 123 calculates an error between the calculated target speed and the calculated current speed (step S204). Since the conveyor belt 301 is not in the positioning area in this case, a simple calculation for speed error is performed following the algorithm shown in FIG. 2, without switching between the gains. 
 The automatic controller 124 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed error calculated by the speed error calculator 123, thereby performing controller process (step S205). As explained above, when the conveyor belt 301 is in the area outside the positioning control area, the speed error is calculated from a target speed obtained by using the algorithm as a speed characteristic determined using a lapse time as a variable, thereby controlling the drive roller. In the area outside the positioning control area, the conveyor belt 301 is quickly brought to the positioning control area near the stop area, without fine adjustment of the speed. 
 On the other hand, when the position determining unit 100 determines that the moving position of the conveyor belt 301 is in the positioning control area (step S201: Yes), that is, when and after it is determined that the conveyor belt 301 has moved to the position p6 in FIG. 2, fine positioning process is started. First, the position difference determining unit 125 calculates a difference between the target position and the current position of the conveyor belt 301 (step S206). The difference between the positions is calculated, from the moving distance detected by the moving distance detector 500. 
 The position difference determining unit 125 determines whether the calculated difference is a positive value corresponding to the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 (step S207). When it is determined that the calculated difference is a positive value (step S207: Yes), that is, when the position difference determining unit 125 determines that the conveyor belt 301 is in the same direction as that set as a sub-scan direction, the gain switch 126 switches the gain to the positive gain (step S208). The target speed calculator 121 multiplies the positive gain to the calculated position difference, thereby obtaining a target speed (step S209). 
 The current speed calculator 102 calculates the current speed (step S203). The speed error calculator 123 calculates an error between the current speed and the target speed (step S204). The automatic controller 124 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed difference, and controls the conveyor belt 301 (step S205). 
 On the other hand, when the position difference determining unit 125 determines that the calculated difference is not a positive value corresponding to the rotation direction of the drive roller 302 (step S207: No), that is, when it is determined that the conveyor belt 301 is in the direction opposite to that set as a sub-scan direction, the gain switch 126 switches the gain to the negative gain (step S210). The target speed calculator 121 multiplies the negative gain to the calculated position difference, thereby obtaining a target speed (step S211). 
 The current speed calculator 102 calculates the current speed (step S203), and the speed error calculator 123 calculates an error between the calculated target speed and the calculated current speed (step S204). The automatic controller 124 controls and drives the drive roller 200 following the speed error, thereby performing controller process (step S205). 
 In the configuration described above, while the position difference determining unit 125 determines the moving direction of the conveyor belt 301, the moving direction can be also determined by inputting positive and negative sign information of the moving speed calculated by the current speed calculator 102. With this arrangement, the current speed calculator 102 can perform the function of the position difference determining unit 125. 
 A prescribed gain can be also obtained based on an absolute value of the difference, as well as based on the positive or negative sign of the difference. A finer gain switch becomes possible. 
 As explained above, the positioning controlling apparatus according to the second embodiment has a gain switch that switches the gain, based on a difference between the current position and the target position. With this arrangement, the position of the conveyor belt 301 can be converged to a target position stably and promptly.
