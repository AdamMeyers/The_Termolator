<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of forming a chip carrier substrate to prevent warping, and a chip carrier formed thereby. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The strong growth in demand for portable consumer electronics is driving the need for high-capacity storage devices. Non-volatile semiconductor memory devices, such as flash memory storage cards, are becoming widely used to meet the ever-growing demands on digital information storage and exchange. Their portability, versatility and rugged design, along with their high reliability and large capacity, have made such memory devices ideal for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, including for example digital cameras, digital music players, video game consoles, PDAs and cellular telephones. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> One exemplary standard for flash memory cards is the so-called SD (Secure Digital) flash memory card. In the past, electronic devices such as SD cards have included an integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) system consisting of several individually packaged ICs each handling different functions, including logic circuits for information processing, memory for storing information, and I/O circuits for information exchange with the outside world. The individually packaged ICs have been mounted separately on a substrate such as a printed circuit board to form the IC system. More recently, system-in-a-package (&#x201c;SiP&#x201d;) and multichip modules (&#x201c;MCM&#x201d;) have been developed where a plurality of integrated circuit components have been packaged together to provide a complete electronic system in a single package. Typically, an MCM includes a plurality of chips mounted side by side on a substrate and then packaged. An SiP typically includes a plurality of chips, some or all of which may be stacked on a substrate and then packaged. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The substrate on which the die and passive components may be mounted in general includes a rigid or soft dielectric base having a conductive layer etched on one or both sides. Electrical connections are formed between the die and the conductive layer(s), and the conductive layer(s) provide an electric lead structure for integration of the die into an electronic system. Once electrical connections between the die and substrate are made, the assembly is then typically encased in a molding compound to provide a protective package. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> One surface of a conventional substrate <b>20</b> including an etched conductive layer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The substrate <b>20</b> includes a conductance pattern <b>22</b> for transferring electrical signals between the various components mounted on the substrate, as well as between the substrate components and the external environment. The conductance pattern may have any number of configurations and occupy various amounts of space on the substrate. In that past it has been recognized that if the conducting layer on a surface of the substrate is completely etched away from the areas not forming part of the conductance pattern, this results in areas of different thermal expansion properties, and a build up of mechanical stresses in the substrate upon heating of the substrate during IC package fabrication. The metal of the conductance pattern tends to expand upon heating, and having some areas with metal and some areas without results is stress generation in the substrate. The same phenomenon was observed where the areas of the conducting layer not forming part of the conducting layer was left completely intact. These stresses tend to warp the substrate. A warped substrate can result in mechanical stresses and cracking of the semiconductor die, either when the semiconductor die is bonded to the substrate, or thereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> It is therefore known to etch a so-called dummy pattern on the substrate in areas not used for the conductance pattern. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,380,633 to Tsai entitled, &#x201c;Pattern Layout Structure in Substrate&#x201d; discloses forming a cross-hatched dummy pattern, such as dummy pattern <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> formed in regions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> on substrate <b>20</b> not used for conductance pattern <b>22</b>. Dummy pattern <b>24</b> provides improved semiconductor yields by reducing disparate thermal properties between areas on the substrate having a conductance pattern and areas on the substrate which do not. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The inventors of the present invention have further realized that thermal stresses still result when the dummy pattern <b>24</b> is laid down in long straight lines. In particular, it has been found that thermal stresses accumulate over a straight segment of a dummy pattern trace, which thermal stresses increase the longer the length of the straight segment. U.S. Pat. No. 6,864,434 to Chang et al. entitled &#x201c;Warpage-Preventive Circuit Board And Method For Fabricating The Same&#x201d; discloses a cross-hatched dummy pattern as proposed in Tsai, but Chang et al. break up the dummy pattern into a plurality of regions. While Chang et al. represent an improvement over Tsai, Chang et al. still disclose a system of straight line segments on the substrate which result in stress in the substrate. As semiconductor die become thinner and more delicate, it becomes even more important to minimize the stresses within the substrate. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Embodiments of the present invention, roughly described, relate to a method of forming a chip carrier substrate to prevent warping, and a chip carrier formed thereby. The substrate includes a conductance pattern for transferring electrical signals between die and components on the substrate, and a dummy circuit pattern to prevent warpage of the substrate in areas not occupied by the conductance pattern. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The dummy circuit pattern may have straight line segments with a length controlled so as not to generate stresses within the line segments above a desired stress. The desired length of a line segment may be determined experimentally by determining the stress within a straight segment as a function of length, and then setting the length below a desired maximum stress within a given straight segment. Alternatively, the desired length of a line segment may be estimated based on the known properties of the materials used in the substrate. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The dummy circuit pattern may be formed in a plurality of lines, shapes and sizes. In one embodiment, the dummy circuit pattern may be formed of a plurality of polygons, such as for example hexagons. The polygons may be contiguous with each other, or the polygons may be spaced from each other. Moreover, the polygons may each be the same size as each other, or the dummy circuit pattern may include polygons of different sizes. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In alternative embodiments, the dummy circuit pattern may be formed of randomly shaped polygons formed on the substrate. The random shapes may also be randomly oriented and/or randomly positioned on the substrate. The random shapes may be contiguous with each other, or they may be spaced from each other in alternative embodiments. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> As an alternative to random shapes, the dummy circuit pattern may further be formed of random lines on the substrate. The lines may have a random orientation, random length and/or a random position on the dummy circuit pattern in alternative embodiments. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The dummy circuit pattern may be formed on a photomask, along with the conductance pattern, and then etched into the conductive layers on the top and/or bottom of the substrate in a known etching process.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-12</figref>, which relate to a method of forming a reduced warpage semiconductor package, and the semiconductor package formed thereby. It is understood that the present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the invention to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents of these embodiments, which are included within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a chip carrier substrate <b>100</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view through a plane normal to the top and bottom surfaces of substrate <b>100</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, substrate <b>100</b> may have a top surface <b>102</b> and a bottom surface <b>104</b>. Substrate <b>100</b> may be formed of an electrically insulative core <b>106</b> having a top conductive layer <b>108</b> formed on a top surface of the core and a bottom conductive layer <b>110</b> formed on a bottom surface of the core. The core may be formed of various dielectric materials such as for example, polyimide laminates, epoxy resins including FR4 and FR5, bismaleimide triazine (BT), and the like. Although not critical to the present invention, core <b>106</b> may have a thickness of between 40 microns (&#x3bc;m) to 200 &#x3bc;m, although thickness of the core may vary outside of that range in alternative embodiments. The core may be ceramic or organic in alternative embodiments. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The conductive layers <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may be formed of copper, copper alloy or other low resistance electrical conductor, and may be patterned in a conductance pattern and dummy circuit according to embodiments of the present invention as explained hereinafter. The layers <b>108</b> and/or <b>110</b> may have a thickness of about 10 &#x3bc;m to 24 &#x3bc;m, although the thickness of the layers <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may vary outside of that range in alternative embodiments. Once patterned, the top and bottom conductive layers may be laminated with a solder mask <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, respectively, as is known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Substrate <b>100</b> may be patterned and configured for use in a wide variety of semiconductor packages. One such package is a so-called land grid array (LGA) semiconductor package used, for example, in SD Flash Memory Cards. However, it is understood that the dummy circuit pattern explained hereinafter may be used on any substrate in which a conductance pattern may be formed and assembled into a semiconductor device. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one or both of the conductive layers <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may be etched or otherwise processed as explained hereinafter so as to include a conductance pattern <b>120</b> to provide electrical connection between components mounted to substrate <b>100</b>, as well as between components on substrate <b>100</b> and external devices. In embodiments including conductance patterns on both the top surface <b>102</b> and bottom surface <b>104</b> of substrate <b>100</b>, as well as in substrates including a plurality of top and bottom layers (as explained hereinafter with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), vias (not shown) may be provided to transmit electrical signals between the conductance patterns in different layers. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Substrate <b>100</b> further includes a plurality of regions <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> not having a conductance pattern, referred to herein as dummy circuit regions. A dummy circuit pattern <b>130</b> according to embodiments of the present invention may be formed in one or more of the dummy circuit regions <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>. It is understood that the size and shape of substrate <b>100</b>, as well as the size and shape of conductance pattern <b>102</b> may vary greatly in alternative embodiments of the present invention so as to define one or more dummy circuit regions of any size or shape. Dummy circuit <b>130</b> may be provided in any one or more of these dummy circuit regions. In embodiments, a dummy circuit pattern according to any of the embodiments described hereinafter may be provided on both sides of the substrate, even where a conductance pattern is provided only on one side of the substrate. It is conceivable that a substrate may be used in a semiconductor device which does not include a conductance pattern on either first or second opposed surfaces of the substrate. Such a substrate may be formed with a dummy circuit pattern according to embodiments of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In each of the embodiments described hereinafter, the dummy circuit pattern is comprised of lines and/or shapes. The lines and/or shapes are provided in a given density in the one or more dummy circuit regions. Density refers to the number, length and/or amount of material in the conductive traces forming a dummy circuit pattern, or the conductance pattern, per a unit of area on the substrate. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The stress level within a straight segment in a portion of a dummy circuit pattern will be linearly or non-linearly related to the length of that straight segment when the substrate is heated. In general, the longer the length, the greater the stress upon heating. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> With regard to the maximum length of a straight segment in any portion of a dummy circuit pattern according to the embodiments described hereinafter, the length of a straight segment may be set to maintain the stresses within that straight segment below a desired level. In particular, the stress per unit length of a straight segment of a portion of the dummy circuit may be determined experimentally and/or by known physical characteristics and behavior of the substrate materials as a function of the type of the materials used, the thicknesses of the materials used and the temperature range to which the materials are to be subjected. Other characteristics may be included in the analysis. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Given this information, the maximum length of a straight segment of a portion of the dummy circuit may be selected to maintain the stresses within that segment below any desired, predetermined level. Stated another way, with a knowledge of the stress build-up per unit length, a desired maximum stress may be selected, and then the length of all or a portion of the straight segments in a dummy circuit may be set to maintain a stress at or below the selected stress level. It is understood that a quantitative analysis of stress per unit length need not be performed, and the maximum length of a straight segment may instead be estimated in embodiments of the invention. It is also understood that a dummy circuit pattern may include straight segments in which stresses exceeding a predetermined maximum may result in those segments upon heating in embodiments of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> Regarding the density of a dummy circuit pattern, without regard to other factors which may contribute to stress within a substrate, stresses within the substrate may be minimized when the density of the dummy pattern approximates that of the conductance pattern. Thus, the density of a dummy circuit pattern may be selected to approximate that of a given conductance pattern on a substrate in embodiments of the invention. Alternatively, the density of the dummy circuit pattern may be selected to be greater or lesser than the density of the conductance pattern, such that the resulting stresses on the substrate remain within predetermined acceptable levels. It is understood that a quantitative analysis of stress resulting from a difference in densities between the dummy circuit pattern and conductance pattern need not be performed, and the density of the dummy circuit pattern may instead be estimated in embodiments of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the dummy circuit pattern <b>130</b> is formed of a plurality of contiguous, aligned cells <b>130</b>&#x2032; etched into layer <b>108</b> and/or <b>110</b>. Each of the contiguous cells may be uniform in shape, and fit together so as not to leave any spaces between the cells. It is understood that individual cells may fit together so as to leave a space therebetween in alternative embodiments. Pattern <b>130</b> is etched or otherwise processed so that no straight line extends through any two contiguous cells <b>130</b>&#x2032;. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the individual cells <b>130</b>&#x2032; are hexagonal, forming a honeycomb pattern <b>130</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The dummy circuit pattern according to embodiments of the present invention described above controls and/or minimizes mechanical stresses on, and warping of, the substrate <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> There are a number of known processes for forming the conductance pattern <b>120</b> and various embodiments of the dummy circuit pattern on substrate <b>100</b>. One such process is explained with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The surfaces of conductive layers <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are cleaned in step <b>150</b>. A photoresist film is then applied over the surfaces of layers <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> in step <b>152</b>. A pattern photomask containing the outline of the electrical conductance pattern and the dummy circuit pattern is then placed over the photoresist film in step <b>154</b>. The dummy circuit pattern and the conductance pattern may be formed on the photomask in a known process. As indicated above, where the dummy circuit pattern includes the formation of random lines or shapes on the substrate, a known random generation process may be associated with the photomask formation to include the random lines or shapes, depending on the embodiment of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Once the photomask is applied over the photoresist film, the photoresist film is exposed (step <b>156</b>) and developed (step <b>158</b>) to remove the photoresist from areas on the conductive layers that are to be etched. The exposed areas are next etched away using an etchant such as ferric chloride in step <b>160</b> to define the conductance and dummy circuit patterns on the core. Next, the photoresist is removed in step <b>162</b>, and the solder mask layer is applied in step <b>164</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> An overall process for forming the finished die package <b>182</b> is explained with reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The substrate <b>100</b> starts out as a large panel which is separated into individual substrates after fabrication. In a step <b>220</b>, the panel is drilled to provide reference holes off of which the position of the respective substrates is defined. The conductance pattern and dummy circuit pattern are then formed on the respective surfaces of the panel in step <b>222</b> as explained above. The patterned panel is then inspected and tested in step <b>224</b>. Once inspected, the solder mask is applied to the panel in step <b>226</b>. A router then separates the panel into individual substrates in step <b>228</b>. The individual substrates are then inspected and tested again in an automated step (step <b>230</b>) and in a final visual inspection (step <b>232</b>) to check electrical operation, and for contamination, scratches and discoloration. The substrates that pass inspection are then sent through the die attach process in step <b>234</b>, and the substrate and dice are then packaged in step <b>236</b> in a known injection mold process to form a JEDEC standard (or other) package. It is understood that the die package <b>182</b> including a dummy circuit pattern may be formed by other processes in alternative embodiments. </p>
