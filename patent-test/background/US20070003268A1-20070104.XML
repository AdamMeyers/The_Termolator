<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to an imaging device, and more specifically, it relates to processing executed on a value to be used for an imaging operation in the imaging device. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In a single lens reflex camera, part of the subject light flux departing an imaging lens toward an image forming plane is guided to a photometering sensor and a focus detection (range finding) sensor to enable calculation of the photometering value and the range value for the subject. The imaging lens may allow the imaging optical system to be shifted or tilted relative to the image forming plane. When capturing an image with such an imaging lens with the imaging optical system in a shifted or tilted state, the photometering operation and the focus detection operation cannot be accurately executed since the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at the photometering sensor or the focus detection sensor is altered from the angle of incidence that is measured when the imaging optical system is not shifted or tilted. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. H9-21943 discloses an optical device that calculates a range value once the extent of shift or tilt of the imaging lens becomes equal to or beyond a predetermined value by using a correction value that has been stored in advance corresponding to the extent of the shift or tilt. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> However, in the optical device disclosed in the publication described above, too, the range value is corrected by using a predetermined correction value, which means that the resulting range value is not completely accurate. In other words, if the extent of decentering of the incident subject light flux due to the shift or the tilt is outside an allowable range at the focus detection sensor unit, the range finding operation cannot be executed. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In the imaging device according to the first aspect, it is preferable that the imaging preparatory processing includes one of photometering processing for calculating a subject luminance value and focus match processing for focusing the imaging lens on a subject. It is preferable that the light receiving element includes one of a photometering sensor that outputs a signal to be used in the photometering processing and a focus detection sensor that outputs a signal to be used in the focus match processing. The control device may execute the imaging preparatory processing through the second imaging preparatory processing if the extent of decentering of the imaging lens is less than a predetermined value and executes the imaging preparatory processing through the first imaging preparatory processing if the extent of decentering of the imaging lens is equal to or beyond the predetermined value. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> An imaging device according to a second aspect of the present invention includes an imaging element that receives a subject light flux from an imaging lens that forms a subject image, and converts the subject light flux to an electrical signal; a lens information detection device that detects lens information corresponding to the imaging lens; and a control device that, in correspondence to results of detection executed by the lens information detection device, selects one of first imaging preparatory processing for executing imaging preparatory processing based upon an output signal from the imaging element and second imaging preparatory processing for executing imaging preparatory processing based upon an output signal from a light receiving element other than the imaging element. </p>

The subject image formed and diffused at the focusing screen <b>5</b> is transmitted through a pentaprism <b>6</b> and an eyepiece optical system <b>8</b> and is then observed through an eyepiece finder <b>9</b>. The subject image formed and diffused at the focusing screen <b>5</b> and then advancing through the pentaprism <b>6</b> is also condensed at a condenser optical system <b>7</b><i>a </i>of a photometering device <b>7</b>, and the condensed light enters a photometering sensor (a photometering element, i.e., a light receiving element) <b>7</b><i>b. </i></p>

In addition, as shown in the figure, a shutter <b>11</b> (in a closed state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an imaging element <b>12</b> are disposed to the rear of the mirror <b>4</b>, and a rear liquid crystal monitor <b>13</b> is disposed at the rear surface of the camera body <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the digital camera <b>100</b> in a mirror-up state in which the mirror <b>4</b> and the sub-mirror <b>4</b><i>b </i>are both set outside the optical path of the subject light flux, with the shutter <b>11</b> in an open state. When the mirror <b>4</b> and the sub-mirror <b>4</b><i>b </i>are outside the optical path of the subject light flux and the shutter <b>11</b> is in an open state, the subject light flux having been transmitted through the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> passes through the opening at the shutter <b>11</b> and forms an image at the imaging element <b>12</b>. </p>

In other words, through the imaging lens <b>3</b>, the optical axis of the subject light flux passing through the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>and entering the imaging element <b>12</b> can be decentered. The extents of shift and tilt in the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>relative to the image forming surface at the imaging element <b>12</b> are respectively detected by a shift quantity detector <b>3</b><i>b </i>and a tilt quantity detector <b>3</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The shift quantity detector <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the tilt quantity detector <b>3</b><i>c </i>may respectively detect the shift quantity and the tilt quantity based upon specific combinations of patterns and brushes. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The imaging lens <b>3</b> includes a communication contact point (not shown) that becomes connected with the camera body <b>1</b> of the digital camera <b>100</b> so as to enable communication with the camera body <b>1</b> when the imaging lens <b>3</b> is connected with the camera body <b>1</b>. A shift quantity signal and a tilt quantity signal indicating the extents to which the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shifted and tilted, detected by the shift quantity detector <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the tilt quantity detector <b>3</b><i>c</i>, are transmitted to the camera body <b>1</b> via the communication contact point.

In addition, the photometering sensor <b>7</b><i>b </i>is disposed so as to monitor a plurality of photometering areas set within the subject imaging area, and thus, multiple segment exposure metering of the known art, whereby subject luminance values are calculated based upon luminance signals detected in the individual areas is achieved. </p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> The following is an explanation of the processing executed in the photographing mode at the digital camera <b>100</b> achieved in the embodiment. </p>

Once the subject luminance value is calculated, photographing value settings such as the shutter speed and the aperture value are determined as necessary. It is to be noted that the processing executed in response to a halfway press operation of the shutter release button <b>60</b> as described above, i.e., the preparatory processing executed prior to the actual image capturing operation, is to be referred to as imaging preparatory processing.

<p id="h-0011" num="0000"> (Optical Path of Incident Light Flux Altered by Shift and Tilt) </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The optical paths of the subject light flux leading to the photometering sensor <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the focus detection sensor <b>10</b><i>a </i>when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is neither shifted nor tilted, are now explained. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> which is not shifted or tilted is indicated with the dotted line, and the corresponding subject light flux is indicated by Ia (the two-point chain line). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is neither shifted nor tilted, the subject light flux having been bent upward at the mirror <b>4</b> forms an image and is then diffused at the focusing screen <b>5</b>, as the subject light flux would in a camera mounted with a standard imaging lens that does not allow a shift operation or a tilt operation. The subject light flux having become diffused at the focusing screen <b>5</b> passes through the pentaprism <b>6</b> and becomes condensed at the condenser optical system <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The condensed light is then received at the photometering sensor <b>7</b><i>b</i>. The photometering unit <b>56</b> is thus able to measure the subject luminance. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> The subject light flux having been transmitted through the semi-transmissive portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>at the mirror <b>4</b> becomes bent downward at the sub-mirror <b>4</b><i>b </i>and enters the focus detection device <b>10</b> constituted with a focal point detection device. The subject light flux having entered the focus detection device <b>10</b> enters the focus detection sensor <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The focus detection unit <b>57</b> calculates the extent of defocusing based upon output from the focus detection sensor <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Based upon the defocus quantity thus calculated, the control unit <b>50</b> executes focus match processing to achieve focus by driving the focal adjustment optical system of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>via the lens drive unit <b>62</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> As described above, when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is neither shifted nor tilted, photometering processing and focus detection processing are executed accurately by the photometering unit <b>56</b> and the focus detection unit <b>57</b> operating independently of each other by using the subject light flux. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> Next, the optical paths of the subject light flux leading to the photometering sensor <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the focus detection sensor <b>10</b><i>a </i>when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is shifted or tilted, are explained. The explanation is given by assuming that the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shifted. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The solid line <b>3</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; indicates the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> when it is shifted upward relative to the imaging element <b>12</b>, with Ib (the one-point chain line) indicating the corresponding subject light flux. Let us now consider a subject light flux forming an image at the center of the imaging surface at the imaging element <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is shifted upward, the angle of incidence of the optical axis of the subject light flux Ib that forms an image at the center of the imaging plane becomes tilted further upward relative to the angle of incidence of the subject light flux Ia measured when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is not shifted. In other words, as the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shifted, the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at the imaging surface at the imaging element <b>12</b> is altered and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at a specific position within the image forming surface at the focusing screen <b>5</b> is also altered in the mirror-down state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The condenser optical system <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the photometering sensor <b>7</b><i>b </i>at the photometering device <b>7</b> are disposed by taking into consideration the diffusion of the light flux corresponding to the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at the focusing screen <b>5</b>, and the photometering value is calculated by detecting the diffused light flux. Accordingly, if a shift or tilt of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>alters the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at the focusing screen <b>5</b>, the state of the diffused light flux also changes, resulting in a change in the photometering value obtained through the calculation. For this reason, a shift or a tilt of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> destabilizes the photometering accuracy. If the extent of a shift or tilt exceeds a predetermined value, accurate photometering is no longer possible. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> At the focus detection device <b>10</b>, too, the focus detection sensor <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the like are disposed in correspondence to the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at a virtual image forming plane assumed in the focus detection device <b>10</b>. Accordingly, if the angle of incidence of the subject light flux at the image forming plane in each focus detection (range finding) area changes due to a shift or tilt of the imaging optical systems <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the presence of the shielding mask or the like for pupil splitting in the focus detection device <b>10</b> induces an eclipse. Thus, a shift or a tilt of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> destabilizes the focus detection accuracy, and if the extent of shift or tilt exceeds a predetermined extent, the focus detection operation itself is disabled. </p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000"> (Switching Photometering and Focus Detection Methods) </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> As described above, if the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is shifted or tilted by an extent equal to or beyond a predetermined extent, the photometering processing by the photometering unit <b>56</b> and the focus detection processing by the focus detection unit <b>57</b> become destabilized or disabled, and thus, the photometering processing or the focus match processing cannot be executed accurately. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> When the photometering processing and the focus detection processing are destabilized or disabled, the photometering processing and the focus match processing are executed based upon signal output from the imaging element unit <b>52</b> by forming an image with a subject light flux at the imaging element <b>12</b> without utilizing the photometering unit <b>56</b> or the focus detection unit <b>57</b> in the digital camera <b>100</b> in the embodiment. More specifically, the shift quantity and the tilt quantity (e.g., a shift quantity equal to or beyond &#xb1;2 mm and a tilt quantity equal to or beyond &#xb1;3&#xb0;) at which the photometering processing and the focus detection processing are destabilized or disabled, are set as predetermined values, and if the shift quantity or the tilt quantity observed for the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is equal to or beyond the corresponding predetermined value, control is switched so as to execute the photometering processing and the focus match processing based upon output signals from the imaging element unit <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The photometering processing and the focus match processing may be executed based upon the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> by adopting methods of the known art. For instance, the output signals from the imaging element unit <b>52</b> may be processed by the image processing unit <b>53</b> and the control unit <b>50</b> so as to calculate the photometering value (the subject luminance value) in the photometering processing. The focus match processing may be executed by adopting a contrast AF method of the known art. In the contrast AF method, the lens drive unit <b>62</b> drives the focal adjustment optical system of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>so as to engage the focal adjustment optical system in a single-direction scan from the infinity side to the close-up side. The control unit <b>50</b> compares the levels of contrast indicated in the output signals from the imaging element <b>12</b>, each obtained as the focal adjustment optical system under the scan drive control moves by a predetermined pitch, and thus calculates the focused position of the focal adjustment optical system at the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> It is to be noted that while an explanation is given above on an example in which photometering processing and focus match processing are executed based upon signals output from the imaging element unit <b>52</b> when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shifted or tilted by an extent equal to or beyond the predetermined value, the present invention is not limited to this example and the photometering processing and focus match processing methods may be switched based upon both the shift quantity and the tilt quantity. For instance, when the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shifted and tilted, the photometering processing and focus match processing methods may be switched by making a decision as to whether a value calculated by incorporating the values of the shift quantity and the tilt quantity is equal to or beyond a predetermined value or less than the predetermined value. For instance, the photometering processing and the focus match processing may be executed by using the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> when the shift quantity is equal to or beyond &#xb1;1 mm and the tilt quantity is equal to or beyond &#xb1;1&#xb0;. </p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The imaging processing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> starts in response to a halfway press operation (as the SW<b>1</b> enters an ON state) of the shutter release button <b>60</b> in the photographing mode. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In step S<b>101</b>, a decision is made based upon the lens information obtained from the imaging lens <b>3</b> as to whether or not the imaging lens <b>3</b> mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> allows a shift operation or a tilt operation of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a</i>. If it is decided that the imaging lens <b>3</b> mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> allows a shift operation or a tilt operation, the operation shifts into step S<b>102</b>, whereas if it is decided that the imaging lens <b>3</b> mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> does not allow a shift operation or a tilt operation, the operation shifts into step S<b>103</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> In step S<b>102</b>, a decision is made as to whether or not the extent of decentering of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the imaging lens <b>3</b> relative to the imaging element <b>12</b>, i.e., the extent of shift or tilt of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is equal to or beyond the predetermined value set in advance as the criterion for switching the processing methods. If it is decided that the decentering quantity is equal to or beyond the predetermined value, the operation proceeds to step S<b>109</b>, whereas if it is decided that the decentering quantity is not equal to or beyond the predetermined value, the operation proceeds to step S<b>103</b>. In step S<b>103</b>, photometering processing is executed by the photometering device <b>7</b>, and the aperture value, the shutter speed or the like is determined as necessary in correspondence to the subject luminance value calculated through the photometering processing. In addition, focus match-processing for achieving a focus match by driving the focal adjustment optical system of the imaging lens <b>3</b> is executed based upon the extent of defocusing calculated by the focus detection device <b>10</b>. </p>

In step S<b>105</b>, a decision is made as to whether or not the shutter release button <b>60</b> is pressed all the way down (whether or not the SW<b>2</b> is in an ON state). If it is decided that the shutter release button <b>60</b> is pressed all the way down, the operation proceeds to step S<b>107</b>, whereas if it is decided that the shutter release button <b>60</b> is not pressed all the way down, the operation proceeds to step S<b>106</b>. </p>

In step S<b>107</b>, the stored electrical charges at the imaging element <b>12</b> are reset. Then, in step S<b>108</b>, the mirror <b>4</b> is raised, the aperture (not shown) is adjusted so as to achieve the aperture value having been selected, and then the shutter curtain at the shutter <b>11</b> is opened.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> In step S<b>109</b>, the mirror <b>4</b> is raised and the shutter curtain of the shutter <b>11</b> is opened. In step S<b>110</b>, photometering processing is executed by the image processing unit <b>53</b> and the control unit <b>50</b> by using the signals output by the imaging element unit <b>52</b>, and the aperture value, the shutter speed or the like is determined as necessary in correspondence to the subject luminance value calculated through the photometering processing. In addition, the control unit <b>50</b> executes focus match processing for driving the focal adjustment optical system of the imaging lens <b>3</b> to the focus match position through the contrast AF method described above based upon the signals output by the imaging element unit <b>52</b>. Then, image signals continuously output from the imaging element unit <b>52</b> are sequentially processed, thereby starting reproduction of a dynamic image (through image display) at the rear liquid crystal monitor <b>13</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> In step S<b>111</b>, a decision is made as to whether or not the halfway press operation (the SW<b>1</b> in an ON state) of the shutter release button <b>60</b> is sustained.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> In step S<b>115</b>, the shutter curtain at the shutter <b>11</b> is closed in conformance to the shutter speed having been set, the electrical charge storage at the imaging element <b>12</b> is stopped and the aperture (not shown) is reset to the open position.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> As described above, if an imaging lens that does not allow a shift operation or a tilt operation is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> (if a negative decision is made in step S<b>101</b>), or if an imaging lens <b>3</b> allowing a shift operation or a tilt operation is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> but the extent of decentering, i.e., the extents of tilt and shift, is equal to or less than a predetermined value (if a negative decision is made in step S<b>102</b>), photometering processing by the photometering device <b>7</b> and focus match processing based upon the output from the focus detection device <b>10</b> are individually executed in step S<b>103</b> with great accuracy. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> If, on the other hand, it is decided that an imaging lens <b>3</b> allowing a shift operation or a tilt operation is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b> and the extent of decentering, i.e., the extent of tilt or shift, is equal to or beyond the predetermined value (if an affirmative decision is made in step S<b>102</b>), an image is formed with a subject light flux at the imaging element <b>12</b> and photometering processing and focus match processing are executed based upon signals output from the imaging element <b>12</b> in steps S<b>109</b> and S<b>110</b>. In other words, even under conditions in which a significant error is likely to manifest in the photometry by the photometering device <b>7</b> or in the focus detection operation executed by the focus detection device <b>10</b>, photometering processing and focus match processing can be executed with accuracy based upon the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> It is to be noted that while the stored electrical charges at the imaging element <b>12</b> are reset in step S<b>114</b> and then the operation directly shifts into the imaging processing in step S<b>115</b> in the explanation provided above, the shutter <b>11</b> may be first closed to block the subject light, the stored electrical charges at the imaging element <b>12</b> may be reset and then the shutter <b>11</b> may be opened again in step S<b>114</b> before the operation shifts into the imaging processing in step S<b>115</b> instead. By adopting such an alternative, it is ensured that the stored electrical charges at the imaging element <b>12</b> are reset without being affected by external light. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> In addition, the mirror <b>4</b> may be lowered and the shutter curtain at the shutter <b>11</b> may be closed upon completion of the photometering processing and the focus match processing, without executing the dynamic image reproduction in step S<b>110</b>. In such a case, the stored electrical charges at the imaging element <b>12</b> may be reset, the mirror <b>4</b> may then be raised and the shutter curtain may be opened in step S<b>114</b>. This allows the user to recheck the subject through the optical viewfinder after the photometering processing and the focus match processing end. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> While an explanation is given above in reference to an embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to this example. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> For instance, when the shift quantity or the tilt quantity is equal to or beyond the predetermined value and the photometering processing and the focus match processing are executed based upon the signals output from the imaging element <b>12</b>, the subject luminance may be calculated through the center-weighted light reading of the known art by using the image data over the central area of the subject image alone. In addition, the predetermined value mentioned earlier (e.g., the shift quantity at &#xb1;2 mm or the tilt quantity at &#xb1;30) may be designated as a first predetermined value and a second predetermined value (e.g., the shift quantity at or beyond &#xb1;3 mm or the tilt quantity at or beyond &#xb1;4&#xb0;) indicating a greater extent of shift or a tilt than the first predetermined value may be further designated. In such a case, the photometering processing and the focus match processing should be executed by using the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> when the shift quantity or the tilt quantity is equal to or beyond the first predetermined value, and if the shift quantity or the tilt quantity is equal to or beyond the second predetermined value, the subject luminance may be calculated based upon the output signal provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> through the center-weighted light reading of the known art by using only the image data over the central area of the subject image. This alternative ensures that highly accurate photometering processing is executed even when a great extent of shift or tilt has induced an eclipse. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> It is to be noted that in the embodiment, the photometering processing and the focus match processing are executed based upon the output signals from the imaging element <b>12</b> when the extent of shift or tilt is equal to or beyond the predetermined value. However, the present invention is not limited to this example and the camera may instead be set so as to execute the photometering processing and the focus match processing based upon the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> regardless of the shift quantity or the tilt quantity if any shift or tilt of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a </i>is detected at all. Alternatively, the photometering processing and the focus detection processing may be executed based upon the output signals from the imaging element <b>12</b> invariably, as long as an imaging lens <b>3</b> allowing a shift or tilt is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Furthermore, an explanation is given above in reference to the embodiment in which the imaging lens <b>3</b> mounted at the imaging device is an interchangeable lens that can be decentered by shifting or tilting at least part of the imaging optical system <b>3</b><i>a</i>. However, the imaging lens <b>3</b> is not limited to this example and the present invention may be adopted in conjunction with any type of imaging lens <b>3</b> as long as the optical axis of at least one of the lenses constituting the imaging lens <b>3</b> can be decentered relative to the imaging element <b>12</b>. For instance, it may be adopted in conjunction with an imaging lens that only allows either a shift or a tilt. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> Moreover, the imaging lens <b>3</b> may be a special lens. The term &#x201c;special lens&#x201d; in this context refers to a lens from which lens information cannot be transmitted to the camera body <b>1</b> or a telephoto lens. It is to be noted that the term &#x201c;lens information&#x201d; in this context refers to lens inherent information, information indicating the lens state and the like. If a lens from which the lens information cannot be transmitted to the camera body <b>1</b> or from which only part of the lens information can be transmitted (e.g., a manual focus lens) is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b>, accurate or precise photometering processing cannot be executed by the photometering device <b>7</b>. In addition, if a telephoto lens or, in particular, if a super-telephoto lens is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b>, the depth of field becomes extremely small, i.e., close to or even exceeding the detection resolution achieved with the focus detection device <b>10</b> through the phase difference detection method. Accordingly, the control may be switched so as to execute the photometering processing and the focus match processing based upon the output signals provided by the imaging element <b>12</b> when such a special lens is mounted at the camera body <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> The control unit <b>50</b> at the camera body <b>1</b> detects the lens information from the imaging lens <b>3</b> mounted thereat and makes a decision as to whether or not the imaging lens <b>3</b> is a special lens based upon the detection results. For instance, if the communication between the mounted imaging lens <b>3</b> and the camera body <b>1</b> is disabled, if the lens information from the imaging lens <b>3</b> is missing, or if information indicating the imaging lens type is input by the user via the operation unit <b>61</b>, the control unit may judge that a special lens is currently mounted. Thus, the photometering processing and the focus match processing can be executed in a desirable manner even when a special lens is mounted without having to provide a special mechanism. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> While an explanation is given above in reference to the embodiment on an example in which the present invention is adopted in a lens interchangeable single lens reflex digital camera which allows the use of a detachable imaging lens <b>3</b>, the present invention is not limited to this example. For instance, the present invention may be adopted in a digital camera equipped with an integrated permanent lens, which includes a decenterable imaging lens, or it may be adopted in an imaging device other than a still camera such as a digital video camera. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> The above described embodiment is an example, and various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. </p>
