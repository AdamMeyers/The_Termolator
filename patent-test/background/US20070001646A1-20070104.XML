<heading level="2" id="h-0001">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-193872, filed on Jul. 1, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates generally to a charging apparatus of rechargeable batteries built into electronic devices such as mobile terminals, and, more particularly, to a charging IC (Integrated Circuit), charging apparatus and an electronic device using as a charging source of the rechargeable batteries an external power source such as an AC (Alternating Current) adaptor or a USB (Universal Serial Bus) host such as a personal computer connected with a USB cable. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In charging of a rechargeable battery built into an electronic device such as a mobile terminal, which uses an AC adaptor or a personal computer as a charging source, preliminary charging, constant-current charging or constant-voltage charging is selected depending on a voltage level of the rechargeable battery, and even in the constant-current charging, a current value may be gradually switched. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In regard to such charging of a rechargeable battery, known propositions are a charging circuit having a drooping characteristic depending on a output current (For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1999-327671 (paragraph number 0020, FIG. 1, FIG. 2 and the like)), a method and apparatus used for constant-voltage charging after constant-current charging for charging a battery of a cellular phone (For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-274570 (paragraph number 0016, FIG. 4, FIG. 5 and the like)) </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> By the way, a description is made for the charging which switches to constant-voltage charging after constant-current charging with an external power source having a drooping characteristic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a charging apparatus using a PMOS (P-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistor for charging control; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart of the charging control; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a charging operation. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> This charging apparatus <b>2</b> is configured to use an AC adaptor <b>8</b> as a charging source to charge a rechargeable battery <b>6</b> built into an electronic device <b>3</b> along with an apparatus load <b>4</b>. The charging apparatus <b>2</b> is provided with a charging IC <b>10</b>, and the charging IC <b>10</b> integrates circuit units such as a charging control unit which can be integrated into an IC. As an external circuit of the charging IC <b>10</b>, a charging path <b>11</b> is formed for passing a charging current between the AC adaptor <b>8</b> and the rechargeable battery <b>6</b>; the charging path <b>11</b> is equipped with a PMOS transistor (Tr) <b>12</b> as a charging control element; and the PMOSTr <b>12</b> is connected serially with a backflow prevention diode <b>14</b> and a sense resistor <b>16</b>. The sense resistor <b>16</b> converts the charging current flowing through the charging path <b>11</b> to a voltage to be detected and the detected current is applied to the charging IC <b>10</b> as control information. Control output obtained in the charging IC <b>10</b> is applied to a gate of the PMOSTr <b>12</b> to execute charging-current control or constant-voltage control. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In the charging of the rechargeable battery <b>6</b> with the charging apparatus <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is detected as the charging source, the output voltage of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is detected, and then, a battery status check is performed for a battery temperature and a battery voltage which indicate a battery status (step S<b>1</b>). If the result of the battery status check is normal, a charging operation is started. At the start of the charging operation, first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> is performed as fast charging (step S<b>2</b>), except the case that a battery voltage is too low (an over-discharge state), and the battery voltage is raised by the first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> to a start voltage of constant-voltage charging (step S<b>3</b>). After the battery voltage is raised, second constant-current charging CC<b>2</b> is performed (step S<b>4</b>), and when full charging is achieved through constant-voltage charging (step S<b>5</b>), the charging is completed. To a constant current Icc<b>1</b> of CC<b>1</b>, a constant current Icc<b>2</b> of CC<b>2</b> is in a relationship of Icc<b>2</b>&#x3c;Icc<b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In this charging process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the rechargeable battery <b>6</b> is raised to a predetermined voltage (e.g., 3 [V]) through preliminary charging (PR) with a preliminary current Ipre, a charging current Ic is increased to a constant current Icc<b>1</b> to utilize the drooping characteristic of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> to perform the first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> and second constant-current charging CC<b>2</b>, and after constant charging CV, the charging of the rechargeable battery <b>6</b> is reaches to, for example, 4.2 [V] and completed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing transitions of charging forms, charging currents and charging voltages. In this case, the output voltage of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is set higher than the charging completion voltage, and maximum heat generation happens at the point of time when the second constant-current charging is switched to the constant-voltage charging. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The heat generation amount due to the charging operation is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing transitions of the heat generation amount in each portion during the charging operation. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In the charging operation, for the heat generation in the PMOSTr <b>12</b>, diode <b>14</b> and sense resistor <b>16</b> in the first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>), the heat generation of the diode <b>14</b> is largest and accounts for one-half of the total heat generation amount. In the second constant-current charging CC<b>2</b> region (t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>), the total heat generation amount is larger than the constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>), and the heat generation amounts of the diode <b>14</b> and sense resistor <b>16</b> is smaller than the CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>), while the heat generation amounts of the PMOSTr <b>12</b> accounts for two third of the total heat generation amount. In the constant-voltage charging CV region (t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b>), the heat generation amount is reduced dependently on reduction of the charging current. In the total heat generation amount of the region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>4</b>), the heat generation amount of the PMOSTr <b>12</b> is largest. In this heat generation, when making the shift to the constant-current charging CC<b>2</b>, PMOSTr <b>12</b> generates heat depending on electric power applying a voltage. Such heat generation leads to energy loss. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> By the way, a start voltage of the constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> is set to, for example, about 3 [V], and the charging current Ic is dependent on the output of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> because the drooping characteristic of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is used. Therefore, in the CC<b>1</b> region, the charging current Ic is on the order of 670 [mA]. Assuming that an output voltage of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is Voa and a battery voltage is Vb, the output volatage Voa is as follows: 
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Voa=Vb</i>+(external part resistance [&#x3a9;]&#xd7;<i>Ic</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1) <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The external part generates heat depending on this acceptable loss. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In this case, assuming that a voltage drop of the diode <b>14</b> is 0.3 [V], the heat generation amount Pd is as follows: 
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Pd=</i>0.3 <i>[V]&#xd7;Ic</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2) <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> When a constant current Icc<b>2</b> in the CC<b>2</b> region is set to, for example, 350 [mA], if the output voltage Voa is about 5.4 [V], a large portion of a difference voltage &#x394;V (=Voa&#x2212;Vb) between the battery voltage Vb and the output voltage Voa of the AC adaptor <b>8</b> is concentrated on the PMOStr <b>12</b>, and the heat generation amount of the PMOStr <b>12</b> accounts for a large portion of the total heat generation amount. Assuming that the loss due to the external part is about 456 [mW], about 318 [mW] is lost by the heat generation of the PMOSTr <b>12</b>. Since the charging current Ic comes down below CC<b>1</b> at the time of the shift to CC<b>2</b>, the battery voltage Vb comes down to on the order of 3.9 [V] and then, the battery voltage Vb is raised by the constant-current charging CC<b>2</b> to make the shift to the constant-voltage charging CV at the battery voltage Vb=4.2 [V]. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> In the constant-voltage charging CV, constant-voltage control is performed such that the battery voltage Vb will be 4.2 [V], and as the rechargeable battery <b>6</b> approaches full charge, the charging current Ic is reduced. In the CV region, since the charging current is small, the heat generation is lower than the CC<b>2</b>. The charging is completed and the charging operation is terminated if the charging current Ic reduced to on the order of 50 [mA]. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> A charging apparatus <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a case that a PMOSTr <b>18</b> is used as a backflow prevention element, instead of the diode <b>14</b> described above.

In the charging apparatus <b>2</b>, the PMOSTr <b>18</b> is operated by a control signal applied from the charging IC <b>10</b> to a gate to regulate the direction of the charging current Ic passing through the charging path <b>11</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> In regard to the heat generation amount of the charging apparatus <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>) the heat generation of the sense resistor <b>16</b> is largest and accounts for one-half of the total heat generation amount. The total heat generation amount in the second constant-current charging CC<b>2</b> region (t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>) is about twice larger than the constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>), and the heat generation amounts of the PMOSTr <b>18</b> and the sense resistor <b>16</b> are dropped to on the order of one-fifth of the total heat generation amount, while the heat generation amount of the PMOSTr <b>12</b> accounts for four-fifth of the total heat generation amount. In the constant-voltage charging CV region (t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b>), the heat generation amount is reduced dependently on reduction of the charging current. In this heat generation, when making the shift to the constant-current charging CC<b>2</b>, PMOSTr <b>12</b> generates heat depending on electric power applying a voltage.

Therefore, in regard to the heat generation amount of the charging apparatus <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the first constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> region (t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>) the heat generation of the switching power source <b>20</b> is largest and accounts for one-half of the total heat generation amount.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> By using such a switching power source <b>20</b>, when the charging current Ic of the constant-current charging CC<b>1</b> is enlarged, the heat generation amount is increased, and although the capacity of the switching power source <b>20</b> may be increased in order to constrain the heat generation, the cost is increased.

<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> An object of the present invention relates to charging of rechargeable batteries built into electronic devices and is to constrain heat generation during the charging. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Another object of the present invention relates to charging of rechargeable batteries using external devices such as Ac adaptors or USB hosts and is to plan to promote the efficiency of the charging. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The configurations of the present invention for solving the issues are listed and described. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In order to achieve the above objects, according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a charging IC used for charging a rechargeable battery built into an electronic device, comprising a power source unit which can be fed with power from an external power source with a drooping characteristic to pick up a constant current; and a control unit which applies a first constant current from the external power source to the rechargeable battery through a circuit element disposed on a charging path of the rechargeable battery, the control unit applying a second constant current smaller than the first constant current from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery after the rechargeable battery is charged with the first constant current to a predetermined voltage. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> According to such a configuration, the rechargeable battery is charged by applying the first constant current to the rechargeable battery from the external power source, such as an AC adaptor, with the drooping characteristic, and after the rechargeable battery is charged to the predetermined voltage, the rechargeable battery can be charged by applying the second constant current from the power source unit built into the charging IC to the rechargeable battery. In this charging, a current value is large for the first constant current supplied to the rechargeable battery from the external power source with the drooping characteristic, and the second constant current supplied from the power source unit built into the charging IC is smaller than the first constant current. Therefore, although the cause of the heat generation on the charging IC side exists in the power source unit applying the second constant current, the heat generation amount thereof is small, since the current value of the second constant current is smaller than that of the first constant current. In this case, since the second constant current is directly supplied from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery and the circuit elements are not involved, the circuit elements do not generate heat when the second constant current is supplied. Also, although the first constant current is applied through the circuit elements which generate heat, the heat generation amount thereof is small. As compared to the conventional case of applying the second constant current through a PMOSTr (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the heat generation amount is considerably reduced. Therefore, the heating or heat generation amount is constrained in the electronic device equipped with the charging IC. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Also, when generating the first constant current or when allowing the power supply unit to generate the second constant current, the heat generation of the external power source occurs outside of the electronic device which is the device equipped with the charging IC and, therefore, is irrelevant to the heat generation of the electronic device. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In the charging IC of the present invention, the power source unit is preferably fed with power from an external device connected to the electronic device to output the constant current or a constant voltage, and the control unit is preferably configured to apply a constant voltage from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery to switch over to constant-voltage charging after the charging with the second constant current. According to such a configuration, the rechargeable battery is charged to the predetermined voltage by the constant-voltage charging. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> In the charging IC of the present invention, the external power source may be, but not exclusively, an AC adaptor converting an alternate current received from an alternate-current power source into a direct current with a predetermined voltage to be picked up. The power source unit is preferably, but not exclusively, a switching power source converting direct-current input to direct-current output. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In order to achieve the above objects, according to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a charging IC used for charging a rechargeable battery built into an electronic device, comprising a power source unit which is fed with power from an external device connected to the electronic device to output constant currents; and a control unit which switches constant currents applied from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery based on power-feeding information provided from the external device. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> According to such a configuration, although the constant current is obtained in the power source unit due to the power feeding from the external device and the rechargeable battery is charged by this constant current, if the power feeding capacity is high, based on the power feeding information provided from the external device, switch-over to the power source unit is performed, and the rechargeable battery is charged with the switched larger constant-current. In this case, since the rechargeable battery is charged by the low-power power source unit or the power source unit, the heat generation amount of the charging IC is constrained and, in turn, the heating or heat generation amount is constrained in the electronic device equipped with the charging IC. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In this charging IC of the present invention, the power source unit may be fed with power from an external device connected to the electronic device and comprise of a first power source circuit outputting a constant current and a second power source circuit outputting a constant current smaller than the first power source circuit; and the control unit may be configured to apply the constant current from the second power source circuit to the rechargeable battery and switch output from the second power source circuit to the first power source circuit based on power-feeding information provided from the external device to apply the constant current to the rechargeable battery. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In this charging IC, the external device is preferably, but not exclusively, an electronic device connected by a USB cable. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In order to achieve the above objects, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a charging apparatus used for charging a rechargeable battery built into an electronic device, comprising: a power source unit which is fed with power from an external power source having a drooping characteristic or an external device connected to the electronic device; a switch which is disposed between the power source unit and the external power source or the external device to switch connection of the external power source or the external device with the power source unit; a circuit element disposed on a charging path of the rechargeable battery; and a control unit, if the external power source is connected to the power source unit, applying a first constant current from the external power source to the rechargeable battery through the circuit element and applying a second constant current smaller than the first constant current from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery after the rechargeable battery is charged with the first constant current to a predetermined voltage, the control unit, if the external device is connected to the power source unit, switching a constant current in accordance with a power-feeding capability of the external device based on power-feeding information provided from the external device to apply the constant current to the rechargeable battery. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> According to such a configuration, power is supplied to the power source unit by either the external power source having a drooping characteristic or the external device for connecting with the electronic device having the rechargeable battery, the switch is used for switching the power supply, charging is controlled responding to the switching. When the external power source is selected, the rechargeable battery is charged by applying the first constant current to the rechargeable battery from the external power source, such as an AC adaptor, with the drooping characteristic, and after the rechargeable battery is charged to the predetermined voltage, the rechargeable battery can be charged by applying the second constant current from the power source unit. In this charging, since a current value is large for the first constant current supplied to the rechargeable battery from the external power source with the drooping characteristic and the second constant current supplied from the power source unit has smaller current value than the first constant current, the heat generation amount is small. In this case, since the second constant current is directly supplied from the power source unit to the rechargeable battery and the circuit elements are not involved, the circuit elements do not generate heat when the second constant current is supplied. Also, although the first constant current is applied through the circuit elements which generate heat, the heat generation amount thereof is small. As compared to the conventional case of applying the second constant current through a PMOSTr (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the heat generation amount is considerably reduced. Therefore, the heating or heat generation amount is suppressed in the electronic device equipped with this charging IC. When the external device is selected, current is switched to a constant current depending on a power-feeding capability of the external device based on power-feeding information provided from the external device thereby recharging the rechargeable battery by this constant current. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> In the charging apparatus of the present invention, the switch may be, but not exclusively, configured to select either the external power source or the external device or select the external power source to connect to the power source unit, if both of the external power source and the external device are connected. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> In this charging apparatus, the control unit is preferably, but not exclusively, configured to select either the external power source or the external device with the switch to connect to the power source unit, if both of the external power source and the external device are connected. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> In the charging apparatus, the power source unit may be fed with power from an external device connected to the electronic device to output a current or voltage in accordance with a power-feeding capability of the electronic device, and the control unit may be configured to switch over to constant-voltage charging after the charging with the second constant current. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The technical features, advantages, etc., of the present invention are listed as follows. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> (1) Heat generation is suppressed in the charging IC, and heating and a heat generation amount are suppressed in a charging apparatus or an electronic device installed the charging IC. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> (2) Heat generation is suppressed in a charging apparatus, heating and a heat generation amount are suppressed in an electronic device installed the charging apparatus. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> (3) According to the electronic device having installed the charging IC or the charging apparatus as described above, heating and a heat generation amount are suppressed and heat radiation measures can be made lighter. For example, when the charging IC and the charging apparatus is used in the electronic device, heat radiation measures can be made lighter resulting from suppressed heating and heat generation amount. As an electronic device, for example, heat radiation measures of a mobile terminal can be made lighter, which facilitates to make the product thinner. </p>
