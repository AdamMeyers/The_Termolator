<heading level="2" id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The present invention relates to systems and methods for sensing levels and electrical properties of liquids stored in fuel tanks and other containers. More particularly, this invention pertains to sensing liquid levels and properties by propagating electromagnetic waves into a liquid container. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Motor vehicle operators rely on fuel gauges to provide accurate information on the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel tank. The most common method of measuring the amount of fuel remaining in a motor vehicle fuel tank is to place a mechanical float and lever inside the tank. When the fuel level changes in the tank, the float causes the lever to pivot. When the lever pivots in response to changing fuel levels, an electrical signal is proportionately generated and/or varied. This variation in electrical signal is transmitted to a fuel gauge or vehicle data bus external to the tank. Such electromechanical fuel measurement systems are not particularly accurate and, of course, require installation of a mechanism inside the tank. Repair, replacement, or adjustment of an internal fuel level measurement mechanism is problematic. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Engine control systems in many motor vehicles, and particularly in flexible fuel vehicles, also have a need to know the type and/or composition of fuel that is inside the fuel tank. Conventional fuel composition sensors are complex, expensive, and are not capable of also measuring fuel levels. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The present invention provides reliable, inexpensive, and accurate systems and methods for measuring liquid levels and properties in a tank using a mechanism that can be installed external or internal to the tank. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In one embodiment of the liquid level sensing systems and methods of the present invention, a substantially sinusoidal radio frequency (RF) signal of constant frequency is generated and coupled to a series-resonant Inductance, Capacitance, Resistance (LCR) circuit. The coil (inductor) of the resonant circuit is placed in close proximity to, or inside, a plastic fuel tank causing electromagnetic radiation to propagate into the fuel space. Consequently, the liquid fuel inside the tank acts as an electrical load to the series resonant circuit in a manner proportionate to the volume of fuel remaining in the tank. The loading effect of the fuel can cause a shift in the resonant frequency of the circuit and/or a change in the inductance Q of the resonant circuit. The loading effect of the fuel is determined by monitoring a change in one or more electrical parameters associated with the excited resonant circuit. For example, the voltage across the resistor in the series resonant circuit can be monitored. Changes in this voltage are detected and analyzed by a system controller, the result of which is used to output a signal indicative of fuel level. This output can be in the form of a digital or analog electrical signal. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In one embodiment of the invention, the resistive component of the series-resonant LCR circuit is provided by the internal resistance of the inductor rather than by a discrete resistor. In this embodiment, the measurement of changes in voltage in the resonant circuit may be taken across the inductor or a portion thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Depending on the position and orientation of the system coil, and/or the use of ground planes and other RF directional devices, the measured electrical parameter can represent the volume of liquid in the entire container or the volume of liquid in only a portion of the container. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The system and method can sense and measure liquid levels in other containers including oil tanks and water tanks and is not limited to the examples used in this description. The system can be used in a wide variety of scientific, consumer, industrial, and medical environments. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Preferably, the system includes auto-calibration hardware and software that enables the system to automatically determine an optimum system operating frequency. In one embodiment of the system, the optimum system operating frequency is selected to be a frequency above or below the resonant frequency of the series LCR circuit. The choice of this operating frequency over the resonant frequency allows for larger changes in voltage drop relative to changes in liquid volume. Preferably, the system is tuned to operate at a frequency between a lower and upper value. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In one embodiment, auto-compensation is provided so that the measured electrical parameter provides an accurate indication of the liquid level in the tank, independent of variations in operating conditions, such as ambient temperature. In another embodiment, the system can measure&#x2014;and be calibrated for&#x2014;variations in the electrical properties of the liquid itself. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The system can include a physical or wireless data interface to facilitate external transmission of the compensated measurement from the system to a fuel gauge or to a central controller in the vehicle. In some embodiments, the system may transmit raw data to a receiver connected to a central controller, with compensation of the raw data being performed in the central controller. The data can be transmitted periodically, in response to a change, by request from the central controller, or by request from an external device such as a diagnostic device.</p>

One terminal of resistor <b>70</b> is electrically connected to system ground. The other terminal of resistor <b>70</b> is electrically connected to an analog input on ADC <b>40</b>. Thus, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, changes in voltage across resistor <b>70</b> are converted to digital signals by ADC <b>40</b> so that such digital signals can be further processed by controller <b>30</b>. Thus, the controller <b>30</b> converts the signal representing a change in the electrical parameter of the resonant circuit into a liquid level signal that is provided to the vehicle fuel gauge directly or through a vehicle data bus. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the series resonant circuit can be characterized as an antenna circuit in which resonant inductor <b>65</b> functions as a radiating component that directs RF energy into the fuel tank <b>15</b>. In other embodiments, a separate radiating component (not shown) may be coupled to the resonant circuit. Also, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the resistive component R of the series-resonant LCR circuit is illustrated as a discrete resistor <b>70</b>. However, the resistive component R can also be provided as an internal resistance of the resonant inductor or coil <b>65</b> rather than as a separate discrete component. In such an embodiment, changes in voltage are measured across the resonant inductor <b>65</b> or a portion thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> Although the scope of the present invention is not limited to any particular circuit topology, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the system <b>10</b> shown in block diagram form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the system, as used in testing described below. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> Preferably, the electronic components of the system <b>10</b> are mounted to a system board, such as a unitary printed circuit board (PCB) <b>85</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with the coil <b>65</b> having a geometry, orientation, and position on the PCB <b>85</b> to provide optimum RF energy coupling external to the PCB <b>85</b>. The printed circuit board <b>85</b> can be rigid or flexible, with or without an adhesive back. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows one embodiment of a plastic vehicle fuel tank <b>15</b> which is conventionally mounted in the rear of a vehicle <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> is fluidly coupled to the vehicle engine and emission systems via one or more fluid lines <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> As best seen in FIGS. <b>9</b>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>c</i>), the PCB <b>85</b> is attached to an external wall of fuel tank <b>15</b> in a position that will provide sensing of changes in the desired liquid level, either in the entire tank <b>15</b> or in only a portion of the tank <b>15</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> In some embodiments of the system <b>10</b>, a ground plane structure <b>75</b> is positioned proximate to and behind the coil <b>65</b> so as to focus and direct RF energy from the coil <b>65</b> into the tank <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>(<i>a</i>), the ground plane <b>75</b> is spaced approximately 2 mm from the coil <b>65</b>, although other embodiments may use different spacings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example. Where a heat shield <b>14</b> is used with the fuel tank <b>15</b> (as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the heat shield can optionally be used as the ground plane structure <b>75</b> as a further cost saving measure. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The coil <b>65</b> can be attached or incorporated into strap (not shown) that secures the fuel tank <b>15</b> to the vehicle. This would avoid the expense of modifying a conventional fuel tank to accept a direct-mounted coil <b>65</b> or PCB <b>85</b>. In addition, if the tank mounting strap is grounded to the vehicle, the strap itself can function as ground plane structure <b>75</b>, further reducing cost. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> In yet another embodiment of the system <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>(<i>b</i>), the series-resonant LCR circuit, or at least the coil <b>65</b>, can be mounted inside the fuel tank <b>15</b>. If a ground plane <b>75</b> is used, it can also be positioned inside the tank <b>15</b>, between the coil <b>65</b> and the tank wall. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> Another embodiment of the PCB <b>85</b> and fuel tank mounting is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, the PCB <b>85</b> is attached to a mounting plate <b>17</b> which can also act as a heat sink. The mounting plate <b>17</b> is then attached a wall of the fuel tank <b>15</b>. The PCB <b>85</b> further includes a connector <b>16</b> that electrically connects the system <b>10</b> to the vehicle electrical system and to the vehicle data bus for purposes of transmitting a fuel level signal. The fuel level signal can be transmitted using a physical (hard-wired) connection or using a wireless connection. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> When the PCB <b>85</b> and coil <b>65</b> are positioned proximate to or inside the tank <b>15</b> as shown, liquid in the tank <b>15</b> will electrically load the series-resonant circuit formed by capacitor <b>60</b>, coil <b>65</b>, and resistor <b>70</b>. Accordingly, when the controller <b>30</b> activates the RF generator <b>35</b>, the coil <b>65</b> is excited by a substantially sinusoidal RF signal at a constant frequency. The loading caused by fuel proximate the coil <b>65</b> will either reduce the Q of the resonant circuit and/or change its resonant frequency. In either case, the voltage measured across the resistor <b>70</b> (or across the internal resistance of the coil <b>65</b>) will vary by an amount that is proportional to a change in fuel level, due to a corresponding change in impedance of the coil <b>65</b>. This change in voltage is converted to a digital signal in the ADC <b>40</b> and processed by the controller <b>30</b> so that a corresponding data output from the PWM/DAC <b>45</b> can be transmitted to a fuel gauge or vehicle central controller (not shown.) </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Other embodiments of the system <b>10</b> can use a parallel resonant circuit with other means of measuring a parameter that represents a change in loading of the resonant circuit caused by changes in fuel level in the tank. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> Preferably, the operating frequency of the RF generator <b>35</b> is adjusted so that it is slightly above the resonant frequency of the series-resonant LCR circuit. As shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the system operating frequency is selected to define a liquid level sensing window on a relatively steep portion of the frequency response curve, thereby providing maximum sensitivity to changes in liquid level. When the printed circuit board <b>85</b> and coil <b>65</b> are placed on a fuel tank <b>15</b>, the series resonant circuit will have a different resonant frequency that varies from tank to tank due to component tolerances, tolerance on tank dimensions, coil dimensions, track width, etc. In order to compensate for these variations, an auto-calibration method is preferably used. In one embodiment of such a method, the controller <b>30</b> includes a calibration module that finds the resonant frequency (fc) of the series-resonant circuit after first power up (or on request), then adjusts the operating frequency of the RF generator <b>35</b> to a frequency (f<b>1</b>) so that the system is operating on the linear slope throughout the entire operating temperature range (&#x2212;40 to +80 C). </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Referring to the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the controller <b>30</b> varies the frequency f of the RF generator <b>35</b> in steps from 0 to 255, where 0 corresponds to the lowest frequency (6.34 MHz) and 255 corresponds to the highest frequency (9.66 MHz). However, use of the system is not restricted to these frequencies. In one embodiment, the lowest frequency is 7.4 MHZ and the highest frequency is 8.3 MHz. For each frequency, the controller <b>30</b> samples the data from ADC <b>40</b> and reads V, the voltage across resistor <b>70</b>. The controller <b>30</b> varies the operating frequency f (sweeping the frequency from low to high or from high to low) in order to find the resonant frequency of the series-resonant circuit. The controller <b>30</b> then adjusts and fixes the frequency f<b>1</b> to a point in a substantially linear section of the frequency response curve. The variation from full to empty tank should be in the substantially linear zone (f<b>1</b> to f<b>2</b>) as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Once the nominal operating frequency of the system <b>10</b> is selected, it can remain fixed for as long as the system <b>10</b> remains in the vehicle. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> Electronic components and systems in motor vehicles will preferably operate properly over a wide range of ambient temperatures. Changes in temperature can induce system output errors. This is shown with raw system data from the ADC <b>40</b> graphed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>(<i>a</i>) and linearized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>(<i>b</i>). In order to compensate for the effects of temperature, the system output is characterized over the entire range of operating temperatures (&#x2212;40 to +80 C) at Empty and Full tank. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows system voltage output as a function of temperature through a full temperature range.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> One embodiment of the system <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, was installed in a test vehicle similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The system coil <b>65</b> was wound and configured as follows: </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> Number of turns=35 </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> Physical Size=50&#xd7;50 mm, Spiral </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> Track width=0.15 mm </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Distance between tracks=0.4 mm (center to center) </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The series-resonant circuit included the following component values: </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> L=68 uH </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> R=33 ohms </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> C=10 pF </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> The ground plane was configured to be 50&#xd7;50 mm and positioned a few centimeters away from coil <b>65</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> had the following dimensions: w=950 mm, l=670 mm, h=210 mm, with a fuel capacity of approximately 80 liters. Note that if the resistance in the series-resonant LCR circuit is provided by the internal resistance of the coil rather than by a discrete resistor, the actual resistance will likely be lower, on the order of 20 ohms or less. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> In a first test, the effects of temperature on system output were measured as follows: The vehicle was driven for 10 minutes then stopped for 20 minutes in order to obtain a fuel level signal (at ADC <b>40</b>) at different temperatures. This test was repeated at three different fuel levels (full, &#xbe; and empty). The test results are shown on the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>(<i>a</i>). As can be seen, the ADC <b>40</b> output vs. temperature varies according to a pattern (oscillating around a line) at all liquid levels. Therefore, to compensate for the temperature, as a first approximation, a simple linearization algorithm was implemented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>(<i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> After the temperature compensation algorithm was programmed into the system controller <b>30</b>, the vehicle was driven for 20 minutes starting from cold (outside temperature=&#x2212;7 C) with an empty tank. The temperature, fuel level, and temperature compensated fuel level signals were recorded as displayed in the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The compensated fuel level ADC <b>40</b> output remains stable around 65 counts (corresponding to an empty tank) when the temperature and the measured fuel level varies. Thus, the temperature compensation algorithm compensates for the changes due to temperature so that the fuel gauge always shows the actual empty level. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In a further test, the vehicle was driven for 230 miles starting with a full tank, stopping at regular intervals (approx. every 30 miles). The temperature, fuel level, and temperature compensated fuel level signals were recorded. The results are shown in FIGS. <b>14</b>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>c</i>). The compensated fuel level signal from ADC <b>40</b> reading varies linearly from 115 to 90 when the temperature and the measured fuel level vary up and down. This demonstrates that the temperature compensation module compensates for the changes due to temperature, so that the fuel gauge always shows the real level. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> The system <b>10</b> of the present invention can also be used to detect variations in the electrical properties associated with different liquids placed into the tank <b>15</b>. For example, if diesel fuel is placed into a fuel tank of a vehicle that runs on gasoline (or vice-versa), this mistake can be detected upon activation of the system. Using a voltage measurement taken across a portion of the series-resonant LCR circuit, it is possible to determine the type or composition of liquid fuel in the tank due to the variation in the electrical properties of the liquid. Using the test set-up of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows system output profiles corresponding to the different fuel types described in the table below when placed in a fuel tank.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> Accordingly, the system <b>10</b> of the present invention can be used as a fuel composition sensor, including detecting fuel type, prior to or in addition to measuring actual fuel level. In flexible fuel vehicles which can operate with different fuel compositions (for example, E85, E10, E20), the engine control systems are preferably informed electronically of the composition of the fuel in the tank so that the necessary engine control adjustments can be made. For example, by comparing actual system output with stored output profiles associated with electrical properties of certain fuel compositions, the system of this invention can provide that functionality (along with fuel level measurement) without the added cost of conventional fuel composition sensors, such as that described in U.S. Pat.
