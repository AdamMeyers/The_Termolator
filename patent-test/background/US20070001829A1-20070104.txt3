A motorcar burglar proof system comprised of a mechanism to lock up the steering wheel, an image retrieve device, and a built in control circuit; an IC chip integrated by the control circuit recording physical features of the genuine driver to compare with the image retrieved so to release the steering wheel if fits; if not, the steering wheel remaining to be locked up, the image being saved, and the alarm being activated to alert the parties concerned to respond in time. 























BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 (a) Field of the Invention 
 The present invention is related to a motorcar burglarproof system mounted to the steering wheel, and more particularly, to one performs physical ID of the driver, locks up the steering wheel, sounds the alarm, and retrieves the image of the burglar in providing an active burglar proof function. 
 (b) Description of the Prior Art 
 Generally, the door lock for a motorcar is the basic equipment to prevent burglar form entering into the motorcar. The shame is that practically all the door locks no matter how advanced and sophisticated, installed by the genuine motor makers can be easily opened up by the burglar; and even they do stop the burglar, the burglar could break up the window and get into the car. This fact alone warrants the installation of a secondary burglarproof system. 
 To keep the motorcar on the road, it takes the running engine and the steering wheel to control the motorcar driving in the correct direction. Therefore, many burglarproof systems generally available in the market are essentially designed to lock up the steering wheel while the motorcar is parked. However, all these systems are limited to a mechanical locking system to restrict the turning of the steering wheel; once the mechanical structure to restrict the steering wheel is tempered, the motorcar could still be easily stolen. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a motorcar burglarproof system essentially comprised of a frame adapted with a locking member to restrict the steering wheel, an image retrieve device, and a control circuit linked to the alarm mounted to the motorcar and integrated with power supply loop, IC chip, image recording unit, digital image process loop, locking member drive loop and alarm drive loop. The IC chip records the physical features of the genuine driver with the data to be compared with that of the image taken by the image retrieve device. If the comparison results fit, the locking member is released from the steering wheel; if not, the steering wheel remains locked, the image taken is filed, and the alarm is activated for the parties concerned to take action. 
 The control circuit may be further integrated with a radio communication module to transmit the image taken by the image retrieve device to the cellular phone of the owner of the motor car and/or to the main frame at a security company to read the image of the burglar and the status of the tempered door of the motorcar for taking the proper response at the first time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 Referring to FIGS. 1 and FIG. 2(A), a preferred embodiment of the present invention is essentially comprised of a frame 10 adapted with a locking member 20 to restrict a steering wheel 70, an image retrieve device 30 (in the form of CCD, CMOS photo-sense device, digital image retrieve device or analog image retrieve device), a control circuit 41 built in the frame 10 integrated with a power supply loop 41, a microprocessor 42, an IC chip 43, an image recording unit 44, a digital image process loop 45, a locking member drive loop 46, an alarm drive loop 47, and a radio communication module 48. The control circuit 40 is further connected to an alarm (not illustrated) mounted to the motorcar. 
 Two motors 50 subject to the control by the locking member drive loop 46 and also integrated with the control circuit 40 are respectively provided on both sides of the frame 10. The locking member 20 is related to a clamping device with its angle changeable by being subject to the revolution of the motor 50 as illustrated in FIG. 3. In use, the frame 10 is fixed to an instrument panel 60 at where close to a steering wheel 70. Before the burglarproof system is activated, the locking member 50 is located with an angle not yet locking up the steering wheel 70. 
 Once the burglarproof system is activated after the owner leaves his motorcar and if the door is opened, the system operates as illustrated in the block chart of FIG. 2(A). The image retrieve device 30 is immediately activated to take the image in the direction of the driver's seat. The image taken is then compared to that of the physical features of the genuine driver recorded in the IC chip 43. If the comparison results fit, the motor is activated to release the locking member 20 from the steering wheel 70 for the motorcar to enter into the normal stand-by status. On the contrary, if the comparison results do not fit, the steering wheel 70 remains to be restricted by the locking member 20 while the image of the person sitting in the driver's seat is recorded and saved in the image recording unit 44 comprised of flash memory, burner and hard disk. Meanwhile, the alarm is activated to notify parties concerned for taking responses in time. 
 An adapter 11 is provided to the frame 10 to be plugged in by another IC chip 43        . The electric circuit of the adapter 11 is linked to the control circuit 40 so to integrate the IC chip 43 and the built-in IC chip 43 with the control circuit 40. The IC ship 43         maintains the data of physical features e.g., pattern of fingerprint, or pupil of the genuine driver or the motorcar owner. Accordingly, once the system is activated, the motor 50 drives the lock member 20 to an angle to restrict the steering wheel 70 as illustrated in FIG. 4. The control circuit 40 and the door opening mechanism are linked to each other so that when the door is opened, the control circuit functions as illustrated in FIG. 2(B). Wherein, the user plugs the IC chip 43         into the adapter 11 to activate the image retriever device 30 to retrieve the image recorded in the direction of the driver's seat and have the image to compare with that of the genuine driver recoded in the built-in IC chip 43. 
 If the results of comparison fit, the motor 50 is activated to release the locking member 20 from the steering wheel 70 for the driver to use his motorcar. On the contrary, when the comparison results do not fit, the locking member 20 maintains its status of restricting the steering wheel 70 and the image of the unauthorized driver is immediately recorded and saved in the image recording unit 44 comprised of flash memory, burner, and hard disk while the alarm is activated to notify parties concerned for taking responses in time. 
 Furthermore, the image taken of the burglar by the image retrieve device 30 is transmitted to the cellular phone of the car owner and/or the main frame of the security company through radio communication for the car owner or the security company to have access to the image of the burglar and the status of the door of the motorcar for coming up with proper response. 
 The present invention may be further incorporated with the audio prompt function to alert the driver to insert the IC chip and approach to the image retrieve device in sequence. The audio prompt function operates on independent power source supplied by a rechargeable battery to prevent from being disabled due to the circuit of the motorcar is damaged. 
 The prevent invention provides an improved mechanism of motorcar burglarproof system, and the application for a utility patent is duly filed accordingly. However, it is to be noted that that the preferred embodiments disclosed in the specification and the accompanying drawings are not limiting the present invention; and that any construction, installation, or characteristics that is same or similar to that of the present invention should fall within the scope of the purposes and claims of the present invention.
