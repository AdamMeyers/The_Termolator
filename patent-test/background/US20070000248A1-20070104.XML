<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Internal combustion engines such as, for example, gasoline engines combust a mixture of air and fuel to produce a power output. The amount of air and fuel and the ratio of air-to-fuel introduced into a combustion chamber of the engine can affect the power output, efficiency, and exhaust emissions of the engine. Typically, the amount of air introduced into the engine and the ratio of air-to-fuel is controlled by a throttle valve mechanism. The throttle valve mechanism selectively restricts the flow of air into the engine to a flow rate that corresponds to a desired ratio of air-to-fuel. However, by restricting the flow of air into the combustion chamber of the engine, the efficiency of the engine may be reduced. In particular, when the throttle valve is in a flow-restricting position, the engine may have to work harder (e.g., expel additional energy) to draw or pump in the same amount of air as compared to when the throttle valve is in a non-restricting position. This additional work output of the engine decreases the efficiency of the engine. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> One attempt to improve the efficiency of an engine has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,888 (the '888 patent) issued to Zimmer et al. on Oct. 24, 2000. The '888 patent describes an engine having a throttle and an electronic turbocharger control system with a wastegate and a bypass valve. The throttle is disposed between a compressor of a turbocharger and an intake manifold to create a pressure differential. The wastegate is disposed between an engine exhaust duct and a turbine of the turbocharger to divert exhaust gases from the turbine to an exhaust discharge duct, thereby decreasing compressor discharge pressure. The bypass valve is disposed between the compressor and the throttle to connect a compressor discharge duct with the engine exhaust discharge duct, thereby relieving pressure in the compressor discharge duct. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> To obtain optimum engine efficiency, the throttle of the '888 patent is maintained in an open position to avoid blocking energy in the form of airflow into the engine. Compressor discharge pressure may be controlled by adjusting a position of the wastegate and the bypass valve. By controlling the compressor discharge pressure, the throttle can be opened to a greater angle, thereby obtaining greater engine efficiency by reducing an exhaust back pressure associated with higher compressor discharger pressures. This increase in throttle angle also reduces energy loss across the throttle, thereby increasing engine efficiency. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Although the system of the '888 patent may increase the efficiency of an engine, it may be complex, expensive, and still lack optimal efficiency. In particular, because the system of the '888 patent requires both a compressor bypass and a wastegate, control of the system may be complicated and component cost of the system substantial. In addition, because the bypass diverts compressed air to the turbine, the energy of the compressed air may either be wasted to the atmosphere via the wastegate, or wastefully directed to driving the turbine for compressing more air. Further, although the wastegate and bypass valve of the electronic turbocharger control system may decrease the amount of restriction associated with the throttle, the throttle of the '888 system is still used throughout the operating range of the engine to inefficiently regulate the flow of air into the engine. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The disclosed air induction system is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In one aspect, the present disclosure is related to an air induction system for an engine. The air induction system includes a compressor operable to compress air directed into the engine, a bypass valve, and a throttle valve. The bypass valve is disposed between the compressor and the engine and has a valve element movable to selectively divert a portion of the flow of the compressed air away from the engine in response to a desired air-to-fuel ratio of the engine. The throttle valve is disposed between the bypass valve and the engine and has a valve element movable to selectively restrict the flow of compressed air into the engine in response to a desired air-to-fuel ratio of the engine. Movements of the valve elements of the bypass and throttle valves are substantially sequential. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of regulating the flow of intake air through an engine.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary disclosed engine <b>10</b> having multiple components that cooperate to produce a power output. In particular, engine <b>10</b> may include an engine block <b>12</b> that defines a plurality of cylinders <b>14</b>, a piston (not shown) slidably disposed within each cylinder <b>14</b>, and a cylinder head (not shown) associated with each cylinder <b>14</b>. It is contemplated that engine <b>10</b> may include additional or different components such as, for example, a valve mechanism associated with each cylinder head, one or more fuel injectors, and other components known in the art. For the purposes of this disclosure, engine <b>10</b> is depicted and described as a four-stroke gasoline engine. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that engine <b>10</b> may embody any other type of internal combustion engine such as, for example, a gaseous fuel-powered engine. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> The piston, cylinder head, and cylinder <b>14</b> may form a combustion chamber <b>15</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, engine <b>10</b> includes six combustion chambers <b>15</b>. However, it is contemplated that engine <b>10</b> may include a greater or lesser number of combustion chambers <b>15</b> and that the combustion chambers <b>15</b> may be disposed in an &#x201c;in-line&#x201d; configuration, a &#x201c;V&#x201d; configuration, or any other suitable configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, engine <b>10</b> may include a plurality of systems that facilitate production of the power output. In particular, engine <b>10</b> may include an air induction system <b>16</b> and an exhaust system <b>18</b>. It is contemplated that engine <b>10</b> may include additional systems such as, for example, a fuel system, a lubrication system, a transmission system, a cooling system, and other such engine systems that are known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Air induction system <b>16</b> may include a means for introducing charged air into combustion chambers <b>15</b> of engine <b>10</b>. For example, air induction system <b>16</b> may include a compressor <b>20</b> in fluid communication with one or more inlet ports <b>22</b> of each cylinder head, an air cooler <b>23</b>, a bypass valve <b>25</b>, a throttle valve <b>24</b>, and a control system <b>26</b>. It is contemplated that additional and/or different components may be included within air induction system <b>16</b> such as, for example, an air cleaner and other means known in the art for introducing charged air into combustion chambers <b>15</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Compressor <b>20</b> may be configured to compress the air flowing into engine <b>10</b> to a predetermined pressure level and to direct the compressed air to inlet ports <b>22</b> via a fluid conduit <b>28</b>. Compressor <b>20</b> may embody a fixed geometry compressor, a variable geometry compressor, or any other type of compressor known in the art. It is contemplated that multiple compressors <b>20</b> may alternatively be included within air induction system <b>16</b> and disposed in a series or parallel relationship, if desired. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Air cooler <b>23</b> may embody an air-to-air heat exchanger or an air-to-liquid heat exchanger in fluid communication with fluid conduit <b>28</b>. Air cooler <b>23</b> may be configured to transfer heat to or from the air compressed by compressors <b>20</b>, prior to the compressed air entering combustion chambers <b>15</b> of engine <b>10</b>. For example, air cooler <b>23</b> may include a tube and shell type heat exchanger, a plate type heat exchanger, or any other type of heat exchanger known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Bypass valve <b>25</b> may be fluidly connected to fluid conduit <b>28</b> at a point upstream of compressor <b>20</b> via a fluid conduit <b>30</b> and at a point down stream of compressor <b>20</b> via a fluid conduit <b>32</b>. Bypass valve <b>25</b> may include a valve element <b>36</b> movable to control the amount of compressed air delivered to combustion chambers <b>15</b>. In particular, valve element <b>36</b> may be movable from a flow blocking position, at which substantially all of the compressed air from compressor <b>20</b> is directed to engine <b>10</b>, against a spring bias toward a flow-passing position, at which a portion of the compressed air from compressor <b>20</b> is diverted from engine <b>10</b> at the point downstream of compressor <b>20</b> to the point upstream of compressor <b>20</b> via fluid conduits <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Bypass valve <b>25</b> may include a butterfly valve element, a spool valve element, a shutter valve element, a check valve element, a diaphragm valve element, a gate valve element, a shuttle valve element, a ball valve element, a globe valve element, or any other type of valve element known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Throttle valve <b>24</b> may be located within fluid conduit <b>28</b> and between compressor <b>20</b> and inlet ports <b>22</b> to control the amount of air delivered to combustion chambers <b>15</b>. Throttle valve <b>24</b> may be positioned at any suitable location within fluid conduit <b>28</b> such as, for example, before or after air cooler <b>23</b>. Throttle valve <b>24</b> may include a valve element <b>38</b> movable from a flow-passing position against a spring bias toward a flow-restricting position. When in the flow-passing position, atmospheric air may be directed into engine <b>10</b> substantially unrestricted. The term restricted, for the purposes of this disclosure, is to be interpreted as at least partially blocked from fluid flow. It is also contemplated that valve element <b>38</b>, when in the flow-restricting position, may be fully blocked from fluid flow. Throttle valve <b>24</b> may include a butterfly valve element, a spool valve element, a shutter valve element, a check valve element, a diaphragm valve element, a gate valve element, a shuttle valve element, a ball valve element, a globe valve element, or any other type of valve element known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Control system <b>26</b> may be configured to affect operation of one or both of throttle and bypass valves <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> in response to one or more input. In particular, control system <b>26</b> may include a controller <b>40</b> that communicates with throttle valve <b>24</b> by way of a communication line <b>42</b>, with bypass valve <b>25</b> by way of a communication line <b>44</b>, and with a sensor <b>46</b> by way of a communication line <b>48</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Controller <b>40</b> may embody a single microprocessor or multiple microprocessors that include a means for controlling an operation of air induction system <b>16</b>. Numerous commercially available microprocessors can be configured to perform the functions of controller <b>40</b>. It should be appreciated that controller <b>40</b> could readily embody a general engine microprocessor capable of controlling numerous engine functions. Controller <b>40</b> may include all the components required to run an application such as, for example, a memory, a secondary storage device, and a processor, such as a central processing unit or any other means known in the art for controlling throttle and bypass valves <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>. Various other known circuits may be associated with controller <b>40</b>, including power supply circuitry, signal-conditioning circuitry, solenoid driver circuitry, communication circuitry, and other appropriate circuitry. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> Controller <b>40</b> may be configured to regulate an actual air flow characteristic of the compressed air directed to combustion chambers <b>15</b> based on a desired air flow characteristic and input from sensor <b>46</b>. In particular, controller <b>40</b> may be configured to receive an indication of a desired air flow characteristic such as, for example, a desired air-to-fuel ratio, a desired air pressure, a desired flow rate, or any other appropriate characteristic. Controller <b>40</b> may be further configured to compare the desired air flow characteristic to the input from sensor <b>46</b> and initiate movement of valve elements <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> in response to the comparison. For example, if an increase in air flow rate, pressure, and/or air-to-fuel ratio is desired, valve element <b>36</b> of bypass valve <b>25</b> may be moved to minimize the amount of air diverted from downstream of compressor <b>20</b> to the point upstream of compressor <b>20</b>. By minimizing the amount of air diverted away from engine <b>10</b>, the flow rate of air directed from compressor <b>20</b> to inlet ports <b>22</b> may increase, resulting in an increased air-to-fuel ratio. Similarly, valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may be moved to a flow-passing position to decrease a restriction on the amount of air directed from compressor <b>20</b> to inlet ports <b>22</b>. Conversely, if a decrease in the air flow, pressure, and/or air-to-fuel ratio is desired, valve element <b>36</b> may be moved to increase the amount of air diverted away from engine <b>10</b>. Likewise, valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may be moved to the flow-restricting position to increase the restriction on the compressed air flow and reduce the flow rate, pressure, and resulting in a decreased air-to-fuel ratio. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Controller <b>40</b> may move valve elements <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> sequentially according to a current loading condition of engine <b>10</b> to accommodate a desired change of the air flow characteristic. Specifically, controller <b>40</b> may operate bypass valve <b>25</b> to control the air flow characteristic of engine <b>10</b> during a high load condition and throttle valve <b>24</b> to control the air flow characteristic of engine <b>10</b> during a low load condition. For example, when engine <b>10</b> is operating at load above about 25% of a rated load (e.g., at a high load) and a decrease in the air flow characteristic is desired, valve element <b>36</b> of bypass valve <b>25</b> may be moved to divert an increased amount of air away from engine <b>10</b> and back into compressor <b>20</b>. At this time, valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may initially remain stationary in the fully open and non-restricting position. As the load on engine <b>10</b> falls below about 25% of the rated load (e.g., to a low load), valve element <b>36</b> may reach the fully open and flow diverting position. In this situation, some portion of the compressed air from compressor <b>20</b> may still be directed to inlet ports <b>22</b> of engine <b>10</b>. In order to further reduce the air flow, pressure, and resulting air-to-fuel ratio after valve element <b>36</b> is in the fully open position, valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may then be moved toward the flow-restricting position. Conversely, when starting from the low load condition, only valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may initially move to increase the flow rate, pressure, and resulting air-to-fuel ratio. After the engine load has increased to about 25% of the rated load, valve element <b>38</b> may be in the fully open position or non-restricting position and movement of valve element <b>36</b> may be initiated to divert compressed air from compressor <b>20</b> back to the inlet of compressor <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Sensor <b>46</b> may embody a monitoring device configured to monitor a characteristic of the compressed air directed from compressor <b>20</b> to engine <b>10</b>. For example, sensor <b>46</b> may embody a flow meter, a pressure sensor, a viscosity sensor, a temperature sensor, or any other appropriate monitoring device. Sensor <b>46</b> may be configured to generate a signal indicative of the monitored characteristic, and to transmit the signal to controller <b>40</b> via communication line <b>48</b>. Sensor <b>46</b> may be in fluid communication with fluid conduit <b>28</b> at any point between compressor <b>20</b> and combustion chambers <b>15</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Exhaust system <b>18</b> may include a means for directing exhaust flow out of engine <b>10</b>. For example, exhaust system <b>18</b> may include a turbine <b>50</b> connected to receive exhaust from engine <b>10</b>. It is contemplated that exhaust system <b>18</b> may include additional and/or different components such as, for example, emission controlling devices such as particulate traps, NOx absorbers, or other catalytic devices, attenuation devices, and other means known in the art for directing exhaust flow out of engine <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Turbine <b>50</b> may be connected to drive compressor <b>20</b>. In particular, as the hot exhaust gases exiting engine <b>10</b> expand against blades (not shown) of turbine <b>50</b>, turbine <b>50</b> may rotate and drive compressor <b>20</b>. It is contemplated that more than one turbine <b>50</b> may alternatively be included within exhaust system <b>18</b> and disposed in a parallel or series relationship, if desired. It is also contemplated that turbine <b>50</b> may be omitted and compressor <b>20</b> driven by engine <b>10</b> mechanically, hydraulically, electrically, or in any other manner known in the art, if desired. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0006">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The disclosed air induction system may be used in any power system where efficient control of an inlet air flow characteristic is desired. In particular, the disclosed system provides a simple, reliable way to control a characteristic of intake air while minimizing inefficient restriction of the incoming air and the associated exhaust backpressure. The operation of air induction system <b>16</b> will now be described. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Atmospheric air may be drawn into air induction system <b>16</b> via compressor <b>20</b> where it may be pressurized to a predetermined level before entering combustion chamber <b>15</b> of engine <b>10</b>. Fuel may be mixed with the pressurized air before or after entering combustion chamber <b>15</b>. This fuel-air mixture may then be combusted by engine <b>10</b> to produce mechanical work and an exhaust flow. The exhaust flow may be directed from engine <b>10</b> to turbine <b>50</b> where the expansion of hot exhaust gases may cause turbine <b>50</b> to rotate, thereby rotating connected compressor <b>20</b> to compress the inlet air. After exiting turbine <b>50</b>, the exhaust gas flow may be directed to the atmosphere. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In response to desired and monitored air flow characteristics, controller <b>40</b> may operate throttle and bypass valves <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> to control the flow rate of the air entering engine <b>10</b>, and the resulting air-to-fuel ratio. As described above, during a high load condition (e.g., a load above about 25% of the rated load), only valve element <b>36</b> of bypass valve <b>25</b> may be moved to change the characteristics of the compressed air directed to engine <b>10</b>. Similarly, during a low load condition (e.g., a load less than about 25% of the rated load), only valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may be moved to change the characteristics of the compressed air directed to engine <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The strategy implemented by controller <b>40</b> to regulate the air flow characteristics of engine <b>10</b> may result in improved efficiency of engine <b>10</b>. In particular, because valve element <b>38</b> of throttle valve <b>24</b> may remain in the non-restricting position for about 75% of the operational range of engine <b>10</b>, the efficiency losses associated with air flow restriction may be minimal as compared to a system that operates a throttle valve throughout a larger portion of the engine's operational range. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The configuration and location of bypass valve <b>25</b> may also increase the efficiency of engine <b>10</b>. Specifically, because bypass valve <b>25</b> diverts air flow to the inlet of compressor <b>20</b> rather than to turbine <b>50</b> or to the atmosphere, pumping losses associated with the unnecessary operation of turbine <b>50</b> and wastegating may be reduced or even eliminated. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed air induction system without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Other embodiments of the air induction system will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the air induction system disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents. </p>
