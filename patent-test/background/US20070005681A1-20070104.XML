<heading level="2" id="h-0001">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP 2005-096699 filed on Mar. 30, 2005, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to a method and system for supporting business system development, and more particularly to a method and system for configuring a business system by searching examples of pre-registered system configurations, work packages and software components and utilizing the searched examples to configure the business system. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A customer business system is developed by arranging system requirements of each customer. In developing a customer business system, neither the whole system is newly created nor the business system is configured by customizing work packages. The business system is developed on the basis of accumulated other business system configuration examples, while positively utilizing the legacy work system resources presently used by a customer. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> As an approach to newly configuring a system by customizing information on design on a reuse assumption, JP-A-2002-358200 discloses a system in which components created on a reuse assumption, such as common basic middlewear and framework of each business, are designed beforehand and the components are properly combined to form software which has a high reuse factor and is easy to be customized. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> JP-A-2002-358200 assumes that system components are accumulated and used on the assumption of reuse of each component. There is a system which aims at an individual work system such as a work package and does not aim at a whole business system (a set of work systems) used by a customer. Design works are not made for linking individual systems after configuring the systems. In order to solve this, the following approach is desired. Namely, customer work systems constituting core competence in a legacy customer system are provided with other work systems from a vendor. The customer work systems and other work systems are add-on customized to satisfy the requirements of a new costumer business network and configure work systems realizing core competence. In this manner, the legacy work systems themselves realizing core competence can be reused. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> It is desired that not only software and components on the reuse assumption are configured but also system components and work packages not on the reuse assumption are combined. In terms of a customer business system creating software components, reuse is assumed only by components of a small granularity. For development of a business system requested by a customer, it is necessary to combine component groups of a small granularity, configure a plurality of work systems and combine the work systems. Therefore, a load on a system engineer increases, including integrity, verification and design documents of reused software components, design of a business system and the like. Furthermore, the legacy work systems presently used and constituting core competence of customer business are not considered, and reused components are used for new core competence so that a load on a system engineer increases. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> An object of the present invention is to provide a business system configuration supporting method and system which applies a legacy business system as customer core competence to a new business system configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In order to achieve the above-described object of the invention, legacy system resources of an order system are analyzed and the analysis information is stored, and system configuration examples already accumulated by an order reception system are stored. According to these information, the structure is adopted searching work systems constituting a business system which satisfies a specification requested by the order system.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention is not limited only to the embodiment. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of the structure of a business system development supporting system according to the embodiment of the invention. This system is constituted of: a legacy customer business resource management unit <b>0100</b> for managing legacy customer business system specification information; a system configuration example management unit <b>0110</b> for managing work packages (ERP packages: Enterprise Resource Planning), and specifications and configuration examples of business software components; and a target system selection apparatus <b>0130</b> for selecting a new costumer business system. A selected new customer business system is stored in a development target system resource (program, execution environment, environment setting information) storage unit <b>0132</b>. The business system is constituted of a plurality of work systems and includes a set of information systems used by an enterprise for performing sales, production, delivery and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> In order to deal with a change in the state of system configuration, normally operating work systems and legacy customer resources are shifted from design information at the time of system configuration, and do not coincide with the design information generated by collecting work specifications at the start of system configuration. Therefore, in the legacy costumer work system resource management unit <b>0100</b>, a legacy work system analysis apparatus <b>0102</b> analyzes legacy customer resources (programs, execution environments, environment setting information) <b>0101</b> operating at a customer to create the specifications of the legacy customer work system. The analyzed results are stored in a legacy work system analysis information storage apparatus <b>0103</b> and managed therein. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In the system configuration example management unit <b>0110</b>, a system configuration example storage information input/output apparatus <b>0111</b> inputs/outputs: work system configuration examples or specifications of work packages executed in the past by system configuration vendors and the like; service specifications and configuration examples provided by an outsourcing company called an application service provider; and specifications and configuration examples of work application components used when a work system is configured. The system configuration example input from the system configuration example storage information input/output apparatus <b>0111</b> is stored in a system configuration example information storage apparatus <b>0112</b>. The work system is an information system used by an enterprise to make business, for example, a sales management system. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The target system selection apparatus <b>0130</b> collects the legacy customer work system specifications stored in the legacy work system analysis information storage apparatus <b>0103</b> and work system configuration examples accumulated by a system configuration vendor and stored in the system configuration example information storage apparatus <b>0112</b>, and outputs the collected specifications and examples to a target system selection input/output apparatus <b>0131</b>. The target system selection input/output apparatus <b>0131</b> transmits business system information and the like selected by a user to the target system selection apparatus <b>0130</b>. In accordance with the received information, the target system selection apparatus <b>0130</b> creates business system configuration information and stores it in the development target system resource storage unit <b>0132</b>. The target system selection apparatus <b>0130</b> links the legacy work system information, system configuration examples and work systems, respectively selected by a user at the target system selection input/output apparatus <b>0131</b>, selects a processing method design example for linking a plurality of work systems, and outputs, as design documents <b>0133</b>, design information for a target development system document creation unit to configure the business system. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating the relation of users of a development system for a content reuse type system of the embodiment. On the side of an order system (customer side) <b>0201</b> for asking system development, modification of the system becomes necessary if the legacy business system or legacy work systems cannot absorb business innovation. Therefore, the order system <b>0201</b> asks an order reception system (developer side) <b>0202</b> receiving system development, about business system configuration. The order reception system <b>0202</b> confirms system requirements of the order system <b>0201</b>, selects work packages and legacy customer work system resources best matching the system requirements of the order system <b>0201</b>, from a work package supply system <b>0203</b>, a service supply system <b>0204</b> for supplying services such as lending an application in time charge, and a software component supply system <b>0205</b>, and supplies the order system <b>0201</b> with the packages and resources as an optimum solution. The optimum solution means a business system satisfying the requirements of a new business system by the order system (customer side) <b>0201</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The work package supply system <b>0203</b> registers business package specifications and goods information in the order system <b>0202</b>. The order system <b>0202</b> refers to the registered specifications and information to select an optimum solution. The service supply system <b>0204</b> registers outsourcing service supply contents such as outsourcing services, user scales, fee systems to be supplied by the service supply system <b>0204</b>, and use example information, in the order system <b>0202</b>. As the service supply system <b>0204</b>, an Application Service Provider (ASP) capable of providing application features via a network can be used. The order system <b>0202</b> searches the registered services and various information to select an optimum solution. The software component supply system <b>0205</b> registers software components and link components (e.g., software for executing file transfer and a component for absorbing a difference between character codes) information for lining systems, in the order system <b>0202</b>. As the software component supply system <b>0205</b>, a System Integrator (SI) can be used. The order system <b>0202</b> searches the registered components and information to select an optimum solution. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a flow of information when the order reception system <b>0202</b> supplies an optimum solution to the order system <b>0201</b> according to the invention. Steps <b>0307</b> to <b>0310</b> illustrate a process of developing a general base solution <b>0306</b>, to be executed by the order reception system <b>0202</b>, and Steps <b>0312</b> to <b>0317</b> illustrate a process of developing a custom solution <b>0311</b>, to be executed by the order reception system <b>0202</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> First, detailed description will be made on the process of creating a base solution <b>0306</b>. The work package supply system <b>0203</b> supplies the order reception system <b>0202</b> with the work package configuration examples and work package specifications (Step <b>0307</b>). Next, the service supply system <b>0204</b> supplies the order reception system <b>0202</b> with the contents of outsourcing services and use examples (Step <b>0308</b>). Next, the software component supply system <b>0305</b> supplies the order reception system <b>0202</b> with software component specifications and configuration example information (Step <b>0309</b>). Lastly, the order reception system <b>0202</b> arranges the system configuration examples and each product specification supplied from the work package supply system <b>0203</b> and the like in a common arrangement frame (Step <b>0310</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Next, detailed description will be made on the process of creating the custom solution <b>0311</b>. The order reception system <b>0202</b> creates the custom solution <b>0311</b> which is a solution (work system group) optimized for a customer, by customizing the legacy work systems and information supplied from the work package supply system <b>0203</b> and the like, in accordance with the system requirements requested by the order system <b>0201</b>, and supplies an optimum solution to the order system <b>0201</b>. Namely, a solution is reduced in practice and supplied as resources when the business system is to be configured. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> In the process of creating the custom solution <b>0311</b>, first the order system <b>0202</b> receives the legacy work system resources from the order system <b>0201</b> (Step <b>0312</b>). The order reception system <b>0202</b> received the legacy work system resources analyzes the resources and presents the analysis results to the order system <b>0201</b> (Step <b>0313</b>). Considering the analysis results, the order system <b>0201</b> selects the resources which are left as legacy customer work system resources (Step <b>0314</b>). More specifically, the order system <b>0201</b> selects work logics which become core competence adopted by the new business system, from the legacy work system analysis results supplied from the order reception system <b>0202</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Next, the order system <b>0201</b> explicitly presents the work logics as core competence and supplies the work logics as a requested specification (Step <b>0315</b>). Namely, the order reception system <b>0202</b> receives from the order system <b>0201</b> the legacy work system resources selected as core competence, requirements to be newly formed, execution environments, an estimated cost and the like. The order reception system <b>0202</b> received the requested specification from the order system <b>0201</b> refers to information stored as the general base solution <b>0306</b>, selects work systems constituted of the legacy work system resources, work packages and the like satisfying the requested specification of the order system <b>0201</b>, and presents custom business system candidates to the order system <b>0201</b> to select the candidate most matching the requested specification (Step <b>0316</b>). The order reception system <b>0202</b> creates several most suitable solutions and presents the solutions to the order system <b>0201</b> to urge selection (Step <b>0317</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating how the development system of the content reuse type system of the embodiment is used. The order system <b>0201</b> supplies the legacy work system resources <b>0406</b> to the order reception system <b>0202</b>. The legacy work system analysis apparatus <b>0102</b> of the order system <b>0202</b> analyzes the supplied legacy custom work system resources <b>0406</b> and stores, as specification information, the analysis results in a legacy work system analysis information storage apparatus <b>0408</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> The system configuration example input/output apparatus <b>0111</b> receives system configuration examples configured in the past by the order reception system <b>0202</b> itself and stores the received information in a system configuration example storage apparatus <b>0410</b>. Similarly, in the work package supply system <b>0203</b>, a configuration example input/output apparatus <b>0420</b> receives work package specifications, and a package specification input/output apparatus <b>0430</b> transmits input specifications to the system configuration example storage apparatus <b>0410</b> of the order reception system <b>0202</b>.
