<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and more particularly to III-nitride semiconductor devices and methods of fabricating III-nitride semiconductor devices. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A III-V semiconductor is a semiconductor material that is composed of a group III element and a group V element. III-V semiconductors are desirable for power applications, but have not been exploited extensively due in part to difficulties in fabrication. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> For example, one commercially desirable III-V semiconductor is III-nitride. Note that as used herein III-nitride semiconductor or GaN-based semiconductor refers to a semiconductor alloy from the InAlGaN system. Examples of alloys from the InAlGaN system include GaN, AlGaN, AlN, InN, InGaN, and InAlGaN. Note that while nitrogen is present in each alloy, the presence and proportion of In, Al, or Ga can be varied to obtain an alloy in the InAlGaN system. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> III-nitride semiconductor devices are desirable for power applications due in large part to the high band gap of III-nitride semiconductor materials. To fabricate a III-nitride semiconductor device at least one III-nitride semiconductor alloy (i.e. an alloy from the InAlGaN system) needs to be formed over a substrate. The three well known substrate materials for III-nitride semiconductor devices are sapphire, SiC and Si. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Silicon substrates are more desirable commercially because of low cost, and high thermal conductivity. However, due to lattice mismatch and differences in the thermal expansion characteristics of III-nitride semiconductor alloys and silicon, thick III-nitride semiconductor layers (e.g. more than 1 micron thick) either crack or cause the silicon wafer to bend. It should be noted that the cracking problem associated with thick III-nitride semiconductor layers is not experienced only when a silicon substrate is used, and thus the problem is not limited to III-nitride semiconductor that is formed on silicon substrates. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> It is an object of the present invention to reduce the stresses due to material incompatibility in the fabrication of a III-nitride semiconductor device in order to prevent cracking or the like mechanical failure. Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to reduce stresses due to material incompatibility when forming a thick (more than one micron) III-nitride semiconductor body on a substrate. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In a process according to the present invention a III-nitride semiconductor growth inhibitor body that is capable of inhibiting the growth of III-nitride semiconductor on the surface thereof is formed in a pattern over a surface of a substrate to define one growth surface or a plurality of growth surfaces on the substrate, and then a III-nitride semiconductor body is grown over the defined growth surface(s). Because the inhibitor body prevents the growth of the III-nitride semiconductor on its surface, the growth of the III-nitride body is limited to the defined growth surface(s). As a result, the dimensions of the growth surface(s) can be selected in order to prevent the cracking of the III-nitride semiconductor due to material incompatibility. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In one embodiment of the present invention, a trench may be formed to extend below the growth surface(s) to define a mesa, and filled with an oxide or the like filler. The trench can further relieve the stress due to material incompatibility. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In yet another embodiment, an amorphous region can be formed below the growth surface(s) in order to further relieve the stress due to material incompatibility. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> A process according to the present invention can be configured for wafer level fabrication. Thus, a III-Nitride growth inhibitor body can be formed over a surface of a wafer, and selectively removed to define a plurality of growth surfaces. The III-nitride semiconductor body can then be grown over each growth surface. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention which refers to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a process according to the present invention a III-Nitride growth inhibitor body <b>10</b> is formed over a surface <b>12</b> of a substrate <b>14</b>. Substrate <b>14</b> is a wafer that is composed of any material capable of having a III-nitride semiconductor body formed thereon such as Si, SiC or Sapphire. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention substrate <b>14</b> is composed of &#x3c;111&#x3e; single crystal of silicon. Furthermore, growth inhibitor body <b>10</b> is composed of a material that does not allow crystal growth by a selected III-nitride semiconductor material on a surface thereof. A preferred material for forming growth inhibitive body <b>10</b> is silicon dioxide, which can be grown by oxidizing surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>14</b> or by depositing an oxide atop surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>14</b>. Another material that may be suitable for forming growth inhibitor body <b>10</b> is Si<sub>3 </sub>N<sub>4</sub>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, growth inhibitor body <b>10</b> is patterned by selectively removing portions thereof from surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>14</b> by etching or the like to define a plurality of cells arranged in a grid. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the grid resembles the appearance of a waffle. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, which shows a single cell in the grid seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, each cell includes III-nitride growth barrier <b>16</b> which surrounds a respective growth surface <b>18</b> and is preferably rectangular, although other geometric shapes are possible. Also, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, growth barrier <b>16</b> rises above the plane of growth surface <b>18</b> to any desired height. The height of growth barrier <b>16</b> can be selected to correspond to the desired thickness of the III-nitride device formed over its respective growth surface <b>18</b>. Preferably, a device formed by a method according to the present invention is one micron or thicker. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In a process according to the present invention a III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> can be grown over growth surface <b>18</b> within the boundaries set by growth barrier <b>16</b>. That is, because growth barrier <b>16</b> is composed of a material that does not allow the growth of a III-nitride semiconductor material on any surface thereof, the III-nitride semiconductor only grows on growth surface <b>18</b>. As a result, the dimensions of III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> can be restricted by the area defined by growth barrier <b>16</b> such that internal stresses due to material incompatibility (lattice mismatch and/or thermal mismatch) can be managed to avoid the cracking of the III-nitride semiconductor. Stated another way, the area of the growth surface <b>18</b> may be defined by growth barrier <b>16</b> to minimize the stresses due to material incompatibility in order to prevent cracking in the III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>. The area of the growth surface may be preferably one millimeter square or more. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a process according to the first embodiment of the present invention, a III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> is formed within the space defined by each growth barrier <b>16</b> over growth surface <b>18</b>. Note that III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> as referred to herein may include one graded or ungraded III-nitride semiconductor layer, or a plurality of III-nitride semiconductor layers having different compositions. That is, III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> as used herein should not be understood to be limited to a single layer of III-nitride semiconductor only. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Specifically, in the preferred embodiment, an interlayer <b>22</b> (or sometimes referred to as buffer layer) is first formed on growth surfaces <b>18</b>, and then a III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> is formed over interlayer <b>22</b>. It should be noted that the material for forming growth barrier <b>16</b> is selected such that it does not allow interlayer <b>22</b> and III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> to grow on any surface thereof. As a result, interlayer <b>22</b> only grows on growth surfaces <b>18</b> and then III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> grows only on interlayer <b>22</b>. It should be noted that after formation III-nitride semiconductor body may include a region of high dislocations <b>24</b> at the outer periphery thereof adjacent growth barrier <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Preferably, interlayer <b>22</b> is a compositionally graded III-nitride semiconductor material from the InAlGaN system such as AlN, AlGaInN or AlGaN. Compositionally graded as referred to herein means that the aluminum content changes along the thickness of interlayer <b>22</b> preferably from an aluminum rich composition, e.g. AlN, adjacent growth surface <b>18</b> to a composition that is essentially free from aluminum, e.g. GaN. Alternatively, interlayer <b>22</b> may include multiple layers of III-nitride semiconductor bodies from the InAlGaN system, each being of a different composition. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> is preferably comprised of GaN, which is more than 1 &#x3bc;m thick and is suitable for power related applications. That is, III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b> is composed of GaN thick enough and configured to serve as a constituent body in a power semiconductor device such as a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), metal insulator semiconductor HEMT (MISHEMT), or the like device. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which like numerals identify like features, in a process according to the second embodiment of the present invention a trench <b>26</b> is formed to extend from growth surface <b>18</b> to a predetermined depth into the body of substrate <b>14</b>. Trench <b>26</b> preferably defines a mesa having growth surface <b>18</b> at the top thereof, and is preferably filled with silicon dioxide <b>28</b> or the like. In a process according to the second embodiment, after trench <b>26</b> is filled, interlayer <b>22</b> is formed on growth surface <b>18</b>. It should be noted that interlayer <b>22</b> laterally extends over silicon dioxide <b>28</b> in trench <b>26</b>, and may also extend to growth barrier <b>16</b>. Interlayer <b>22</b> may include a region of high dislocation density <b>30</b> at the outer periphery thereof adjacent growth barrier <b>16</b>. The remaining steps in a process according to the second embodiment are identical to those of the first embodiment, and thus are not repeated. Trench <b>26</b> allows for further relief of stresses due to material incompatibility, which may in turn prevent the cracking of the III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a process according to the third embodiment of the present invention the crystal structure of the mesa is damaged by ion implantation or the like in order to form amorphous region <b>32</b> therein. Amorphous region <b>32</b> can further reduce the stress caused by material incompatibility and thereby prevent cracking of the III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>. It should be noted that in an alternative process trench <b>28</b> can be eliminated and the crystal structure below growth surface <b>18</b> can be rendered amorphous in order to obtain the desired stress relief. The remaining steps in a process according to the third embodiment are identical to those in the second or the first embodiment (if trench <b>28</b> is omitted), and thus will not be repeated herein for the sake of brevity. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> After forming III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>, further processing can be carried out as desired to form semiconductor devices such as HEMTs in each cell on substrate <b>14</b>. Thus, for example, a layer of AlGaN can be grown over a GaN (when GaN is used to form III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>) to form a heterojunction in a process for fabricating a HEMT. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Thereafter, individual semiconductor device die can be obtained by dicing. Preferably, wafer <b>15</b> can be diced by cutting through growth barriers <b>16</b> to obtain individual singulated die <b>34</b>, which may have barrier <b>16</b> at the outer periphery thereof and a semiconductor device <b>36</b> within barrier <b>16</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Referring, for example, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a device <b>36</b> may include III-nitride semiconductor body <b>20</b>, which may be composed of GaN, and another III-nitride semiconductor body <b>21</b> composed of another semiconductor alloy from the InAlGaN system such as AlGaN formed over semiconductor body <b>20</b> to obtain a III-nitride active heterojunction. Power electrodes, e.g. drain electrode <b>38</b>, and source electrode <b>40</b>, control electrode <b>42</b> of device <b>36</b> are schematically shown as well. Examples of III-nitride based devices that can be fabricated on growth surface <b>18</b> can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,987, and 6,878,593. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims. </p>
