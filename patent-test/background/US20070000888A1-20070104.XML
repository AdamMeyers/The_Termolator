To the tool chuck <b>760</b>, for example a tap <b>762</b> for threaded holes is chucked. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> Piston seals <b>734</b> are attached to the top and bottom of the outer circumference of the piston member <b>730</b>. To the top of the piston member <b>730</b>, a dumper <b>732</b> is also provided. A spring <b>770</b> is further provided between the bottom of the piston member <b>730</b> and the body <b>720</b> to bias the piston member <b>730</b> upward. A dumper <b>774</b> at the lowest end position of the piston member <b>730</b> provides cushioning. A switching valve <b>785</b> is provided at the upper portion of the air motor <b>740</b> to switch between a normal rotation and a reverse rotation of the air circuit. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> The upper surface <b>724</b> of the body <b>720</b> has an opening of an air flow path <b>781</b> for the normal rotation of the air motor which is in communication with an air flow path for clamping rod, and an opening of an air flow path <b>782</b> for the reverse rotation of the air motor which is in communication with an air flow path for unclamping rod in using a laser processing tool. A path to supply an assist gas is connected to the flow path <b>783</b> in the body <b>720</b> for the pressurizing chamber <b>784</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a state in which an assist gas having an adjusted pressure is sent into the pressurizing chamber <b>784</b> through the NC controlled electropneumatic regulator, and the gas causes the piston member <b>730</b> to be lowered against the spring <b>770</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-21</figref>, operations for machining with a machining tool <b>70</b> mounted to the processing head <b>50</b> will be explained. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the processing head <b>50</b> has a configuration similar to that in the description for the laser processing tool, so similar numerals are used to explain similar parts, and the processing head <b>50</b> will not be described or illustrated in detailed below. The processing head <b>50</b> is lowered in the Z axis direction toward a machining tool <b>70</b> which is displaced at a tool change position, and clamps the machining tool <b>70</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, among the air flow paths in the mounting section <b>510</b> of the processing head, the circuit <b>551</b> for clamping the rod having a lens of a laser processing tool, and the circuit <b>552</b> for unclamping the same are used, and the circuit <b>553</b> for lowering the lens is not used. The assist gas flow path <b>554</b> is used to operate a cylinder member <b>730</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, air is supplied from the air source <b>551</b><i>b </i>through the switching valve <b>551</b><i>a </i>to a circuit for clamping <b>551</b>. The air through the circuit <b>781</b> of the machining tool <b>70</b> is sent into an air motor <b>740</b> and the reducer <b>750</b> by switching the switching valve <b>785</b> to rotate the tap <b>762</b> in a normal direction R<sub>1</sub>. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In this state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an assist gas having an adjusted pressure is supplied from an assist gas source <b>554</b><i>b </i>through the NC controlled electropneumatic regulator <b>554</b><i>a </i>into an assist gas circuit <b>554</b>. The assist gas is sent to the pressurizing chamber <b>784</b> to lower the cylinder member <b>730</b> against the spring <b>770</b>. The tap <b>762</b> in a normal rotation contacts a work W<sub>1 </sub>and starts a tapping operation. Once the tapping operation is started, the tap <b>762</b> is threaded into the work W<sub>1 </sub>by its own operation for completion of the tapping. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> After the tapping is completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, air is supplied to an unclamping circuit <b>552</b>. The air switches the switching valve <b>785</b> to rotate the air motor <b>740</b> into a reverse direction R<sub>2</sub>. The tap <b>762</b> rotates in the reverse direction to be out of the work W<sub>1</sub>. Here, the pressure of the assist gas in the pressurizing chamber <b>784</b> is balanced so that no excess thrust is applied to the tap <b>762</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> After the tap <b>762</b> is out of the tapped hole T<sub>1 </sub>of the work W<sub>1</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the assist gas supply to the pressurizing chamber is stopped, and the piston member is raised to the highest position by the action of the spring <b>770</b>, which returns the tap to the initial state. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22B</figref> are the views to illustrate another example according to the present invention. In this example, a tool chuck <b>760</b> of a machining tool <b>70</b> is equipped with a milling or grinding tool <b>764</b> which performs a laser processing for forming a hole H<sub>1 </sub>in a work W<sub>1 </sub>supported on a supporting member K<sub>1</sub>. The dross D<sub>1 </sub>which is produced in the laser processing adheres to the wall of the hole H<sub>1 </sub>and solidifies there, which leads a deterioration in the processing accuracy of the hole H<sub>1</sub>. In this example, the milling or grinding tool <b>764</b> cuts or grinds off the dross D<sub>1 </sub>that adheres to the inside of the hole H<sub>1 </sub>to improve the processing accuracy of the hole H<sub>1</sub>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23B</figref> are the views to illustrate further another example according to the present invention. Some works W<sub>1 </sub>have mirror finished surfaces S<sub>1</sub>. In this case, the laser beam LB is reflected at such a mirror surface, which makes it difficult to perform a laser processing on the surface. In the device according to the present invention, a surface roughing tool such as a surface milling or surface grinding tool <b>766</b> and the like is equipped to the chuck <b>760</b> of the machining tool <b>70</b> to perform roughing to increase the roughness of the mirror surface S<sub>1</sub>. A surface S<sub>s </sub>having a high surface roughness has a low degree of reflectance of the laser beam LB, so a processing such as for a piercing hole PH is easily performed, which improves the efficiency of the laser processing. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> As described above, the present invention increases the types of processings and improves the efficiency of the processings because a laser processing tool and a machining tool can be automatically exchanged and mounted to a laser processing head to perform a laser processing and machining. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> In the above examples, tool change magazines are arranged in a single line in a tool setup station <b>100</b> which is displaced at an end of the bed <b>10</b>. The tool change magazines, however, may be arranged in a plurality of lines or in a matrix at other positions. The tool change magazines may be specially displaced in a plane (for example, the Z axis) which crosses a plane defined by the X axis and the Y axis, in addition to be displaced in the plane defined by the X axis and the Y axis. In addition, it is also possible to place the magazines at appropriate positions where they do not interfere with processing. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Also, in the above examples, a linear motor is used for driving along the X axis and the Y axis. However, the present invention may be applied to a case in which a ball screw is used for driving. </p>
