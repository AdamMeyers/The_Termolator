<heading level="2" id="h-0001">CROSS-REFERENCE RELATED APPLICATION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-192848, filed on Jun. 30, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to a connection structure of an electronic device such as a multi-pin IC (Integrated Circuit) package, and specifically relates to a socket used for connecting to peripheral appliances or external circuits of the electronic device in order to extract signals or supply power and the like, and electronic appliances using such a socket. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Conventionally, an IC package, as an example of electronic devices, has electrical power consumption of about 50 [W] at the maximum. And in order to connect such an IC package to external circuits, an IC socket equipped with a spring probe in a heat-resisting resin has been used. However, due to increased leak current in the IC package or due to the increased amount of current during operation brought by the speeding up of test frequency, when heat generation higher than 100 [W] is performed, heat generation in probes becomes an issue. Furthermore, with the widened data bus width, the ratio of signal pins tend to increase while the ratio of power pins (V/G) tend to decrease, which requires an IC socket that can support a large current. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> By the way, a spring probe disposed in an IC socket includes, for example, a pair of plungers to bring into contact with the electrode pads, and has a tube structure to make electrical connection by providing a spring or the like between each of the plungers and by pressing the plungers to connect to the electrode pads. In the IC socket having such a structure, contact resistance comes with the structure and the contact resistance generates heat. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> With regard to such heat generation in IC sockets, among conventional patent documents, there is one providing a heat sink in which a cooling fan is embedded in an IC socket (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. H10 (1998)-294582 (paragraph No. 0023, FIG. 1, etc.)); and one providing heat insulation and cooling structure of probes (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-241454 (paragraph No. 0030, FIG. 1, etc.)). </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> By the way, since a probe disposed between the electrode pads constitute a current path, contact portions (ohm contact) of plungers and a tube that supports the plungers in the probe are included in the current path, therefore resistance component in the contact portions causes heat generation. In such a structure that has a ball between the plunger and the spring, the contact portions of the ball and the plunger, and the contact portions of the ball and the tube constitute a part of the current path, so that the resistance component in these contact portions cause heat generation as well. Even though parts of the plunger, the tube, or the like are made of good conductive materials, when a current &#x201c;i&#x201d; flows through a contact resistance &#x201c;r&#x201d; existing in the contact portions, a heat &#x201c;i<sup>2</sup>r&#x201d; is generated. Because of this heat generation, restriction is placed on permissible current. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Further, with regard to relationship between the distance of the IC package and the spring probe, and internal resistance, although resistance is small in peripheral portions of the IC package because the distance from the spring probe is short; whereas resistance becomes large in the central portion side of the IC package because the distance from the spring probe is long. Therefore, when a large current flows by the power supply in the IC package, a potential difference arises between the central portions of the package and the spring probe contacting the peripheral portions of the package, which causes a voltage drop. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Therefore, it becomes necessary to secure permissible current as well as to reduce voltage drop in a current path in order to enable a large current flowing in a socket. And in order to secure permissible current, it is necessary to suppress high temperature by enhancing heatsinking of probes. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> None of the above-described patent documents disclose nor suggest such issues at all, and there is no descriptions or suggestions about the solution. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> The first object of the present invention is to suppress heat generation with regard to a socket comprising probes to be connected to an electronic device such as an IC package. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> To be more specific, the first object is to secure maximum permissible current by improving heatsinking. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The second object of the present invention is to reduce voltage drop with regard to a socket comprising probes to be connected to an electronic device such as an IC package. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The third object of the present invention is to provide an electronic appliance using the above-described socket. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Each aspect of the configurations of the present invention in which the above-described issues have been solved will be listed and explained hereinafter. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> To attain the first object, according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a socket having a probe to be connected to an electronic device, comprising a heatsink component disposed adjacent to the probe in order to move heat in the probe to a heatsink area. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> According to this configuration, since the heat in the probe can be moved to the heatsink area through the heatsink component, and with this heat movement, the probe is cooled down by dispersing the heat, which reduces resistance in the probe, and eventually heat generation can be suppressed and maximum current capacity of permissible current can be secured as well. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> To attain the above-described first object, the socket may further comprise an air layer encompassing at least heat-generating portions in the probe. According to this configuration, the heat in the probe is dispersed into air in the air layer and a local overheating in the probe can be prevented. That is, heat density can be lowered. Therefore, current capacity of permissible current can be enhanced as well with this configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> To attain the above-described first object, in the socket, the heatsink component may be extended to the side of the socket such that its end portion forms heatsink fins. According to this configuration, heat movement can be enhanced by heatsinking of the heatsink fins and the probe can be cooled down, which reduces resistance in the probe, and eventually heat generation can be suppressed. Therefore, current capacity of permissible current can be enhanced also with this configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> To attain the above-described second object, according to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided the socket, further comprising a first probe to be connected with pressure between an electrode of signal system in the electronic device and an electrode of signal extraction board corresponding to the signal system; and a second probe to be connected with pressure between an electrode of power system in the electronic device and an electric conductor corresponding to the power system. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> According to this configuration, since the signal system and the power system consist of separate probes, connection distance of the power system can be shortened and direct current resistance in the current path can be reduced, which reduces the potential difference and voltage drop. Therefore, current-carrying capacity of permissible current can be enhanced also with this configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> To attain the above-described third object, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an electronic appliance having a socket to be connected to an electronic device, comprising a signal extraction board corresponding to signal system in the electronic device; a first probe disposed in the socket and connected with pressure between an electrode of signal system in the electronic device and an electrode of the signal extraction board; and a second probe disposed in the socket and connected with pressure between an electrode of power system in the electronic device and an electric conductor corresponding to the power system. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> According to this configuration, since the signal system and the power system consist of separate probes, especially connection distance of the power system can be shortened and direct current resistance in the current path can be reduced, which reduces the potential difference and voltage drop. Therefore, current capacity of permissible current can be enhanced, making it suitable to be used for a test or an electronic appliance using a large amount of current. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> To attain the above-described objects, in the socket, the heatsink area may be cooled down by air or water; the electronic device may be an IC package; the probe may be comprised of a tube and a plunger supported by the tube; a space part formed in a holding component that holds the probe such that the space part constitutes an air layer may be further provided; and the heatsink component may further comprise a space part such that the space part constitutes an air layer. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> To attain the above-described objects, in the electronic appliance, an air fan to supply cooling air to the sidewall of the socket may further be provided; the revolutions per minute of the air fan may be controlled by using a temperature detected by a temperature sensor mounted on an IC package as a control information; and any one of the previously described sockets may be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Features and advantages of the present invention will be listed hereinbelow. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> (1) According to the present invention, heatsinking of a probe can be enhanced and heat generation in the probe can be suppressed as well, thereby current-carrying capacity of permissible current can be enhanced. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> (2) According to the present invention, by providing an air layer, heat density of a probe can be lowered so that heat generation in the probe can be suppressed, and eventually current-carrying capacity of permissible current can be enhanced. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> (3) According to the present invention, by providing a first probe in the signal extraction board corresponding to the signal system in the electronic device and by providing a second probe in the electric conductor corresponding to the power system, connection distance of each system can be further shortened, which reduces the potential difference and eventually voltage drop, leading to the enhancement of current-carrying capacity of permissible current. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> An electronic appliance of the present invention makes it suitable to be used for a test or an electronic appliance using a large amount of current with its increased permissible current. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

In this case, a through hole <b>48</b> is formed in the insulating boards <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> in order to expose the conductive plate <b>42</b>. Therefore, a signal extraction system circuit is constructed between the IC package <b>4</b> and the signal extraction board <b>38</b> via each of the probes <b>32</b>; a power system circuit (grounding circuit) is constructed between the IC package <b>4</b> and the conductive plate <b>40</b> via each of the probes <b>34</b>; and a power system circuit is constructed between the IC package <b>4</b> and the conductive plate <b>42</b> via each of the probes <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> In such configurations, each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is aligned by penetrating the through holes <b>78</b> in probe alignment plates <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, and passes through the air layer AL in the above-described air spaces <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. In the middle portions of each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are produced by passing current, and the heat in these heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> is dispersed into the air layer AL by the air. As a result, temperature of the air in the air layer AL is raised while heat density is reduced in proportion to the heat dispersion from the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. That is, heatsinking and cooling down of the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are achieved and as a result of reduced resistance in the probes, loss of the permissible current in the electronic appliance <b>2</b> having such connection structure can be reduced and its maximum current capacity can be secured. </p>

Further, a part of each of the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> is exposed in the air layer AL. The heat of the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> is absorbed by the corresponding heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, and moves to the heatsink area <b>84</b> side. In that case, the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> also absorb the heat in the air layer AL and move the heat to the heatsink area <b>84</b> side. This heat movement is all the more enhanced by the heatsinking with the cooling air W at the heatsink slit <b>86</b> side. The air temperature in the air layer AL is lowered as well as the heat in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> is moved to the heatsink area <b>84</b>. Therefore, heatsinking and cooling down of the air layer AL and the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be achieved, and with this, the resistance in the probes can be reduced as described above, so that the heat generation can be suppressed and the loss of permissible current in the electronic appliance <b>2</b> can be reduced, and eventually maximum current capacity can be secured. </p>

Therefore, occurrence of voltage difference due to different connection distances of direct current resistance or voltage drop by direct current resistance can be reduced, and increased permissible current can be obtained in proportion to the reduction. In this case, the difference of the connection distance in the power system exists only in the length of the probes, and that difference is just about a difference in the depth length of the through holes <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, so that the difference of resistance in the probes can be ignored, and voltage drop in the probes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be ignored as well. </p>

That is, when the temperature of the IC package <b>4</b> rises, the RPM of each motor <b>171</b> to <b>176</b> is increased in response to the rise; and if cooling down proceeds, then the RPM is reduced. According to such a configuration, heatsinking or cooling down of the socket <b>6</b> is enhanced together with the IC package <b>4</b>, which enables increase of permissible current. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> Next, regarding the first embodiment, technical matters relating to securing of permissible current and reduction of voltage loss are extracted and technical meanings will be explained for each of the technical matters. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> (1) Heat Movement by the Heatsink Plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> Whenever current flows through each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> for many hours, there is always a phenomenon of heat generation in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and the temperature of the generated heat becomes higher as the current becomes larger. Such heat of the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be absorbed in the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> penetrating each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and moved to outside the socket <b>6</b>. And with this heat movement, the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can disperse heat and get cooled down. With this cooling down, the heat generation of each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be suppressed. Although permissible current has been restricted by heat resisting temperature, with such an improved heatsinking capability, along with the suppression of the heat generation, current capacity of permissible current in each socket <b>6</b> can be enhanced. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> (2) Cooling Down by the Heatsink Slit <b>86</b> and by its Cooling Air W </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> The heat of each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is guided to the heatsink slit <b>86</b> via the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and dispersed. The heatsink slit <b>86</b> is forcibly cooled down with the cooling air W produced by the rotation of the air fans <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>95</b>. That is, a temperature slant occurs between the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and the heatsink slit <b>86</b> as a dummy heatsink fin by the medium of the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, and the heatsinking in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are promoted by the cooling down of the heatsink slit <b>86</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> (3) Suppression of Heat Accumulation by the air Layer AL </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> In the peripheral of each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, the common air layer AL is formed by the space parts <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> encompassing the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>; and through the contact of each of the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> with the air, the heat is radiated and dispersed into the air layer AL. Further, since each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is disposed in the common air layer AL, temperature difference of probes among each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is reduced and temperature difference in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> per each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is reduced as well, so that a local heat accumulation as well as uneven distribution of the heat can be prevented. As a result, resistance component in each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> dependent on temperature are ensured to become even. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> Further, the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are exposed in the air layer AL, so that the heat in the air layer AL can also be moved to the heatsink area <b>84</b> by the heatsink plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, and this heat movement contributes to heatsink in the air layer AL. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> (4) Reduction of Voltage Drop by the Probes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and the Conductive Plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> In regard to power supply in the IC package <b>4</b> having multi-pin structure, when a large current is supplied, a potential difference occurs between the probe assigned to the central portions and the probe assigned to the peripheral portions of the package. The reason of this occurrence is because peripheral resistance becomes small whereas inner resistance becomes large. Therefore, in this embodiment, as described above, a configuration is used in which the signal extraction board <b>38</b> constitutes the signal system, whereas the conductive plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> constitutes the power system; the conductive plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are stacked on the signal extraction board <b>38</b>; the probes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are connected to the conductive plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> at the nearest position of the power system in the IC package <b>4</b>. Further, the probes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are set to longer than the probe <b>32</b> in order to penetrate the signal extraction board <b>38</b>; and the probe <b>36</b> is set to longer than the probe <b>34</b> in order to penetrate the signal extraction board <b>38</b> and the conductive plate <b>40</b>. With this configuration, the potential difference between the central portions and the peripheral portions of the socket <b>6</b> can be reduced and each probe resistance is made to become even. Thus permissible current can be prevented from becoming uneven by different power supply points. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> (5) Direct Cooling Down of the IC Package <b>4</b> and Indirect Cooling Down Thereof by Heatsinking in the Socket <b>6</b> </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> Although the IC package <b>4</b> is cooled down by the heatsink <b>16</b> and the cooling air W from the air fans <b>93</b>, <b>96</b>; in addition to these direct cooling down, it can be expected that the IC package <b>4</b> is cooled down indirectly since the socket <b>6</b> is cooled down by the effects described in (1) to (3). </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> (6) Securing of Permissible Current </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> By the above-described cooling down of the socket <b>6</b> according to (1) to (4), temperature of each of the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be controlled to become less than the heatproof temperature of parts in general (for example, about 70&#xb0; C.) and temperature distribution can be maintained to become constant as well, so that loss of permissible current in the probe itself can be suppressed. Eventually maximum permissible current in the socket <b>6</b> and the electronic appliance <b>2</b> can be secured. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> In this way, since maximum permissible current in the socket <b>6</b> and the electronic appliance <b>2</b> can be secured, the electronic appliance <b>2</b> having the socket <b>6</b> can be applied for a test of high heat generating packages or various devices requiring large current. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0007">Second Embodiment </heading>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), three probe alignment plates <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are used to align the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>; however, in this embodiment, four probe alignment plates <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are used to hold and align the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and there is also a laminated layer stacking alternately a plurality of heatsink plates <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, . . . <b>20</b>N as a heatsink component and spacers <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . <b>30</b>N formed of insulating board in the space between these probe alignment plates <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. At the front edge of these heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N and the spacers <b>301</b> to <b>30</b>N, space parts <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> are formed, and as described above, the air layer AL is formed in these space parts <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>. Further, the rear edge of each of the heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N is extended from the rear edge of the spacers <b>301</b> to <b>30</b>N to be disposed at the heatsink area <b>84</b> and the heatsink slit <b>86</b> is formed thereat. To this heatsink slit <b>86</b>, the cooling air W is supplied. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> According to such a configuration, the heat of the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be received at the heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N facing the space parts <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> and then moved to the heatsink area <b>84</b>. In this case, heatsinking from the heatsink slit <b>86</b> is promoted with the cooling air W and the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are cooled down via heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N. Further, the space parts <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> are formed to encompass the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> so that the heat in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be dispersed into the internal air layer AL, which reduces heat density thereof and thus a local overheat can be prevented. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> In this embodiment, although the distance between the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and the heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N that are a heatsink component is set to be equal, this distance can be differentiated in response to the distance from the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. According to such a configuration, without narrowing the capacity of the space parts <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, the heat in the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be effectively guided to the heatsink area <b>84</b> via the heatsink plates <b>201</b> to <b>20</b>N, and thus the heat-generating portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in the probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be cooled down. </p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> In addition, the signal system circuit and the power system circuit can be configured independently, by differentiating the length of these probes <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> such that the probe <b>32</b> corresponds to the signal extraction board <b>38</b> of the socket board <b>8</b> and the IC package <b>4</b>; the probe <b>34</b> corresponds to the conductive plate <b>40</b> of the socket board <b>8</b> and the IC package <b>4</b>; and the probe <b>36</b> corresponds to the conductive plate <b>42</b> of the socket board <b>8</b> and the IC package <b>4</b>. </p>
