<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Sample mini columns are known which can bind an analysis object material in a sample to a substructure within the column by having a funnel for storing sample at the top end of a column, introducing sample into the funnel, and injecting sample into the column by sealing the top part of the funnel and increasing the pressure (for example, refer to WO98/03264). Intemational Laid-Open Patent Publication No. WO98/03264 discloses an auto analyzer that injects a solvent into a column through an inlet nozzle to dissociate an analyte from a substructure by connecting the inlet nozzle to the top end of the column, and introducing the solvent containing the analyte into a detection device through an outlet nozzle connected to the bottom end of the column so as to automatically detect the analyte in order to analyze an analyze analyte material held in a column. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> This auto analyzer is provided with an inlet nozzle and outlet nozzle for each of a plurality of columns. The inlet nozzle is connected to a pump via a rotating valve, and liquid is fed into an object column from the pump via the rotating valve and inlet nozzle by switching the rotating valve. The outlet nozzle is connected to a detecting device through a rotating valve, and liquid is fed to the detecting device from the object column via the outlet nozzle and rotating valve. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In the above auto analyzer with columns, however, a plurality of columns are provided, and the flow paths from the pump to the detection device via the columns are complicated in order to analyze an analyte material held in a different column switching the flow path from a column using rotating valves, such that in order to analyze an analyte material in a different column, the residue of the previous analyte remaining in the complex of flow paths must be washed therefrom. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims, and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In view of this information, the present invention provides a column and sample preparation apparatus and an auto analyzer having simple constructions appropriate for auto analyzers. </p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Liquid Manifold </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top view of the fluid manifold, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional B-B view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in these drawings, the fluid manifold <b>13</b> is formed of vinyl chloride resin, and is provided with a column connecting part <b>21</b> for connecting to the liquid introducing part <b>3</b> of the column <b>1</b>, and a liquid sample receiving part <b>22</b> for receiving a liquid sample. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> The fluid manifold <b>13</b> is provided with an internal flow path <b>23</b>, and at the bottom surface is provided with an electromagnetic valve <b>24</b> that operates between the liquid sample introducing part <b>22</b> and the flow path <b>23</b>, and an electromagnetic valve <b>25</b> that operates between the flow path <b>23</b> and the column connecting part <b>21</b>. The fluid manifold <b>13</b> has a threaded connector hole <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for connecting the connector <b>20</b> to the side surface, and the threaded hole <b>26</b> connects to the flow path <b>23</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow circuit diagram of the sample preparing unit <b>11</b>, and shows the syringe <b>14</b> connected to the fluid manifold <b>13</b> via the connector <b>20</b>. The liquid holding chamber <b>34</b> is connected to the syringe <b>14</b> via an electromagnetic valve <b>33</b> provided on the fluid operating part <b>71</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) described later, and a positive pressure is applied from a positive pressure source <b>35</b> to the liquid holding chamber <b>34</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The method by which the column <b>1</b> is loaded in the fluid manifold <b>13</b> is described below. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a column receiving concavity <b>27</b> is formed on the top surface of the fluid manifold <b>13</b> in order to accommodate the bottom end of the column <b>1</b>, and an O-ring <b>28</b> is fitted on the circumference of the bottom surface while allowing passage through the center of the bottom of the concavity <b>27</b> to the column connecting part <b>21</b>. Attached to the top surface of the fluid manifold <b>13</b> are two pressing plates <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> having L-shaped cross sections are attached in parallel with a gap wider than W and narrower than D therebetween as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and centered on the column receiving concavity <b>27</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The column <b>1</b> is loaded in the column receiving concavity <b>27</b> so that the flange <b>9</b> passes between the pressing plates <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, and rotated 90 degrees in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction. Thus, the D diameter part of the flange <b>9</b> engages the pressing plates <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, and the flange <b>9</b> is attached by the pressing plates <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> via the elasticity of the O-ring <b>28</b>. To remove the column <b>1</b>, the column <b>1</b> is pressed and rotated 90 degrees in either left or right directions. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> When the column <b>1</b> is loaded in the fluid manifold <b>13</b> of the sample preparing unit <b>11</b>, the concavity <b>27</b> of the manifold <b>13</b> is filled with liquid to prevent the introduction of air bubbles, and fluid may overflow depending on the capacity when the tip of the column <b>1</b> is inserted in the concavity <b>27</b>, as described later. In order to prevent this liquid from flowing to the margins, an overflow storage concavity <b>31</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) is formed at the perimeter of the column loading concavity <b>27</b>, and a concavity <b>32</b> which is deeper than the concavity <b>31</b> is provided at part of the concavity <b>31</b>. </p>
