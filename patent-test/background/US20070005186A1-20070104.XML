<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and method is provided for coordinating automated package and bulk dispensing at a remote site. A hopper apparatus includes a series of storage compartments and access doors. The compartments and doors are linked to a PLC that is further linked to an inventory provider. The inventory provider takes product orders from an end-user. The end-user is provided an end-user access code. The inventory provider communicates with the PLC and reserves for the ordered product(s) a vacant storage compartment(s). The inventory provider delivers the product(s) ordered by the end-user to the hopper apparatus. Upon delivery, the inventory provider enters the appropriate end-user access code(s), causing the PLC to open the storage compartment(s) previously reserved by the inventory provider for the products ordered by the end-user. The inventory provider loads the appropriate storage compartment(s) with the end-user product(s). The end-user subsequently picks up product(s) previously ordered by entering in his or her access code(s). </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> An apparatus and method for the self-service, automatic distribution of bulk and package products, including bulk seed, packaged seed, and packaged chemicals to an end-user. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Current systems for distribution of products to end-users typically require dealers and distributors to hand deliver the products to the end-user or use a vending machine, where end-users select the product previously loaded into the vending machine. For delivery directly by a dealer, distributor, or other transferring entity (dealer), end-users must typically take possession of products during the hours that the dealer is open for business. Distribution of bulk and packaged products is done manually. By way of example, for bulk plant seed, a dealer will typically transfer the seed from the dealer's storage container into a grower's container, such as a truck box, seed wagon or seed tender unit. Alternatively, the dealer may transfer its storage container containing the product directly to the grower. The grower then transports the product in the storage container to its end use. Allowing the end-user or grower to carry away the storage containers requires that the dealer stock a large number of often very expensive storage containers. The growers often keep the containers until after the planting season, making them unavailable for further use by the dealer that season. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> To best serve its end-users, dealers will typically pay workers significant overtime to keep a facility open and to deliver products to the end-users before and after hours. This is especially true for dealers of agricultural products. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> A particular storage container used in numerous industries is referred to as a &#x201c;hopper.&#x201d; A hopper is a funnel-shaped container in which materials, including such things as seed, grain, coal, or fuel are stored in readiness for dispensation. Freight trucks and trains often store, transport and dispense materials using hoppers. Hopper dispensing doors or gates are typically flat and are located at the bottom end of the funnel-shaped hopper. A recurring problem occurs during dispensation due to the crusting or bridging of the stored materials at the bottom of the hopper due to gravity compaction of the stored material. Typical unblocking solutions are to use poles, hammers, and other similar tools to manually stir or otherwise break up the blockage. These methods take time and can cause injury to the person trying to unblock the blocked material and can cause harm to the hopper itself. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> To date, there is no apparatus and method that provides for receiving orders for products and subsequently providing an automatic, all-time delivery of the products to the end-user at a remote site. There is also no method or apparatus for automatically dislodging stored material that has compacted and lodged itself at the bottom opening of the hopper. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The present disclosure provides an apparatus and method for self-service, automatic, all-time delivery of products to an end-user at a remote site. The apparatus and method of the disclosure are capable of operating to dispense numerous different types of bulk and packaged products, including, but not limited to, plant seed such as corn and soybean seed, pesticides, oil, hydraulic fluid, gasoline, fertilizer, tires, equipment, parts, and other supplies, wherein such products are delivered to the apparatus of the disclosure according to a specific order by an end-user and stored for pick-up. End-user pick-up of the ordered goods is by self-service and, therefore, can happen any day or time. The end-user enters into a processing device, such as a programmable logic control (PLC) device, the specific end-user access code, whereupon the PLC releases the product from the assigned storage compartment(s) and the end-user takes delivery. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In more detail, the apparatus of the present disclosure is referred to as a &#x201c;hopper apparatus.&#x201d; The hopper apparatus includes a number of different product storage areas, some of which are contiguous with or feed into hoppers. These storage areas are capable of holding large storage containers and products stored in bulk (bulk product), such as plant seed, grain, chemicals, coal, and other materials. The hopper apparatus of the disclosure also includes areas for storing goods that are pre-packaged, such as bagged seed or chemicals that may or may not be stored on pallets. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The hopper apparatus of the disclosure is typically located at a site remote from the entity allowed to provide inventory to the structure, such as a product dealer, distributor, or the like. For present purposes, this entity is referred to as an &#x201c;inventory provider.&#x201d; The hopper apparatus further includes a PLC and a printer linked to the PLC. The PLC, having a user interface, such as a key pad and/or touch screen, is capable of sending to and receiving data from the inventory provider and is further capable of receiving data via the user interface from, and sending data to, an end-user. In one embodiment of the disclosure, an inventory provider receives a product order from an end-user and communicates with the PLC. The PLC indicates to the inventory provider the vacant storage areas. The inventory provider requests the PLC to reserve selected storage areas for particular packaged and/or bulk products to be delivered to an end-user, providing the PLC with a code identifying the particular end-user. The inventory provider subsequently delivers to the hopper apparatus of the disclosure the product(s) and amount ordered by the end-user and inserts the product into the previously reserved storage area(s) of the hopper apparatus. The end-user subsequently receives delivery of the product by entering his code into the PLC. The PLC will inform the end-user which storage compartment(s) or conveyor from which to obtain the product(s). The end-user can only receive product from one compartment at a time, and therefore indicates to the PLC that he or she is ready for delivery of the first product, upon which title to that product automatically passes to the end-user. The PLC releases the product from the assigned storage compartment and the end-user takes delivery. The end-user repeats the process until the product from each storage compartment corresponding to the end-user code is delivered to the end-user. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The hopper apparatus of the disclosure also includes a unique hopper gate also referred to herein as a &#x201c;slide gate.&#x201d; The slide gate, upon sliding to its open position, simultaneously dislodges crusted, bridged, or otherwise blocked material, allowing such material to freely exit the hopper.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In the Figures, the first digit of a reference number refers to the Figure in which it is used, while the remaining two digits of the reference number refer to the same or equivalent parts of embodiment(s) of the present disclosure used throughout the several figures of the drawings. The scaling of the figures does not represent precise dimensions of the various elements illustrated therein. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for self-service, automatic distribution of bulk and package products. In the embodiment described herein, the products ordered, delivered and distributed according to the apparatus and method of the present disclosure are agricultural products, including bulk seed, seed pre-packaged in large containers or bags, and pre-packaged chemicals. Other agricultural products also may be distributed according to the present disclosure, including such things as equipment, hydraulic fluid, and the like. The apparatus and method of the present disclosure may be used for products and distribution systems of other industries. For example, certain aspects of the disclosure may be particularly relevant to the freight truck and train transport industry. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hopper apparatus <b>110</b> of the disclosure provides for automatic all-time delivery of product to an end-user at a remote site. Hopper apparatus <b>110</b> includes a number of different product storage receptacles, including an integral large container/bulk storage receptacle <b>120</b>, referred to hereinafter as the &#x201c;receptacle.&#x201d; Receptacle <b>120</b> accepts container <b>122</b>, such as a center flow container manufactured by Buckhorn Inc. Another container that is compatible with the hopper apparatus of the disclosure is the Q-Bit PLUS&#x2122; container. Receptacle <b>120</b> may also accept similar containers that have off-center bottom openings, such as bottom openings located at a bottom corner of the container. An off-center bottom opening container known to the industry is the Q-Bit&#x2122; container. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows receptacle <b>220</b> and a product package support base comprising two or more container support rails <b>260</b> and two or more floor support rails <b>262</b>. The rails <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> are beveled so that non-packaged bulk product, such as grain, falls into the hopper without collecting on rails <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>. &#x201c;Product package support base&#x201d; refers to a base that bears products residing within a package or packages, such as container <b>220</b>, individual product bags, a pallet of packaged products, or any other form or configuration of packaged product. The product package support base of the disclosure allows receptacle <b>220</b> to be used for bulk storage or for storage of packaged product. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In one embodiment, floor support rails <b>262</b> are positioned so that their top surface is slightly below the top surface of support rails <b>260</b>, allowing such things as pallets (not shown) and containers such as container <b>122</b> to slide on container support rails <b>260</b> without catching on intersecting rails <b>262</b>. Other support bases may be used according to the present disclosure, provided such bases do not encumber loading of material and containers, pallets, and other product packages into receptacle <b>220</b>, are able to hold substantial weight, and allow bulk material to flow unimpeded into hopper <b>116</b> and receptacle <b>220</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The present disclosure also includes a removable floor <b>364</b> having hand holds <b>366</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Removable floor <b>364</b> can be inserted into receptacle <b>320</b> and placed on top of rails <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Removable floor <b>364</b> provides more storage flexibility for the hopper system by allowing users to store bags and packaged items in receptacle <b>320</b>. When removable floor <b>364</b> is not in use, it may be stored and locked on any appropriate unused surface, e.g., receptacle <b>320</b>, or within any available space thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, container <b>422</b> includes an interior funnel hopper-like structure (not shown) featuring smooth sides and a funnel shape, e.g., cone-shaped, for complete emptying without tipping. In one embodiment, container <b>422</b> also includes side exit slide door <b>424</b>, such that when opened the products contained in container <b>422</b> are emptied through the side of container <b>422</b>. Container <b>422</b> also includes bottom exit slide door <b>423</b> as shown in its open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Bottom exit slide door <b>423</b> is opened and closed using a cable and pulley system <b>548</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. An electric, air, or other type powered actuator <b>625</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is operably associated with bottom exit slide door <b>523</b> via clamp <b>527</b> and to programmable logic control (PLC) <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is recognized that it is within the scope of the disclosure to manually open slide door <b>523</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> A source of compressed air (not shown) that serves the air powered actuator <b>625</b> can be connected to an output device (e.g., a hose) so as to provide pressurized air that can be operated by a user (e.g., an inventory provider) to clean out the storage receptacles of the dispensing apparatus before product has been placed in the receptacles by the inventory provider and after product has been removed by the end-user. The pressurized air so provided also can be used by inventory providers and end-users for other purposes related to dispensing product, e.g., increasing air pressure within tires of a transport vehicle after loading large quantities of product onto the transport vehicle. Making pressurized air available to users can increase the desirability of obtaining large quantities of product from the dispensing apparatus. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the cable and pulley system <b>548</b> is operated by means of air cylinder <b>550</b>. Cable and pulley system <b>548</b> includes air cylinder <b>550</b> operably connected to one end of cable <b>552</b>. Cable <b>552</b> is mounted around pulley <b>554</b> which is held within bracket <b>558</b>. The second end of cable <b>552</b> is attached to clamp <b>527</b>, which is secured to exit slide door <b>523</b> by use of bracket <b>558</b>. It is within the scope of the present disclosure to use any known mechanism and system now or hereafter known to open and close slide exit door <b>523</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> According to the present disclosure, door <b>536</b> includes inner and outer panels creating a hollow cavity within. The container opening device <b>548</b> is located within the cavity of door <b>536</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In order to engage the automatic slide door <b>523</b> opener system of the disclosure, clamp <b>527</b> must be secured to slide door <b>523</b> of container <b>522</b>. The individual delivering container <b>522</b> to receptacle <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must close door <b>536</b> and open cavity access door <b>538</b> and side door (not shown) of container <b>522</b>. Keeping slide door <b>523</b> in its closed position, the user secures clamp <b>527</b> to bracket <b>558</b> and slide door <b>523</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> The process of opening exit slide door <b>523</b> is initiated by PLC <b>128</b>, wherein in one embodiment a user ID and password is entered and instructions are provided to PLC <b>128</b> to open a particular exit slide door <b>523</b>, an air compressor (not shown) supplies air pressure to retract air cylinder <b>550</b>. Air cylinder <b>550</b> is in a fully extended position while the slide door <b>523</b> is in its closed position. Upon retraction of air cylinder <b>550</b>, cable <b>552</b> moves in an outward direction pulling slide door <b>523</b> open. Therefore, the present disclosure also includes an automatic mechanism and method for opening slide door <b>523</b> of container <b>522</b>, without having to modify container <b>522</b>, wherein container <b>522</b> may be a standard Q-Bit PLUS&#x2122; or Q-Bit&#x2122; container currently used in the marketplace. However, it is to be understood that various other containers also may be used successfully in the apparatus and method of the present disclosure. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further shows hopper <b>116</b>. Hopper <b>116</b> is positioned below container <b>422</b> and container opening <b>429</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), such that when slide door <b>423</b> is opened, the product in container <b>422</b> falls into hopper <b>116</b>. Hopper <b>116</b> is operably associated with slide gate <b>140</b>. Slide gate <b>140</b> is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 9A</figref>, and <b>9</b>B, and is described in further detail below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when slide gate <b>640</b> is opened, seed released from container <b>622</b> falls through discharge opening of hopper <b>616</b> onto horizontal conveyor <b>614</b>. Horizontal conveyor <b>614</b> is continuous with or otherwise associated with vertical conveyor <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such that seed from container <b>622</b> is conveyed up vertical conveyor <b>112</b> and released to the receiving container of the end-user, such as a truck box, seed wagon, or seed tender unit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, vertical conveyor lift motor <b>113</b> operates to raise and lower vertical conveyor <b>112</b>, it being understood that a manual hand winch can be used in place of lift motor <b>113</b>. Thus, PLC <b>128</b> of hopper apparatus <b>110</b> causes the automatic opening of container <b>422</b> bottom exit door <b>423</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and hopper slide gate <b>640</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) for delivery to the conveyor system comprising, in one embodiment of the disclosure, a horizontal conveyor <b>614</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and vertical conveyor <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along with the end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, integral receptacle <b>120</b> is also designed to hold bulk product. Bulk product is loaded into receptacle <b>120</b> through fill access ports <b>118</b> and <b>718</b>, respectively Each receptacle door, e.g., <b>536</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A and 736</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes a hatch door, e.g., <b>538</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B and 738</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, slide gate <b>640</b> is shown at the bottom of hopper <b>616</b>. Slide gate <b>640</b> is linked to an air, electric or other type powered actuator <b>642</b>. When slide gate <b>640</b> is in its closed position, product is held within hopper <b>616</b>. When slide gate is opened, product is emptied onto horizontal conveyor <b>614</b>, subsequently transferred to vertical conveyor, shown as <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and is ultimately transferred to end-user container (not shown) located under the output end of vertical conveyor <b>112</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Slide gate <b>640</b> of the present disclosure is specially formed to actively discharge material stored in receptacle <b>120</b> or in a container <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Solid bulk products (e.g., grain, seed, pellets, dry distillers grain, flour, milk powder, cement, clay and other non-liquid materials) tend to form a crust at the bottom discharge openings of bulk storage and transportation hoppers. Upon opening of the hopper gates, the gravity compaction of crust prevents the &#x201c;mass flow&#x201d; of product from the hopper. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Similarly, in some types of bulk materials, a densely packed bridge is often formed by settling of small particles, distribution of various particle sizes, moisture absorption, relative humidity, temperature, and vibrations during transport or storage and product cohesiveness. &#x201c;Funnel compaction&#x201d; results in the formation of stagnant compacted material around the sides causing material to flow through a small hole from the top of the hopper through the stagnant compacted material. This hole is referred to the industry as a &#x201c;rat hole.&#x201d; Funnel compaction also prevents the mass flow of material through discharge opening of a hopper. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> A further problem with discharging materials stored in hoppers is that hopper gates are currently flat and formed on a substantially horizontal plane. Thus, even when fully open, stored material remains on top of the horizontal gate and often gets wedged <b>844</b> into the hopper slide gate (male) <b>840</b> and frame (female receptor) <b>816</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> when closed. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As will be described in more detail next, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a slide gate <b>640</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that upon sliding to its open position disturbs crust and funnel compacted material at and around the discharge opening, thereby freeing the product to mass flow through discharge opening to conveyor <b>614</b> below. As such, embodiments of the slide gate <b>640</b> according to the present disclosure are self-cleaning. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A, 9B</figref>, and <b>10</b>, illustrate in more detail embodiments of a hopper door <b>941</b> including a slide gate <b>940</b> and <b>1040</b>, respectively, of the present disclosure. The hopper door <b>941</b> includes a frame <b>976</b>, illustrated with a rectangular geometry, to which a hopper cone (shown as <b>616</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) can be mounted. Embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular rectangular frame geometry provided in this example. The frame <b>976</b> defines an opening above the slide gate <b>940</b> and can include a top member <b>976</b>-A and a bottom member <b>976</b>-B. The slide gate, e.g., <b>940</b>, is disposed between the top member <b>976</b>-A and the bottom member <b>976</b>-B and can travel therebetween, e.g., on roller, bearings, etc., to be retractable between an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). As shown in the embodiments, a set of fingers, e.g., <b>974</b> and <b>1074</b> respectively, project vertically from the slide gate <b>940</b> and <b>1040</b>, respectively, to dislodge material from the hopper, e.g., hopper cone (shown as <b>616</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The set of fingers <b>974</b> and <b>1074</b>, respectively, are located on a leading edge <b>970</b> and <b>1070</b>, respectively, of slide gate <b>940</b> and <b>1040</b>, respectively, and extend upwards from the top of slide gate <b>940</b> and <b>1040</b>, respectively, into hopper discharge opening. Depending on the product stored in hopper <b>116</b> and receptacle <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the type of flow problems, fingers <b>974</b> and <b>1074</b>, respectively, can vary in length, diameter, number, and shape. For example, if the product is slightly damp grain that forms a crust, fingers <b>974</b> may be only a couple of inches long and be still effective in breaking the crust, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> However, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if the product is dry distillers grain that discharges as a &#x201c;funnel flow,&#x201d; fingers <b>1074</b> may be a foot or more in length and shaped like inverted spoons. Fingers <b>1074</b>A and <b>1074</b>B are pointed towards and away, respectively, from leading edge <b>1070</b> of slide gate <b>1040</b>. When slide gate <b>1040</b> is opened, the forward pointing fingers <b>1074</b>-A break through the crust, bridge or funnel compaction releasing the product for mass flow from the proximate interior wall <b>1080</b>-A. Likewise, when slide gate <b>1040</b> is opening, the backward pointing fingers <b>1074</b>-B break the bridge of funnel compaction formed on the opposing interior wall <b>1080</b>-B of hopper <b>1016</b>. The action of opening and closing of slide gate <b>1040</b> allows fingers <b>1074</b> to disrupt the compacted stored materials and allows for mass flow to a waiting conveyor <b>614</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or other material receiving device. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure the slide gate <b>940</b> and <b>1040</b>, having a particular configuration to the set of fingers <b>974</b> and <b>1074</b>, respectively, can be interchangeably replaced with another slide gate having a different particular configuration of the set of fingers, as suited to use with a particular product to be dispensed through the hopper, by opening the hopper door frame <b>976</b>, e.g., disconnecting bolts connecting the top member <b>976</b>-A to the bottom member <b>976</b>-B and placing a different slide gate therebetween. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A, 9B</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b> show that the present disclosure further provides a slide gate <b>940</b>, <b>1040</b>, and <b>1140</b>, respectively, with a downwardly sloped leading edge <b>970</b>, <b>1070</b>, and <b>1170</b>, resp, which may pass between the top member <b>976</b>-A and bottom member <b>976</b>-B of the frame <b>976</b> to seal the hopper discharge opening. The downwardly sloping leading edge, e.g., <b>970</b>, provides the self-cleaning aspect of the present disclosure by allowing stored material to slide downward to conveyor <b>614</b> rather than remaining on top of the slide gate and/or remaining between the gate <b>940</b> and hopper frame <b>976</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The leading edge, e.g., <b>970</b>, of the present disclosure is also bent for structural support. Bent metal, depending on the bend angle, has increased weight-bearing capacity compared to a flat metal structure. The slide gate <b>940</b> of the present disclosure has approximately three times the structural support capacity compared to a flat horizontal hopper gate. Providing a bend in the slide gate provides for two functions: self-cleaning and increased strength. </p>

Product slide <b>1282</b> is located directly below port <b>1218</b> and having one end attached to the upper portion of receptacle <b>1220</b> and a lower end attached to the lower end of receptacle <b>1220</b>, thereby forming a slide. The slide catches bulk material being poured into port <b>1218</b> and gently slides the material, such as seed, into hopper <b>1216</b> and receptacle <b>1220</b>, thereby preventing the material from physical damage. Product slide <b>1282</b> may be made out of standard conveyor or other materials and is attached to container by appropriate means known to those skilled in the art. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, product slide <b>1282</b> is attached to receptacle <b>1220</b> by chain and link. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows locker <b>126</b>, wherein packaged products (e.g., bags containing seed, chemical, fertilizer, etc.) ordered from an inventory provider are stored for pick up according to the method of the disclosure. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows one embodiment of the hopper apparatus <b>110</b> having rows of paired receptacles. Any number of receptacles of different shapes and sizes and in numerous physical arrangements are within the scope of this disclosure. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> In general, the method of the disclosure provides a unique system for end-users to order products from an inventory provider and self-service pick up of those products at a site remote from the inventory provider at any time of the day and week. In practice, an end-user calls an inventory provider with an order. The end-user is provided with an end-user access code. An end-user broadly means any person that orders product(s) from an inventory provider. The inventory provider can communicate with PLC <b>128</b> of the hopper apparatus <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the disclosure. Communication is facilitated by any communication means now or hereafter known. For example, communication devices and systems can include land or mobile telephones and systems, computers, and/or the internet. The inventory provider calls PLC <b>128</b> to check the vacant container capacity of hopper apparatus <b>110</b>. PLC <b>128</b> determines the status of its various storage container units (i.e., receptacles <b>120</b>, lockers <b>126</b>, and pallet lockers <b>132</b>) and provides that information to the inventory provider. Collection, storage, and communication of data can be accomplished in numerous ways known by those persons skilled in the art. For example, in one embodiment of the disclosure, PLC <b>128</b> and inventory provider may link with a website containing data relating to hopper apparatus <b>110</b>, end-user, and product information. The inventory provider can then reserve various hopper apparatus <b>110</b> storage container units for subsequent delivery of product ordered by an end-user. It is understood that more than one inventory provider may have use of and access to the hopper apparatus and method of the disclosure. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The inventory provider then arranges for the product ordered by the end-user to be delivered via delivery truck or other vehicle to the hopper apparatus <b>110</b>. The hopper apparatus <b>110</b> is typically located at a remote site, closer to the activity of the product end-users. However, it is within the scope of the disclosure that it can be located at the inventory provider site, such that end-users can obtain product at that site outside of business hours. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> Upon arrival at the hopper apparatus, a person with knowledge of the end-user code will typically interact with the PLC <b>128</b> by entering the previously assigned end-user codes, which will cause the receptacles <b>120</b>, lockers <b>126</b>, and pallet lockers <b>132</b> that were previously reserved by the inventory provider for the particular end-user order to open for insertion of the bulk products and product packages. By requiring the inventory provider to enter the end-user code, a cross-check is integrated into the method of the disclosure, whereby the cross-check insures that correct products get into the correct compartments, which insures that the end-users obtain the correct products when they enter in their end-user code. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> For delivery of bulk seed to receptacle <b>120</b>, the person opens ports <b>118</b> and inputs the product into receptacle <b>120</b>. It is contemplated that the hopper apparatus of the disclosure also can be located adjacent a large fixed seed storage bin, such as a TruBulk&#x2122; bulk delivery system (Syngenta Seeds, Inc.). Transfer of seed ordered by an end-user to hopper apparatus <b>110</b> can be implemented by a seed delivery conduit removably interconnecting the TruBulk&#x2122; bulk delivery system and fill access port <b>118</b> of hopper apparatus <b>110</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> For insertion of a large container <b>122</b> into receptacle <b>120</b>, door <b>736</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is opened. Typically, a forklift is needed to insert large container <b>122</b> into receptacle <b>120</b>. The end-user access code corresponding to the particular receptacle <b>120</b>, lockers <b>126</b>, and pallet lockers <b>132</b> that contains the end-user product is entered into the PLC <b>128</b>. The entry of the end-user code can be input into the PLC <b>128</b> at any time after the inventory provider receives the order. The inventory provider must engage the bottom exit door <b>523</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to clamp <b>527</b> by manually unlocking safety latch <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and hooking clamp <b>527</b> to bottom exit door <b>423</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> To determine if the product(s) that the end-user has ordered is stored in the hopper apparatus, the end-user communicates with the PLC <b>128</b> via internet, phones, the web, or other means and enters his or her access code. Upon receiving the access code, the PLC <b>128</b> will indicate to the user whether delivery has occurred. According to the disclosure, the end-user can determine product delivery status any day and time. Furthermore, the end-user can take delivery of the product contained from hopper apparatus <b>110</b> any day and time. The hopper apparatus <b>110</b> of the disclosure is self-service for the end-user and automatic, not needing anyone representing the inventory provider to be present during transfer of the products to the end-user. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Upon arriving at the hopper apparatus <b>110</b>, the end-user enters his or her access code into the PLC <b>128</b>. The PLC will communicate to end-user where the products are stored within the hopper apparatus <b>110</b>. For example:

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> Referring to Table 1, the end-user selects one product for delivery, for example bulk hybrid seed <b>5432</b>, wherein the PLC <b>128</b> will ask if truck box, seed wagon, seed tender unit, or other receiving container is in its proper place under the output end of conveyor <b>112</b>. When the end-user indicates that the truck is in place, the PLC <b>128</b> will indicate to the appropriate actuator(s) to open the respective sliding doors, wherein the <b>90</b> units of hybrid seed <b>5432</b> within Compartment A is conveyed to the waiting container. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> However, prior to delivery, the grower may be required to accept all legal disclaimers for the particular product as indicated by the PLC <b>128</b>. Furthermore, it is within the scope of the present disclosure to require that end-user agree to contract terms. For example, in the agriculture industry, PLC <b>128</b> would provide contract language that the end-user must accept, requiring the end-user to abide by certain Integrated Resistance Management practices. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Again referring to Table 1, the end-user repeats the process for the hybrid seed <b>7654</b>, also stored in bulk within hopper apparatus <b>110</b>. As already described above, bulk product is stored freely within receptacle <b>120</b> or within large container <b>122</b> residing in receptacle <b>120</b>. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, storage capacity of produce stored freely within receptacle <b>120</b> is larger than the storage capacity of large container <b>122</b> residing within receptacle <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> The PLC <b>128</b> includes a screen and input device such as a key pad (not shown) for display and input of information. It is also within the scope of the disclosure to allow end-user access to the hopper apparatus <b>110</b> by using a credit card or other card that identifies the end-user. Once the end-user has agreed to the terms of the purchase, the end-user indicates to the PLC <b>128</b> that the truck is in place, and ownership of the product immediately passes from the inventory provider to the end-user. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> By way of example, if the product selected is contained in container <b>122</b> or directly in receptacle <b>120</b>, the PLC <b>128</b> causes the conveyor to start and the actuator(s) to open the respective slide doors <b>423</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and/or <b>940</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). The PLC <b>128</b> runs the conveyors until a flow sensor (not shown) tells the PLC <b>128</b> that receptacle <b>120</b> is empty. Once the sensors indicate that the receptacle <b>120</b> is clear of the product, the PLC <b>128</b> sends a signal causing the respective slide doors <b>423</b> and/or <b>940</b> to close. The conveyor belts <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are run, however, an extra time to ensure complete exit of the product, after which they are stopped. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> As product enters conveyor belt <b>112</b>, application of another product (e.g., inoculants, fertilizer, pesticides, emulsifiers, coatings, treatments, etc.) can be applied to the product before exiting into the end-users receptacle. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> To continue transferring end-user products identified in Table 1, the end-user selects hybrid seed <b>3210</b> (50 bags). The 50 bags contained in Compartment C would likely be stored in a pallet locker <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The PLC <b>128</b> will ask if the end-user is ready to take delivery of the pallet. When the end-user indicates that he or she is ready to take delivery, the PLC <b>128</b> will instruct the appropriate actuator to unlock the appropriate pallet locker <b>132</b> door, wherein the end-user removes the pallet, typically by a forklift, for loading of a truck box or other receiving container. End-user continues transferring the products contained in Compartments D and E. The packaged products contained in Compartments D and E would be stored in package lockers <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). To unload package Hybrid Seed <b>4321</b> and Chemical <b>8921</b> from package lockers <b>126</b>, end-user simply repeats the steps used to transfer the products contained in Compartment C. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> End-user still needs to take delivery of the remaining articles. For delivery of bulk articles contained freely within receptacle <b>120</b> or in container <b>122</b>, end-user follows the method already describe above. For packaged items that are stored in a locker <b>126</b>, end-user again enters in his or her access code, which may be a different access code for each compartment accessed by the end-user, accepts all legal disclaimers, contract terms, etc. Referring to the example products listed in Table 1, the end-user selects Hybrid Seed <b>4321</b> Bags indicator on the PLC <b>128</b>. Once the end-user selects the product, ownership passes from the inventory provider to the end-user. The PLC <b>128</b> then causes the locker door to unlock. The end-user removes the packages from the locker and loads them into a vehicle. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Once the end-user removes the products he or she previously ordered, the end-user indicates to the PLC <b>128</b> that the transaction is complete. The PLC <b>128</b> will cause a receipt to be printed out. The end-user can also request additional information to be printed out, for example, product specifications, relevant federal and state regulations, and instructions. As is understood in the art, any type of information can be input and stored in the PLC <b>128</b> and printed out for the benefit of the end-user. It is recognized that the PLC <b>128</b> can function as an information center, wherein local news, industry events, special sales, weather, etc., are provided to the end-user. For example, PLC <b>128</b> may provide the end-user with current grain commodity prices. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> It is customary for end-users to produce products (e.g., grain) from the original product (e.g., seed) dispensed from the disclosure apparatus. This disclosure can be used to reverse the transaction, wherein the end-user is given an access code to load product (e.g., grain) into container <b>122</b> or in receptacle <b>120</b>. The originating inventory provider (dealer), or designee, can receive products from the end-user by being dispensed by belt conveyor <b>112</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> The foregoing disclosure has been described in detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding. However, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the disclosure, as limited only by the scope of the appended claims. </p>
