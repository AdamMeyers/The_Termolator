<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 58916/2005 filed in Korea on Jun. 30, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) device and, more particularly, to an LCD device and a fabrication method thereof. Although the present invention is suitable for a wide scope of applications, it is particularly suitable for improving a residual image level of an LCD device. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In general, the LCD device is a display device in which data signals corresponding to image information is supplied to a matrix of pixels. The data signals control optical transmittance of the pixels so as to display images. The LCD device includes a liquid crystal display panel in which the pixels are arranged in a matrix and a driving part for driving the pixels. The liquid crystal display panel includes an array substrate on which a thin film transistor (TFT) array is formed and a color filter substrate on which color filters are formed. The TFT array substrate and the color filter array substrate are attached to each other with a uniform cell gap maintained therebetween with a liquid crystal layer positioned within the cell gap. The array substrate and the color filter substrate are attached by a seal pattern formed along an outer edge of a pixel part. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Alignment films are formed on surfaces of the array substrate and the color filter substrate that face each other. The alignment films are rubbed to make liquid crystals be arranged in a predetermined direction. A polarization film and a retardation film are provided on each outer surface of the TFT array substrate and the color filter substrate. By selectively constructing a plurality of components, a liquid crystal display panel can have high luminance and good contrast characteristics by changing the direction and/or refracting the proceeding light. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of a related art LCD device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the LCD device includes a pixel part <b>35</b> having pixels arranged in a matrix for displaying an image, a gate pad part <b>31</b> electrically connected with the gate lines <b>16</b> of the pixel part <b>35</b>, and a data pad part <b>32</b> electrically connected with the data lines <b>17</b> of the pixel part <b>35</b>. The gate pad part <b>31</b> and the data pad part <b>32</b> are formed at an edge portion of the array substrate <b>10</b>, which is not overlapped by a color filter substrate <b>5</b>. The gate pad part <b>31</b> supplies a scan signal from the gate driving unit (not shown) to the gate lines <b>16</b> of the pixel part <b>35</b>, and the data pad part <b>32</b> supplies image information from the data driving unit (not shown) to the data lines <b>17</b> of the pixel part <b>35</b>. The data lines <b>17</b> and the gate lines <b>16</b> are arranged to cross each other on the array substrate <b>10</b> to define pixel regions. A thin film transistor (not shown) and pixel electrodes (not shown) are provided in the pixel regions defined by the data lines <b>17</b> and the gate lines. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, color filters for each of the pixels are separated by a black matrix. Further, a common electrode, which is a counter electrode of the pixel electrode formed on the array substrate <b>10</b>, is formed on the color filter substrate <b>5</b>. A certain cell gap is maintained between the color filter substrate <b>10</b> and the array substrate <b>5</b> by spacers (not shown), and the color filter substrate <b>10</b> and the array substrate <b>5</b> are attached by a seal pattern <b>50</b> formed along an outer edge of the pixel part <b>35</b>. In such an LCD device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in general, parasitic capacitance (Cgd) is generated where the gate electrode and the source electrode overlap and/or where the gate electrode and the drain electrode of the TFT overlap. This parasitic capacitance causes a change in a voltage by an amount equaling &#x394;Vp, which is called a level shift voltage or a kickback voltage. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The capacity of liquid crystal to maintain proper orientation degrade when a DC voltage is applied across liquid crystal in one direction for a long time. Accordingly, when liquid crystal is driven, the polarity of an applied voltage must be periodically changed. Due to the kickback voltage, a DC component from the parasitic component remains that causes bad effects, such as flickering, residual screen images and non-uniform screen brightness. Each of the TFTs in the pixel regions have a different kickback voltage depending on their positions in the panel. Thus, because the amount of the DC component remaining in the panel is different across the panel, a non-uniform residual image is generated. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing variation values of common voltages according to each position on the panel as simulated by a computer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, points indicated by a diamond shape and square shape show variation values of common voltages according to each position on the panel from a computer simulation while points indicated by a triangular shape show an average value of the simulation results. The X axis in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> indicates a relative position on the panel and the Y axis indicates the size of each common voltage. In other words, the left side of the X axis refers to the left side on the panel based on the center of the panel while the right side of X axis refers to the right side on the panel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the size of each common voltage is not consistent across the panel. More particularly, the common voltages differ depending on the position in the panel along the horizontal direction of the panel. Since the amount of the accumulated DC component is different depending on position in the panel, a non-uniform residual image (ghost) is created across the entire panel, which cannot be resolved by the existing method of uniformly compensating the common voltages across the panel. </p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> A liquid crystal display (LCD) device and its fabrication method in accordance with embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of one pixel, including a thin film transistor (TFT), on an array substrate in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Although an actual LCD device includes N&#xd7;M number of pixels defined by N number of gate lines and M number of data lines, which cross each other, only one pixel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for the sake of explanation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the array substrate <b>110</b> includes a gate line <b>116</b> and a data line <b>117</b> arranged horizontally and vertically thereon and defining a pixel region. A TFT <b>120</b>, a switching device, is formed adjacent to the crossing of the gate line <b>116</b> and the data line <b>117</b>. A pixel electrode <b>118</b> is formed in the pixel region. The pixel electrode is connected to the TFT <b>120</b> so as to drive liquid crystal (not shown) together with a common electrode of a color filter substrate (not shown). </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the TFT <b>120</b> includes a gate electrode <b>121</b> connected to the gate line <b>116</b>, a source electrode <b>122</b> connected to the data line <b>117</b> and a drain electrode <b>123</b> connected to the pixel electrode <b>118</b>. Although a TFT <b>120</b> with a U-shaped channel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. Embodiments of the present invention can be used in all types of TFTs of the pixel part for an LCD device, regardless of the shape of the channels in the TFTs. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The TFT <b>120</b> further includes a first insulation film (not shown) for insulating the gate electrode <b>121</b>, source/drain electrodes <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>, and an active layer (not shown) for forming a conductive channel between the source electrode <b>122</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> in response to a gate voltage supplied to the gate electrode <b>121</b>. A portion of the source electrode <b>122</b> extends in one direction to form a portion of the data line <b>117</b>. A portion of the drain electrode <b>123</b> is electrically connected through a contact hole <b>140</b> formed in a second insulation film (not shown) to the pixel electrode <b>118</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> A compensation pattern <b>150</b> for compensating the amount of kickback voltages, which are different according to position on a panel, can be formed at the sides of the drain electrode <b>123</b> in TFTs of the pixel part for an LCD device so as to change parasitic capacitance of the TFTs. As stated above, in the TFT <b>120</b>, parasitic capacitance (Cgd) is generated where the gate electrode <b>121</b> and the source electrode <b>122</b> overlap and where the gate electrode <b>121</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> overlap, so a pixel voltage is changed by the amount equaling the kickback voltage (&#x394;Vp) due to the parasitic capacitance (Cgd). The kickback voltage can be expressed by the following equation: 
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>Vp=Cgd&#xd7;&#x394;Vg/{Cgd+Clc+Cst}</i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
 wherein Clc is capacitance of a liquid crystal capacitor, Cst is capacitance of a storage capacitor, and &#x394;Vg is a difference between a high gate voltage and a low gate voltage. 
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The kickback voltage is calculated based on the variables of Cgd, Clc, Cst and &#x394;Vg. If the size of the parasitic capacitance Cgd can be controlled, the kickback voltage &#x394;Vp can be controlled to have values from &#x2018;0&#x2019; to &#x394;Vg. Thus, the kickback voltage &#x394;Vp of each pixel can be individually controlled by changing the size of the parasitic capacitance (Cgd) at each pixel so as to create the same the kickback voltage &#x394;Vp across the panel. In embodiments of the present invention, the size of the parasitic capacitance in each pixel according to position of the panel is controlled by the compensation pattern formed at the side or sides of the one of or both the drain electrode and the source electrode. More specifically, the compensation pattern has an appropriate size so as to achieve a desired parasitic capacitance in that pixel. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are enlarged plan views showing TFTs formed at different positions on the panel. For the sake of explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a first TFT formed at a first position while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a second TFT formed at a second position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the TFTs include the gate electrode <b>121</b> connected to the gate line, the source electrode <b>122</b> connected to the data line, and the drain electrode <b>123</b> connected to the pixel electrode. In addition, the TFTs also include the first insulation film (not shown) for insulating the gate electrode <b>121</b> and the source/drain electrodes <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>, and an active layer for forming the conductive channel (not shown) between the source electrode <b>122</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> in response to a gate voltage supplied to the gate electrode <b>121</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The first TFT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> has the same structure as the second TFT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> except for that the gate electrode <b>121</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> overlaps larger area of compensation patterns <b>150</b>A than the area of compensation patterns <b>150</b>B overlapped by the gate electrode <b>121</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. More particularly, the first TFT at the first position includes the first compensation pattern <b>150</b>A having a region &#x2018;A&#x2019; overlapped by the gate electrode <b>121</b> and the second TFT at the second position includes the second compensation pattern <b>150</b>B having a region &#x2018;B&#x2019; overlapped by the gate electrode <b>121</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> A situation where the value of the kickback voltage at the first position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is smaller than at the second position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> when the compensation patterns <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B are not formed will now be discussed as an example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, if the region &#x2018;A&#x2019; of the first compensation pattern <b>150</b>A overlapped by the gate electrode <b>121</b> is designed to be greater than the region &#x2018;B&#x2019; of the second compensation pattern <b>150</b>B overlapped by the gate electrode <b>121</b>, the parasitic capacitance the first TFT is increased more than the increase in the parasitic capacitance of the second TFT. Accordingly, a value of the compensated kickback voltage at the first TFT at the first position is greater than a value of the compensated kickback voltage of the second TFT at the second position. Thus, the difference of kickback voltage between the first and second regions can be compensated to make the values of the overall kickback voltages, including both actual and compensated kickback voltages, at the first and second positions to be about the same. Further, the overall kickback voltages, which are about the same for the first and second positions, can be about the same as the kickback voltage at a third position at which a third TFT does not contain a compensation pattern. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> The method for compensating the kickback voltage with respect to two or three positions are examples that the present invention is not limited thereto. Embodiments of the present invention can be applied to many TFTs at many positions to compensate kickback voltages with different parasitic capacitances so as the same overall kickback voltages across a panel. The compensation patterns <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B can be formed of the same conductive material as that of the source electrode <b>122</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> when the source electrode <b>122</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> are formed, or can be formed of a different conductive material. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4</figref><i>b </i>show compensation patterns <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B formed at both sides of the drain electrode <b>123</b>, embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. The compensation pattern can be formed at only one side of the drain electrode <b>123</b>. Further, instead of separately forming the compensation pattern <b>150</b> at a side or sides of the drain electrode, the compensation pattern <b>150</b> can be integrally formed with the drain electrode <b>123</b>. In other words, embodiments of the present invention can be applied to a case where the overlap of the drain electrode <b>123</b> by the lower gate electrode <b>121</b> is controlled by varying the width of the drain electrode <b>123</b>. In addition or in the alternative, compensation patterns can be formed at the side or sides of the source electrode <b>121</b> in the TFTs. </p>

More particularly, the square-shaped points indicate variation values of common voltages according to each position on a panel before kickback voltages are compensated according to a computer simulation, triangular-shaped points indicate variation values of common voltages according to each position on the panel after the kickback voltages are compensated, and diamond-shaped points indicate the size of compensating parasitic capacitances used for compensating the kickback voltages according to each position on the panel. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, before the kickback voltages are compensated, the common voltages are not uniform across the panel. However, after the kickback voltages are compensated by forming the compensation pattern as described above, substantially the same common voltage can be obtained across the panel. The X axis in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates a relative position on the panel and the Y axis indicates the size of each common voltage. In other words, the left side of the X axis refers to the left side on the panel based on the center of the panel while the right side of X axis refers to the right side on the panel. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that the center of the panel has the highest common voltage and the size of the common voltage decreases as it goes from the center to the left and right sides. Before the kickback voltages are compensated, each of the common voltages with respect to position are different across the horizontal direction of the panel, which indicates that a different amount of DC components are accumulating at different positions on the panel. As a result, before the kickback voltages are compensated, non-uniform residual images are created on the entire panel. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> The common voltage and the kickback voltage have substantially linear relationship, so that when signal voltages of the opposite positive and negative polarity are inputted sequentially, the kickback voltage can be obtained by subtracting the size of the common voltage from a central value of the signal voltages. In this manner, in the case where the center of the panel has the common voltage of greater size than that of the left and right portions of the panel, a compensation pattern is designed such that larger parasitic capacitance is formed at the center of the panel with compensation patterns than at the left and right portions of the panel. Accordingly, the uniform kickback voltage can be obtained across the entire panel and thus flickering a local residual image can be prevented. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variation can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </p>
