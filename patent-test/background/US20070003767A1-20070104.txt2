CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 
 This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C.       119 from German Patent Application No. 10 2005 029 146.5, filed Jun. 23, 2005. 
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT 
 The subject matter of this application does not concern federally sponsored research or development. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Technical Field 
 This invention relates to coating compositions with relatively little tendency towards shrinkage. These coating compositions are obtainable by reaction of epoxy resins and special hardeners according to the invention, these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of epoxidized polyalkylene oxide, an epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compound and an aromatic hydroxy compound to form a first intermediate product, subsequently reacting this intermediate product with a polyamine to form a second intermediate product and, finally, reacting the second intermediate product with special Lewis acids. 
 2. Background Art 
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,405 describes hardeners for epoxy resins. These hardeners are produced as follows: a first intermediate compound, a diepoxy compound (a) obtainable by reaction of diglycidyl ethers of dibasic phenols, diglycidyl ethers of aliphatic dihydroxy polyethers and dibasic phenols with a polyamine (b) containing primary amino groups are reacted to form a second intermediate compound, with the proviso that practically all the epoxy groups present in (a) are substantially quantitatively reacted with the polyamine (b). The second intermediate compound obtained is then reacted with a compound (c) from the group of monoepoxides or monocarboxylic acids, with the proviso that at least all the primary amino groups of the polyamines (b) are reacted with the compounds (c), resulting in the formation of a third intermediate compound which, finally, is converted into an ionic compound by addition of a volatile acid, such as formic, acetic or propionic acid. According to the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,405, this ionic compound is a hardener for water-based epoxy resin systems. 
 WO 93/21250 describes a process for the production of aqueous emulsions of epoxy resin hardeners containing free amino groups. These epoxy resin hardeners in turn are adducts of epoxy resins and aminofunctional compounds. 
 EP-A-253,405 describes compositions containing cationic epoxy resins. These compositions are produced by reaction of a component (a) containing a diglycidyl ether of a polyol and a diglycidyl ether of a dibasic phenol with a dibasic phenol (b) and optionally a capping agent (c), resulting in the formation of an epoxy resin containing terminal oxirane rings. These terminal oxirane rings are then converted into cationic groups by reaction with nucleophiles and addition of an organic acid and water during the process. 
 EP-A-1,518,875 describes hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which are obtained by reaction of a mixture of (a) at least one epoxidized polyalkylene oxide selected from the group of epoxidized polyethylene oxides, epoxidized polypropylene oxides and polyethylene propylene oxides, (b) at least one epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group of bisphenol A epoxides and bisphenol F epoxides and (c) at least one aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group consisting of bisphenol A and bisphenol F to form an intermediate product and subsequent reaction of this intermediate product with a polyamine (E). 
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The problem addressed by the present invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which, when used in the reaction with epoxy resins, would lead to the formation of coating compositions or coatings distinguished by a comparatively long pot life. The end of the pot life would be reflected in a distinct increase in the viscosity of the mixture. In addition, the hardeners would be self-emulsifying in water and would be capable of emulsifying added liquid epoxy resins in water or water-containing systems. 
 Another problem addressed by the invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which, when used in the reaction with epoxy resins, would lead to the formation of coating compositions or coatings distinguished by a particularly low tendency to shrink. Another problem addressed by the invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which would develop distinct hardness after a short drying time. 
 It has now surprisingly been found that coating compositions obtainable by reaction of epoxy resins and special hardeners        these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of epoxidized polyalkylene oxides, epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compounds and aromatic hydroxy compounds to form a first intermediate product, subsequently reacting this intermediate product with polyamine to form a second intermediate product and finally reacting the second intermediate product with special Lewis acids        satisfy these requirements excellently in every respect. 
 In a first embodiment, the present invention relates to hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems, these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of 

     (A) at least one epoxidized polyalkylene oxide selected from the group of epoxidized polyethylene oxides, epoxidized polypropylene oxides and polyethylene propylene oxides, 
     (B) at least one epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group of bisphenol A epoxides and bisphenol F epoxides and 
     (C) at least one aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group of bisphenol A and bisphenol F 

 to form a first intermediate product (Z1), subsequently reacting this intermediate product (Z1) with a polyamine (E) to form a second intermediate product (Z2) and, finally, reacting the intermediate product (Z2) with at least one compound (F), 

 with the proviso that the compounds (F) are selected from the group of Lewis acids and salts thereof, 

 with the further proviso that at least 0.1% and at most 30% of the compounds (F), based on the intermediate product (Z2), is/are added, and with the further proviso that the following are excluded from the definition of Lewis acids: 
    
         (a) compounds corresponding to general formula (i)  




         in which R1 is a saturated, linear or branched C1-22 alkyl group, which may optionally carry an amino or OH group as substituents in the alpha position to the carbonyl carbon atom, or a C6H5 group, 
         (b) alpha,beta-unsaturated organic carboxylic acids and 
         (c) carbon dioxide, 
    
    


 In the context of the present invention, Lewis acids        in line with common usage        are understood to be electron pair acceptors, i.e. molecules or ions with incomplete electron configurations (cf. for example R      mpps Chemie-Lexikon, 7th Edition, Stuttgart 1973, page 1964). Br      nstedt acids (unless Br      nstedt acids of special structure as explained above are explicitly excluded as compounds (F)) i.e. substances which release protons, may of course be interpreted as a special case among Lewis acids and therefore come under the heading of Lewis acids. 
 With the quite outstanding properties of the hardeners according to the invention in mind, it is pointed out in particular that the pot lives of clear lacquers obtainable using the hardeners according to the invention are excellent. With clear lacquer formulations based on the hardeners of Table 1 of the Examples of the present application, the clear lacquer can still readily be applied after 54 minutes, a clear, colorless transparent lacquer being obtained. The end of the pot life is characterized by a distinct increase in the viscosity of the mixture and is clearly reflected in the fact that the viscosity increases by more than three-fold relative to the initial viscosity. 
 The present invention also relates to the use of the hardeners according to the invention for the production of clear lacquers, coating compositions and the like.

 The polyamines (E) used in accordance with the present invention are amines containing at least two primary amino groups per molecule. Additional other amino groups may optionally be present. Aliphatic, aromatic, aliphatic-aromatic, cycloaliphatic and heterocyclic di- and polyamines may be used as the compounds (E). 
 The following are examples of suitable polyamines (E): polyethylene amines (ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, etc.), 1,2-propylene diamine, 1,3-propylene diamine, 1,4-butane diamine, 1,5-pentane diamine, 1,3-pentane diamine, 1,6-hexane diamine, 3,3,5-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, 3,5,5-trimethyl-1,6-hexane diamine, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diamine, bis-(3-aminopropyl)-amine, N,N        -bis-(3-aminopropyl)-1,2-ethane diamine, N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,2-ethane diamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, 1,3-diaminocyclohexane, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, the poly(alkylene oxide)diamines and triamines (such as, for example, Jeffamine D-230, Jeffamine D400, Jeffamine D-2000, Jeffamine D4000, Jeffamine T403, Jeffamine EDR-148, Jeffamine EDR-192, Jeffamine C-346, Jeffamine ED-600, Jeffamine ED-900, Jeffamine ED-2001), meta-xylyene diamine, phenylene diamine, 4,4        -diaminodiphenyl methane, toluene diamine, isophorone diamine, 3,3        -dimethyl-4,4        -diaminodicyclohexyl methane, 4,4        -diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 2,4        -diaminodicyclohexyl methane, 1,3-bis-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane, the mixture of poly(cyclohexylaromatic)amines attached by a methylene bridge (also known as MBPCAA) and polyaminoamides. Polyethylene amines, especially diethylene triamine, are particularly preferred. 
 The compounds (E) may be used individually or in admixture with one another. 
 In one embodiment, the compounds (E) may be used in combination with amines (E*), with the proviso that the amines (E*) are amines that do not come under the definition of the amines (E). Examples of such amines (E*) are amines with only one primary amino group per molecule, such as cyclohexylamine, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine, heptylamine, octylamine, nonylamine, decylamine, undecylamine, dodecylamine, tridecylamine, tetradecylamine, pentadecylamine, hexadecylamine, heptadecylamine, octadecylamine, aniline, Jeffamine M 2070, Jeffamine M 600, ethanolamine. 
 If mixtures of (E) and (E*) are used, the percentage of (E) in such mixtures is at least 10% by weight, preferably at least 40% by weight and, more particularly, at least 60% by weight. 
 In one preferred embodiment, one or more compounds (E), but no compounds (E*), are used. 
 Compounds (F) 
 In the context of the present invention, Lewis acids        in line with common usage        are understood to be electron pair acceptors, i.e. molecules or ions with incomplete electron configurations (cf. for example R      mpps Chemie-Lexikon, 7th Edition, Stuttgart 1973, page 1964). Br      nstedt acids (unless Br      nstedt acids of special structure as explained above are explicitly excluded as compounds (F)) i.e. substances which release protons, may of course be interpreted as a special case among Lewis acids and therefore come under the heading of Lewis acids. 
 However, as already expressly pointed out, 

    
    
         compounds corresponding to general formula (i)  




         in which R1 is a saturated, linear or branched C1-22 alkyl group, which may optionally carry an amino or OH group as substituent in the alpha position to the carbonyl carbon atom, or a C6H5 group, 
         alpha,beta-unsaturated organic carboxylic acids and 
         carbon dioxide 

 are explicitly excluded as compounds (F). 

    
    


 Alpha,beta-unsaturated organic carboxylic acids are understood to be organic carboxylic acids which have an olefinic C        C double bond immediately adjacent the carboxyl group, from which it is clear that acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, for example, do not come under the definition of the compounds (F) according to the invention. 
 Examples of suitable Lewis acids (F) in the context of the invention are salts such as, for example, copper(I) sulfate, copper(I) fluoride, copper(I) chloride, copper(I) bromide, copper(I) iodide, copper(I) acetate, copper(I) borate, copper(I) nitrate, copper(I) carbonate, copper(II) sulfate, copper(II) fluoride, copper(II) chloride, copper(II) bromide, copper(I) iodide, copper(II) acetate, copper(II) borate, copper(II) nitrate, copper(II) carbonate, magnesium(II) sulfate, magnesium(II) fluoride, magnesium (II) chloride, magnesium (II) bromide, magnesium (II) iodide, magnesium (II) acetate, magnesium(II) borate, magnesium(II) nitrate, magnesium(II) carbonate, magnesium(III) sulfate, magnesium(III) fluoride, magnesium (III) chloride, magnesium (III) bromide, magnesium (III) iodide, magnesium (III) acetate, magnesium(III) borate, magnesium(III) nitrate, magnesium(III) carbonate, zinc(II) sulfate, zinc(II) fluoride, zinc(II) chloride, zinc(II) bromide, zinc(I) iodide, zinc(II) acetate, zinc(II) borate, zinc(II) nitrate, zinc(II) carbonate, iron(II) sulfate, iron(II) fluoride, iron(II) chloride, iron(II) bromide, iron(I) iodide, iron(II) acetate, iron(II) borate, iron(II) nitrate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) sulfate, iron(III) fluoride, iron(III) chloride, iron(III) bromide, iron(III) iodide, iron(III) acetate, iron(III) borate, iron(III) nitrate, iron(III) carbonate, aluminium(III) sulfate, aluminium(III) fluoride, aluminium(III) chloride, aluminium(III) bromide, aluminium(III) iodide, aluminium(III) acetate, aluminium(III) borate, aluminium(III) nitrate, aluminium(III) carbonate, boric acid and boric acid esters. Boric acid is the most particularly preferred compound (F). 
 Production of the Intermediate Product (Z1) 
 In one embodiment, compounds (A) and (B) are used in a molar ratio of 0.1:1 to 5:1 in the production of the intermediate product (Z1). 
 In another embodiment, a molar ratio of the sum of compounds (A) and (B) (these compounds each contain two oxirane groups per molecule) to compound (C) (this compound contains two OH groups per molecule) of 1.1:1 to 10:1 is adjusted in the production of the intermediate product (Z1). In other words, the equivalent ratio of oxirane rings in the sum of compounds (A) and (B) to reactive hydrogen atoms in compound (C) is adjusted to a value of 1.1:1 to 10:1. 
 In another embodiment, namely in cases where at least one compound (D) is also used in the production of the intermediate product (Z2), a molar ratio of the sum of compounds (A), (B) and (D) (these compounds each contain two oxirane groups per molecule) to compound (C) (this compound contains two OH groups per molecule) of 1.1:1.0 to 10.0:1.0 is adjusted in the production of the intermediate product (Z1). In other words, the equivalent ratio of oxirane rings in the sum of compounds (A), (B) and (D) to reactive hydrogen atoms in compound (C) is adjusted to a value of 1.1:1.0 to 10.0:1.0. 
 In the interests of clarity, the following explanation is offered: The expression         equivalent ratio         is familiar to the expert. The basic concept behind the notion of the equivalent is that, for every substance participating in a reaction, the reactive groups involved in the desired reaction are taken into consideration. By indicating an equivalent ratio, it is possible to express the ratio which all the various reactive groups of the compounds (x) and (y) used bear to one another. It is important in this connection to bear in mind that a reactive group is understood to be the smallest possible reactive group, i.e. the notion of the reactive group is not identical with the notion of the functional group. In the case of H-acid compounds, this means for example that, although OH groups or NH groups represent such reactive groups, NH2 groups with two reactive H atoms positioned at the same nitrogen atom do not. In their case, the two hydrogen atoms within the functional group NH2 are appropriately regarded as reactive groups so that the functional group NH2 contains two reactive groups, namely the hydrogen atoms. 
 In one embodiment, the production of the intermediate product (Z1) is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, more particularly triphenyl phosphine or ethyl triphenyl phosphonium iodide. The catalyst is used in a quantity of about 0.01 to 1.0% by weight, based on the total quantity of compounds (A), (B) and (C). The epoxy value (% EpO) of the intermediate product is preferably below 10% EpO and more particularly below       5% EpO. The definition of epoxy value and information on its analytical determination can be found in the Examples of the present application. 
 Production of the Intermediate Product (Z2) 
 As already mentioned, the intermediate product (Z2) is produced by reacting the intermediate product (Z1) with a polyamine (E). 
 In one embodiment, the intermediate product (Z1) and the polyamine (E) are used in such quantities that the equivalent ratio of the reactive H atoms at the aminonitrogen atoms of (E) to the oxirane groups in the intermediate compound (Z1) is in the range from 4:1 to 100:1 and, at the same time, the ratio of oxirane groups to primary amines is at least 1:1.01. 
 The reaction of the intermediate product (Z1) with the polyamine is preferably carried out by initially introducing the polyamine in excess so as to ensure that essentially 1 molecule of the polyamine, preferably diethylene triamine, reacts with one of the epoxy groups of the intermediate compound (Z1). Excess amine can be distilled off to keep the free amine content as low as possible. 
 Production of the Hardener According to the Invention 
 To produce the hardener according to the invention, the intermediate product (Z2) is reacted with at least one compound (F), with the proviso that at least 0.1% and at most 30% of the compounds (F), based on the intermediate product (Z), is/are added. 
 In a preferred embodiment, at least 1.0% and at most 10.0% of the primary amino groups present in the intermediate product (Z2) is/are allowed to react off. 
 In another preferred embodiment, at least 1.0% and at most 10.0% of the primary amino groups present in the intermediate product (Z2) is/are allowed to react off. 
 In a particularly preferred embodiment, at least 1.5% and at most 7.5% of the primary amino groups present in the intermediate product (Z2) are allowed to react off. 
 Production of Coating Compositions 
 The present invention also relates to a process for the production of clear lacquers, coating compositions and the like which are obtainable by combining and reacting the above-mentioned hardeners according to the invention with epoxy compounds (G) while stirring in an aqueous medium. 
 The epoxy compounds (G) are polyepoxides containing on average at least two terminal or lateral epoxy groups per molecule. These epoxy compounds may be both saturated and unsaturated and aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic and may also contain hydroxyl groups. They may also contain substituents which do not cause any troublesome secondary reactions under the mixing and reaction conditions, for example alkyl or aryl substituents, ether groups and the like. These epoxy compounds are preferably polyglycidyl ethers based on polyhydric, preferably dihydric, alcohols, phenols, hydrogenation products of these phenols and/or novolaks (reaction products of mono- or polyhydric phenols with aldehydes, more particularly formaldehyde, in the presence of acidic catalysts). The epoxy equivalent weights of these epoxy compounds are preferably between 160 and 3,200 and more preferably between 170 and 830. The epoxy equivalent weight of a substance is the quantity of the substance (in grams) which contains 1 mol of oxirane rings. 
 Preferred polyhydric phenols are the following compounds: resorcinol, hydroquinone, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (bisphenol A), isomer mixtures of dihydroxydiphenyl methane (bisphenol F), tetrabromobisphenol A, 4,4        -dihydroxydiphenyl cyclohexane, 4,4        -dihydroxy-3,3-dimethyldiphenyl propane, 4,4        -dihydroxydiphenyl, 4,4        -dihydroxybenzophenol, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1-ethane, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1-isobutane, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ether, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-sulfone etc. and the chlorination and bromination products of the above-mentioned compounds. Bisphenol A is most particularly preferred. 
 The polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols are also suitable compounds (G). Examples of such polyhydric alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, polyoxypropylene glycols (n=1-20), 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butylene glycol, pentane-1,5-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, hexane-1,2,6-triol, glycerol and bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-2,2-propane. 
 Other suitable compounds (G) are polyglycidyl ethers of polycarboxylic acids obtained by reaction of epichlorohydrin or similar epoxy compounds with an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic polycarboxylic acid, such as oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and dimerized linolenic acid. Examples are adipic acid diglycidyl ester, phthalic acid diglycidyl ester and hexahydrophthalic acid diglycidyl ester. 
 Mixtures of several epoxy compounds (G) may also be used. 
 In addition, additives and/or processing aids known to the relevant expert may be used in the production of coating compositions where, as mentioned above, the hardeners according to the invention are reacted with epoxy compounds (G) in aqueous medium. Examples include pigments, cement, gravel, deaerators, defoamers, dispersion aids, antisedimenting agents, accelerators, free amines, flow control additives, conductivity improvers. 
 So far as the layer thickness of the coating compositions is concerned, the hardeners according to the invention may be used in coating compositions for layer thicknesses of 0.01 to 10 mm and preferably for layer thicknesses of 0.05 to 3 mm. 
 In addition, the very slight tendency towards shrinkage of the cured compositions achieved by the use of the hardeners to be used in accordance with the invention can be further reduced by adjusting a high pigment content. 
 The present invention also relates to the cured compositions obtainable by reacting the above-mentioned hardeners according to the invention with epoxy compounds (G) in aqueous medium and then curing the resulting product. 
 In one embodiment, the cured compositions are floor coatings. In a preferred embodiment, these floor coatings have a longitudinal shrinkage of less than 3% in a layer thickness of more than 0.4 mm (as measured at 23       C./50% relative air humidity). 
EXAMPLES 
 Measurement Methods 
 Epoxy Value (% EDO) 
 The content of oxirane groups (        epoxy groups        ) in compounds was characterized by epoxy titration. The epoxy value (% EpO) obtained indicates how many grams oxirane oxygen are present in 100 grams of a sample. 
 Titration is Based on the Following Principle: 
 A solution containing excess tetraethyl ammonium bromide is added to the sample containing oxirane rings. The mixture is then titrated with a solution of perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid, an equimolar quantity of hydrogen bromide being released. The hydrogen bromide reacts with the oxirane rings in a ring opening reaction and forms the corresponding bromohydrin.  




 Crystal violet is used as the indicator. The determination presupposes the absence of water, bases and amines. 
 The following reagents were used: (1) 0.1 N perchloric acid (Merck) in glacial acetic acid; (2) tetraethyl ammonium bromide (Fluka) in the form of a solution of 100 g tetraethyl ammonium bromide in 400 ml glacial acetic acid; (3) crystal violet (Merck); the indicator solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g crystal violet in 100 ml glacial acetic acid. 
 Procedure: 0.2 to 0.5 g of the sample containing oxirane rings is placed in an Erlenmeyer flask. The sample is dissolved in 50 ml water-free acetone. 10 ml tetraethyl ammonium bromide solution (see above) and 3 drops crystal violet solution (see above) are then added. The mixture is titrated with a 0.1 N solution of perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid. The end point is reached when the color changes from blue to green. The actual titration is preceded by a blank test (no oxirane compound present) to rule out measurement errors. 
 Evaluation: The epoxy content % EpO is calculated as follows: 

% EpO=[(a        b)      0.160]/E 

 where 

 a=milliliters 0.1 n HClO4 solution required for titration, 

 b=milliliters 0.1 n HClO4 solution needed in the blank test, 

 E=weight of sample in grams 

 Epoxy Equivalent Weight (EEW) 

 The epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) can be calculated as follows from the epoxy value: 

16      100% EpO=EEW 

 The EEW is expressed in g/eq.

 Performance Tests 
 1. Clear Lacquer Properties 
 The hardeners of Examples 1 to 3 (hardener 60% in water) and Comparison Example 1 (hardener 60% in water) were made up into a clear lacquer by mixing the quantities shown in Table 1 of components Nos. 1 to 3 (the numbering of components Nos. 1 to 3 used appears in the first column of Table 1). 
 To this end, components No. 1 (epoxy resin) and No. 2 (hardener 60% in water) were thoroughly mixed with component No. 3 (water) in a glass beaker by stirring manually with a wooden spatula until a homogeneous emulsion had formed. The emulsion was then applied by coating knife (0.1 mm) to a pane of glass and left to cure at 20       C. After one day and seven days, the K      nig pendulum hardness (DIN 53157) was determined with an Erichsen type 299 pendulum hardness tester. 
 In every case, the end of the pot life was reflected in a distinct increase in the viscosity of the emulsion to more than 3 times its initial viscosity. The pot life was ca. 60 minutes in every case. The lacquers obtained were clear and colorless. The tack-free time (time after which small glass balls or glass dust no longer adhere to the film) was ca. 1 hour in every case.
