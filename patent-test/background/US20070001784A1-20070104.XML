<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2005-190269 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Jun. 29, 2005, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to a microresonator including a beam-type resonator element that is electrostatically driven, a band-pass filter including this microresonator, a semiconductor device including this microresonator, and a communication apparatus that uses a band-pass filter based on this microresonator. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> With progress in wireless communication technology in recent years, there has been demand for size reduction and weight reduction in a communication apparatus that uses wireless communication technology. Micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) technology, which employs micro-processing technology used for a semiconductor to manufacture a micro mechanical structure, has been used for an RF signal processing portion where size reduction has been hitherto considered to be difficult. As an example thereof, there is a mechanical filter using mechanical resonance, which is expected to be applied to a communication field, because size is small and integration is possible. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2004-328076 discloses a beam-type microresonator element that is electrostatically driven, as a mechanical resonator element constituting a filter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a microresonator element <b>1</b> is configured such that an input electrode <b>3</b> and an output electrode <b>4</b> that are lower electrodes are formed on a substrate <b>2</b> having at least an insulating surface. Further, an electrode to be an oscillating portion, that is, a beam <b>6</b> is formed opposing those input electrode <b>3</b> and output electrode <b>4</b> across a space <b>5</b>. The input electrode <b>3</b> and the output electrode <b>4</b> are formed to intersect the lengthwise direction of the beam <b>6</b>. The beam <b>6</b> straddles the input and output electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> in the manner of a bridge and is integrally supported at both ends by support portions (anchor portions) <b>8</b> [<b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B] to be connected to wiring layers <b>7</b> disposed outside the input and output electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. A necessary DC bias voltage V<sub>DC </sub>is applied to the beam <b>6</b> through the wiring layer <b>7</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In this microresonator element <b>1</b>, based on a signal input from the input electrode <b>3</b>, the beam <b>6</b> oscillates at a specific resonance frequency, because the beam <b>6</b> receives external force caused by electrostatic force generated between the beam <b>6</b> to which a DC bias voltage V<sub>DC </sub>is applied and the input electrode <b>3</b>. This oscillation is transmitted as a signal to the output electrode <b>4</b> through the micro space <b>5</b>. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> When a mechanical filter is formed by using the microresonator element <b>1</b>, a microresonator including individual microresonator elements <b>1</b> arranged in parallel is used. In a band-pass filter, filter characteristics can be obtained by interconnecting two resonators having different resonance frequencies which are determined according to pass bands thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> When a band-pass filter is formed by combining resonators, a ladder-type, for example, and the like are known as a method of combining the resonators. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a band-pass filter of the ladder-type is configured as follows. A series resonator <b>13</b> including a resonator element that has a high resonance frequency is connected in series to a signal line <b>11</b>. Further, a shunt resonator <b>14</b> similarly including a resonator element that has a low resonance frequency is connected between the signal line <b>11</b> on the output side of this series resonator <b>13</b> and a ground line <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a ladder-type filter <b>10</b> of a two-stage configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> A filter characteristic of this ladder-type filter <b>10</b> is obtained as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an output waveform <b>15</b> having a resonance peak p<b>1</b> at a high frequency is obtained in the series resonator <b>13</b> and an output waveform <b>16</b> having a resonance peak p<b>2</b> at a low frequency is obtained in the shunt resonator <b>14</b>. On the other hand, an output waveform becomes the one denoted by a reference numeral <b>17</b> when a signal is input after connecting the shunt resonator <b>14</b> between the signal line <b>11</b> and the ground line <b>12</b>. As a result, a frequency characteristic of the ladder-type filter <b>10</b> is obtained as a waveform in which the output waveform <b>17</b> and the output waveform <b>15</b> of the series resonator <b>13</b> are added up. Specifically, a waveform <b>18</b> of the filter characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is obtained. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The waveform <b>18</b> of an excellent filter characteristic is obtained when a frequency of the resonance peak p<b>1</b> of the series resonator <b>13</b> and a frequency of an anti-resonance peak p<b>2</b>&#x2032; of the shunt resonator <b>14</b> are the same. In this ladder-type band-pass filter, a wide bandwidth <b>19</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) can be obtained by widely setting a frequency difference &#x394;f between the resonance peak p<b>2</b> and anti-resonance peak p<b>2</b>&#x2032; of the shunt resonator <b>4</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> However, the microresonator including the above-described beam-type resonator element <b>1</b> has large parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b> between the input electrode <b>3</b> and the beam <b>6</b>, and large parasitic capacitance C<b>2</b> between the output electrode <b>4</b> and the beam <b>6</b> due to the structural reasons. Because of the above, it is difficult to widely set the frequency difference &#x394;f between the resonance peak p<b>2</b> and anti-resonance peak p<b>2</b>&#x2032;, and therefore it has been difficult to broaden the bandwidth <b>19</b> of the band-pass filter. Specifically, in case of a beam-type resonator, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a signal path <b>20</b> electrically formed through resistance R of the beam portion, parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b> between the input electrode <b>3</b> and the beam <b>6</b>, and parasitic capacitance C<b>2</b> between the output electrode <b>4</b> and the beam <b>6</b>, in addition to a signal path formed through a mechanical oscillation of the beam. Leak signals carried in this path <b>20</b> are irrelevant to the resonance of the beam and may lower S/N of the resonator. Since the space <b>5</b> between the input and output electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> of the lower electrodes and the beam <b>6</b> is narrow in this microresonator, the parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b> between the input electrode <b>3</b> and the beam <b>6</b> and parasitic capacitance C<b>2</b> between the output electrode <b>4</b> and the beam <b>6</b> are large, and the signal leaks flowing through the parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> become large. Due to the above, it is difficult to widely set the frequency difference &#x394;f between the resonance peak and anti-resonance peak, when the band-pass filter is designed by using the microresonator, and accordingly it has been difficult to obtain a band-pass filter whose bandwidth is broadened. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In order to suppress the above-described signal leaks, it is conceivable that the parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b> between the input electrode <b>3</b> and the beam <b>6</b> and parasitic capacitance C<b>2</b> between the output electrode <b>4</b> and the beam <b>6</b> are reduced, or the resistance R of the beam portion is increased. In order to reduce the parasitic capacitance C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, it is necessary to increase the space <b>5</b> between the beam <b>6</b> and the signal line (namely, the input electrode <b>3</b> and the output electrode <b>4</b>). However, as a result, electromechanical conversion efficiency between the signal line and the beam <b>6</b> is reduced, and the performance is lowered. When resistance R of the beam <b>6</b> itself is increased, oscillation by electrostatic force may not be obtained, because electric charges to generate the oscillation by applying the DC bias voltage V<sub>DC </sub>to the beam <b>6</b> are not collected sufficiently. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In view of the above, it is desirable to provide a microresonator that can reduce signal leaks through parasitic capacitance between input and output signals. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Further, it is desirable to provide a band-pass filter of a wide bandwidth using this microresonator, a semiconductor device including this microresonator, and a communication apparatus including the band-pass filter based on this microresonator. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> A microresonator according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a beam-type resonator element in which a beam that is an oscillating portion of the resonator element has a high-resistance portion or an insulating portion. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> A band-pass filter according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a microresonator which has a beam-type resonator element in which a beam that is an oscillating portion of the resonator element has a high-resistance portion or an insulating portion. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> A semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a microresonator which has a beam-type resonator element in which a beam that is an oscillating portion of the resonator element has a high-resistance portion or an insulating portion. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> A communication apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention is a communication apparatus provided with a filter which performs band limiting of transmission signals and/or reception signals, wherein, as the filter, a filter based on a microresonator which includes a beam-type resonator element in which a beam that is an oscillating portion of this resonator element has a high-resistance portion or an insulating portion is used. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The microresonator according to an embodiment of the present invention has the high-resistance portion or the insulating portion in the beam of the resonator element, and so signal leaks through parasitic capacitance between input and output signals can be reduced. Hence, the frequency difference between a resonance peak and anti-resonance peak can be widely set, and a band-pass filter of a wide bandwidth can be obtained when this microresonator is applied to the band-pass filter, for example. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The band-pass filter according to an embodiment of the present invention uses the microresonator in which the signal leaks through the parasitic capacitance between the input and output signals are reduced, and so the frequency difference between the resonance peak and anti-resonance peak can be widely set, and a band-pass filter of a wide bandwidth can be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> The semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the microresonator in which the signal leaks through the parasitic capacitance between the input and output signals are reduced, and so the semiconductor device having an excellent characteristic can be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The communication apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention uses, as a band-pass filter, the filter based on the microresonator in which the signal leaks through the parasitic capacitance between the input and output signals are reduced, and so the communication apparatus that has an excellent filter characteristic of the wide bandwidth and other excellent characteristics can be obtained. Accordingly, a highly reliable communication apparatus can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> The microresonator according to the above-described embodiments can be used as a band signal filter such as a high frequency (RF) filter and an intermediate frequency (IF) filter. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the filter including the microresonator of the above-described embodiments is used to provide a communication apparatus such as mobile phone units, wireless LAN devices, wireless transceivers, television tuners, and radio tuners, which perform communication using electromagnetic waves. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an example of a configuration of a communication apparatus is explained, to which the filter according to an embodiment of this invention is applied. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> First, a configuration of a transmission system is explained. Transmission data for I channel and transmission data for Q channel are supplied to digital/analog converters (DACs) <b>201</b>I and <b>201</b>Q respectively, and are converted into analog signals. The converted signals for each channel are supplied to band-pass filters <b>202</b>I and <b>202</b>Q, signal components of the transmission signals outside the pass band are removed, and the outputs of the band-pass filters <b>202</b>I and <b>202</b>Q are supplied to a modulator <b>210</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> In the modulator <b>210</b>, the signals for each channel are supplied to mixers <b>212</b>I and <b>212</b>Q via buffer amps <b>211</b>I and <b>211</b>Q, and are mixed with frequency signals corresponding to the transmission frequency supplied from a transmission PLL (phase-locked loop) circuit <b>203</b> to be modulated. The mixed signals for each channels are added by an adder <b>214</b> to obtain a single series of transmission signals. In this case, the frequency signals supplied to the mixer <b>212</b>I are phase-shifted by 90&#xb0; by a phase-shifter <b>213</b>, and so the I-channel signals and Q-channel signals are quadrature-modulated. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> The output of the adder <b>214</b> is supplied to a power amplifier <b>204</b> via a buffer amplifier <b>215</b>, and is amplified to a predetermined transmission power. Signals amplified by the power amplifier <b>204</b> pass through a transmission/reception switch <b>205</b> and high-frequency filter <b>206</b>, and are supplied to an antenna <b>207</b>. From the antenna <b>207</b>, the signals are wirelessly transmitted. A high-frequency filter <b>206</b> is a band-pass filter which removes signal components outside the frequency band for transmission and reception by this communication apparatus. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> As a configuration of a reception system, signals received by the antenna <b>207</b> are supplied to a high-frequency portion <b>220</b> via the high-frequency filter <b>206</b> and transmission/reception switch <b>205</b>. In the high-frequency portion <b>220</b>, after being amplified by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) <b>221</b>, received signals are supplied to a band-pass filter <b>222</b>, where signal components outside the reception frequency band are removed. The signals with these components removed are then supplied to a mixer <b>224</b> via a buffer amplifier <b>223</b>. After frequency signals supplied from a channel selection PLL circuit <b>251</b> are mixed, signals for the predetermined transmission channel are made to be intermediate-frequency signals, and these intermediate-frequency signals are supplied to an intermediate-frequency circuit <b>230</b> via a buffer amplifier <b>225</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> In the intermediate-frequency circuit <b>230</b>, the supplied intermediate-frequency signals are supplied to a band-pass filter <b>232</b> via a buffer amplifier <b>231</b>, and signal components outside the band of the intermediate-frequency signals are removed. After this removal, the signals are supplied to an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit <b>233</b> to obtain signals with substantially constant gain. After gain adjustment performed in the automatic gain control circuit <b>233</b>, the intermediate-frequency signals are supplied to a demodulator <b>240</b> via a buffer amplifier <b>234</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> In the demodulator <b>240</b>, the supplied intermediate-frequency signals are supplied to mixers <b>242</b>I and <b>242</b>Q via a buffer amplifier <b>241</b> and are mixed with frequency signals supplied from an intermediate-frequency PLL circuit <b>252</b>. Thus, the received I-channel signal components and Q-channel signal components are demodulated. In this case, frequency signals which have been phase-shifted 90&#xb0; by a phase shifter <b>243</b> are supplied to the I signal mixer <b>242</b>I, and the quadrature-modulated I-channel signal component and Q-channel signal component are demodulated. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> The demodulated I-channel and Q-channel signals are respectively supplied to band-pass filters <b>253</b>I and <b>253</b>Q via buffer amplifiers <b>244</b>I and <b>244</b>Q. Signal components other than the signals of the I channel and Q channel are removed, and the signals after the removal are supplied to analog/digital converters (ADCs) <b>254</b>I and <b>254</b>Q for sampling and conversion to digital data. Thus, I channel received data and Q channel received data are obtained. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> In the configuration described thus far, the filter according to the above-described embodiments can be applied, either in whole or in part, to each of the band pass filters <b>202</b>I, <b>202</b>Q, <b>206</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>253</b>I, and <b>253</b>Q, to limit the pass band. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> In the communication apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, since the filter including the microresonator according to an embodiment of the present invention is provided as the band-pass filter, an excellent filter characteristic of a wide bandwidth is obtained and a highly reliable communication apparatus can be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, each filter is configured as a band-pass filter. However, each filter may be configured as a low pass filter to pass only a lower frequency band than a predetermined frequency and a high pass filter to pass only a higher frequency band than a predetermined frequency, and the filter having the configuration according to an embodiment of the present invention is applied to those filters. Here, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is the communication apparatus that performs wireless transmission and wireless reception. However, the filter having the configuration according to the above-described embodiments may be applied to a filter provided in a communication apparatus that performs transmission and reception through a wired transmission path. Furthermore, the filter having the configuration according to the above-described embodiments may be applied to a filter provided in a communication apparatus that performs only transmission processing and in a communication apparatus that performs only reception processing. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </p>
