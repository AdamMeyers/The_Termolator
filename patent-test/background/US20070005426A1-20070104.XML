<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A billing statement according to one aspect of the invention includes a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer. In one example of this aspect, the offer pointer is a telephone number printed adjacent to a description of a transaction on a credit card billing statement. The telephone number accesses a voice response system presenting conditional branches through which a consumer can navigate to review an offer. In another example, a hyperlink is positioned adjacent to a total amount owed listed on an electronically-displayed billing statement. The hyperlink may be selected to access a website presenting offers for review by the consumer. The offers reviewed in each of these examples may be customized based on details of the transaction such as the product purchased or the amount of the purchase, the identity of the consumer, and/or on other data. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The present invention relates to systems for providing offers to consumers. More particularly, the present invention concerns systems for providing offers to consumers using billing statements. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Sellers present offers to consumers in order to sell products and to acquire new customers. For example, a retailer may use newspaper advertisements or mass mailings to offer products to consumers for sale prices. In another example, a representative of a long distance telephone service provider may call a consumer and offer cash in exchange for the consumer's agreement to use the provider's service. Other conventional channels for presenting offers include radio and television advertisements, billboards, and in-store displays. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> However, since a typical consumer is inundated with offers received through conventional channels, such offers are rather limited in their ability to receive the consumer's thorough consideration. Moreover, of all the offers presented to the consumer, only a small fraction actually deal with products and/or services in which the consumer is interested. As a result of these factors, most offers presented to consumers through conventional channels are virtually ignored. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Some sellers, realizing that only a small fraction of presented offers will be considered and even a smaller fraction will actually be accepted, try to increase a total number of accepted offers by increasing the total number of offers presented to consumers. This strategy is not acceptable to most sellers because it suffers from the problems described above with respect to offers presented through conventional channels and because it can be quite costly. Additionally, since this strategy results in an increase in the number of offers presented through conventional channels, the already small fraction of these offers which are effectively considered tends to decrease. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In an attempt to address the foregoing, some sellers have employed billing statements as vehicles for presenting offers to consumers. For example, Synapse Group, Inc. of Stamford, Conn. presents offers for magazine subscriptions using materials enclosed with monthly credit card billing statements. This approach presumes that a consumer will pay more attention to items received along with a billing statement than to advertising vehicles such as mass mailings or newspaper advertisements. As a result, it is believed that the approach increases the percentage of offers which are thoroughly considered by consumers. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> One shortcoming of the previous approach results from the limited space available for including advertising materials within billing statements. Due to this limitation, offers which can be presented using this approach are limited to a small number of concise, simply explained offers. Accordingly, what is needed is a system allowing sellers to present more offers and additional types of offers, including complex, customized, and dynamically-created offers, to consumers using billing statements. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Moreover, offers presented using billing statements as described above are no more likely than other conventional offers to deal with products or services in which a particular consumer is interested. As a result, such offers are no more likely than conventional offers to be accepted even if thoroughly considered. Therefore, what is also needed is a system providing consumers with increased incentive to accept offers presented using billing statements. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In order to address the foregoing, the present invention, according to one embodiment, concerns a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Various embodiments of the present invention comprise a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer. According to one example of the present invention, the offer pointer is a toll-free telephone number printed adjacent to a description of a transaction on a credit card billing statement. The telephone number accesses a voice response (VR) system presenting conditional branches through which a consumer can navigate to review an offer. In another example, a hyperlink is positioned adjacent to a total amount owed listed on an electronically-displayed billing statement. The hyperlink may be selected to access a website presenting offers for review by the consumer. The offers reviewed in each of these examples may be customized based on details of the transaction such as the product purchased, the amount of the purchase, the identity of the consumer, and/or on other information. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> If, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, an offer pointer is included in a billing statement, it is likely that the reviewed offer will be more thoroughly considered than a conventional offer. Moreover, the complexity of the offer and the number of offers may not be limited by space constraints imposed by the billing statement. The offer may also be generated so as to be tailored to the characteristics or needs of the consumer, the seller, or a third party. As a result, the offer may be more likely to be accepted than an offer presented using conventional methods. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In various embodiments of the present invention, the reviewed offer, if accepted, reduces an amount owed which is associated with the transaction. For example, the reviewed offer may specify that the consumer's account balance will be reduced by the amount owed as a result of the transaction in exchange for performance of an obligation. This further aspect provides incentive to a consumer to accept the reviewed offer, since the acceptance would allow the consumer to avoid a previously-incurred cost. This incentive is particularly strong if the consumer regrets the transaction to which the offer is associated. In addition, this aspect allows billing companies, such as credit card issuers, to reduce uncollectable debt by allowing consumers to reduce their outstanding account balances through accepted offers. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> According to various embodiments, the present invention concerns a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer is to reduce an amount owed associated with the transaction. As an example of this aspect, a billing statement for a credit card account includes a description of a purchase of gasoline and an amount owed by the consumer as a result of the purchase. Printed adjacent to the amount is text which indicates that the amount will be deducted from the account if the consumer agrees to switch long distance telephone service providers. In a further example, several transactions described in a billing statement may each be associated with different offers to reduce amounts owed associated with each respective transaction. Advantageously, these various embodiments allow the consumer to avoid a previously-incurred cost, and may reduce a creditor's uncollected debt by providing an alternative system for consumers to reduce their outstanding balances. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In various embodiments, the present invention relates to a system in which: transaction information is received; an offer pointer is determined based on the transaction information, the offer pointer including information that may be used to review an offer; and the offer pointer is transmitted to a consumer via a billing statement. Since the offer pointer is determined based on received transaction information, the offer which may be reviewed using the offer pointer may be particularly suited to the transaction information. In one particular example, the received transaction information indicates that a tennis racket was purchased, therefore the determined offer pointer is a World Wide Web address of a tennis supply website presenting offers for other tennis equipment. Advantageously, these various embodiments may increase the likelihood that the reviewed offer is accepted. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In various embodiments, the present invention is a system in which: transaction information is received; an offer is determined based on the transaction information; an offer pointer is determined, the offer pointer including information that may be used to review the offer; and the offer pointer is transmitted to a consumer via a billing statement. According to these various embodiments, the offer is determined based on received transaction information; therefore, the offer itself may be particularly suited to the transaction information. Such an arrangement may thereby increase the likelihood that the offer is accepted. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In various embodiments, the present invention concerns a system in which a request is received from a consumer to review an offer associated with a transaction on a billing statement, the offer being an offer to reduce an amount owed by the consumer. The offer is transmitted to the consumer and a new amount owed is calculated if the offer is accepted by the consumer. These various embodiments allow a consumer to avoid overpayment or underpayment of an amount owed by updating the amount owed based on an accepted offer. In other various embodiments, a new minimum payment is also determined if the offer is accepted. This feature conveniently provides a consumer with new minimum payment information based on the accepted offer, thereby reducing the possibility of underpayment or overpayment by the consumer. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a representation of a billing statement according to one embodiment of the present invention. As will be described in greater detail below, the billing statement <b>1</b> may be generated by a bank, a credit card issuer, a billing service, or any other entity capable of generating billing statements. As shown, the billing statement <b>1</b> reflects information corresponding to a particular credit card account, including an itemized listing of transactions posted to the account. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Generation of a typical credit card billing statement involves several steps. Initially, an account is established with an issuing bank which associates a consumer (or consumers) with a particular credit card account number. The consumer receives a credit card including a magnetic strip encoding his particular account number, and the consumer submits the account number to a seller in order to purchase products and/or services therefrom. In this regard, the consumer may submit the account number to a seller by allowing the seller to scan and decode the account number from the magnetic strip or by transmitting the account number to the seller via the World Wide Web. Next, the seller transmits the account number along with various details of the transaction, such as a transaction date and time, a description of the product or service purchased, a purchase price, the seller's identity, etc. to a credit card clearinghouse such as CCH. The credit card clearinghouse forwards the information to an appropriate issuing bank based on the account number or to a billing statement generator designated by the appropriate issuing bank. According to the invention, a billing statement such as the billing statement <b>1</b> is then generated by the issuing bank or the billing statement generator using the forwarded information. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The billing statement <b>1</b> includes several types of information. For example, the billing statement <b>1</b> includes an account number <b>5</b> which was used to execute the transactions described in the billing statement. The billing statement <b>1</b> also includes contact information <b>10</b> which specifies a consumer with whom the account number <b>5</b> is associated. The contact information <b>10</b> may include a postal address, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, an e-mail address, or any other information that may be used to contact the consumer. Accordingly, the billing statement <b>1</b> may be transmitted by post, e-mail, or other means to the consumer described by the contact information <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> For each transaction described in the billing statement <b>1</b>, the billing statement <b>1</b> lists a transaction date <b>15</b>, a description <b>20</b> of the transaction, an amount owed <b>25</b> and alternative payment information <b>30</b>. The transaction date <b>15</b> may specify a date on which the transaction was authorized. The billing statement <b>1</b> may also, or alternatively, list a posting date for each transaction, which may be a date on which transaction settlement is reflected in the account. The description <b>20</b> may include, but is not limited to, descriptions of the particular product and/or service purchased and of the seller from whom the product and/or service was purchased. The amount owed <b>25</b> specifies the amount which the consumer agreed to pay for the product and/or service which is the subject of the associated transaction. In some embodiments, the description <b>20</b> includes one or more of the transaction date, the amount owed, the posting date, and any other information describing a transaction. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> According to the present invention, the alternative payment information <b>30</b> may include an offer pointer and/or a statement offer. Offer pointers will be discussed first. Generally, an offer pointer includes information which a consumer can use to review an offer. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> An offer pointer may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) referencing information contained in a website. For the present description, a URL is a data string that specifies how to access network resources, such as hypertext markup language (HTML) documents. A sample URL is &#x201c;http://www.NeedNotPay.com/SmallCharge/1.htm&#x201d;, with &#x201c;http&#x201d; identifying one of many protocols which may be used to retrieve documents on a network, and with &#x201c;www.NeedNotPay.com&#x201d; being a hostname (referred to herein as a website) which can be resolved into an IP address using the Domain Name Service. The portion &#x201c;SmallCharge/1.htm&#x201d; identifies a directory and a document provided by the website. In a case in which this sample URL is used as an offer pointer, the document &#x201c;1.htm&#x201d; may include one or more offers. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> An offer pointer may also include a relative URL, which specifies only a portion of a URL. In such a case, the unspecified portion of the URL is inferred from the context of the document in which the relative URL is located. For example, a consumer accesses a website maintained by an issuing bank to view an electronic copy of a billing statement. The billing statement appears similar to the billing statement <b>1</b> and includes a hyperlink associated with a listed transaction. The hyperlink references a relative URL specifying only a directory and a document in the directory. In order to access the document to which the relative URL refers, it is inferred that the protocol and website missing from the relative URL are those used to access the website of the issuing bank. It should be noted that both the hyperlink and the relative URL may be considered offer pointers in this example. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> A URL offer pointer may reference a homepage of a website (e.g., http://www.NeedNotPay.com) which presents offers or hyperlinks to other Web pages presenting offers. Again, these offers need not have anything to do with the transaction with which the URL is associated on a billing statement. However, a URL offer pointer may be associated with a transaction based on an aspect of the transaction, such as the associated amount owed <b>25</b> or the description <b>20</b>. That is, based on pre-existing rules, cross-subsidy offers, yield management techniques, or the like, a specific offer pointer may be tailored for association with a specific transaction (or type of transaction) on a billing statement. For example, if an amount owed <b>25</b> associated with a transaction is less than $5.00, a URL offer pointer may be associated with the transaction which references a page of a website providing offers appropriate for transactions associated with an amount owed <b>25</b> of less than $5.00 (e.g., &#x201c;http://www.NeeNotPay.com/SmallCharge/1.htm&#x201d;). In another example, a URL offer pointer &#x201c;http://www.dontpay.com/any/cosmetics.htm&#x201d; may be associated with a transaction if the transaction is associated with a description <b>20</b> of some type of cosmetic. Accordingly, it may be desirable for a Web page referenced by this URL to present offers which may be attractive to a consumer who purchases cosmetics. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> In yet another example, transactions in a billing statement which are associated with an amount owed <b>25</b> of less than $5.00 are associated with a particular URL offer pointer, regardless of any other factors. However, when a consumer accesses a Web page corresponding to the offer pointer, he may be asked to enter identifying information such as his credit card account number. Based on this or other entered information, an offer is presented for review which may be different for a first consumer than an offer presented to a second consumer accessing the same Web page. The offers may differ in the benefit conferred, in the obligation to be performed, or both. For example, a more valued consumer may be presented with an offer having a less onerous obligation than an offer presented to a less valued consumer for a same benefit. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> In addition to the factors mentioned in the foregoing examples, a particular offer pointer may be associated with a transaction based on factors such as the consumer's credit limit, credit history, address or geographic location, profile information, the current account balance, the minimum payment due, purchasing history, previously accepted offers, the time or date of the transaction, inventory, market conditions, yield management information, relationships with other consumers, or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> A URL offer pointer according to the invention may also include data to be passed to a website referenced by the URL. The data included in such an offer pointer may be formatted according to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) format or another format for passing data from a network client to a server. For example, an offer pointer may read &#x201c;http://www.NeedNotPay.com/BigCharge/Code=X847Q&#x201d;. In this case, the data &#x201c;Code=X847Q&#x201d; may represent a particular offer which the website presents to a consumer in response to reception of the data, or details of a transaction (encoded or otherwise) with which the offer pointer is associated on a billing statement. In the latter case, the website may determine an appropriate offer or offers to present to the consumer based on the data and/or other information as discussed above with respect to offer pointers. Examples of offer determination based on transaction information will be discussed below. However, it should be noted that certain embodiments allow for less-complex generation of offer pointers because appropriate offers need not be determined before determination of the offer pointers. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> A URL offer pointer may also identify the consumer to whom the offer pointer is presented. For example, the last four digits of a consumer's credit card account number may be hashed into a URL offer pointer as a means of identifying the consumer when the consumer submits the offer pointer to a website in order to review an offer. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In addition to URL's, offer pointers included in the alternative payment information <b>30</b> may comprise a telephone number. In order to use this type of offer pointer to review an offer, a consumer dials the telephone number and is presented with at least one offer for review. It should be noted that, like URL offer pointers discussed above, a telephone number offer pointer may be selected for association with the transaction because it allows access to offers which are appropriate in view of one or more characteristic(s) of the transaction, consumer, or other factor. Of course, the telephone number may simply allow review of one or more offers which are not particularized to the associated transaction. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Alternatively, a consumer calling a telephone number offer pointer may be presented with a VR menu through which the consumer navigates by selecting appropriate menu items before being presented with at least one offer for review. The menu items may correspond to details of the transaction to which the telephone number is associated, information regarding the consumer, or to any other information that may be used by the VR system to determine at least one offer to present to the consumer for review. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> Included with a telephone number in an offer pointer may be a code or an extension number which is dialed after dialing the telephone number. The telephone extension may be dialed to access offers associated with the extension, and the code may be used to determine an appropriate offer to present to the consumer for review. As described above with respect to telephone number offer pointers, extension numbers or codes may allow consumers to access particular offers which are appropriate to an associated transaction or may simply reference one or more offers selected for other reasons. As described with respect to codes passed with URL offer pointers, an extension number or code may also represent a particular offer which is presented to a consumer in response to reception of the extension number or code, or details (encoded or not) of the associated transaction which are used to determine an offer to present to the consumer for review. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> In addition to the foregoing, other offer pointers that may be used in accordance with the present invention include a television, cable, or satellite channel on which a consumer may review offers, a postal address from which a consumer may request to review offers, a geographic location to which a consumer may go to review offers, and Uniform Resource Identifiers, of which URLs are a subset. Moreover, it is considered that an offer reviewable using an offer pointer is associated with any transaction to which the offer pointer is associated. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> It should be noted that any or all of the offer pointers discussed above may be used to review an offer to reduce or eliminate an amount owed <b>25</b> associated with a transaction to which an offer pointer is associated. For example, a consumer may access a Web page referenced by a URL offer pointer listed under the alternative payment information <b>30</b> and in association with a transaction. The Web page presents an offer to the consumer and, if the consumer accepts the offer, an amount owed <b>25</b> associated with the transaction is deducted from the consumer's account and the consumer is bound to abide by any obligation specified in the offer. In one embodiment, a party receiving the benefit of the obligation then pays the amount owed <b>25</b> to the issuing bank. Other types of settlement are discussed below. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> As described above, alternative payment information <b>30</b> according to the present invention includes statement offers as well as offer pointers. A statement offer differs from offers reviewable using offer pointers only in that a statement offer is an offer included in a billing statement. Therefore, both statement offers and offers may be determined using any method discussed herein for determining either type of offer, and may have any characteristics attributed to either herein. For clarity, however, offers reviewable using offer pointers are referred to as &#x201c;offers&#x201d; and offers included in a billing statement are referred to as &#x201c;statement offers&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> A statement offer may be accepted by a consumer using a check box or other means, such as those described in parent application Ser. No. 09/100,684. A statement offer may explicitly describe a benefit, if any, which will be conferred upon an agreement to perform or upon performance of an explicitly described obligation, if any. A statement offer may also be presented in terms of an obligation to which the consumer may indicate agreement, wherein it is clear from the billing statement what benefit will be received by the consumer in return. For example, as shown on billing statement <b>1</b>, alternative payment information <b>30</b> includes an implied statement offer to eliminate an amount owed <b>25</b> of $25.00 if the consumer agrees to change his long distance provider to NCI. In this case, an agreement to perform the obligation is deemed equivalent to acceptance of the implied statement offer. Determination of a statement offer to associate with a transaction on a billing statement may take into account details of the transaction, the consumer, or other factors. For example, determination of a statement offer may take into account any of those factors discussed above with respect to determination of an offer pointer or determination of an offer to present in response to a received offer pointer. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> As alluded to above, offers and statement offers according to the invention may be associated with a transaction based on an amount owed <b>25</b> associated with the transaction. In one example, a long distance service provider may agree to pay an issuing bank $20.00 for each consumer who accepts a statement offer or an offer requiring the consumer to switch to the service. Based on this agreement, the issuing bank may associate such offers or statement offers with transactions associated with amounts owed in the range of $15.00 to $20.00. The benefit of an offer may be a reduction in an amount owed to a psychologically appealing number, such as $999.99 or $1000.00. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> It should be noted that an offer or a statement offer associated with a transaction in accordance with the invention requires the consumer to fulfill some or no obligation in exchange for some or no benefit. Examples of obligations the consumer might be required to fulfill include: switching long distance telephone service providers; test-driving a particular car; making a minimum purchase at a merchant; answering an on-line survey; and referring a number of people to apply to the issuing bank for new credit card accounts. The obligations may also be associated with a deadline for fulfillment, after which the offer is void and/or a penalty is assessed against the consumer. If the obligation component of an offer requires a consumer to spend an amount, the consumer may be required to charge the amount to the account reflected in the billing statement. Such an obligation would benefit the issuing bank and compliance with the obligation would be easy to track. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> The benefit of an offer or a statement offer to a consumer may be something other than a reduction of an account balance. Other possible benefits include: products and/or services, a reduction of an interest rate on revolving balances; a postponement of a payment due date; a reduction in a minimum payment due; an increased credit limit; an increased grace period; or any other benefit. The benefit of an offer may also be a rebate. For example, a consumer may accept an offer, pay a total amount owed on a credit card account, fulfill the obligation component of the offer, and then receive a rebate check from the controller <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the rebate may come directly from the entity receiving a benefit of the obligation. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The benefit and/or the obligation of an offer or a statement offer may be based on information about a consumer or transactions executed by the consumer. For example, if a consumer has purchased a sweater using his credit card account, the consumer may be presented with an offer or a statement offer which requires the consumer to clean the sweater at a particular cleaner in exchange for a reduction in his account balance equal to the price of the sweater. Information on which benefits and/or obligations may be based also includes all the information which may be taken into account in the generation of offer pointers. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Returning to the general description of the billing statement <b>1</b>, the current charges <b>40</b> reflect a total of the listed amounts owed <b>25</b>. The previous charges owed <b>45</b> reflect charges not listed on the current billing statement <b>1</b> but owed by the consumer, and the finance charge <b>50</b> is a finance charge also owed by the consumer according to terms under which the credit card account was established. The total amount owed <b>55</b> is a sum of the current charges <b>40</b>, the previous charges owed <b>45</b> and the finance charge <b>50</b>. Although only the total amount owed <b>55</b> is associated with alternative payment information <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be noted that any of the current charges <b>40</b>, the previous charges owed <b>45</b> and the finance charge <b>50</b> may also be associated with alternative payment information <b>30</b>. In this regard, the total amount owed <b>55</b>, the current charges <b>40</b>, previous charges owed <b>45</b>, the finance charge <b>50</b> and other information which may be contained in the billing statement <b>1</b> are considered descriptions of transactions, wherein offer pointers, statement offers and/or offers that are associated therewith are also to be considered associated with the transactions described thereby. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> A minimum due <b>60</b> and a due date <b>65</b> are also shown on the billing statement <b>1</b>. Associated with the minimum due <b>60</b> is alternative payment information <b>30</b> in the form of an implied statement offer to discharge the consumer of his duty to pay the minimum due <b>60</b> by the due date <b>65</b>. Acceptance, processing and settlement of such a statement offer is described in detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Elements <b>70</b> through <b>80</b> on the billing statement <b>1</b> may be used by the consumer for record-keeping purposes. Specifically, the modified total amount owed entry area <b>70</b> allows a consumer to record a total amount owed which is different from the total amount owed <b>55</b> due to acceptance of an offer or a statement offer, and the modified minimum due entry area <b>75</b> and the modified due date entry area <b>80</b> allow a consumer to record any modifications to the minimum due <b>60</b> or the due date <b>65</b> resulting from acceptance of an offer or a statement offer. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> It should be noted that even though the billing statement <b>1</b> associates a statement offer or an offer pointer with a transaction by including the statement offer or offer pointer on a same line as other information associated with the transaction, it should be noted that a statement offer or an offer pointer may be associated with a transaction in many other ways according to the present invention. For example, a statement offer or an offer pointer may appear above or below information regarding a transaction to which the statement offer or offer pointer is associated. Moreover, a single statement offer or offer pointer may be associated with one or more listed transactions. In another embodiment, the billing statement <b>1</b> contains a printed explanation of which offer pointers or statement offers are associated with which listed transactions. In other embodiments, a transaction is associated with a statement offer or an offer pointer by placing a number or other symbol next to an element describing the transaction such as the transaction date <b>15</b>, the description <b>20</b> or the amount owed <b>25</b> and by printing the statement offer or offer pointer next to an identical symbol elsewhere in the billing statement, in accompanying papers, in a guide provided to the consumer in hardcopy form, on a Web page, or using any other known method for communicating information to a consumer. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> It should also be noted that a statement offer or an offer pointer may be considered to be associated with a transaction according to the present invention if it is associated with any of the current charges <b>40</b>, the previous charges owed <b>45</b>, the finance charge <b>50</b>, the total amount owed <b>55</b>, the minimum due <b>60</b> and the due date <b>65</b>, since each of these elements are associated with at least one transaction. Moreover, a transaction may be associated with one or more offer pointers and/or one or more statement offers, and one or more offer pointers and/or one or more statement offers may be associated with one or more transactions. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> Although the billing statement <b>1</b> corresponds to a credit card account, the present invention may be used in conjunction with any other type of billing statement, such as those corresponding to utility service, telephone service, cable television service, Internet service, loan installments, car payments, or any other product and/or service for which a consumer is billed, either before or after a purchase. In addition, a billing statement may include reminders to fulfill the obligation components of offers a consumer has previously accepted. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> A billing statement in accordance with the invention need not be in hardcopy form. Rather, such a billing statement may be in any perceptible form, such as an HTML document viewable by a Web browser, a data structure in another form viewable by known or future systems, or an audio file. In this regard, a hardcopy billing statement may contain an offer pointer which a consumer may use to view an electronic version of the billing statement. The consumer may select one or more of the transactions shown in the electronic version using hyperlinks or other techniques, and may, in response, receive offers for reducing an amount owed associated with the selected transaction(s). </p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000"> System </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system for generating billing statements according to embodiments of the present invention. Of course, other systems may be used to practice the invention. As shown, the system includes an issuing bank device <b>100</b> in communication with a controller <b>200</b>. The controller <b>200</b> is also in communication with a subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> and a consumer device <b>400</b>. Multiple physical devices may be used to perform the functions of each element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> according to the present invention, and some or all of these functions may also be performed manually. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> Although one consumer device <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, any number of consumer devices may be in communication with the controller <b>200</b> according to the invention. Similarly, any number of issuing bank devices <b>100</b> or subsidizing merchant devices <b>300</b> may be in communication with the controller <b>200</b>. The latter arrangement is particularly beneficial in a case where the controller <b>200</b> is operated by an entity providing billing statement generation and/or offers via billing statements in accordance with the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Furthermore, although the communication media between the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the controller <b>200</b>, the consumer device <b>400</b> and the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> are represented by dedicated connections, it should be understood that one or more of the illustrated devices may be connected to a network, such as a Local Area Network or a Wide Area Network, to which is also connected at least one of the remaining devices. The network may be an IP-based network, such as the World Wide Web, and/or one or more of a satellite based network, a cellular network, a radio frequency network, a telephone network, a cable television network, or any other communication system for transferring data between locations. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> Those skilled in the art will understand that devices in communication with each other need not be continually transmitting to each other. On the contrary, such devices need only to transmit to each other as necessary, and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example, a device in communication with another device over the World Wide Web may not transmit data to the other for weeks at a time. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> A description of operation of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is set forth below. The description includes many optional and alternative methods which may be used to practice the invention. It should be understood that the invention is not deemed limited to the methods set forth in the description. </p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000"> Billing Statement Generation </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Initially, it is assumed that a consumer has been issued a credit card by an issuing bank operating the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. The credit card may be issued according to any known method, and the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may store information associated with the credit card, such as a consumer name, address and an account number. Of course, in a case that a billing statement for an account other than a credit card account is to be generated according to the invention, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be substituted with a device operated by an entity maintaining the other account. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> As described above, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be in communication with a credit card clearinghouse for obtaining credit card transaction information. In one embodiment, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> receives from the credit card clearinghouse transaction information associated with transactions conducted using credit cards issued by the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. The issuing bank device <b>100</b> may also receive this transaction information directly from sellers conducting the transactions. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Once the transaction information is received, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer. Furthermore, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may provide generation of a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer is an offer to reduce an amount owed associated with the transaction. In the latter case, the offer may be a statement offer or an offer reviewable using an offer pointer. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> In one embodiment, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> generates a billing statement by determining, for at least one transaction included in the received transaction information, an offer pointer and/or a statement offer to associate with the transaction. Rather than determining offer pointers and/or statement offers to associate with a transaction, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may transmit associated transaction information to the controller <b>200</b>, which determines and transmits the offer pointers and/or statement offers back to the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. For example, in a case that a transaction is associated with an amount owed of less than $50.00, the controller <b>200</b> may determine an offer pointer to associate with the transaction that directs the consumer to a Web page presenting offers which, if accepted, result in elimination of amounts owed which are less than $50.00. Such offers may be transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. The issuing bank device <b>100</b> may also store offers received from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. In this regard, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may provide subsidy offers from one or more subsidizing merchants and will be discussed in more detail below. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> In another embodiment, transaction information is received by the controller <b>200</b> directly from sellers or from the credit card clearinghouse, and the determination of statement offers and offer pointers is thereafter performed by the controller <b>200</b>, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> or another device. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Of course, billing statement generation according to the invention may be performed by an entity other than the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. For example, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may transmit received transaction information to an entity which operates as described above to generate billing statements for the issuing bank based on the transaction information. As described with respect to the controller <b>200</b>, the transaction information may be received by the entity directly from sellers or from the credit card clearinghouse. </p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000"> Presenting Offers for Review </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> The determination of offers for consumer review may occur prior to the determination of offer pointers to associate with transactions on a billing statement. That is, the controller <b>200</b> may determine an offer based on transaction information and then determine an offer pointer which can be used by a consumer to review the offer. Using the determined information, the controller <b>200</b> or another device may generate a billing statement associating the offer pointer with the transaction. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> In a case that the issuing bank device <b>100</b> determines an offer pointer based on transaction information, the transaction information may be transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> for determination of a corresponding offer. Alternatively, the offer pointer itself may be transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> for determination of a corresponding offer. Of course, the offer pointer transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> may include transaction information which is used by the controller to determine the offer. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> Offers may also be determined anytime after the billing statement is generated. These embodiments provide flexibility and control in determining an appropriate offer to present to a consumer. For example, a Web page referenced by an offer pointer associated with a transaction on a billing statement may be periodically updated with new offers such that consumers accessing the Web page at different times may review different offers. In another example, an offer corresponding to an offer pointer may be determined only after the offer pointer is used by the consumer device <b>400</b> to access an offer. In one such embodiment, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> generates a billing statement including offer pointers associated with transaction information, wherein the offer pointers can be used by the consumer device <b>400</b> to access a Web page provided by a Web server executing in the controller <b>200</b>. The Web page requests consumer-specific or transaction-specific information from the consumer device <b>400</b>, such as the transaction date, the description, or the amount owed as a result of the transaction, and the controller <b>200</b> thereafter determines and generates an offer to transmit to the consumer device <b>400</b> for review, the offer being based on the received transaction information. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> In a variation of the foregoing, an offer pointer generated by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may indicate transaction information but might not be directly associated with a particular offer. Therefore, when the consumer device <b>400</b> uses the offer pointer to access the controller <b>200</b>, the controller <b>200</b> determines an offer or offers to present to the consumer, the determined offer being based on the transaction information indicated by the offer pointer, and/or other information, such as inventory, market conditions, revenue management information, or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> Of course, offers corresponding to offer pointers may be determined by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> instead of the controller <b>200</b>, or by any other device. In any case, offers and statement offers may be chosen from offers stored in the controller <b>200</b>, received from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or received from another device. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> In one embodiment, the controller <b>200</b> includes systems required to receive requests for offers from the consumer device <b>400</b>. For example, the controller <b>200</b> may be physically connected to the World Wide Web and may maintain a website which can be accessed using URL offer pointers presented in a billing statement. In this regard, the website may also transmit a billing statement to the consumer device <b>400</b> which includes hyperlink offer pointers selectable in order to request offers for review. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> The controller <b>200</b> may also connect to the telephone network and maintain a VR unit to respond to calls from the consumer device <b>400</b> to a telephone number offer pointer listed in a billing statement. If such a call is received, the controller <b>200</b> presents an appropriate offer to the consumer device <b>400</b> for review. As previously described, an appropriate offer may be determined based on the telephone number, on consumer responses to a program executed by the VR unit, on a dialed code or extension number which specifies a particular offer or encodes transaction information, or on any other considerations for determining offers mentioned herein. In one embodiment, the controller <b>200</b> receives offers from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> and determines an offer to present to the consumer based on the received offers. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> In some embodiments, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may inform the controller <b>200</b> of which offer pointers were included in billing statements of particular consumers. Accordingly, if a consumer attempts to review offers by accessing the controller <b>200</b> using an offer pointer which was not included in his billing statement, the controller <b>200</b> informs the consumer that the offer pointer is not valid. This feature may serve to prevent a consumer from trying to obtain offers that are not meant for him. </p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000"> Receiving Acceptance of an Offer </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> Once an offer is presented to a consumer for review through the consumer device <b>400</b>, the controller <b>200</b> may provide the consumer with means for accepting the offer. For example, in a case that an offer is presented via a Web page, the Web page may include an &#x201c;accept&#x201d; button selectable by the consumer using the consumer device <b>400</b>. Upon receiving an indication that the &#x201c;accept&#x201d; button was selected, the controller <b>200</b> determines that the offer was accepted. If an offer is presented via a recording played by a VR unit in the controller <b>200</b>, a consumer may transmit his acceptance by voice, or by pressing an indicated combination of keys on the consumer device <b>400</b> (e.g., a telephone) to accept the offer. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> Prior to accepting an offer, a consumer may, in one embodiment, obtain further information about the offer. For example, a &#x201c;details&#x201d; button on a Web page presenting the offer may be selected using the consumer device <b>400</b> and, in response, the controller <b>200</b> may transmit a Web page to the consumer device <b>400</b> including further details about the offer. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> A consumer may also enter into a negotiation process with the controller <b>200</b> prior to accepting an offer. For example, the controller <b>200</b> may present an offer to a consumer through the consumer device <b>400</b> which will eliminate $20 from the consumer's account. Next, the consumer may ask that the offer eliminate $30 from the account. The controller <b>200</b> may reject the new terms, accept the new terms, or present another offer. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> In one embodiment, a consumer is presented with the option of selecting one or more offers from amongst several offers. For example, the consumer may accept three presented offers having associated benefits totalling an amount owed due to a particular transaction. In some embodiments, the associated benefits may exceed the amount owed, and may even exceed a total amount owed to the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> Furthermore, the acceptance of some offers may affect a consumer's ability to accept other offers. In this regard, if a consumer accepts an offer to eliminate a $20 amount owed from the consumer's account, the consumer may thereafter be unable to review other offers to eliminate the same amount owed. On the other hand, a consumer's acceptance of one offer may trigger the controller <b>200</b> to present other offers to the consumer, either related or unrelated to the accepted offer. For example, a consumer who accepts an offer having an obligation to try a home burglar alarm system for one month might be presented with an offer to sell a car alarm system. </p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000"> Settlement </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> Once the controller <b>200</b> has received an indication of the consumer's acceptance of an offer, the controller <b>200</b> may transmit to the consumer device <b>400</b> an indication of a new amount owed by the conswner in view of the accepted offer. The transmission may include a modified total amount owed and/or a modified minimum amount due, as described with respect to entry areas <b>70</b> and <b>75</b> of the billing statement <b>1</b>. For example, if a consumer accepts an offer to switch long distance service to NCI, the controller <b>200</b> might transmit to the consumer device <b>400</b> a message such as &#x201c;Ignore the charge for that suit. Your new, reduced balance is $172.50 and your minimum payment due is $12.03.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> Additionally, the consumer may be instructed to check a check box on his billing statement indicating that a corresponding amount owed need not be paid, and/or to write a modified total amount due on the billing statement. These actions may serve to alert the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to the details of the offer. In other embodiments, these actions are immaterial except in providing the consumer with a sense of relief, accomplishment, or gratification. The controller <b>200</b> may also provide a code to a consumer after the consumer has accepted an offer, with instructions to write the code on his billing statement. The code may allow the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to verify that a party other than the consumer has assumed part of the debt reflected in the billing statement. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> The controller <b>200</b> may also transmit a new amount owed, a modified total amount owed, a modified minimum amount due and/or any other account information which may have changed due to the accepted offer to the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. The issuing bank device <b>100</b> may then update corresponding stored account information based on the received information. Alternatively, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be notified that an offer has been accepted, and may calculate and update corresponding stored account information accordingly. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> In the case of an offer received by the controller <b>200</b> from a subsidizing merchant and presented to a consumer, the controller <b>200</b> may notify the subsidizing merchant once the offer is accepted. For example, if a long distance telephone service provider has input an offer to the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> and the offer is transmitted therefrom to the controller <b>200</b>, the offer may be transmitted to a consumer during operation of a system according to the invention. If the offer is subsequently accepted, the controller <b>200</b> may notify the service provider of the acceptance through the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. In the case that the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> collects offers from more than one subsidizing merchant, the controller <b>200</b> may notify the service provider directly of the acceptance. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> Upon receiving notification of the acceptance, the subsidizing merchant may then execute any actions needed for the consumer to fulfill any agreed to obligation. For example, a long distance service provider may switch a consumer to its long distance service once notified that the consumer has accepted an offer including an obligation to switch to the long distance service. The provider may, however, wait for the consumer to perform some action, such as confirming the acceptance by mail, before switching the consumer to its service. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In some embodiments, the controller <b>200</b> instructs the consumer to notify the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or the subsidizing merchant of any obligation included in an accepted offer. In other embodiments, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or the subsidizing merchant may not be notified of the accepted offer until after the consumer has fulfilled a corresponding obligation. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> After an offer has been accepted by a consumer using the consumer device <b>400</b>, the controller <b>200</b> may notify the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to apply any benefit associated with the offer to the consumer's account. For example, if an offer specifies that an amount owed associated with a transaction will be eliminated in exchange for performance of a particular obligation, the controller <b>200</b> notifies the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to eliminate the amount owed from the consumer's account. In some embodiments, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> is reimbursed for the benefit by the controller <b>200</b>, either before or after the corresponding obligation is performed. If the benefit received by the consumer is not strictly monetary (e.g. a reduced interest rate on an outstanding balance), then the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, or some other entity, may use a formula in order to determine a monetary value of the benefit, which is paid to the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> It should be noted that the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be reimbursed for an amount less than or greater than the monetary value of the benefit applied to the consumer's account. For example, the controller <b>200</b> may pay the issuing bank device <b>100</b> an additional fee for the right to print statement offers and offer pointers on billing statements issued by or for the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the controller <b>200</b> may extract a fee from the issuing bank device <b>100</b> in exchange for providing consumers with incentive to open credit card accounts with the issuing bank. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"> The controller <b>200</b> may recoup the money paid to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> as described above. In this case, the controller <b>200</b> may be reimbursed by the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or by whatever other entity or entities received a benefit from the obligation. The controller <b>200</b> may be paid more or less than the controller <b>200</b> paid the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. For example, the controller <b>200</b> may be paid more for providing the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or other entity with a new customer. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> In other embodiments, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> pays the issuing bank device <b>100</b> directly, rather than paying the controller <b>200</b> after the controller <b>200</b> has paid the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. Once again, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may pay the issuing bank device <b>100</b> more or less than the benefit applied to the consumer's account by the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> The controller <b>200</b> may require notification from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or other entity that an obligation has been performed before notifying the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to apply a corresponding benefit to the consumer's account. Also, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> might not pay the controller <b>200</b> until the consumer has fulfilled the obligation. If an obligation is associated with a deadline for completion and has not been fulfilled by the deadline, the associated offer may be revoked and any benefit previously applied to the consumer's account may be removed. In addition, a penalty charge might be added to the account. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> In an example of settlement according to one embodiment of the invention, a consumer accepts an offer requiring him to test drive a car in exchange for the removal of a $23.00 charge from his credit card account. The offer was provided to the controller by the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>, which is operated by the manufacturer of the car. After receiving the acceptance, the controller <b>200</b> pays $23.00 to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> and the issuing bank device <b>100</b> removes the charge from the account. However, the manufacturer does not pay $23.00 to the controller <b>200</b> until the consumer has test-driven the car. If the consumer fails to test-drive the car, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may pay $23.00 back to the controller <b>100</b> and add the charge back to the account. In this regard, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may reserve an amount of unused credit on the credit card account equal to $23.00. Thus, the charge can be reinstated on the account without exceeding the account's credit limit. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"> One or more of the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the controller <b>200</b>, and the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may verify that a consumer has fulfilled an obligation under an offer. In one embodiment the controller <b>200</b> and/or the issuing bank device <b>100</b> receive verification from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> that the obligation has been fulfilled. Such an embodiment may be most practical in a case that the obligation benefits of the entity operating the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or to an entity providing offers which are transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> through the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. In another embodiment, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or other entity may provide to the consumer a receipt or a code after fulfillment of the obligation which can be transmitted from the consumer device <b>400</b> to the controller <b>200</b> or to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> and verified thereby. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"> Of course, the consumer may fulfill his obligation directly with the issuing bank device <b>100</b> or with the controller <b>200</b>. For example, the obligation may require the consumer to use the consumer device <b>400</b> to access a website maintained by the controller <b>200</b>, and to answer a number of survey questions presented thereon. In this case, the controller <b>200</b> detects that the consumer has fulfilled his obligation once an answer to each question has been received. </p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> Issuing Bank Device </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of the issuing bank device <b>100</b> according to the present invention. As described above, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be operated by an entity which issues credit cards to consumers, receives credit card transaction information and/or generates billing statements for delivery to consumers. The issuing bank device <b>100</b> may be implemented using a network server, a dedicated hardware circuit, an appropriately-programmed general-purpose computer, another electronic, mechanical or electromechanical device, or any combination thereof. In addition, the elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be located entirely within a single computer or other computing device, or connected to each other by remote communication media such as a serial port cable, telephone line or radio frequency transceiver. In one embodiment, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> comprises one or more computers and peripheral devices. </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"> The issuing bank device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a processor <b>110</b>, such as one or more RISC&#xae; processors. The processor <b>110</b> is coupled to a communication port <b>120</b> through which the issuing bank device <b>100</b> communicates with other devices. For example, according to one embodiment, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> receives transaction information from a credit card clearinghouse and transmits transaction information to the controller <b>200</b> through the communication port <b>120</b>. The issuing bank device <b>100</b> may also receive information regarding accepted offers from the controller <b>200</b> over the communication port <b>120</b>. Accordingly, the communication port <b>120</b> is configured, in one embodiment, to communicate using hardware and software protocols of the media connecting the communication port <b>120</b> with other devices with which the issuing bank device <b>120</b> communicates. It should be noted that the issuing bank device <b>100</b> may also communicate with locally-attached devices through the communication port <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"> Also connected to the processor <b>110</b> are an input device <b>125</b>, a display <b>130</b> and a printer <b>135</b>. The input device <b>125</b> may be any device for inputting data, such as keyboard, a touch screen, a mouse, a voice input device, an infrared port, or the like. The input device <b>125</b> may be used by issuing bank personnel to enter data used by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention, such as transaction information, consumer data, rules for determining offers and offer pointers, offer information, or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"> The display <b>130</b> is used to output graphics and text and may be a CRT computer monitor, a flat panel display or another type of display device. Graphics, text or other data may also be output by the printer <b>135</b> in hardcopy format. The printer <b>135</b> may also be used to print hardcopies of billing statements generated by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> or any other device according to the present invention. The printer may be any type of printer, such as a laser printer, a thermal printer, an inkjet printer, and a dot-matrix printer. </p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"> The processor <b>110</b> is also in communication with a data storage device <b>140</b>. The data storage device <b>140</b> is generally a data memory and may include any combination of magnetic, optical and/or semiconductor memory. The data storage device <b>140</b> may also include, for example, Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a compact disc and/or a hard disk. The data storage device <b>140</b> stores a program <b>150</b> of processor-executable process steps. The program <b>150</b> may be stored in a compressed, uncompiled and/or encrypted format. The program <b>150</b> may be stored in the storage device <b>140</b> during manufacture of the storage device <b>140</b>, may be downloaded from a compact disc or other computer-readable medium, or may be retrieved from a remote or local source through the communication port <b>120</b> in the form of a signal having the program <b>150</b> encoded thereon. The processor <b>110</b> executes the process steps of the program <b>150</b> and thereby operates in accordance with the present invention, and particularly in accordance with the steps described herein with respect to the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. In one example, the process steps of the program <b>150</b> are executed by the processor <b>110</b> to generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer. In another example, the processor <b>110</b> executes steps of the program <b>150</b> to generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer is an offer to reduce an amount owed associated with the transaction. </p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"> According to one embodiment, the steps of the program <b>150</b> are transferred from the data storage device <b>140</b> into a main memory, such as a RAM, and executed therefrom by the processor <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114"> The storage device <b>140</b> also stores a consumer account database <b>160</b> and a transaction database <b>170</b>. Briefly, the consumer account database <b>160</b> stores information concerning consumers holding accounts at the issuing bank, such as account number, name, transaction information, etc. The transaction database <b>170</b> includes details of transactions executed by consumers using credit cards issued by the issuing bank. Each of these databases will be described in detail below. </p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"> Controller </p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates several elements of the controller <b>200</b>. As described above, the controller <b>200</b> is used in one embodiment to generate billing statements according to the present invention. The controller <b>200</b> may also be used to receive requests to review offers using offer pointers, to determine offers to present to consumers, and to transmit the determined offers to the consumer. The controller <b>200</b> also controls, in one embodiment, settlement of accounts between consumers, the issuing bank and subsidizing merchants. </p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"> The controller <b>200</b> includes a processor <b>205</b> connected to a communication port <b>210</b>. The communication port <b>210</b> is configured to transmit data to and to receive data from the issuing bank device <b>100</b> via a network connection, such as the World Wide Web, via an intermediate device, via a dedicated connection, or via another connection. Similarly, the communication port <b>210</b> is configured to communicate with the consumer device <b>400</b> and the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, the consumer device <b>400</b> communicates with the controller <b>200</b> via the World Wide Web and, in another embodiment, the consumer device <b>400</b> communicates with the controller <b>200</b> via the telephone network. The subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may also communicate with controller <b>200</b> via any type of network. </p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"> Also connected to the processor <b>205</b> are an input device <b>215</b>, a display device <b>220</b> and a printer <b>225</b>. The input device <b>215</b> may be used by an entity operating the controller <b>200</b> to input data and instructions to the controller <b>200</b>. The input device <b>215</b> may also be used by consumers to transmit information needed to receive an offer from the controller <b>200</b> in a case that the controller <b>200</b> is a device which is accessible to consumers, such as a publicly-located kiosk. In this regard, the display <b>220</b> may be used to display offers to a consumer for review. The printer <b>225</b> may be used to generate hardcopies of billing statements in accordance with the present invention, particularly in embodiments wherein the controller <b>200</b> generates the billing statements. The printer <b>225</b> may also be used to generate reports from data collected by the controller <b>200</b>. It should be noted that the input device <b>215</b>, the display <b>220</b> and the printer <b>225</b> may comprise any of the input devices, displays, or printers described above. </p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"> A storage device <b>230</b> is also connected to the processor <b>205</b>, and stores data and processor-executable process steps for the operation of the controller <b>200</b>. The storage device <b>230</b> stores, in particular, a program <b>235</b> of processor-executable process steps which may be executed by the processor <b>205</b> to provide functionality based on embodiments of the invention in which the controller <b>200</b> is utilized. For example, in a case that offers are determined by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> and billing statements are printed by the controller <b>200</b>, the processor <b>205</b> may execute the process steps of the program <b>235</b> to receive offer information from the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, to generate offer pointers based on the received offer information, to generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review the offer information. Of course, since, as described above, functions performed by the controller <b>200</b> depend upon the embodiment in which the controller <b>200</b> is operated, the program <b>235</b> may include process steps different from or in addition to those described above. The process steps of the program <b>235</b> may be stored in the storage device <b>230</b> during its manufacture, may be downloaded from a compact disc or other computer-readable medium, or may be retrieved from a remote or local source through the communication port <b>210</b> embodied in a signal having the process steps encoded therein. </p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"> The storage device <b>230</b> also stores: i) a rules database <b>240</b> containing rules for generating offers, statement offers and/or offer pointers based on transaction information; ii) an offer database <b>250</b> containing offer details; iii) a central consumer database <b>260</b> including data specific to particular consumers; iv) a subsidizing merchant database <b>270</b> including subsidy offer information; v) an offer tracking database <b>280</b> for assisting in tracking the fulfillment and settlement of accepted offers; and vi) an issuing bank database <b>290</b> including data facilitating communication and settlement with one or more issuing bank devices <b>100</b> in communication with the controller <b>200</b>. Details and use of each database are explained below. </p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"> Subsidizing Merchant Device </p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a block diagram of several components of the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. The subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> is used in some embodiments to communicate subsidy offers to the controller <b>200</b> and to track fulfillment of agreed to obligations. The subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may be operated by a single merchant and may store offers from only that merchant or from several different merchants. In this regard, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may be in communication with one or more merchant devices (not shown), through which individual merchants may submit offers to the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"> As shown, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> includes a processor <b>310</b> for executing processor-executable process steps and for controlling components in communication therewith. In this regard, a communication port <b>320</b> is in communication with the processor <b>310</b>. Data such as subsidy offer information may be transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> over the communication port <b>320</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"> Also connected to the processor <b>310</b> are an input device <b>330</b> and a display <b>340</b>, which may used by personnel operating the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> to enter subsidy offer information, consumer information or the like into the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, such subsidy offer information is transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> for storage in the offer database <b>250</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"> Storage device <b>350</b> is also in communication with the processor <b>310</b>, and stores at least a program <b>360</b> of processor-executable process steps, a consumer database <b>370</b> and a subsidy offer database <b>380</b>. The process steps of the program <b>360</b> may be executed by the processor <b>310</b> to receive a request from the controller <b>200</b> for subsidy offer information, to retrieve subsidy offer information from the subsidy offer database <b>380</b>, and to transmit subsidy offer information to the controller <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the processor <b>310</b> executes the process steps of the program <b>360</b> to receive consumer information, and to determine subsidy offer information from the subsidy offer database <b>380</b> to transmit based on the consumer information and based on the information stored in the consumer database <b>370</b>. For example, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may transmit one subsidy offer if it is indicated in the consumer database <b>370</b> that the consumer to whom the offer will be presented is a preferred consumer, and a different subsidy offer to the consumer if it is indicated that the consumer is not a preferred consumer. </p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"> Consumer Device </p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a block diagram of several components of the consumer device <b>400</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The consumer device <b>400</b> may be used to view a billing statement, to request to review offers using an offer pointer printed on a billing statement in association with a transaction, and/or to accept offers to reduce an amount owed associated with a transaction contained in a billing statement. </p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"> The consumer device <b>400</b> may be any device or combination of devices usable by a consumer to request offers for review using an offer pointer and to review offers presented in response. For example, the consumer device <b>400</b> may be one or more of a dedicated kiosk, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, an Internet kiosk, a telephone, a set-top box, a pager, a cellular phone, a payphone, a video game, an automated teller machine, a slot machine, a watch, a vending machine, an in-car communication system, or any other device adapted to communicate with the controller <b>200</b> over whatever communication media exist between the device <b>400</b> and the controller <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, however, the consumer device <b>400</b> is a device for communication with the controller <b>200</b> over the World Wide Web. </p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"> More specifically, the consumer device <b>400</b> includes a processor <b>410</b> in communication with a communication port <b>420</b>. The communication port <b>420</b> is configured to transmit data to the controller <b>200</b> via the World Wide Web over any suitable network or networks and to receive data therefrom. Also connected to the processor <b>410</b> are an input device <b>430</b> for receiving data and instructions from a consumer, a display <b>440</b> for displaying data to the consumer, and a printer <b>430</b> for creating a hardcopy of data, such as of details of an offer which has been accepted by the consumer. </p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"> A storage device <b>460</b> is also in communication with the processor <b>410</b>, storing processor-executable process steps of an operating system <b>470</b> and of a Web browser <b>480</b>. The process steps of the operating system <b>470</b>, such as the Palm&#xae; operating system, are executed by the processor <b>410</b> to control basic operations of the consumer device <b>400</b>. The process steps of the Web browser <b>480</b> may be executed by the processor <b>410</b> to provide communication between the consumer device <b>400</b> and a Web server executing within the controller <b>200</b> via the World Wide Web. Of course, depending on the communication media disposed between the consumer device <b>400</b> and the controller <b>200</b>, other known processor-executable process steps or hardware may be needed for the consumer device <b>400</b> to communicate with the controller <b>200</b>. For example, in a case that a telephone number offer pointer is included in a billing statement in association with a transaction, the consumer device <b>400</b> need only be a device capable of communicating over the telephone network. </p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000"> Databases </p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"> The databases described in detail below are depicted in tabular form with sample entries in the accompanying figures. In this regard, and as will be understood by those skilled in the art, the schematic illustrations and accompanying descriptions of the databases presented herein are merely intended to demonstrate operable systems for associating and storing information which may be used in accordance with the present invention. A number of other data structures may be employed beside those suggested by the tables shown. Similarly, the illustrated entries of the databases represent sample information only; those skilled in that art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those illustrated. </p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"> Consumer Account Database </p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a tabular representation of a portion of the consumer account database <b>160</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The consumer account database <b>160</b> is used to store information regarding credit card accounts issued by the issuing bank. It should be noted that in a case that the issuing bank contracts with a third party to generate billing statements and/or to manage consumer accounts, the consumer account database <b>160</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be located at and controlled by the third party. </p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"> Each record shown in the illustrated portion of the consumer account database <b>160</b> includes several fields, the fields specifying: i) a consumer identifier <b>161</b> used to identify a consumer with whom a record is associated; ii) a name <b>162</b> of the associated consumer; iii) an address <b>163</b> to which billing statements may be delivered and at which the consumer may be reached; iv) a credit card account number <b>164</b> identifying a credit card account associated with the consumer; v) an amount owed by the consumer <b>165</b> for transactions posted to the credit card account; vi) a minimum amount due <b>166</b> associated with the credit card account; vii) a due date <b>167</b> by which the associated minimum amount due <b>166</b> must be received by the issuing bank device <b>100</b>; and viii) an amount owed by controller <b>168</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"> The consumer identifier <b>161</b> and the credit card account number <b>164</b> may be generated by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> upon creating an account for a consumer. In this regard, a request or an application to open a credit account with the issuing bank may be received by the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the application including a consumer name and address. Accordingly, the received name and address information is stored as a name <b>162</b> and an address <b>163</b>, and a consumer identifier <b>161</b> and a credit card account number <b>164</b> are generated and stored in associated fields of a record as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It should be noted that a credit card account number <b>164</b> may be used in place of a consumer identifier <b>161</b>. However, in a case that a consumer has been issued more than one credit card account, it may be convenient to reference all the consumer's accounts using a single consumer identifier <b>161</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"> In a case that the name <b>162</b> and the address <b>163</b> are obtained through a written application form, the information may be entered into the consumer account database <b>160</b> by an employee operating the input device <b>125</b> of the issuing bank device <b>100</b>. The associated consumer identifier <b>161</b> and credit card account number <b>164</b> are preferably generated by process steps stored in the data storage device <b>140</b> and executed by the processor <b>110</b> or may also be input via the input device <b>125</b>. Of course, other methods for receiving consumer information and for generating associated account information may be used in practicing the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"> The amount owed by the consumer <b>165</b> reflects a current balance of an associated account. The amount owed by consumer <b>165</b> may reflect a total of all charges posted to the associated account for which the consumer has not yet paid the issuing bank. As described in detail below, the amount owed by consumer <b>165</b> may be less than the total of all charges for which the consumer has not yet paid in a case that the consumer has accepted an offer to reduce an amount owed according to the present invention. For example, in a case that unpaid charges associated with an account equal $238.76 but the consumer has accepted an offer to switch long distance services in exchange for $40.00, the amount owed by consumer <b>165</b> will reflect $198.76 ($238.76-$40.00). </p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"> The minimum amount due <b>166</b> and due date <b>167</b> associated with a record indicate, respectively, a minimum amount which is due to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> and a date by which the minimum amount is due. According to many types of credit card accounts, a consumer will be charged a late fee if the issuing bank device <b>100</b> does not receive the minimum amount due <b>166</b> by the due date <b>167</b>. As will be described in detail below, the minimum amount due <b>166</b> and the due date <b>167</b> each may be modified based on acceptance of an offer by a consumer in accordance with the present invention. In one example, a minimum amount due <b>166</b> of $20.00 may be reduced to $15.00 in a case that a consumer accepts an offer to receive two free magazines. As previously described, such an offer may be presented as a statement offer in association with a transaction on a billing statement or may be reviewed by a consumer using an offer pointer associated with a transaction on a billing statement. </p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"> The amount owed by controller <b>168</b> indicates, in one embodiment, an amount previously owed by a consumer but now owed to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> by the controller <b>200</b>. Using the example given with respect to the amount owed by consumer <b>165</b>, the $40.00 offered to the consumer in exchange for an agreement to switch long distance services is subtracted from the amount owed by consumer <b>165</b> and added to an associated amount owed by controller <b>168</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"> Transaction Database </p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"> A tabular representation of a portion of the transaction database <b>170</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The transaction database <b>170</b> is used to record transaction information related to credit card accounts issued by the issuing bank. Each record of the transaction database <b>170</b> according to the illustrated embodiment includes fields specifying: i) a transaction identifier <b>171</b>; ii) a credit card account number <b>172</b>; iii) a transaction description <b>173</b>; iv) a transaction date <b>174</b>; v) an amount due <b>175</b>; and vi) a merchant identifier <b>176</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"> As described above, the data stored in the transaction database <b>170</b> may be received by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> from a credit card clearinghouse, from another central collector and repository of credit card transaction information, directly from merchants executing transactions using credit cards issued by the issuing bank, directly from consumers holding credit card accounts with the issuing bank, from other sources, or from any combination of the above. In some embodiments, only transaction information relating to credit card accounts issued by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> is stored in the transaction database <b>170</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"> The transaction identifier <b>171</b> may be assigned to a set of information received by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> relating to one transaction. Accordingly, the transaction identifier <b>171</b> provides simple access to information associated with the transaction. The credit card account number <b>172</b> identifies the credit card account used in the transaction, and the transaction description <b>173</b> provides a description of a subject transaction. The description <b>173</b> may identify a purchased product and/or service to varying degrees of specificity. The transaction date <b>174</b> and the amount due <b>175</b> reflect a date on which the transaction occurred and a corresponding amount which was charged to the credit card account. Finally, the merchant identifier <b>176</b> is a code identifying a merchant from whom the product and/or service was purchased. </p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"> In one embodiment, a billing statement corresponding to a particular credit card account is generated by examining the transaction database <b>170</b> to identify each record in which the credit card account is identified in the credit card account number field <b>172</b> and which is associated with a transaction date <b>174</b> falling within a range of dates with which the billing statement is concerned. Transaction information of each identified record may then be used in any of the manners described above to generate a billing statement including offer pointers and/or statement offers. </p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"> Rules Database </p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a tabular representation of a portion of the rules database <b>240</b> of the controller <b>200</b>. The controller <b>200</b> may use the information stored in the rules database <b>240</b> to determine a statement offer, an offer pointer and/or an offer to associate with a transaction on a billing statement. The determination may, as described above, be based on information corresponding to the transaction. Therefore, utilization of the rules database <b>240</b> as described herein advantageously allows a consumer to review offers deemed appropriate to particular transactions. In a case that the issuing bank device <b>100</b> or another device is used to make such determinations, the rules database <b>240</b> may be stored in or otherwise accessible by that device. </p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"> The rules database <b>240</b> includes fields specifying: i) a rule identifier <b>241</b>; ii) an amount owed range <b>242</b>; iii) a transaction category <b>243</b>; iv) a merchant <b>244</b>; and v) alternative payment information <b>245</b>. In the present embodiment, the information stored in the rules database <b>240</b> may be communicated to the controller <b>200</b> by any device in direct or indirect communication with the controller <b>200</b>, such as the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or the input device <b>215</b> of the controller <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"> The rule identifier <b>241</b> of a given record is a code identifying a rule which is the subject of the record. The amount owed range <b>242</b> of a record may be used to determine whether to associate alternative payment information <b>245</b> of the record with a transaction on a billing statement. Specifically, in a case that an amount charged to an account due to a transaction is within an amount owed range <b>242</b>, alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with the amount owed range <b>242</b> may be associated with the transaction on a billing statement. Similarly, if a transaction satisfies the transaction category <b>243</b> and the merchant <b>244</b> of a record in the rules database <b>240</b>, the transaction may be associated on a billing statement with alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with the record. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, alternative payment information <b>245</b> of a record may be associated with a transaction on a billing statement even if the amount owed, transaction category and/or merchant associated with the transaction do not comply exactly with respective values in the rules database <b>240</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"> It should be noted that the rules database <b>240</b> may store many other criteria based on which alternative payment information <b>245</b> is selected for association with a transaction on a billing statement. For example, the rules database <b>240</b> may include fields specifying a payment due date, characteristics or ratings of the consumer associated with the transaction, inventory levels of certain products, market economic indicators, subsidy payments paid by offer providers, or other characteristics. The rules database <b>240</b> may also include a field to specify types of transaction descriptions, such as current charges, previous charges, finance charges, total amount owed, minimum amount due, due date, etc. Using values such as these, alternative payment information <b>245</b> may be explicitly associated with particular types of transaction descriptions on a billing statement. </p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"> The alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with a record may include an offer, an offer pointer and/or a statement offer. As described above, the alternative payment information <b>245</b> may be associated with a transaction on a billing statement if criteria associated with the alternative payment information <b>245</b> is satisfied by the transaction. As shown, alternative payment information <b>245</b> including an offer pointer may include a wildcard which is assigned a value prior to associating the offer pointer and the assigned value with a transaction on a billing statement. For example, the offer pointer may be a URL with a CGI extension &#x201c;amountowed=[amountowed]&#x201d;. In this case, &#x201c;[amountowed]&#x201d; is substituted with an actual amount owed associated with a transaction prior to associating the URL and extension with the transaction on a billing statement. An offer pointer included in alternative payment information <b>245</b> may refer to a particular offer or may be used to access an offer which may change periodically due to various factors. </p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151"> Alternative payment information <b>245</b> may also include an offer in the form of an expression of an agreement to perform an obligation along with a device such as a checkbox by which a consumer may indicate agreement. When associated with a transaction on a billing statement, such alternative payment information <b>245</b> comprises an offer to eliminate an amount owed associated with the transaction upon agreement to the obligation. In other embodiments, alternative payment information <b>245</b> may include an offer using language such as &#x201c;BOL will pay the entire minimum amount due this month if you agree to sign up for one year of internet service&#x201d; along with a checkbox for indicating agreement. </p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"> It should be noted that a particular transaction may satisfy the criteria of more than one rule in the rules database <b>240</b>. In such a case, the alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with each satisfied rule may be associated with the transaction on a billing statement, or some system of arbitration may be employed to select one or more of the alternative payment information <b>245</b>. Such arbitration may be based on qualities of the associated consumer, of the offers referenced by the information <b>245</b>, other factors or combinations of the foregoing. </p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"> Offer Database </p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"> A tabular representation of a portion of the offer database <b>250</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The offer database <b>250</b> stores information regarding offers presented to consumers in accordance with the present invention. The information stored in the offer database <b>250</b> may be received from one or more subsidizing merchant devices <b>300</b>, from the input device <b>215</b> of the controller <b>200</b> or from another device. The records in the offer database <b>250</b> specify: i) an offer identifier <b>251</b> identifying an offer; ii) a subsidizing merchant identifier <b>252</b> identifying a merchant providing the offer; iii) a benefit <b>253</b> included in the offer; iv) an obligation <b>254</b> included in the offer and in exchange for which the associated benefit will be provided and v) offer rules <b>255</b> specifying various conditions or instructions relating to the offer. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the benefit <b>253</b>, the obligation <b>254</b> and the offer rules <b>255</b> may take many different forms in accordance with the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"> As an example of usage of the offer database <b>250</b>, a consumer operates the consumer device <b>400</b> to accesses the controller <b>200</b> via a URL printed on a billing statement in association with a transaction. In a case that the URL references a &#x201c;medium charge&#x201d; Web page, the controller <b>200</b>, through execution of the process steps by the processor <b>205</b> and based on the offer rules <b>255</b>, identifies offer identifier <b>251</b> <b>999333</b>O and presents an offer offering the consumer $40.00 if the consumer switches long distance service to NCI within 30 days of accepting the offer. </p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"> In another example, a consumer may dial a telephone number printed on a billing statement in association with a transaction, and thereby access a VR system provided by the controller <b>200</b>. Upon accessing the system, the consumer enters a code printed adjacent to the telephone number on the billing statement. The controller <b>200</b> decodes the data to determine that the transaction included a purchase at a department store. Accordingly, the controller <b>200</b> identifies the offer identifier <b>251</b> <b>888445</b>O and presents the consumer with a playback of an audio recording offering the consumer to pay an amount due associated with the transaction up to $50.00 if the consumer makes at least a $50.00 purchase at Max 6<sup>th </sup>Avenue department store within 14 days of accepting the offer. It should be noted that the controller <b>200</b> may identify that the consumer has made a department store purchase in several other ways. In one envisioned embodiment, the telephone number which is associated with the transaction is associated only with transactions involving a department store purchase. Accordingly, the controller <b>200</b> assumes that all requests received through the telephone number are associated with transactions including a department store purchase. Alternatively, the consumer may select from a menu presented by the VR system to indicate that the transaction included a department store purchase. </p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"> A benefit <b>253</b> and an associated obligation <b>254</b> may also be used to associate a transaction with a statement offer. Specifically, based on the record associated with the offer identifier <b>251</b> <b>777666</b>O, a statement offer such as &#x201c;I agree to make a minimum $50.00 purchase at Max 6<sup>th </sup>Avenue within 14 days of accepting this offer&#x201d; may be associated with a transaction associated with an amount owed of less than $50.00. </p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"> As described above with respect to the rules database <b>240</b>, more than one offer of the offer database <b>250</b> may be presented to a consumer based on associated offer rules <b>255</b>. For example, in a case that a consumer requests to review offers using an offer pointer which references a &#x201c;medium charge&#x201d; Web page, and a transaction associated with the offer pointer was a department store purchase, offers corresponding to offer identifiers <b>251</b> <b>999333</b>O and <b>777666</b>O may be presented. Alternatively, only one of the offers may be presented based on an arbitration system such as that described above with respect to the rules database <b>240</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"> Central Consumer Database </p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a tabular representation of a portion of the central consumer database <b>260</b> of the controller <b>200</b>. The central consumer database <b>260</b> is used to store consumer-specific data which may be used to determine statement offers and offer pointers to associate with a transaction on a billing statement and/or offers to present to consumers. Each record of the central consumer database <b>260</b> specifies: i) a consumer identifier <b>261</b> identifying a consumer who is the subject of the record; ii) a name <b>262</b> of the consumer; iii) credit card account numbers <b>263</b> associated with the consumer; iv) an acceptance percentage <b>264</b> associated with the consumer; and v) a fraud flag <b>265</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"> The credit card account numbers <b>263</b> associated with a consumer in the central consumer database <b>260</b> may reflect credit card accounts maintained by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> or by other issuing bank devices operated by other issuing banks. Such a scenario may occur in a case where the controller <b>200</b> provides functionality according to the invention for several different issuing banks. </p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"> The acceptance percentage <b>264</b> reflects a percentage of offers which are accepted by the consumer who is the subject of the record, and the fraud flag <b>265</b> indicates whether the consumer poses some type of risk or unreliability. The acceptance percentage <b>264</b> may reflect a percentage of total offers presented to the consumer, as statement offers or using an offer pointer, which are accepted by the consumer, a number of accepted offers as a percentage of billing statements transmitted to the consumer, or some other percentage reflective of accepted offers. </p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"> During use, a consumer associated with a low acceptance percentage <b>264</b> may be presented with an offer pointer specific to consumers having a low acceptance percentage <b>264</b>. Such an offer pointer may reference a Web page including offers which are more enticing than those accessed using an offer pointer presented to consumers having a higher acceptance percentage <b>264</b>. Similarly, subsidizing merchants may specify, through offer rules <b>255</b> stored in the offer database <b>250</b>, that certain offers should not be provided to consumers associated with a fraud flag <b>265</b> of &#x201c;yes&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"> Of course, many other types of information may be stored in the central consumer database <b>260</b> based on which statement offers, offers and/or offer pointers are presented. For example, stored in association with each consumer identifier <b>261</b> may be a rating such as &#x201c;gold&#x201d;, &#x201c;silver&#x201d;, &#x201c;bronze&#x201d;, and/or the consumer's credit rating. </p>

The information stored in the subsidizing merchant database <b>270</b> may be received by the controller <b>200</b> from the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>, from several subsidizing merchant devices, and/or from the input device <b>215</b> of the controller <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167"> The subsidizing merchant identifier <b>271</b> uniquely identifies a particular merchant, and the subsidizing merchant name/description <b>272</b> provides the name of the merchant and a description of the products and/or services sold by the merchant. The remaining budget <b>273</b> reflects the availability of subsidy offers from the merchant. For example, a subsidizing merchant may provide offers to reduce an account balance by an amount owed of up to $50.00 if a consumer registers for one year of Internet access. Each time such an offer is accepted by a consumer, the amount of the reduction is added to the amount owed by merchant <b>274</b> associated with the merchant, such as the subsidizing merchant identified by the subsidizing merchant identifier <b>271</b> <b>8484</b>S. Accordingly, the associated remaining budget <b>273</b> is reduced by the amount of the reduction. </p>

<p id="p-0172" num="0171"> As an example of usage of the offer tracking database <b>280</b>, the record identified by the accepted offer identifier <b>281</b> <b>525252</b>AO reflects an offer which was accepted by a consumer to provide $30.00 toward an amount owed on a credit card account associated with the consumer. As shown by the status field <b>283</b>, the consumer has fulfilled an agreed to obligation corresponding to the offer, the issuing bank device <b>100</b> was paid the $30.00 subsidy amount by the controller <b>200</b>, and the controller <b>200</b> was paid, most likely by the entity which received the benefit of the fulfilled obligation, such as the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b>.

<p id="h-0013" num="0000"> Processes </p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow diagram of process steps <b>1700</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Briefly, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> process steps include steps to generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer pointer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer pointer includes information that may be used to review an offer. In a case that the controller <b>200</b> performs the process steps <b>1700</b>, the process steps <b>1700</b> may be embodied in hardware within the controller <b>200</b>, in processor-executable process steps stored on a computer-readable medium such as the data storage device <b>230</b> and executed by the processor <b>205</b>, in processor-executable process steps encoded in an electronic signal received by the controller <b>200</b> and executed by the processor <b>205</b>, or in any combination thereof. It should be noted that the process steps <b>1700</b> may be, wholly or in part, stored in and/or executed by elements of the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or any another suitable device. </p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"> The process steps <b>1700</b> are described below in the context of a specific example according to one embodiment of the invention. In this example, a consumer executes a transaction to purchase a toothbrush at Jack's Dime Store for $1.10. The consumer executes the transaction by presenting a credit card issued by the issuing bank device <b>100</b> to the merchant. The merchant passes a magnetic strip located on the credit card through a credit authorization terminal to read an associated credit card account number therefrom. The terminal associates the account number (e.g. 5555 6666 7777 8888) with the cost of the product ($1.10), a description of the product (toothbrush), the identity of the merchant (Jack's Dime Store), the current date (e.g. Mar. 29, 2003), and a merchant identifier identifying the merchant (e.g. <b>7777</b>M). This associated transaction information is transmitted to a credit card clearinghouse, from which it is routed to the issuing bank device <b>100</b> based on the account number. In this regard, the credit card clearinghouse maintains a database of credit card numbers and associated issuing banks. By matching the received account number to an entry in the database, the credit card clearinghouse determines to which issuing bank device <b>100</b> the transaction information should be transmitted. Once received by the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the transaction information is assigned a transaction identifier and is stored in association with the transaction identifier in the transaction database <b>170</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the transaction identifier <b>171</b> <b>555555</b>T identifies the transaction information of the present example. </p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"> In step S<b>1702</b>, the controller <b>200</b> receives the transaction information from the issuing bank device <b>100</b> through the communication port <b>210</b>. Next, in step S<b>1704</b>, the controller <b>200</b> uses the rules database <b>240</b> to determine an offer pointer based on the transaction information. According to the rules database of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the received transaction information satisfies the amount owed range <b>242</b>, the transaction category <b>243</b> and the merchant <b>244</b> associated with the rules identified by rule identifiers <b>241</b> <b>555</b>R and <b>666</b>R. However, in this example, the alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with the rule identifier <b>241</b> <b>555</b>R is determined as an offer pointer only if the received transaction information fails to satisfy the criteria of any other rule. </p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186"> Accordingly, the offer pointer determined in step S<b>1704</b> is the alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with the rule identifier <b>666</b>R, or &#x201c;http://www.erasecharges.com/amountowed=1.10&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"> A billing statement is generated in step S<b>1706</b>, the billing statement associating the executed transaction with the determined offer pointer. Billing statement <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents a billing statement generated in step S<b>1706</b> according to the present example. The billing statement <b>1</b> is generated by creating an electronic document formatted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and by printing a hardcopy of the document using the printer <b>225</b>. The billing statement <b>1</b> associates the transaction with the determined offer pointer by locating the determined offer pointer on a same line of the billing statement <b>1</b> as the transaction date <b>15</b>, the description <b>20</b> and the amount owed <b>25</b> corresponding to the transaction. The hardcopy of the billing statement <b>1</b> is transmitted to the consumer in step S<b>1708</b> by post, using the name <b>162</b> and the address <b>163</b> associated with the received credit card account number <b>164</b> in the consumer account database <b>160</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"> In step S<b>1710</b>, the controller <b>200</b> receives a request to review an offer based on the offer pointer. The request is received in the form of a request for a Web page corresponding to the offer pointer transmitted from the consumer device <b>400</b>. More specifically, prior to step <b>1710</b>, the consumer to whom the statement <b>1</b> was transmitted enters the offer pointer into a Web browser provided by the consumer device <b>400</b> through execution of the Web browser process steps <b>480</b>. The Web browser then transmits a command to retrieve an associated Web page over the World Wide Web, from which the command is received by a corresponding Web server provided by the controller <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"> An offer is determined by the controller <b>200</b> in step S<b>1712</b> using the offer database <b>250</b>. More specifically, the offer rules <b>255</b> of each offer reflected in the database <b>250</b> are evaluated to determine which reflected offer should be presented to the consumer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, only the offer identified by the offer identifier <b>251</b> <b>222111</b>O is associated with rules that are satisfied by the present transaction. Accordingly, it is determined in step S<b>1712</b> to transmit the offer identified by the offer identifier <b>251</b> <b>222111</b>O to the consumer. </p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190"> The offer is transmitted to the consumer in step S<b>1712</b>. Specifically, a Web page including the offer is sent to the Web browser from which the request was received in step S<b>1710</b>. The Web page may include a statement such as &#x201c;Your charge of $1.10 will be eliminated if you agree to receive two free issues of Big Top magazine&#x201d;, and selectable icons labeled &#x201c;I Agree&#x201d; and &#x201c;I Don't Agree&#x201d;. Accordingly, if the consumer indicates agreement by selecting the &#x201c;I Agree&#x201d; icon, settlement proceeds according to one of the embodiments described above. </p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"> It should be noted that an offer may be determined prior to determination of an offer pointer, with the offer pointer then determined so as to provide a consumer with access to the determined offer. According to one embodiment, such an offer is determined based on the received transaction information prior to step S<b>11704</b>. Therefore, the offer then determined in step S<b>1712</b> is the same as the offer determined prior to step S<b>1704</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"> By virtue of the foregoing process steps, it is likely that the offer eventually reviewed will be thoroughly considered. Moreover, the complexity of the offer and the number of offers are not strictly limited by space constraints imposed by the billing statement. The offer may also be more personalized, reflective of real-time conditions such as inventory or product demand, and/or tailored to the characteristics or needs of the consumer, the seller, or a third party. Consequently, the offer may be more likely to be accepted than an offer presented using conventional methods. </p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow diagram of process steps <b>1800</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Briefly, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> process steps include steps to generate a billing statement including a description of a transaction and an offer associated with the transaction, wherein the offer is an offer to reduce an amount owed associated with the transaction. In a case that the controller <b>200</b> performs the process steps <b>1800</b>, the process steps <b>1800</b> may be embodied in hardware within the controller <b>200</b>, in processor-executable process steps stored on a computer-readable medium such as the data storage device <b>230</b> and executed by the processor <b>205</b>, in processor-executable process steps encoded in an electronic signal received by the controller <b>200</b> and executed by the processor <b>205</b>, or in any combination thereof. It should be noted that the process steps <b>1700</b> may be, wholly or in part, stored in and/or executed by elements of the issuing bank device <b>100</b>, the subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> or another suitable device. </p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"> Initially, flow begins at step S<b>1802</b>, wherein the controller <b>200</b> receives from the issuing bank device <b>100</b> information regarding a transaction executed by a consumer using a credit card account. In this example, the information includes a minimum due ($30.00) corresponding to the credit card account. The minimum due is considered a description of a transaction, with the transaction including all previous transactions based on which the minimum due is calculated. </p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"> A statement offer is determined in step S<b>1804</b> based on the received information. The statement offer is determined using the rules database <b>240</b>, particularly by determining alternative payment information <b>245</b> associated with an amount owed range <b>242</b>, a transaction category <b>243</b> and a merchant <b>244</b> which correspond to the received information. Accordingly, the alternative payment information <b>245</b> &#x201c;I agree to register for 1 year of BOL Internet access&#x201d; is determined as a statement offer in step S<b>1804</b> based on the received minimum due of $30.00. </p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196"> Next, in step S<b>1806</b>, a billing statement is generated which associates the transaction described by the minimum due with the determined statement offer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates such an association. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the statement offer as shown on the billing statement <b>1</b> is an implied offer to eliminate the minimum due in exchange for a consumer's agreement to perform the described obligation. According to this example, the statement offer offers to pay the $30.00 minimum due if the consumer agrees to register for 1 year of Internet access with BOL. </p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"> The generated billing statement is transmitted to the consumer in step S<b>1808</b> in response to a request to view a billing statement received from the consumer device <b>400</b>. In more detail the consumer operates a Web.browser provided by the consumer device <b>400</b> to review a billing statement, and the controller <b>200</b> provides a Web server which transmits a generated credit card billing statement to the consumer over the World Wide Web so that the consumer is able to review an electronic version of his billing statement using the Web browser. </p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198"> The consumer then operates the consumer device <b>400</b> to place a check mark in the checkbox displayed beside the statement offer, thereby indicating acceptance of the statement offer. The acceptance is then transmitted over the World Wide Web, from which it is received by the controller <b>200</b> in step S<b>110</b>. Next, the controller <b>200</b> calculates a new total amount owed associated with the credit card account. The new total amount owed is $30.00 less than the total amount owed shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or $671.35. The new amount owed is transmitted to the consumer in step S<b>1812</b> using a Web page generated by the controller <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000"> Additional Embodiments </p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199"> The following are several examples of additional embodiments of the present invention. These examples do not constitute all possible embodiments, and those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is amenable to many other embodiments. Those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes, if necessary, to the above-described system to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications. </p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"> In one embodiment, a consumer may choose a transaction on a billing statement to associate with an offer pointer or an offer. Such an embodiment allows a consumer to choose a transaction to which a benefit of an accepted offer will be applied. </p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"> In determining offers to present to consumers, the controller <b>200</b> or subsidizing merchant device <b>300</b> may calculate a value of the consumer to the subsidizing merchant. The value calculation may be based upon any information about the consumer, and may be based on comparisons to other consumers with similar characteristics. </p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202"> An offer may also be determined based on credit history of a consumer. For example, a consumer who owes a large amount or who has demonstrated difficulty in paying off prior balances may be given offers whose obligation components are more difficult to meet than those of a typical offer. In this regard, a consumer who frequently revolves credit balances may be considered to have difficulty in paying off balances. </p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203"> The controller <b>200</b>, or some other party, may maintain a list of offers previously accepted by a consumer. Using the list, the controller <b>200</b> may prevent a consumer from accepting offers which conflict with the intent of previously-accepted offers. For example, a consumer who has previously accepted an offer requiring him to switch to a long distance service provider may be prevented from accepting an offer requiring him to switch to another long distance service provider. </p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"> In some embodiments, the consumer accepts and performs an obligation benefiting the controller <b>200</b> (or the issuing bank device <b>100</b>) rather than any subsidizing merchant.
