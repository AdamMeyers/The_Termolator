<heading level="2" id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> comprises a multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> adapted to cooperate with a discrete lens array <b>14</b> through a block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, wherein the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> and the discrete lens array <b>14</b> are each operatively coupled to opposing sides of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>. The multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> can be adapted for operation in a transmit mode, a receive mode, or both a transmit mode and a receive mode either in sequence or simultaneously. In a transmit mode, each broadside feed antenna <b>18</b> of the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> provides for generating a different beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> in a different direction as focused by the discrete lens array <b>14</b>. In a receive mode, each broadside feed antenna <b>18</b> of the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> provides for receiving a different beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> through the discrete lens array <b>14</b> from a corresponding different direction. In one embodiment, the discrete lens array <b>14</b> is located substantially along the focal plane of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, i.e. at a distance f therefrom, wherein f is equal to the focal length of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the discrete lens array <b>14</b> is located substantially along a focal surface of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, i.e. so that each of the elements of the discrete lens array <b>14</b> is substantially at a focal point of the discrete lens array <b>14</b> relative to an associated beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> associated with a corresponding direction. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> A first embodiment of the multi-beam antenna <b>10</b>&#x2032; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. The discrete lens array <b>14</b> comprises an assembly of a first set <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> of first broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> on a first side <b>26</b>.<b>1</b> of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, and a corresponding second set <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> of second broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> on a second side <b>26</b>.<b>2</b> of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, wherein the first <b>26</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>26</b>.<b>2</b> sides face in opposing directions with respect to one another, and the first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements from the first <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> sets are paired with one another. The first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements of each pair <b>28</b> are adapted to communicate with one another through an associated delay element <b>30</b>, wherein the amount of delay, or phase shift, is a function of the location of the particular pair <b>28</b> of first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements in the discrete lens array <b>14</b> so as to emulate the behavior of an electromagnetic lens, for example, a spherical, plano-spherical, elliptical, cylindrical or plano-cylindrical lens. The delay as a function of location on the discrete lens array <b>14</b> is adapted to provide&#x2014;in a transmit mode&#x2014;for transforming a diverging beam of beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> from an associated broadside feed antenna <b>18</b> at a focal point to a corresponding substantially collimated beam exiting the discrete lens array <b>14</b>; and vice versa in a receive mode. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, in accordance a first aspect, the discrete lens array <b>14</b> comprises a first set <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> of first broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>1</b>, for example, patch antenna elements, on a first side <b>32</b>.<b>1</b> of a first dielectric substrate <b>32</b> and a second set <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> of second broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>2</b>, for example, patch antenna elements, on a first side <b>34</b>.<b>1</b> of a second dielectric substrate <b>34</b>, with the respective second sides <b>32</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>.<b>2</b> of the first <b>32</b> and second <b>34</b> dielectric substrates facing one another across opposing sides of a central conductive layer <b>36</b> that is provided with associated coupling slots <b>38</b> associated with each pair <b>28</b> of first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements, wherein the associated coupling slots <b>38</b> provide for communication between the first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements of each pair <b>28</b>, and are adapted to provide for the corresponding associated delay, for example, in accordance with the technical paper, &#x201c;A planar filter-lens-array for millimeter-wave applications,&#x201d; by A. Abbaspour-Tamijani, K. Sarabandi, and G. M. Rebeiz in 2004 <i>AP</i>-<i>S Int. Symp. Dig</i>., Monterey, Calif., June 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment, the coupling slots <b>38</b> are &#x201c;U-shaped&#x201d;&#x2014;i.e. similar to the end of a tuning fork&#x2014;and in cooperation with the adjacent first <b>32</b> and second <b>34</b> dielectric substrates constitute a sandwiched coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonant structure, wherein the associated phase delay can be adjusted by scaling the associated coupling slot <b>38</b>. Accordingly, the individual pairs <b>28</b> of first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements in combination with an associated delay element <b>30</b> constitute a bandpass filter with radiative ports which can each be modeled as a three-pole filter based upon the corresponding three resonators of the associated first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements and the associated coupling slot <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> For example, the first <b>32</b> and second <b>34</b> dielectric substrates may be constructed of a material with relatively low loss at an operating frequency, examples of which include DUROID&#xae;, a TEFLON&#xae; containing material, a ceramic material, depending upon the frequency of operation. For example, in one embodiment, the first 32 and second 34 dielectric substrates comprise DUROID&#xae; with a TEFLON&#xae; substrate of about 15-20 mil thickness and a relative dielectric constant of about 2.2, wherein the first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements and the coupling slots <b>38</b> are formed, for example, by subtractive technology, for example, chemical or ion etching, or stamping; or additive techniques, for example, deposition, bonding or lamination, from associated conductive layers bonded to the associated first <b>32</b> and second <b>34</b> dielectric substrates. The first <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> and second <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> broadside antenna elements may, for example, comprise microstrip patches, dipoles or slots. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The first side <b>26</b>.<b>1</b> of the discrete lens array <b>14</b> is bonded to a first surface <b>40</b> of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b> using a bonding agent <b>42</b>, for example, having a dielectric constant substantially equal to that of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>. The first broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> are adapted so as to be substantially impedance-matched to the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, and the second broadside antenna elements <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> are adapted so as to be substantially impedance-matched to air. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The block of dielectric material <b>16</b> is adapted so as to provide for locating the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> substantially along the focal plane of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the block of dielectric material <b>16</b> comprises a slab with a thickness substantially equal to the focal length f of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, for example, having an aspect ratio&#x2014;given by the ratio f/D of the focal length f to the diameter D of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>&#x2014;greater than 0.25. For example, for a multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> with f/D of about 0.4-0.6 and an aperture diameter of about 4 inches, the corresponding thickness of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b> would be about 1.6-2.4 inches. A larger f/D provides for better scanning off-axis, but requires a thicker structure. The particular thickness of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b> for a particular application, could and typically would, for example, be calculated using ray-tracing and full-wave electromagnetic models. The block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, for example, comprises a material with relatively low loss at an operating frequency, for example, a TEFLON&#xae; containing material or a ceramic material, depending upon the frequency of operation. For example, TEFLON&#xae; has been useful at microwave and mm-wave frequencies, although some other material with a similar relatively dielectric constant and a similar loss tangent would provide similar results. In one embodiment, the block of dielectric material <b>16</b> comprises a cylindrical disk <b>44</b> with parallel planar faces <b>46</b>, sliced from a cylindrical rod of TEFLON&#xae;, wherein the separately fabricated multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> and discrete lens array <b>14</b> are respectively bonded to respective opposing parallel planar faces <b>46</b> of the cylindrical disk <b>44</b>. Excessive undesirable reflections from the cylindrical side surface <b>48</b> of the cylindrical disk <b>44</b>, if present, could be mitigated by rounding or angling the cylindrical side surface <b>48</b>, or by incorporating quarter-wave grooves therein so a to provide for a better match to the surrounding air.

For example, the third dielectric substrate <b>50</b> would comprise a material with relatively low loss at an operating frequency, for example, DUROID&#xae;, a TEFLON&#xae; containing material, a ceramic material, depending upon the frequency of operation. The multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> on the third dielectric substrate <b>50</b> is bonded with a bonding agent <b>42</b> to the second surface <b>52</b> of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, and is substantially aligned with the center of the discrete lens array <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> The broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> of the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> are, for example, located along a linear array in the X-direction, Y-direction; located in accordance with a 2-dimensional spacing; or located in accordance with any combination therefore (ie, a cross), so as to provide for scanning in azimuth or elevation, or two dimensional scanning. For linear (e.g. 1&#xd7;N, 2&#xd7;N, or 3&#xd7;N) and cross-arrays (N in the X; N in the Y), there would be sufficient space to integrate the associated front-end electronic components <b>54</b>, e.g. transmit and receive electronics, and the switch network for the broadside feed antennas <b>18</b>, with the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> on the third dielectric substrate <b>50</b>. For example, the broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> may comprise either dipole (or double-dipoles or folded-dipoles) antennas, slot (or double-slots or folded slots) antennas, microstrip-type antennas, patch antennas, or any other type of a broadside radiating antenna, wherein the broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> are adapted to radiate efficiently within the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, wherein the particular design would be adapted for the particular operating frequency. For example, in one embodiment, the broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> comprise single or paired rectangular or square conductive patches. In another embodiment, slot feeds might be used. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> In accordance with one process, the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> and the discrete lens array <b>14</b> are each first fabricated separately, and then both are respectively bonded to respective first <b>40</b> and second <b>52</b> surfaces on opposing sides of the block of dielectric material <b>16</b>, so as to create an integral multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> assembly that provides for maintaining the alignment of the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> with respect to the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, thereby precluding the need for subsequent alignment thereof. Conventional printed circuit board (PCB) construction and assembly processes can be used for the construction and alignment of the multi-element broadside feed array <b>12</b> and the discrete lens array <b>14</b>, and the assembly of the multi-beam antenna <b>10</b>, which provides for improved reliability and reduced cost thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> may further comprise a switching network having at least one input and a plurality of outputs, wherein the at least one input is operatively connected&#x2014;for example, via at least one transmission line&#x2014;to a corporate antenna feed port, and each output of the plurality of outputs is connected&#x2014;for example, via at least one transmission line&#x2014;to a respective feed port of a different broadside feed antenna <b>18</b> of the plurality of broadside feed antennas <b>18</b>. The switching network further comprises at least one control port for controlling which outputs are connected to the at least one input at a given time. The switching network may, for example, comprise either a plurality of micro-mechanical switches, PIN diode switches, transistor switches, or a combination thereof, and may, for example, be operatively connected to the dielectric substrate, for example, by surface mount to an associated conductive layer of a printed circuit board. </p>

It should be understood that the feed signal may either comprise a single signal common to each broadside feed antenna <b>18</b>, or a plurality of signals associated with different broadside feed antennas <b>18</b>. Each broadside feed antenna <b>18</b> to which the feed signal is applied launches an associated electromagnetic wave into the first side <b>26</b>.<b>1</b> of the associated discrete lens array <b>14</b>, which is diffracted thereby to form an associated beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b>.

The various beams of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> may be generated individually at different times so as to provide for a scanned beam of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b>. Alternately, two or more beams of electromagnetic energy <b>20</b> may be generated simultaneously. Moreover, different broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> may be driven by different frequencies that, for example, are either directly switched to the respective broadside feed antennas <b>18</b>, or switched via an associated switching network having a plurality of inputs, at least some of which are connected to different feed signals. </p>

As another example, with the multi-beam antenna <b>10</b> configured as a communication antenna, the respective broadside feed antennas <b>18</b> are used to both transmit and receive electromagnetic energy, and the respective processing elements comprise transmit/receive modules or transceivers. The switching network, if used, need not be collocated on a common dielectric substrate, but can be separately located, as, for example, may be useful for low frequency applications, for example, for operating frequencies less than 20 GHz, e.g. 1-20 GHz. </p>
