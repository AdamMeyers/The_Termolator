<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 1. Technical Field </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> This invention relates to coating compositions with relatively little tendency towards shrinkage. These coating compositions are obtainable by reaction of epoxy resins and special hardeners according to the invention, these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of epoxidized polyalkylene oxide, an epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compound and an aromatic hydroxy compound to form a first intermediate product, subsequently reacting this intermediate product with a polyamine to form a second intermediate product and, finally, reacting the second intermediate product with special Lewis acids. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> 2. Background Art </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,405 describes hardeners for epoxy resins. These hardeners are produced as follows: a first intermediate compound, a diepoxy compound (a) obtainable by reaction of diglycidyl ethers of dibasic phenols, diglycidyl ethers of aliphatic dihydroxy polyethers and dibasic phenols with a polyamine (b) containing primary amino groups are reacted to form a second intermediate compound, with the proviso that practically all the epoxy groups present in (a) are substantially quantitatively reacted with the polyamine (b). The second intermediate compound obtained is then reacted with a compound (c) from the group of monoepoxides or monocarboxylic acids, with the proviso that at least all the primary amino groups of the polyamines (b) are reacted with the compounds (c), resulting in the formation of a third intermediate compound which, finally, is converted into an ionic compound by addition of a volatile acid, such as formic, acetic or propionic acid. According to the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,405, this ionic compound is a hardener for water-based epoxy resin systems. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> WO 93/21250 describes a process for the production of aqueous emulsions of epoxy resin hardeners containing free amino groups. These epoxy resin hardeners in turn are adducts of epoxy resins and aminofunctional compounds. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> EP-A-253,405 describes compositions containing cationic epoxy resins. These compositions are produced by reaction of a component (a) containing a diglycidyl ether of a polyol and a diglycidyl ether of a dibasic phenol with a dibasic phenol (b) and optionally a capping agent (c), resulting in the formation of an epoxy resin containing terminal oxirane rings. These terminal oxirane rings are then converted into cationic groups by reaction with nucleophiles and addition of an organic acid and water during the process. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> EP-A-1,518,875 describes hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which are obtained by reaction of a mixture of (a) at least one epoxidized polyalkylene oxide selected from the group of epoxidized polyethylene oxides, epoxidized polypropylene oxides and polyethylene propylene oxides, (b) at least one epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group of bisphenol A epoxides and bisphenol F epoxides and (c) at least one aromatic hydroxy compound selected from the group consisting of bisphenol A and bisphenol F to form an intermediate product and subsequent reaction of this intermediate product with a polyamine (E). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The problem addressed by the present invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which, when used in the reaction with epoxy resins, would lead to the formation of coating compositions or coatings distinguished by a comparatively long pot life. The end of the pot life would be reflected in a distinct increase in the viscosity of the mixture. In addition, the hardeners would be self-emulsifying in water and would be capable of emulsifying added liquid epoxy resins in water or water-containing systems. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Another problem addressed by the invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which, when used in the reaction with epoxy resins, would lead to the formation of coating compositions or coatings distinguished by a particularly low tendency to shrink. Another problem addressed by the invention was to provide hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems which would develop distinct hardness after a short drying time. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> It has now surprisingly been found that coating compositions obtainable by reaction of epoxy resins and special hardeners&#x2014;these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of epoxidized polyalkylene oxides, epoxidized aromatic hydroxy compounds and aromatic hydroxy compounds to form a first intermediate product, subsequently reacting this intermediate product with polyamine to form a second intermediate product and finally reacting the second intermediate product with special Lewis acids&#x2014;satisfy these requirements excellently in every respect. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In a first embodiment, the present invention relates to hardeners for water-based epoxy resin systems, these hardeners being obtainable by reacting a mixture of

Br&#xf6;nstedt acids (unless Br&#xf6;nstedt acids of special structure as explained above are explicitly excluded as compounds (F)) i.e. substances which release protons, may of course be interpreted as a special case among Lewis acids and therefore come under the heading of Lewis acids. </p>

In other words, the equivalent ratio of oxirane rings in the sum of compounds (A) and (B) to reactive hydrogen atoms in compound (C) is adjusted to a value of 1.1:1 to 10:1. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0070"> In another embodiment, namely in cases where at least one compound (D) is also used in the production of the intermediate product (Z2), a molar ratio of the sum of compounds (A), (B) and (D) (these compounds each contain two oxirane groups per molecule) to compound (C) (this compound contains two OH groups per molecule) of 1.1:1.0 to 10.0:1.0 is adjusted in the production of the intermediate product (Z1).

<p id="p-0051" num="0071"> In the interests of clarity, the following explanation is offered: The expression &#x201c;equivalent ratio&#x201d; is familiar to the expert. The basic concept behind the notion of the equivalent is that, for every substance participating in a reaction, the reactive groups involved in the desired reaction are taken into consideration. By indicating an equivalent ratio, it is possible to express the ratio which all the various reactive groups of the compounds (x) and (y) used bear to one another. It is important in this connection to bear in mind that a reactive group is understood to be the smallest possible reactive group, i.e. the notion of the reactive group is not identical with the notion of the functional group. In the case of H-acid compounds, this means for example that, although OH groups or NH groups represent such reactive groups, NH<sub>2 </sub>groups with two reactive H atoms positioned at the same nitrogen atom do not. In their case, the two hydrogen atoms within the functional group NH<sub>2 </sub>are appropriately regarded as reactive groups so that the functional group NH<sub>2 </sub>contains two reactive groups, namely the hydrogen atoms. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0072"> In one embodiment, the production of the intermediate product (Z1) is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, more particularly triphenyl phosphine or ethyl triphenyl phosphonium iodide.

<p id="p-0055" num="0075"> The reaction of the intermediate product (Z1) with the polyamine is preferably carried out by initially introducing the polyamine in excess so as to ensure that essentially 1 molecule of the polyamine, preferably diethylene triamine, reacts with one of the epoxy groups of the intermediate compound (Z1).

<p id="p-0087" num="0109"> 205.6 g of a clear amber-colored liquid were obtained. Viscosity (Brookfield, 10 r.p.m., 40&#xb0; C.): 2140 mPas. Amine value: 134. </p>

<p id="h-0026" num="0000"> 1. Clear Lacquer Properties </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0110"> The hardeners of Examples 1 to 3 (hardener 60% in water) and Comparison Example 1 (hardener 60% in water) were made up into a clear lacquer by mixing the quantities shown in Table 1 of components Nos. 1 to 3 (the numbering of components Nos. 1 to 3 used appears in the first column of Table 1). </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0111"> To this end, components No. 1 (epoxy resin) and No. 2 (hardener 60% in water) were thoroughly mixed with component No. 3 (water) in a glass beaker by stirring manually with a wooden spatula until a homogeneous emulsion had formed. The emulsion was then applied by coating knife (0.1 mm) to a pane of glass and left to cure at 20&#xb0; C. After one day and seven days, the K&#xf6;nig pendulum hardness (DIN 53157) was determined with an Erichsen type 299 pendulum hardness tester. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0112"> In every case, the end of the pot life was reflected in a distinct increase in the viscosity of the emulsion to more than 3 times its initial viscosity. The pot life was ca. 60 minutes in every case. The lacquers obtained were clear and colorless. The tack-free time (time after which small glass balls or glass dust no longer adhere to the film) was ca. 1 hour in every case.
