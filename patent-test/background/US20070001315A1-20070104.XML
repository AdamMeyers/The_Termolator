<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to a substrate for device bonding which is used for bonding or fixing devices, a device bonded substrate in which a device has been bonded to the substrate for device bonding, and a process for producing the substrate for device bonding. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> With the spread of cellular phones and optical communications, ceramic substrates have been employed as substrates for mounting semiconductor devices of high output and high power consumption which work in the high-frequency region, such as GaAs type FET, Si&#x2014;Ge type HBT, Si type MOSFET and GaN type laser diode, for the reason of low dielectric loss at high frequencies. Of the ceramic substrates, aluminum nitride sintered substrates are particularly paid attention because they have excellent characteristics that the thermal conductivity is high and the coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of semiconductor devices. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> For bonding a device onto a ceramic substrate such as an aluminum nitride sintered product, it is general that a first and a second undercoating metal layers firmly bonded to the ceramic substrate are formed by metallization, then on the undercoating metal layer an electrode layer composed of a noble metal such as gold is formed, and the device is soldered to the electrode layer. For soldering the device, a reflow process is frequently adopted from the viewpoint of efficiency. Therefore, a solder layer of a specific pattern for bonding the device needs to be previously formed on the electrode layer of the substrate. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> As the semiconductor devices are integrated more highly in recent years, the solder layer needs to be formed in an extremely small area on the substrate for the reflow process with higher precision using thin film-forming technique. The solder layer is generally formed by laminating various metal thin film layers successively in such a manner that a prescribed solder composition should be obtained when the solder layer is molten. Such a solder layer is referred to as a &#x201c;thin film-laminated solder layer&#x201d; hereinafter, and a ceramic substrate having an electrode layer on which the thin film-laminated solder layer has been formed is referred to as a &#x201c;ceramic substrate with a thin film-laminated solder layer&#x201d; hereinafter. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> As such a ceramic substrate with a thin film-laminated solder layer, there is known a substrate having an Au&#x2014;Sn type thin film-laminated solder layer (see patent document 1), a substrate having a thin film-laminated solder layer that gives a Sn-37 wt % Pb eutectic solder having a melting point of 183&#xb0; C. or gives a solder containing this eutectic solder and a small amount of a different metal (these solders being also referred to as &#x201c;Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solders&#x201d; generically hereinafter) in the melting stage (see patent document 2), or the like. The Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solders are most popular as electronically industrial solders and have widely spread, and they can bond devices with high bond strength even in case of a thin film-laminated solder layer (e.g., solder layer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in which a Pb layer and a Sn layer are laminated alternately). </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> On the other hand, so-called Pb-free solders containing no lead component have been employed recently because harmfulness of lead has become a problem. As the Pb-free solders, those having a melting point equivalent to that of the Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solvers are desired from the viewpoint of substitutes for the Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solders, and as such Pb-free solders, a Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;In type solder (see patent document 3) and a Su&#x2014;Ag&#x2014;Bi type solder (see patent document 4) are known. These solders, however, are alloy solders previously prepared so as to have a prescribed composition, and any example of the thin film-laminated solder layer using such Pb-free solders is not known. In the present specification, the solder layer composed of an alloy solder previously prepared so as to have a prescribed composition is called an &#x201c;alloy solder layer&#x201d; for convenience and distinguished from the aforesaid thin film-laminated solder layer. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">Problem to be Solved by the Invention </heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Also in case of the ceramic substrate with a thin film-laminated solder layer, Pb-freeing is an important technical problem, and it has been desired to convert a thin film-laminated solder layer that gives a Sn&#x2014;Pb solder in the melting stage into a Pb-free thin film-laminated solder layer. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In case of the thin film-laminated solder layer, however, the whole layer gives a prescribed solder composition when the layers are molten, so that its performance is greatly influenced by the layer structure differently from an alloy solder layer (this is apparent also from the later-described comparison between the examples and the comparative examples). For example, even if high bond strength is obtained by the alloy solder layer, sufficient bond strength is not obtained frequently by the thin film-laminated solder layer that is formed so as to give the same composition as that of the alloy solder layer in the melting stage. Further, the process to bond a device to a ceramic substrate having a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic thin film-laminated solder layer has been established, and therefore, in the shift to the Pb-free thin film-laminated solder layer from the Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic thin film-laminated solder layer, it is required that bond strength equivalent to that obtained by the Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic thin film-laminated solder layer should be obtained, and besides there is no large modification of the process. In order to satisfy these requirements, the Pb-free thin film-laminated solder layer adopted needs to have a melting point of 170 to 230&#xb0; C., preferably 180 to 200&#xb0; C. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> It is an object of the present invention to provide a substrate for device bonding which has a Pb-free thin film-laminated solder layer satisfying the above requirements. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">Means to Solve the Problem </heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In order to solve the above problem, the present inventors have earnestly studied, and as a result, they have found that by the addition of metals such as Bi and In to a Pb-free solder such as a Sn type solder containing Au, the resulting solder can have a melting point almost equivalent to that of a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solder. However, it has been also found that there is a problem of low bond strength in the case where a device is soldered by the use of such thin film-laminated solder layer incorporated with the above metals. In order to solve this problem, the present inventor has further studied, and they have found that high bond strength is sometimes obtained by adding specific metals such as Ag, bond strength is strongly influenced by the surface roughness of the thin film-laminated solder layer surface, and when the surface roughness is lower than a specific value, high bond strength is obtained. Furthermore, the present inventors have succeeded in finding a method for stably forming a solder layer having a surface roughness satisfying this condition. Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> According to the substrate for device bonding of the invention, it becomes possible to bond semiconductor devices without using a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solder that is considered to have a fear of harmfulness. Further, since the solder used in the substrate for device bonding of the invention has a melting point of almost the same level as that of a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solder, a conventional reflow process using a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic solder can be adopted without largely modifying the process, and it becomes possible to solder semiconductor devices with high bond strength at low temperatures. In particular, a ceramic substrate which contains aluminum nitride as a main component on which an electrode layer has been formed is very excellent substrate for device bonding, which has, in addition to the above merits, both of a merit of low dielectric loss at high frequencies and a merit of excellent heat discharging properties to dissipate heat that is generated when the device is used. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> According to the production process of the invention, it is possible to efficiently produce the above-mentioned excellent substrate for device bonding. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0007">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The substrate for device bonding of the invention comprises a substrate having an electrode layer and a solder layer formed on the electrode layer, wherein the solder layer is a Pb-free solder layer comprising (1) a base metal composed of (i) Sn, (ii) Sn and Au, or (iii) In, (2) at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Bi, In (only in the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au), Zn, Au (only in the case where the base metal is In) and Sb, and (3) at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Ni, Fe, Al, Cu and Pt, and the solder layer has a thickness of 1 to 15 &#x3bc;m and a surface roughness (Ra) of not more than 0.11 &#x3bc;m. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The &#x201c;substrate having an electrode layer&#x201d; in the invention is not specifically restricted so long as being a substrate on a part or all of a surface of which an electrode layer composed of a noble metal functioning as an electrode has been formed, but from the viewpoint that dielectric loss at high frequencies is low when a semiconductor device bonded to the substrate is used, it is preferable to use a metallized substrate obtained by forming a noble metal layer on a ceramic substrate such as aluminum nitride, alumina or SiC, or a Si substrate, particularly a ceramic substrate having a surface roughness Ra of not more than 0.05 &#x3bc;m and Rmax of not more than 0.2 &#x3bc;m, by means of metallization. Although Au, Ag, Pd, Pt or the like is employable as the noble metal to constitute the electrode layer, Au having extremely low conduction resistance is preferably employed. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> In the metallized substrate, the noble metal electrode layer is generally formed directly or indirectly on an undercoating metal layer that is firmly bonded to the ceramic substrate, as previously described. In case of, for example, an alumina substrate, there can be preferably employed a metallized substrate obtained by printing an electrode pattern composed of a paste of a high-melting point metal such as tungsten or molybdenum on an alumina green sheet, sintering the pattern and the green sheet simultaneously, then forming a nickel layer on the high-melting point metal layer if necessary, and further forming thereon a noble metal layer such as a gold layer. In case of a ceramic substrate containing aluminum nitride as a main component, there can be particularly preferably employed a metallized substrate obtained by (i) a process comprising adding a sintering agent to an aluminum nitride powder, molding the mixture to thereby sintering the same, then forming a metal layer (first undercoating layer) containing titanium as a main component and having basically the same shape as that of the electrode pattern on a surface of the sintered substrate by sputtering or the like and then forming, as an electrode layer, a layer containing platinum as a main component on the first undercoating layer by sputtering or the like similarly to the above, or a metallized substrate obtained by (ii) a process comprising further forming an electrode layer of gold or the like on the platinum layer as the second undercoating layer by sputtering or the like. In the substrate for device bonding of the invention, it is particularly preferable to use the aluminum nitride type metallized substrate obtained by the above process (i) or (ii) from the viewpoint that heat discharging properties to dissipate heat that is generated when a device bonded thereto is used are excellent. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> In the present invention, the thickness of the solder layer is in the range of 1 to 15 &#x3bc;m, and from the viewpoints of precision bonding of a device and bond strength, the thickness is in the range of preferably 2 to 8 &#x3bc;m. If the thickness of the solder layer is less than 1 &#x3bc;m, sufficient bond strength is not obtained occasionally. If the thickness thereof exceeds 15 &#x3bc;m, a trouble that a side surface or an upper surface (light emission surface in case of semiconductor device) of the device is obscured by the solder after bonding sometimes takes place because the amount of the solder is too large. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In the present invention, the surface roughness (Ra) of the solder layer is not more than 0.11 &#x3bc;m, preferably not more than 0.06 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably not more than 0.05 &#x3bc;m. When the surface roughness (Ra) of the solder layer is in this range, high bond strength is obtained when a device is soldered. If the surface roughness exceeds 0.11 &#x3bc;m, high bond strength is not obtained in some cases. The bond strength is sensitive also to the surface profile of the solder layer, and therefore, in addition to the Ra of the above range, Rmax is preferably not more than 0.90 &#x3bc;m, more preferably not more than 0.55 &#x3bc;m. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> The term &#x201c;surface roughness (Ra)&#x201d; used herein is an arithmetic mean value of surface protrusions and depressions based on the center plane of the measuring ragion, and is one parameter obtained by numerically expressing shapes and sizes of protrusions and depressions of the surface. The term &#x201c;Rmax&#x201d; is a difference in height between the highest point and the lowest point of the surface. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> In the present invention, measurements of the surface roughness (Ra) and the Rmax are carried out using AFM (atomic force microscope). The AFM can three-dimensionally measure fine surface profile of a sample by resolution of atomic level (A order), and by image processing of the resulting three-dimensional profile, accurate surface roughness (Ra) and Rmax can be determined. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> The base metal is an essential component of a solder, and is a component to primarily determine the melting point of the solder and to make basic bond strength appear. As the base metal, (i) Sn, (ii) Sn and Au, or (iii) In is employable, and for the reason of high reliability after bonding, it is preferable to use (i) Sn or (ii) Sn and Au. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The content of the base metal in the solder layer is in the range of preferably 10 to 95% by weight, particularly preferably 34 to 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the solder layer. In the case where (ii) Sn and Au are used as the base metals, it is preferable that the content of Sn is in the range of 80 to 99% by weight and the content of Au is in the range of 1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of the base metals, and from the viewpoint of bond strength, it is most preferable that the content of Sn is in the range of 87 to 97% by weight and the content of Au is in the range of 3 to 13% by weight, based on the total weight of the base metals. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The melting point-lowering metal has a function of lowering a melting point of the solder layer. The melting point-lowering metal is at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Bi, In, Zn, Au and Sb. However, use of In as the melting point-lowering metal is restricted to the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au, and use of Au as the melting point-lowering metal is restricted to the case where the base metal is In. For the reason that the melting point lowering effect on all the base metals is high, Bi is preferably used as the melting point-lowering metal. In the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au, In can also be preferably used as well as Bi, for the same reason. The In has not only a melting point lowering effect but also has an advantage that cushioning effect at the bonding is high because In itself is soft. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The content of the melting point-lowering metal is in the range of preferably 0.1 to 30% by weight, particularly preferably 3 to 16% by weight, based on the total weight of the solder layer, from the viewpoints of a melting point and bond strength of the solder layer. When the content of the melting point-lowering metal is in this range, the melting point of the solder layer can be made to be in the range of 170 to 230&#xb0; C., preferably 180 to 200&#xb0; C. If the content of the melting point-lowering metal is low, the melting point of the solder layer tends to be raised. If the content thereof is less than the lower limit of the above range, the melting point of the solder layer frequently exceeds 230&#xb0; C. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The surface-smoothing metal has a function of smoothing a surface of the solder layer. It is preferable to use Ag as the surface smoothing metal because Ag has a high surface smoothing effect and also has a melting point lowering effect. </p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> In the present invention, the existence form of the various components contained in the solder layer is not specifically restricted. That is to say, the solder layer may be, for example, the aforesaid thin film-laminated solder layer or an alloy solder layer, but because a fine pattern can be formed with high precision, the solder layer is preferably the thin film-laminated solder layer. There is no specific limitation on the method for forming the thin film-laminated solder layer, and for example, sputtering, ion plating, deposition, CVD method and plating are preferable. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> In the case where the solder layer in the invention is a thin film-laminated solder layer, it is preferable that the solder layer comprises (1) a base metal layer composed of (i) Sn, (ii) Sn and Au, or (iii) In, (2) one or more melting point-lowering metal layers each of which is composed of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Bi, In (only in the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au), Zn, Au (only in the case where the base metal is In) and Sb, and (3) one or more surface-smoothing metal layers each of which is composed of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Ni, Fe, Al, Cu and Pt, and each of the melting point-lowering metal layers is adjacent to any one of the surface-smoothing metal layers. When the base metal layer is composed of Sn and Au, the base metal layer may have such a single layer structure of homogeneous composition as is formed by depositing Sn and Au simultaneously, or may have a multi-layer structure including one or more Sn layers and one or more Au layers. Further, the aforesaid arbitrary components, such as Ga, Pd, P, Mn, Cr, Ti and rare earth elements, can be introduced at the formation of the base metal layer. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> As the layer structure wherein the melting point-lowering metal layer is adjacent to the surface-smoothing metal layer, there can be mentioned three kinds of layer structures, i.e., a layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layer is present on the melting point-lowering metal layer, a layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layer is present under the melting point-lowering metal layer, and a layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layers are present on and under the melting point-lowering metal layer. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> In case of the layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layer is present on the melting point-lowering metal layer, the melting point-lowering metal layer is formed on a layer (e.g., layer of Pb-free solder) other then the surface-smoothing metal layer at the formation of the thin film-laminated solder layer. In this case, the melting point-lowering metal is partially aggregated, so that the resulting melting point-lowering metal layer is not a smooth continuous layer and has a rough surface. However, when a surface-smoothing metal layer is further formed thereon, the rough surface is restored presumably by the interaction between the melting point-lowering metal and the surface-smoothing metal, whereby a smooth surface is provided. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> In case of the layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layer is present under the melting point-lowering metal layer, the melting point-lowering metal layer is formed on the surface-smoothing metal layer at the formation of the thin film-laminated solder layer.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> As described above, if the melting point-lowering metal layer is adjacent to the surface-smoothing metal layer in the solder layer, the melting point-lowering metal layer becomes a continuous layer of smooth surface, and even if the melting point-lowering metal is temporarily aggregated to form a discontinuous layer, this layer is restored by the surface-smoothing metal layer laminated thereon and has a smooth surface. Therefore, the solder layer finally obtained has high surface smoothness and exhibits great bonding power when a device is bonded. Of the above layer structures, the layer structure wherein the surface-smoothing metal layer is present on and under the melting point-lowering metal layer is particularly preferable because a solder layer having highest smoothness and greatest bonding ability is obtained. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> On the other hand, in the case where the melting point-lowering metal layer is not adjacent to any surface-smoothing metal layer, the melting point-lowering metal layer is aggregated at the formation of the thin film-laminated solder layer and is not restored, so that the finally obtained solder layer has low surface smoothness, and when a device is bonded, sufficient bonding ability is not obtained in some cases. As a result, soldering in the temperature range of 170 to 230&#xb0; C. with high bond strength sometimes becomes infeasible. </p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> The thickness of the surface-smoothing metal layer <b>500</b> present as the lowest layer in the solder layer is in the range of preferably 0.1 to 5 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably 0.2 to 3 &#x3bc;m, from the viewpoint of cost performance. If the thickness of this layer is less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m, the surface smoothing effect is low. Even if the thickness is more than 5 &#x3bc;m, the surface smoothing effect is almost the same as that of a layer having a thickness of 0.2 to 3 &#x3bc;m. This surface-smoothing metal layer is preferably composed of Ag. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> There is no specific limitation on the process for producing the substrate for device bonding of the invention. For example, the substrate for device bonding can be obtained by forming a solder layer of the aforesaid composition on an electrode layer of a substrate having an electrode layer and then polishing the surface of the solder layer so that the thickness and the surface roughness of the solder layer should satisfy the aforesaid requirements. However, for the reason that the substrate for device bonding can be simply and readily obtained in high yields with high reproducibility, it is preferable to adopt the following process (process of the invention). That is to say, it is preferable to adopt a process for producing a substrate for device bonding, comprising a solder layer-forming step for forming a Pb-free solder layer on an electrode layer of a substrate having an electrode layer, said Pb-free solder layer comprising (1) a base metal composed of (i) Sn, (ii) Sn and Au, or (iii) In, (2) at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Bi, In (only in the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au), Zn, Au (only in the case where the base metal is In) and Sb, and (3) at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Ni, Fe, Al, Cu and Pt, and said Pb-free solder layer having a thickness of 1 to 15 &#x3bc;m and a surface roughness (Ra) of not more than 0.11 &#x3bc;m, wherein the solder layer-forming step includes one or more steps for forming a layer composed of the base metal, one or more steps for forming a melting point-lowering metal layer composed of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Bi, In (only in the case where the base metal is Sn, or Sn and Au), Zn, Au (only in the case where the base metal is In) and Sb, and one or more steps for forming a surface-smoothing metal layer composed of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Ni, Fe, Al, Cu and Pt, and immediately before and/or immediately after the step for forming the melting point-lowering metal layer, any one of the steps for forming the surface-smoothing metal layer is carried out. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> In the above production process, the solder layer does not necessarily have to be formed directly on the electrode layer of the substrate having an electrode layer, and it is possible that a bonding layer composed of a transition metal is formed on the electrode layer of the substrate having an electrode layer and then the solder layer is formed on the bonding layer. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> There is no specific limitation on the method to bond a device such as a semiconductor device to the substrate for device bonding of the invention, and soldering methods publicly known are adoptable without any restriction. For the reason that bonding of high precision can be efficiently carried out, it is preferable that a device having an electrode is placed on the solder layer of the substrate for device bonding of the invention in such a manner that the electrode of the device is brought into contact with the solder layer and then the device is bonded by reflow soldering. The reflow soldering is a process comprising supplying a solder to a prescribed land of a substrate or an electrode of a part or both of them, fixing the part at a given position of the substrate, and then melting the solder (allowing the solder to flow) to bond the part and the substrate to each other. In this process, a method for allowing the solder to reflow is not specifically restricted, and a method using a reflow conveyer, a method using a hot plate, vapor reflowing, etc. are adoptable. The heating temperature and the heating time are properly determined according to the type of the solder used. In the case where the substrate for device bonding of the invention is used, excellent soldering can be carried out at almost the same temperature as that for bonding a device to a ceramic substrate having a solder pattern of a Sn&#x2014;Pb eutectic thin film-laminated structure, specifically 170 to 230&#xb0; C., preferably 180 to 200&#xb0; C. </p>

The substrate <b>200</b> consists of an aluminum nitride sintered substrate <b>201</b>, a first undercoating layer <b>202</b> containing Ti as a main component, a second undercoating layer <b>203</b> containing platinum as a main component and a gold electrode layer <b>204</b> laminated in this order. The substrate for device bonding <b>101</b> has a structure wherein on a gold electrode layer <b>204</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>, a solder flow-out preventing Pt layer <b>301</b>, a bonding layer <b>401</b> containing Ti as a main component and a solder layer <b>509</b> are laminated, wherein the solder layer <b>509</b> consists of a first Ag layer <b>500</b>, a first Au10-Sn layer <b>501</b>, a Bi layer <b>502</b>, a second Ag layer <b>503</b> and a second Au10-Sn layer <b>504</b> laminated in this order. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> First, on a surface of an aluminum nitride sintered substrate (50.8 mm&#xd7;50.8 mm&#xd7;0.3 mm (thickness), surface roughness (Ra): 0.02 &#x3bc;m, Rmax: 0.179 &#x3bc;m, available from Tokuyama Corporation), the first undercoating layer containing Ti as a main component and having a thickness of 0.06 &#x3bc;m, the second undercoating layer containing platinum as a main component and having a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m, and a gold electrode layer having a thickness of 0.6 &#x3bc;m were laminated in this order by the use of a sputtering apparatus. Subsequently, patterning for preventing flow-out of solder was performed by photolithography, and the Pt layer having a thickness of 0.25 &#x3bc;m was formed by sputtering. Then, solder patterning was performed by photolithography, and on the solder flow-out preventing Pt, the Ti bonding layer having a thickness of 0.06 &#x3bc;m and the Ag layer having a thickness of 1.5 &#x3bc;m were formed by the use of a vacuum deposition apparatus. Subsequently, the Au&#x2014;Sn layer composed of an Au&#x2014;Sn alloy (melting point: 217&#xb0; C., Young's modulus: 45.0 GPa (at 25&#xb0; C.)) having a gold content of 10% by weight and having a thickness of 1.0 &#x3bc;m was formed by two-element simultaneous deposition using Au and Sn as targets, then the Bi layer having a thickness of 0.33 &#x3bc;m and the Ag layer having a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m were formed, and finally the Au&#x2014;Sn layer having a gold content of 10% by weight and having a thickness of 2.47 &#x3bc;m was formed by two-element simultaneous deposition using Au and Sn. Thus, a substrate for device bonding (No. 1) of the invention was prepared. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> The substrate for device bonding thus obtained was measured on the surface roughness, and as a result, Ra was 0.058 &#x3bc;m and Rmax was 0.689 &#x3bc;m. The measurement of surface roughness was carried out in the following manner using Digital Instruments Contact AFM NanoScope III. That is to say, a double-sided tape was stuck to the opposite side to the solder layer surface side of the substrate for device bonding of the invention, and the substrate for device bonding was fixed to a steel circular plate having a diameter of 12 mm. Then, the circular plate was fixed on an upper part of a piezo-scanner by a magnetic method, and a cantilever equipped with a probe was brought into contact with the solder layer surface. The cantilever responds to protrusions or depressions of the solder layer surface directly and is displaced. The displacement was measured by an &#x201c;optical lever method&#x201d;. The cantilever used was a V-shaped cantilever made of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, having a spring constant of 0.12 N/m, a probe height of 3 &#x3bc;m, a curvature radius of 5 to 40 nm and a &#xbd; cone angle of 35&#xb0; and having a tip shape of quadrangular pyramid. Prior to the measurement, static elimination using a static elimination blower was carried out to reduce influences by static electricity of the substrate surface to the lowest. The measuring range was a range of 20 &#x3bc;m square, and the number of measuring fields of view was 3 per 1 chip of the substrate for device bonding. After the measurement, image processing of the measured three-dimensional profile was carried out using a softwear of NanoScope III to calculate Ra and Rmax, and a mean value of the 3 fields of view was determined. In the present invention, Ra is a mean value on a surface based on the center plane of the measuring range and is calculated from the formula (1). Rmax is a difference in height between the highest point and the lowest point of the surface.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> Subsequently, on the solder layer of the substrate for device bonding prepared as above, a Ga&#x2014;As semiconductor device having an Au electrode was placed, and the semiconductor device was bonded at 220&#xb0; C. for 180 seconds by the use of a die bonder to prepare a device bonded substrate. Similarly, 10 device bonded substrates were prepared, and their bond strength was measured by a die shear tester (manufactured by IMADA Inc.). As a result, the mean bond strength was 3.1 kgf/mm<sup>2</sup>, and the modes of peeling were all &#x201c;inside semiconductor device&#x201d;. The melting point of the solder layer in the examples and the comparative examples was determined by DTA measurement using a Seiko Instruments TG/DTA apparatus SSC-5200. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> Further, substrates for device bonding No. 2 to No. 8 of the invention were prepared by changing each thickness of the Bi layer, the Au&#x2014;Sn layer having a gold content of 10% by weight (Au10-Sn layer) and the Ag layer as shown in Table 1, and then measurements of surface roughness and bond strength were carried out in the same manner as above. The results are set forth in Table 1. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> The expression that the mode of peeling is &#x201c;inside semiconductor device&#x201d; means that peeling is caused by breakage of a semiconductor device, and the expression that the mode of peeling is &#x201c;inside solder layer&#x201d; means that peeling is caused by breakage of a solder layer. Breakage of a semiconductor device takes place at 2.5 kgf/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more. It is generally said that when the mode of peeling is &#x201c;inside solder layer&#x201d;, the mean bond strength is desired to be 2.0 kgf/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more from the viewpoint of reliability. Further, it can be said that when peeling takes place between a semiconductor device and a solder, bond reliability is low. In the composition of a solder layer in Table 1, a component other than Au, Bi and Ag is Sn, so that the amount (% by weight) of Sn is omitted.
