<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to packaging systems, and especially to packaging systems for objects such as pills (i.e., pills, tablets, capsules, caplets and the like). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Systems forpackaging small objects for easy dispensing have been the subject of significant research and development. Especially in the field of pharmaceutical products, the accurate packaging of pills, tablets, capsules and the like, has been the focus of industry development and governmental regulation. Accurate dispensation of pharmaceutical products to those in need of such products has been the subject of research and development due to increasing costs associated with the products themselves, as well as concerns over damage caused by inaccurate dispensation of such medications. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Notwithstanding prior efforts to develop such packaging systems, known systems for packaging objects, and in particular for packaging small objects like pills, tablets, capsules and the like, involve a significant level of complexity and commercial scale which makes most of them unsuitable for many applications. For instance, in nursing home settings, home health agencies, outpatient medical facilities and the like, there are very few choices, if any, which provide a convenient, table-top-scale system for accurately and conveniently re-packaging pharmaceutical products purchased in bulk. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Thus, there remains a need for a system or method which facilitates the convenient and accurate packaging and labeling of pharmaceutical products and/or other objects intended for later dispensation and use. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0034"> As will now be appreciated, certain embodiments of the present invention not only enable a user to place, respectively, a plurality of objects into a plurality of blister-like chambers in a sheet, but also enable the user to label each object being packaged so that necessary information associated with the packaged object can be associated with each object. For instance, in the pharmaceuticals field, systems and methods of this invention enable the labeling of each unit dose to be packaged so that the product and/or its recipient may be identified properly, to help ensure that the correct medicine in the correct amount is provided to the correct patient at the correct time. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0035"> The objects to be packaged in accordance with this invention may vary widely, but will typically include objects which are relatively small in size (less than 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, and preferably less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>) with an average width, average thickness and an average length which can vary. In a preferred embodiment, the objects are pharmaceutical products which are distributed as solid or semi-solid objects in the form of pills, tablets, capsules, caplets or the like. It should be appreciated, however, that other larger objects, e.g., syringes or any other object or device conveniently packaged in the type of sheets disclosed in this description, may be packaged by employing a system or method of this invention. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0036"> The sheet into which the objects are placed will form an array of blister-like chambers. The number of recesses in the array in a given sheet will vary based upon the intended use of the sheet and the size of the objects to be placed in the recesses. Typical recess arrays in preferred sheets will have 500 or fewer recesses. A fewer number of recesses may be more desirable when an adhesive backing with space for printed matter or other optical indicia is used to convey information about the contents of each recess. The circumference and depth of each recess may also vary widely, but preferably each recess will be sized to facilitate placement of an object within the recess without having any portion of the object extend above the plane occupied by the flat surface of the sheet, so that any adhesive backing may fit neatly against the sheet without obstruction. The recesses are also preferably sized so that only one object may be placed into a respective recess, to avoid inadvertent placement of multiple objects into a recess. When the objects to be placed in the recesses are pharmaceutical in nature, the sheet preferably is made of a flexible, clear plastic material suitable for storing pharmaceutical products. Also in such circumstance, the sheet is preferably perforated so that the sheet material surrounding each recess may be separated from the adjacent recesses to facilitate dispensation of the contents of each recess on a individualized basis. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0037"> Referring now to the drawings, a preferred device of this invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>A, which depict a planar member <b>10</b> having a top surface <b>12</b> and a bottom surface <b>14</b>. Top surface <b>12</b> is characterized by a plurality of substantially linear and substantially parallel undulations formed by a plurality of rounded rails <b>16</b> disposed in parallel fashion relative to one another so as to define a plurality of grooves <b>18</b> therebetween. Top surface <b>12</b> also defines a plurality of recesses <b>20</b>, each recess <b>20</b> being disposed within a respective groove <b>18</b>, each groove <b>18</b> having disposed along its length a plurality of recesses <b>20</b> disposed therein. Each recess <b>20</b> has associated with it a respective fluid passageway <b>22</b> extending through member <b>10</b> and through top surface <b>12</b> and bottom surface <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0038"> In some embodiments of this invention, it may be preferable for the planar member recesses to be sized and configured to receive substantially all of one, and even more preferably only one, object to be loaded into a blister-like chamber of the target sheet. In this way, the planar member may be more specifically configured to the particular object being loaded into the chambers of the sheet, to avoid loading of multiple objects into a chamber inadvertently. However, this configuration of the planar member may require that different objects having different sizing be loaded using planar members particularly sized for those objects, so that the user who loads a variety of objects into target sheets may wish to have a number of planar members at his or her disposal. It should also be noted that the planar member may be fabricated from a wide variety of materials, but will preferably be fabricated from a material which itself provides a fairly smooth top surface, or provides a surface which can be made smooth and slick through the application of a slicking agent to facilitate movement of objects across the top surface. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0039"> Another embodiment of the present invention provides an alternative configuration of the planar member. In particular, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an alternative planar member <b>10</b> is comprised of a base portion <b>11</b> and removable rounded rails <b>16</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated, each rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>is connected to base portion <b>11</b> through a dove-tailed tongue <b>13</b> which runs the length of the rail and a corresponding groove <b>15</b> in base portion <b>11</b>. In this way, rails <b>16</b><i>a </i>may be separated from base portion <b>11</b> so that a sheet which forms an array of blister-like chambers may be placed flush against a top surface <b>17</b> of base portion <b>11</b>. When base portion <b>11</b> is then rotated while the sheet (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is held flush against the top surface in order to transfer the contents of recesses <b>20</b> into the blister-like chambers of the sheet, the chance that the contents of recesses <b>20</b> will fall outside of a corresponding blister-like chamber ofthe sheet is reduced. It should be appreciated that other means of attaching each rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>to base portion <b>11</b> may be envisioned and feasible. For example, mechanical snaps, screws, magnets, hook and loop fastening material and the like, as well as many other attachment means may be employed to connect each rail to the base portion so that the rails may be removed after filling recesses <b>20</b>, in order to facilitate transfer of the objects from recesses <b>20</b> to the blister-like chambers of the target sheet further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and described in detail below. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0040"> Another embodiment ofthe invention provides for attachment of multiple planar members <b>10</b>,<b>10</b> to one another, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The planar members <b>10</b>,<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are aligned and connected to one another, end-to-end as illustrated, by attachment means in the form of a latch <b>24</b>. Of course, here again, other attachment means, like those described above with respect to rails <b>16</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) may be envisioned and are within the scope and spirit of the invention. In this way, additional planar member recesses <b>20</b> may be filled with ease by one swipe of objects across elongated grooves <b>18</b> formed by end-to-end aligned planar members <b>10</b>,<b>10</b>. Of course, any number of attachable planar members could be so aligned and attached to elongate even further the recess-containing grooves, thereby increasing even more the number of recesses which could be filled with a single deposit and swipe of objects across the grooves. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0041"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary target sheet <b>30</b> for use in accordance with the present invention. A plurality of blister-like chambers <b>32</b> are arrayed across sheet <b>30</b>, and a perforation pattern <b>34</b> through sheet <b>30</b> enables separation ofthe portions of sheet <b>30</b> surrounding each chamber <b>32</b> from the rest of sheet <b>30</b>. As illustrated, a backing <b>36</b> is suspended above sheet <b>30</b>. Preferably, backing <b>36</b> includes an adhesive on the side adjacent to sheet <b>30</b>, the adhesive being patterned so as to provide adhesive only in a pattern which excludes the area above each chamber <b>32</b>. In this way, when backing <b>36</b> is placed in adhering contact with sheet <b>30</b>, adhesive is not present in the enclosed space formed by the walls ofthe blister-like chambers <b>32</b> and the adjacent portion of sheet <b>30</b>, to avoid adhesive from coming into contact with the contents of chambers <b>32</b>. Backing <b>36</b> is also preferably configured to permit printing of information (e.g., bar coding, text, etc.) on the side opposite from sheet <b>30</b>, so that information related to the contents of each chamber <b>32</b> may be printed thereon. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0042"> A preferred apparatus employing the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to provide a system in accordance with this invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. There it can be seen that planar member <b>10</b> is engaged with a vacuum chamber <b>40</b> so as to enclose the space within chamber <b>40</b>. Chamber <b>40</b> is in fluid communication with a vacuum pump P through a vacuum hose <b>42</b>. Chamber <b>40</b> has extending from one end a flange <b>44</b>, and is connected to a template support <b>46</b> by a hinge <b>48</b>. Template support <b>46</b> supports a template <b>50</b> upon which is placed sheet <b>30</b>. A receptacle <b>52</b> is disposed adjacent to chamber <b>40</b> for receiving excess objects when they are swept across top surface <b>12</b>. Template support <b>46</b> further includes a flange <b>54</b> which is provided with an electrical on-off switch <b>56</b> operatively connected to pump P. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0043"> In operation, when switch <b>56</b> is actuated to &#x201c;on, &#x201d; pump P forms a vacuum within vacuum chamber <b>40</b>. This vacuum in turn creates a vacuum within each fluid passageway <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) extending through planar member <b>10</b> and opening into respective recesses <b>20</b>. During such operation, objects may be swept across grooves <b>18</b> of planar member <b>10</b> until each recess <b>20</b> contains one of the objects and the vacuum formed in each respective fluid passageway <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) tends to draw the object toward the floor of a respective recess <b>20</b>. Once the desired number of recesses contain objects respectively, vacuum chamber <b>40</b> may be lifted and pivoted relative to template support <b>46</b> in the direction of the arrow indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> until top surface <b>12</b> of planar member <b>10</b> is disposed directly above target sheet <b>30</b>. When flange <b>44</b> comes into contact with switch <b>56</b>, switch <b>56</b> is then actuated to &#x201c;off&#x201d; so that pump P is switched off, whereupon the contents of each recess <b>20</b> drop into a corresponding and adjacent chamber <b>32</b> of sheet <b>30</b>. Before, during or after this operation, a sheet of backing <b>36</b> may be printed using a printer X optionally controlled by a computer Z. Using the computer, and typically appropriate and commercially available label printing software, the information to be printed on backing <b>36</b> may be customized for the particular objects deposited into sheet <b>30</b>, with suitable information such as, e.g., patient identification information and/or chamber contents identification information, including bar coding if desired. Of course, when only a portion of chambers <b>32</b> of sheet <b>30</b> are to be filled, using computer Z the print placed on backing <b>36</b> can be edited so that print is placed only on the portion of backing <b>36</b> covering filled chambers <b>30</b>. In some cases, it will be desirable to configure computer Z with a bar code reader (not shown) so that bulk objects which are labeled with bar coding (e.g., a national drug code in bar code form) can be read into the system for labeling individual objects from the bulk container in a consistent manner. It also may be desirable to configure the computer with a database to store desired information, such as bar coding information, for preselected objects or products, to reduce the possibility of human error when inputting data for printing on the backing and to generally facilitate use of the system. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0044"> It should be appreciated that, in some cases, use of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may cause additional objects to fall within a recess <b>20</b> of planar member <b>10</b> inadvertently, especially when the recess size is large enough, relative to the objects being loaded, to permit more than one object to fall within a recess <b>20</b>. In such a case, after a vacuum is formed in chamber <b>40</b> as previously described, vacuum chamber <b>40</b> may be lifted and pivoted relative to template support <b>46</b> in the direction of the arrow indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> until top surface <b>12</b> of planar member <b>10</b> is disposed substantially directly above a receptacle (not shown) for excess objects which have been lodged in one or more recesses <b>20</b> of planar member <b>10</b>. The excess objects which are not retained by the vacuum within the fluid passageway <b>22</b> of the respective recess <b>20</b> will fall out of the respective recess <b>20</b>. Then, the target sheet <b>30</b> may receive the retained objects from the recesses of member <b>10</b> once switch <b>56</b> is activated as described above. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0045"> If desired, the planar members of this invention may be used to fill target sheets in accordance with this invention even without a vacuum pump system employing fluid passageways through the members and associated vacuum chambers and pumps. In such a case, the planar member is preferably configured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, so that the top surface of the planar member may be modified by removal of the rails to provide a bottom portion having a flat top surface when the target sheet is placed upon the planar member and the blister-like chambers are aligned with the recesses of the planar member. Of course, once aligned with each other, the sheet and planar member may then be manually flipped so that the contents ofthe planar member recesses fall into the chambers of the target sheet. Another embodiment of the invention could also provide that each rail be configured for attachment to the adjacent rail(s), e.g., by attaching adjacent ends of the rails to a crossbar or some other form of connecting means, so that all of the rails could be attached and removed substantially in unison with one another, thereby facilitating use ofthe planar member. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0046"> It should now be appreciated that the present invention provides an economical, yet commercially viable, solution to the packaging and accurate labeling of objects, and in particular small objects such as pharmaceutical products. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the system may be a table-top configuration which permits small offices and institutional operations alike to package and properly label materials in easy-to-dispense blister packs such as those described herein. It should also be apparent that, when desired, the systems, devices and methods of this invention enable the loading of multiple objects into each individual blister-like chamber of the target sheet, so that unit doses and multiple doses may be loaded into each chamber when desired. To do so would be a matter of repeating the loading procedure for each individual object to be placed in a chamber of the target sheet, and placing the adhesive backing bearing the desired information on the sheet once the desired contents is placed therein. </p>
