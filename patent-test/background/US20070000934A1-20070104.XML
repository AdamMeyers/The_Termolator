<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates generally to systems for dispensing prescribed medications and, more particularly, to a drug dispensing system which enables physicians and approved staff members to conveniently and safely dispense medications from an office of a medical practice. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Traditional methods of dispensing prescribed medications are well known to consumers and medical practitioners. Typically, a consumer receives a drug prescription from a doctor and then proceeds to have the prescription filled by a separate retail pharmacy. Unfortunately, when separate entities are used for prescribing and providing medication, errors can be introduced into the dispensing process which results in improper dispensing of medication. The dispensing of incorrect drugs or the dispensing of proper drugs of incorrect strengths poses serious risks to patients which can lead to injury and even death. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> To reduce such risks, doctors may provide on-site dispensing of certain prescriptions through the use of repackaged drugs. However, under Federal and State law, physicians must dispense only properly packaged and labeled drug products. More specifically, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) require that drug products are repackaged in facilities under stringent quality and procedural standards. Using these standards and procedures, doctors can effectively maintain a comprehensive system for on-site dispensing of medical products while simultaneously providing for the tracking of medical products and/or other inventory maintained by a medical practice. In this manner, doctors can effectively track drug dispensing transactions such that doctors can know what drugs are available for dispensing and whether quantities of drugs on hand have reached critical levels. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Another desirable feature for on-site dispensing of medical supplies is a system that allows for convenient and quick dispensing of prescription drugs. In this regard, it is desirable that prescription drugs may be easily transferred from inventory to a storage and/or dispensing unit that may be quickly and easily refilled and from which prescription drugs may be quickly and easily dispensed. Such drugs are preferably selected from items that are most commonly prescribed for a doctor's patients. More specifically, such items are preferably selected from a predetermined product formulary that best suits the practice of the doctor's office. Items may be selected from an inventory of commonly used solid oral medications, injectables, suspensions, creams and ointments. Either brand-name medications or high quality generic medications may be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Accordingly, there exists a need for a system for manually dispensing of prescription drugs at point-of-care facility using patient-ready bottles. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for a dispensing system wherein the patient-ready bottles may be prepackaged into a self-contained dispensing cartridge. Additionally, there exists a need in the art wherein the cartridges can be easily loaded into a storage locker or cabinet that can be locked to prevent or deter unauthorized access thereinto. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for a dispensing system wherein the cabinet is not readily portable in order to deter theft of certain controlled substances that may be stored in the cabinet. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Also, there exists a need in the art for a dispensing system wherein the cartridges may be easily loaded into the cabinet after which the patient-ready bottles may be dispensed in one-at-a-time fashion. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for dispensing system wherein the cabinets may accommodate cartridges of various sizes for accommodating different quantities of bottles. Finally, there exists a need in the art for a dispensing system wherein the cartridge and cabinets are of simple construction and of low cost. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention specifically addresses the need associated with point-of-care dispensing. More specifically, the present invention is drug dispensing system which comprises a cabinet having a plurality of cartridges disposed therewithin. Each one of the cartridges may contain a plurality of containers or vials into which medications such as prescription drugs and/or controlled substances may be packaged. The vials may be generally cylindrically shaped and may be removed from a vial opening formed in the cartridge. The vial opening may be formed manually by removing a punch-out that is formed along tear lines provided in each one of the cartridges. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The cabinet has opposing door portions which may be hingedly attached to one another along a hinge. The door portions are preferably closable against one another in sealing engagement and may include a lock member such that the door portions may be locked to one another to deter unauthorized access to controlled substances in compliance with DEA regulations. Each one of the cabinets may include a plurality of the shelves for storing a plurality of the cartridges. The door portions include a top wall, a bottom wall, a pair of end walls and a back wall. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The door portions may be pivoted open to a 180&#xb0; arrangement to reveal the cartridges. Each one of the shelves may be mounted to an inner side wall of the door portion. Opposite ends of the shelf may include mounting brackets which allow for vertical adjustment of the shelf in order to accommodate cartridges of varying heights. The back wall may include apertures from which the door portion may be hung from a back of a door or wall. Each one of the shelves may have an upwardly turned lip such that the cartridge may be retained by the lip when the cartridge is stored or placed on the shelf. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Each one of the cartridges is preferably configured to store a plurality of the vials therewithin. The cartridges may have a generally rectangular cross sectional shape and may be fabricated of varying heights depending on the quantity of vials to be stored therewithin. Each one of the cartridges includes a top panel and a bottom panel interconnected by a front panel, a back panel and a pair of side panels. A vial opening is provided in the front panel and side panels of the cartridge to enable removal of one of the vials. The top panel of each one of the cartridges is hingedly openable to facilitate loading of the vials into the cartridge. The vial opening is manually generated by removal of a punch-out formed as a series of contiguous tear lines in the front panel and side panels. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In the flat, unassembled state, each one of the cartridges is comprised of the top panel, side panels, front panel and back panel foldably connected to one another along a plurality of fold lines which extend orthogonally along the cartridge in the unassembled state. When folded, the cartridge defines a generally enclosed interior compartment that is sized and configured to dispensibly store the vials. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The ability to disassemble and unfold the cartridge into the flat planar material facilitates shipping, storage and handling of the cartridges. Furthermore, by fabricating the cartridge out of cardboard, costs are reduced with the added benefit that cardboard is generally biodegradable to enhance its disposability.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating the present invention and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a drug dispensing system <b>10</b> of the present invention. In its broadest sense, the drug dispensing system <b>10</b> comprises a cabinet <b>14</b> having a plurality of cartridges <b>60</b> disposed therewithin. The cartridges <b>60</b> may contain a plurality of containers or vials <b>96</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Medications such as prescription drugs and/or controlled substances may be packaged within the vials <b>96</b>. The vials <b>96</b> may also be packaged with vitamins and neutraceuticals. As is common in the drug industry, the bottles or vials <b>96</b> typically comprise a vial body which is generally a hollow tubular member having a cap such as a childproof cap disposed on an end of the vial body. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the vials <b>96</b> may be generally cylindrically shaped and may be removed from a vial opening <b>94</b> formed in the cartridge <b>60</b> which can be seen mounted on a shelf <b>38</b> of the cabinet <b>14</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the vial opening <b>94</b> may be formed manually by removing a punch-out <b>88</b> that is formed along tear lines <b>92</b> provided in each one of the cartridges <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cabinet <b>14</b> is shown as having opposing door portions <b>12</b> which may be hingedly attached to one another along a hinge <b>34</b>. The door portions <b>12</b> are preferably identical to one another in regard to overall height and width such that the door portions <b>12</b> are closable against one another in sealing engagement. A lock member <b>28</b> may be included on at least one of the door portions <b>12</b> and which may be engageable to a lock latch <b>30</b> disposed on an opposing one of the door portions <b>12</b> such that the door portions <b>12</b> may be locked to one another to deter unauthorized access to substances stored therewithin in compliance with DEA regulations. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The lock member <b>28</b> may be accessible via a key <b>32</b> which may be inserted thereinto as is commonly used in conventional door locks. Each one of the cabinets <b>14</b> may include a shelf <b>38</b> for placing of the cartridges <b>60</b> therewithin. Furthermore, each one of the door portions <b>12</b> may include a plurality of the shelves <b>38</b> for storing a plurality of the cartridges <b>60</b> as well as storing various other medications such as suspensions, creams and ointments. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>, shown is one of the door portions <b>12</b> having three of the shelves <b>38</b> disposed in horizontal arrangement. As can be seen, each one of the door portions <b>12</b> includes a top wall <b>16</b>, a bottom wall <b>18</b>, a pair of end walls <b>20</b> and a back wall <b>22</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the door portions <b>12</b> are adjoined at the respective ones of the end walls <b>20</b> by the hinge <b>34</b>. In this manner, the door portions <b>12</b> may be pivoted open to a 180&#xb0; arrangement to reveal the contents. In the closed position, the door portions <b>12</b> are hingedly closed against one another and may be locked using the lock member <b>28</b> and lock latch <b>30</b>. The hinge <b>34</b> preferably runs the length of the end walls <b>20</b> to provide sufficient structural integrity of the door portions <b>12</b> in relation to one another. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, each one of the shelves <b>38</b> has opposing ends which may be mounted to an inner wall <b>36</b> which is slightly spaced apart from the end walls <b>20</b> of the door portion <b>12</b>. Opposite ends of the shelf <b>38</b> may include mounting brackets <b>46</b> which are configured to allow for vertical adjustments of the shelf <b>38</b> in order to accommodate different configurations of the cartridge <b>60</b> (i.e., cartridges of varying heights). More specifically, each one of the shelves <b>38</b> of the door portions <b>12</b> is preferably configured to be vertically adjustable in order to accommodate a four-vial cartridge <b>62</b>, a six-vial cartridge <b>64</b> and/or a ten-vial cartridge <b>66</b>. It is contemplated that the mounting brackets <b>46</b> may be engageable to holes formed in the inner walls <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the back wall <b>22</b> may include at least one aperture <b>24</b> and preferably a plurality of apertures <b>24</b> from which the door portion <b>12</b> may be hung from a back of the door or from a wall in compliance with DEA regulations. Each one of the apertures <b>24</b> is preferably formed in a keyhole <b>26</b> shape such that the door portion <b>12</b> may be easily hung or suspended from screws that may be extended into the door or wall. Referring briefly now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, shown are the shelves <b>38</b> having an upwardly turned lip <b>44</b> on a free side of the shelf <b>38</b>. Each one of the shelves <b>38</b> may also include a flange <b>42</b> running the length of the shelf <b>38</b> on an opposite side of the shelf <b>38</b> (i.e., the back of the shelf). The flange <b>42</b> provides a means by which the shelf <b>38</b> may be attached to the back wall <b>22</b> of the door portion <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Preferably, the shelf <b>38</b> has a shelf depth <b>40</b> which is dimensioned to be complementary to a depth of the cartridge <b>60</b> such that the cartridge <b>60</b> may be stored on the shelf <b>38</b>. More specifically, the cartridge <b>60</b> has the cartridge depth that is preferably sized to be complementary to the shelf <b>40</b> depth such that the cartridge <b>60</b> may be retained by the lip <b>44</b> when the cartridge <b>60</b> is stored or placed on the shelf <b>38</b>. In this manner, lateral movement of the cartridge <b>60</b> is prevented which secures the cartridge <b>60</b> within the shelf <b>38</b> preventing dislodging of the cartridge <b>60</b> such as may occur during opening of the door portions <b>12</b>. The bottom one of the shelves <b>38</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, may be comprised of the bottom wall <b>18</b> of the door portion <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the shelf <b>38</b> with the upwardly turned lip <b>44</b> may be provided in abutting contact with bottom wall <b>18</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> It is contemplated that the door portion <b>12</b> is fabricated of metallic material such as steel sheet metal which may be formed by bending the sheet metal into the desired dimensional shape (i.e., forming the flange <b>42</b> and lip <b>44</b> on the shelf <b>38</b>). The inner side walls <b>36</b> are disposed in spaced in relation to respective ones of the end wall <b>20</b> of the door portion <b>12</b> and may be secured to the bottom wall <b>18</b>, top wall <b>16</b> and back wall <b>22</b> of the door portion <b>12</b> such as by welding and/or using mechanical fasteners. The shelves <b>38</b> may have the flange <b>42</b> which is disclosed in abutting relationship to the back wall <b>22</b>. Vertical adjustment of the shelf <b>38</b> is facilitated through the use of the mounting brackets <b>46</b> disposed on opposite ends of the shelf <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Referring more particularly now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, shown is the cartridge <b>60</b> which is configured to be removably supported or stored on the shelf <b>38</b>. As was earlier mentioned, each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> is preferably configured to store a plurality of the vials <b>96</b> therewithin. The vials <b>96</b> may be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as having a generally cylindrical shape with the end cap disposed thereon. However, it is contemplated that the vials <b>96</b> may be configured in any shape including rectangular or oval shapes although the cylindrical shape is believed to be advantageous in allowing for slidable movement of the vials <b>96</b> within the cartridge <b>60</b> as the vials <b>96</b> are dispensed. In this manner, the vials <b>96</b> may be readily removed through the vial opening <b>94</b> by sliding downwardly into alignment with the vial opening <b>94</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> As can be seen, the cartridges <b>60</b> have a generally rectangular cross sectional shape and may be fabricated of varying heights depending on the quantity of vials <b>96</b> to be stored therewithin. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cartridge <b>60</b> may be provided as a four-vial cartridge <b>62</b>, a six-vial cartridge <b>64</b> or a ten-vial cartridge <b>66</b>. With the four-vial cartridge <b>62</b>, it is contemplated that the cartridge <b>62</b> is configured to contain of the four vials <b>96</b> in a horizontal orientation wherein the vials are stacked in two columns of two vials. Likewise, for the six-vial cartridge <b>64</b>, it is contemplated that the cartridge <b>60</b> is configured to contain six of the vials in horizontal orientation wherein the vials <b>96</b> are stacked in two columns of three vials. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Finally, if provided in the ten-vial cartridge <b>66</b>, the cartridge <b>60</b> is preferably configured to contain ten of the vials <b>96</b> in horizontal orientation wherein the vials are stacked in two columns of five vials. However, it should be noted that the cartridge <b>60</b> may be configured to contain any number of vials <b>96</b> in any number of columns and rows. Furthermore, as was earlier mentioned, the vials <b>96</b> may be provided in any shape and size with the cartridge <b>60</b> preferably being formed complementary thereto to contain multiples ones of the vials <b>96</b>. In this regard, it is contemplated that the shelves <b>38</b> may have a shelf depth <b>40</b> that is complementary to the cartridge depth which, therefore, is dependant upon the shape and size of the vials <b>96</b> to be contained within the cartridge <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> includes a top panel <b>68</b> and a bottom panel <b>78</b> interconnected by a front panel <b>98</b>, a back panel <b>78</b> and a pair of side panels <b>84</b>. A vial opening <b>94</b> is provided in the front panel <b>98</b> and side panels <b>84</b> of the cartridge. More specifically, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vial opening <b>94</b> is preferably disposed at a lower portion of the front panel <b>98</b> and is spaced slightly upwardly from the bottom panel <b>78</b> in order to prevent inadvertent or unwanted removal of the vials <b>96</b> contained therewithin. In this regard, the vial opening <b>94</b> is preferably spaced slightly upwardly from the bottom panel <b>78</b> to enable removal of one of the vials <b>96</b> yet preventing the vials <b>96</b> from rolling or otherwise escaping out of the vial opening <b>94</b>. The vial opening <b>94</b> in each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> allows access to the interior chamber. The top panel <b>68</b> of each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> is preferably hingedly removable to facilitate loading of the vials <b>96</b> into the interior compartment. As can be seen, the vial opening <b>94</b> is manually generated by removal of a punch-out <b>88</b> which may be formed as a series of contiguous tear lines <b>92</b> provided in the front panel <b>98</b> and side panels <b>84</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in the flat, unassembled state, each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> is comprised of the top panel <b>68</b>, side panels <b>84</b>, front panel <b>98</b> and back panel <b>78</b> foldably connected to one another along a plurality of fold lines <b>90</b> which extend orthogonally along the cartridge <b>60</b> in the unassembled state. When folded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cartridges <b>60</b> define the generally enclosed interior compartment that is preferably sized and configured to dispensibly store the vials <b>96</b>. As was earlier mentioned, the top panel <b>68</b> is preferably hingedly openable along one of the fold lines <b>90</b> to facilitate loading of the vials <b>96</b> into the interior compartment. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Each one of the side panels <b>84</b> may include a top flap <b>72</b> which is foldably connected to the side panel <b>84</b>. Likewise, each one of the top flaps <b>72</b> preferably has a slight joggle <b>74</b> formed along one edge of the top flap <b>72</b>. When the cartridge <b>60</b> is folded along the fold lines <b>90</b>, the joggles <b>74</b> and the back panel <b>78</b> collectively form a slot <b>76</b> for receiving the top panel tab <b>70</b> thereinto when the top panel <b>68</b> is closed. In this manner, when the top panel <b>68</b> is open, the vials <b>96</b> can be easily loaded into the interior compartment of the cartridge <b>60</b> after which the top panel tab <b>70</b> can be inserted between the joggles <b>74</b> and back panel <b>78</b> in order to close the interior compartment. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the bottom panel <b>78</b> is comprised of a plurality of bottom flaps <b>80</b> which extend from respective ones of the back panel <b>78</b> and the side panels <b>84</b>. In this regard, the bottom flaps <b>80</b> are foldably connected along the fold lines <b>90</b> to respective ones of the front <b>98</b>, back <b>86</b> and side panels <b>84</b>. When the cartridge is folded up for use, the bottom flaps <b>80</b> preferably overlap one another and are generally securable together to form a structurally sound bottom panel <b>78</b> that resists opening when the cartridge <b>60</b> is loaded with vials <b>96</b>. Regarding the particular configuration of the bottom flaps <b>80</b>, it can be seen that notches <b>82</b> may be provided in the sides of the bottom flaps <b>80</b> such that opposing ones of the bottom flaps <b>80</b> extending from the front <b>98</b> and back panels <b>78</b> may be interconnected with the bottom flaps <b>80</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> The bottom flaps <b>80</b> extending from the side panels <b>84</b> are overlapped with the bottom panels that extend from the front <b>98</b> and back panels <b>78</b> in order to provide a secure bottom panel <b>78</b> that resists gravitational forces imposed by vials <b>96</b> loaded in the interior compartment. The generally closed cross sectional shape of the cartridge <b>60</b> is achieved when a folding tab <b>70</b> extending from one of the side panels <b>84</b> is connected to the opposite one of the side panels <b>84</b>. It is contemplated that the tab <b>70</b> may be connected to the opposite one of the side panels <b>84</b> using adhesive and/or mechanical fasteners. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is a top flap <b>72</b> extending from respective ones of the side panels <b>84</b>. As was earlier mentioned, the top flaps <b>72</b> may include joggles <b>74</b> formed on at least one edge thereof to collectively define a slot <b>76</b> with the back panel <b>78</b> and into which the tab <b>70</b> from the top panel <b>68</b> may be inserted. Additionally, the top flaps <b>72</b> may provide an additional measure of structural integrity to the cartridge <b>60</b> in the event that the cartridge <b>60</b> is turned upside down when vials <b>96</b> are loaded therewithin. In this manner, the top flaps <b>72</b> cooperate with the top panel <b>68</b> to prevent the vials <b>96</b> from forcing the top panel <b>68</b> open and spilling out of the cartridge <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Importantly, as can be seen, the cartridge <b>60</b> is initially provided in the unassembled state and is fabricated of a single piece of planar material. Although any suitable <b>70</b> material may be used, cardboard is a preferable material. The cardboard may be corrugated cardboard or it may be a single laminate of cardboard. Preferably, the cartridge <b>60</b> is pre-assembled into an auto-bottom arrangement wherein the cartridge <b>60</b> can be formed into its operative configuration merely by popping open and closing the top flap. Advantageously by providing the cartridge <b>60</b> in an unassembled state, various markings such as instructions of use may be easily applied to outer surfaces of the cartridge <b>60</b> such as on the side <b>84</b> and front panels <b>98</b> of the cartridge. It is further contemplated that other markings such as advertising for such point-of-care dispensing systems may be provided on the side <b>84</b> and front panels <b>98</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> Furthermore, the ability to disassemble and unfold the cartridge <b>60</b> into the flat planar material simplifies marking/labeling as well as simplifying shipping, storage and handling of the cartridges <b>60</b>. Furthermore, by fabricating the cartridge <b>60</b> out of cardboard, costs are reduced with the added benefit that cardboard is generally biodegradable to enhance its disposability. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</figref> and <b>4</b>, a punch-out <b>88</b> may be provided in the cartridge <b>60</b> wherein a user may manually generate the vial opening <b>94</b> to allow access to the vials <b>96</b> stored in the interior compartment of the cartridge <b>60</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> may include contiguous tear lines <b>92</b> that may be provided along the front panel <b>98</b> and side panels <b>84</b> such that the punch-out <b>88</b> may be manually removed by the user. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> Although shown with a generally rectangular shape having slightly tapering tear lines <b>92</b> in the side panels <b>84</b>, it is contemplated that the punch-out <b>88</b> may be provided in any shape such as an oval shape. Furthermore, the punch-out <b>88</b> may be provided along any portion of any panel of the cartridge <b>60</b> although the front panel <b>98</b> is a preferred location. In this regard, it is contemplated that the punch-out <b>88</b> could be generally oriented on the side panel <b>84</b> between the back panel <b>78</b> and front panel <b>98</b>. In order to facilitate removal of vials <b>96</b> from the vial opening <b>94</b>, it is contemplated that the punch-out <b>88</b> is generally sized and configured to be complementary to the shape and size of the vials <b>96</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> Furthermore, when placed in the use (i.e., folded up) configuration, it is contemplated that the cartridge <b>60</b> is geometrically sized to be compatible with the vials <b>96</b>. More specifically, because the vials <b>96</b> are stored within the interior compartment in a generally horizontal orientation, the width of the front panel <b>98</b> is preferably generally equal to or slightly greater than the length of each one of the vials <b>96</b>. Likewise, the back panel <b>78</b> is generally sized to be generally equal to that of the front panel <b>98</b>. The side panels <b>84</b> are preferably sized to be complementary to double the width of the vial <b>96</b> such that two columns of vials <b>96</b> may be stored in one cartridge <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> Referring briefly now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown in the drug dispensing system <b>10</b> are a plurality of cartridges <b>60</b> stored on each one of the shelves <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, five cartridges <b>60</b> are stored in generally side-by-side arrangement on the shelf <b>38</b>. However, four of the cartridges may be stored in the shelf <b>38</b> such that the shelf <b>38</b> defines a shelf length which is specifically configured to accommodate four of the cartridges <b>60</b> in side-by-side arrangement. It should be noted that any number of cartridges <b>60</b> may be provided and stored on the shelves <b>38</b> in side-by-side arrangement. It should also be noted that spacers <b>58</b> may be inserted between adjacent ones of the cartridges <b>60</b> in order to equally space the cartridges <b>60</b> apart from one another. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The cabinet <b>14</b> and, hence, the door portions <b>12</b> may be provided in a variety of sizes. For example, the cabinet <b>14</b> may be provided in a small size suitable for accommodating up to 24 dispensing cartridges <b>60</b> with four cartridges <b>60</b> being installed or stored on each of three shelves <b>38</b> disposed in each of the two door portions <b>12</b>. A larger size of the cabinet <b>14</b> may be configured to hold at least forty of the cartridges <b>60</b>. If the ten-vial cartridges <b>66</b> are exclusively stored on the shelves <b>38</b>, it is contemplated that at least four hundred and eighty (480) vials <b>96</b> may be stored in one of the cabinets <b>14</b>. As can be seen, any number of cartridges <b>60</b> having a variety of different configurations (i.e., four-vial cartridge <b>62</b>, six-vial cartridge <b>64</b> and ten-vial cartridge <b>66</b>), may be stored within the cabinet <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The operation of the drug dispensing will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. Each one of the cartridges <b>60</b> may be initially provided in the unassembled or flat state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. The cartridge <b>60</b> is comprised of a top panel <b>68</b>, a bottom panel <b>78</b>, a front panel <b>98</b>, a back panel <b>78</b> and a pair of side panels <b>84</b> foldably connected to one another along a plurality of fold lines <b>90</b>, as was described above. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, the top panel <b>68</b> is completely separated from top flaps <b>72</b> disposed on either side of the top panel <b>68</b> such that the top panel <b>68</b> can move independently of the top flaps <b>72</b> to allow for folding of the top panel <b>68</b> along the fold line <b>90</b>. Likewise, the bottom flaps <b>80</b> which comprise the bottom panel <b>78</b> are each constructed to be movable and formable along the fold lines <b>90</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> The bottom flaps <b>80</b> are thus independent of one another such that when the cartridge <b>60</b> is folded up into the use configuration, the bottom flaps <b>80</b> may be overlapped and interlocked with one another. Assembly of the cartridge <b>60</b> into the use configuration is accomplished by folding the side panels <b>84</b>, back panel <b>78</b> and front panel <b>98</b> along the four vertically oriented fold lines <b>90</b>. The tab <b>70</b> extending from the side panel <b>84</b> may then be connected to the opposing one of the side panels <b>84</b> (such as via adhesive) to form a generally closed, orthogonally-shaped cross section. The bottom flaps <b>80</b> may be folded upwardly into interlocking and/or overlapping arrangement with one another and may be secured together via adhesive and/or mechanical fastenings such as stapling. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> Vials <b>96</b> containing the desired types of prescription drugs may be then loaded into the interior compartment of the cartridge <b>60</b> and a generally horizontal orientation. It is configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vials <b>96</b> are preferably loaded in columns of two, and in two rows for the four-vial cartridge <b>62</b>, up to three rows for the six-vial cartridge <b>64</b>, up to five rows, for the ten-vial cartridge <b>66</b>. The cartridges <b>60</b> may then be loaded into the cabinet <b>14</b> and be placed on the shelves <b>38</b> in the appropriate location. The cabinet <b>14</b> may be moved to the desired location such as by mounting on a wall or door. During periods of non-use, the door portions <b>12</b> may be closed and/or locked to one another. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> During dispensing of operations, the door portions <b>12</b> may be opened along the hinge <b>34</b> revealing the cartridges <b>60</b> stored therewithin. Upon identifying the type of prescription drug to be dispensed, the user manually removes the punch-out <b>88</b> by pressing inwardly along the tear lines <b>92</b> to break away and remove the punch-out <b>88</b> from the front panel <b>98</b> and side panels <b>84</b>. The vial opening <b>94</b> that is formed by removal of the punch-out <b>88</b> allows access to individual ones of the vials <b>96</b> stored within the cartridge <b>60</b>. The user then removes the vial <b>96</b> presented adjacent the vial opening <b>94</b> after which the vials <b>96</b> stored on top of the just-dispensed vial <b>96</b> move freely downwardly into alignment with the vial opening <b>94</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Removal of subsequent vials <b>96</b> simply entails the user grasping the vial <b>96</b> located adjacent the vial opening <b>94</b> and removing the vial <b>96</b> therefrom. A variety of drugs and prescriptions may be dispensed in this manner by simply identifying the type of desired drug to be dispensed and locating the cartridge <b>60</b> which contains such drug. Upon completion of dispensing operations, the door portions <b>12</b> may be closed against one another and may be locked together. Upon depletion of the contents of vials <b>96</b> in any of the cartridges <b>60</b>, a user may simply reload the desired replacement cartridge <b>60</b> on the shelf <b>38</b>. Advantageously, the upwardly turned lip <b>44</b> which extends along the length of each one of the shelves <b>38</b> prevents lateral movement and spillage of the cartridges <b>60</b> out of the door portions <b>12</b> when the door portions <b>12</b> are being opened. The cardboard from the depleted cartridge <b>60</b> may be easily disposed of such as by recycling or incineration. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only certain embodiments of the present invention and is not intended to serve as limitations of alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the invention. </p>
