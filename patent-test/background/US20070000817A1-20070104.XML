<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to a screening arrangement in a vibrating screen for screening of material, such as crushed stone, gravel or the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a screening arrangement being a cross-tensioned or a longitudinally tensioned screening media. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> In mining and stone industries, it is in many cases important to fractionate crushed stone and gravel into fractions of stones with different sizes. Normally, a deviation from the size is permitted according to industry standards, e.g., 10 percent oversized particles and 15 percent undersized particles. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> In most cases, fractionating is done by supplying an unfractionated stream of crushed stone or gravel to a vibrating screen provided with a screening deck including screening holes for allowing stones smaller than the screening holes to pass through the holes. The vibration pattern and the inclination of the vibrating screen are arranged so that the crushed stones continuously flow in one direction on the screen, ultimately leaving it on one side or falling through the holes in the screening deck. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> To improve the screening of the unfractionated material and to get a thicker material layer on the screening deck some screening devices are provided with raised portions, see e.g., SE-C2-524 179 and EP-B1-0 680 386. In SE-C2-524 179, stiffening longitudinal beams are arranged on top of the screening deck to reduce the wear on the screening holes and to make undersized particles to pass faster through the screening deck. In EP-B1-0 680 386, a curved surface in the form of longitudinal ridges has been arranged on top of the screening deck, where the curved surface is a fine screening screen. The curved surface aims to provide a larger screening surface and to prevent material from being screened to migrate toward the lower sides of the screen. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another application of a non-flat screening deck is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,607,080 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,610, where systems for separating particles from a mix of particles and fluids by a screen with shale shakers used in the drilling industry are shown. The screen is designed with a flat screening deck and with ramps so that a portion of the fluids will pass over the ramp, whereas the screen will separate the particles from the remaining portion containing both particles and fluid. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The problem with the above prior art solutions and screening devices having only a flat screening deck is that none of them reduces the traveling speed of the material to be stratified as it passes over the screening deck. Furthermore, they do not include elements for stirring or mixing the material to improve the screening. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Faced with the above prior art screening systems and the disadvantages and problems therewith, the object with the present invention is to provide a solution to improve screening efficiency in a simple way with a screening assembly for a vibrating screen for screening of unfractionated material, such as crushed stone and gravel. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> According to a first aspect, a screening arrangement in a vibrating screen for screening of material, the screening arrangement being a cross-tensioned or longitudinally tensioned screening media and comprising elements arranged on top of the screening media for stirring or mixing the screened material. The stirring elements being raised portions on the surface of the screening media, where the raised portions are arranged transversely to the travel direction of the screened material.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a screening media <b>100</b> for a vibrating screen for screening of crushed stones, gravel or the like. The screening media <b>100</b> is a cross-tensioned screening media that is arranged in a vibrating screen by way of fastening arrangements <b>170</b> in each end of the screening media that fasten the screening media <b>100</b> to the walls <b>200</b> of the vibrating screen. The screening media <b>100</b> comprises a screening surface <b>101</b>, wires <b>102</b> and raised portions <b>103</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The screening media <b>100</b> is further provided with a beginning portion <b>104</b> and an end portion <b>105</b>. The beginning portion <b>104</b> defines the portion of the screening media <b>100</b>, where the material to be screened enters the screening media <b>100</b>. The end portion <b>105</b> defines the portion of the screening media <b>100</b>, where the material leaves the screening media <b>100</b>. A longitudinal direction of the screening media <b>100</b> is indicated with an arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The longitudinal direction of the screening media is also the traveling direction for the material, i.e. stones or gravel, on the vibrating screen. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front view of the screening media <b>100</b> having projecting wires <b>102</b> at each longitudinal side of the screening media <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a top view of the screening media <b>100</b>. In both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, only a few of the wires <b>102</b> and the raised portions <b>103</b> are indicated, but it is obvious for a man skilled in the art that wires <b>102</b> and raised portions <b>103</b> are arranged at intervals from the beginning portion <b>104</b> and the end portion <b>105</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a side view of the screening media <b>100</b> in its entire length. The screening media <b>100</b> comprises a screening surface <b>101</b>, wires <b>102</b> and raised portions <b>103</b>. The screening surface <b>101</b> is provided with through holes (not shown) for fractionating crushed stone and gravel into fractions of stones with different sizes. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The wires <b>102</b> and raised portions <b>103</b> are arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the screening media <b>100</b> and at a distance between each other along the entire length of the screening media <b>100</b>. Between each raised portion <b>103</b>, the screening surface <b>101</b> is arranged. At every raised portion <b>103</b>, at least one wire <b>102</b> is arranged. The wires <b>102</b> are connected to an attaching device to fasten the screening media <b>100</b> to the walls of the vibrating screen. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> To make the length of the screening media <b>100</b> flexible, the screening media <b>100</b> is provided with certain shortening positions <b>106</b>-<b>109</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, i.e. positions where the screening media <b>100</b> is prepared to be cut off. At the positions <b>106</b>-<b>109</b>, several raised portions <b>103</b> can be arranged, where at least one of the raised portions <b>103</b> at the positions <b>106</b>-<b>109</b> is provided with two wires <b>102</b>. If the screening media is shortened, the portion of the screening media left of the shortening positions <b>106</b>-<b>109</b> and the raised portion <b>103</b>, having two wires <b>102</b> incorporated (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 9</figref> and <b>10</b>), are cut off. Thus, the modified and shortened screening media has a new beginning portion defined by the raised portion <b>103</b> having two wires <b>102</b> incorporated at the cut-off position <b>106</b>-<b>109</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The raised portions <b>103</b> may have slightly different shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>-<b>12</b>, but all shapes preferably have some common features, i.e. having a slightly increasing slope along the longitudinal direction of the screening media <b>100</b> to a top portion of the raised portion <b>103</b> and having a steep slope or almost a vertical end portion. The length, height, start portion and end portion of the raised portion <b>103</b> affect the stirring effect of the raised portion <b>103</b> and are selected to achieve the most effective stirring of the material to be screened. The shape of the raised portions <b>103</b> is also affected by the thickness of the screening surface. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where the raised portion <b>103</b> is arranged on a plateau. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The raised portions <b>103</b> can also be arranged so that not every raised portion <b>103</b> has the same shape to create different stirring effects along the screening media. For example every second raised portion <b>103</b> may have the same shape, e.g., a higher shape, and those therein between may have another shape, e.g., a lower shape. The raised portions could also be arranged so that the raised portions <b>103</b>, having two wires <b>102</b> incorporated are longer and lower, whereas the raised portions <b>103</b>, having one wire <b>102</b> incorporated, are shorter and higher. In the shown embodiments, the raised portions <b>103</b>, having two wires <b>102</b> incorporated are longer (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), whereas the raised portions <b>103</b>, having one wire <b>102</b> incorporated, are shorter (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an enlargement C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the end portion <b>105</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an enlargement D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the beginning portion <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an enlargement E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the screening media <b>100</b> including the shortening positions <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> show an enlargement F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the screening media <b>100</b> including the shortening position <b>109</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an enlargement G of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of a raised portion <b>103</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The screening media <b>100</b> comprises different materials. Both the screening surface <b>101</b> and the raised portions <b>103</b> are typically made of polymeric materials, e.g., polyurethane (PU) or rubber. Both the screening surface <b>101</b> and the raised portions <b>103</b> can be made of the same material, but in a preferred embodiment, the raised portions <b>103</b> are manufactured of relatively unresilient PU, whereas the screening surface <b>101</b> is manufactured of a more resilient PU. The preferred materials for the raised portions <b>103</b> have a hardness that preferably is in the range from about 50&#xb0; Shore A to about 95&#xb0; Shore A, and the preferred materials for the screening surface <b>101</b> have a hardness of about 30&#xb0; Shore A to about 95&#xb0; Shore A. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Preferred materials are, e.g., PU, rubber, PVC, polyethylene, polyamide, polyester, urethane rubber, suitable natural rubber compounds, other rubber materials or the like for both the raised portions <b>103</b> and the screening surface <b>101</b>. The wires <b>102</b> are typically made of steel, Kevlar, Twaron, polyester or aramid fibers. The term &#x201c;wire&#x201d; has been used throughout the description and the appended claims with meaning of an arrangement having reinforcing and tensioning functionality and the &#x201c;wires&#x201d; are made of any of the above-disclosed materials. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The screening media can also be provided with wires at every second position of the raised portions, but not at the shortening positions. It also possible to have a screening media, where the raised portions are arranged at every second wire position. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The screening media can also be longitudinally tensioned, either by only rotating the screening media shown in e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or by arranging the wires parallel with the longitudinal direction A of the screening media and arranging the spaced raised portions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction A. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is shown screening media <b>100</b> that is mounted in a vibrating screen. The screening media <b>100</b> is attached to the sidewalls <b>200</b> of the vibrating screening by a hook arrangement <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>. Hooks <b>170</b> is arranged at the ends of the of the screening media <b>100</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and corresponding and interacting hooks <b>160</b> are arranged on the sidewalls <b>200</b>. The hooks <b>160</b> are provided with bolt and nuts arrangement <b>180</b> to tension the screening media <b>100</b> between the sidewalls <b>200</b> of the screen. The screen is further provided with support beams or barriers <b>190</b> between the sidewalls <b>200</b> of the vibrating screen having their longitudinal direction parallel to the sidewalls <b>200</b> of the vibrating screen. The support beams or barriers <b>190</b> are arranged at different heights in order to support the cross-tensioned screening media <b>100</b> between the sidewalls of the vibrating screen, forming the cross-tensioned screening media <b>100</b> to have a crowned or slightly upwardly curved shape and to support the cross-tensioned when being mounted. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a holding-down arrangement <b>150</b> is shown, which is used if the vibrating screens are very wide. The holding-down arrangement <b>150</b> is arranged with down holding element, e.g., longitudinal beam fixed by bolts or the like, for holding down the middle of the cross-tensioned screening media <b>100</b> so that the crowned shape is not too high, which eitherwise could cause the material to be screened to deviate to the sides giving a bad screening result. Thereby, two crowned shapes are arranged with the cross-tensioned screening media <b>100</b> over the width of the vibrating screen. In a narrower screen, the holding-down arrangement <b>150</b> is naturally omitted, since it is not needed. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> The presently disclosed embodiments are considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive. The scope is indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents thereof are intended to be embraced. </p>
