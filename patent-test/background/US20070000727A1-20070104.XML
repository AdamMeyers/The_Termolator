<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a drain valve, and more particularly to a drain valve assembly that may be used with a small gas engine for lawn and garden equipment (such as lawnmowers and riding mowers), snowblowers, power shovels, generators, and the like. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional drain valve <b>10</b> connected to an oil sump <b>12</b>. The drain valve <b>10</b> is a rigid metal pipe that provides little, if any, flexibility. The drain valve <b>10</b> is threadably secured to the oil sump <b>12</b> through a threaded end <b>14</b>. In order to drain oil from the oil sump <b>12</b>, an engagement end <b>16</b> of the drain valve <b>10</b> is rotated such that an oil passage (not shown) is exposed, thereby allowing oil to drain from the oil sump <b>12</b>, through the drain valve <b>10</b>, and out of the oil passage. Because the drain valve <b>10</b> is rigid and stiff, gaining access to the drain valve <b>10</b>, and/or draining fluid therefrom, may be difficult. Additionally, because the drain valve <b>10</b> is rigid and stiff, if an outside object contacts the drain valve <b>10</b>, the force exerted by the outside object may be sufficient to crack, snap, or otherwise break the drain valve <b>10</b> or the oil sump <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Thus, a need exists for a drain valve assembly that may be used with a small gas engine that is easy to access and use. Additionally, a need exists for a more resilient and robust drain valve assembly. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Embodiments of the present invention provide a drain valve assembly configured for use with an engine. The drain valve assembly includes an adapter and an outlet tube. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The adapter may include a cylindrical body having a threaded end configured to be secured to a fluid outlet of an engine, and a tube-mating end including either a ball or a socket. An oil channel is formed through the adapter. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The outlet tube includes an adapter-mating end integrally formed with an intermediate portion, which is in turn integrally formed with an outlet end. The adapter-mating end includes an opposite one of the ball and socket as the adapter. That is, if the adapter includes the ball, the outlet tube includes the socket, and vice versa. An oil passage is formed through the outlet tube and is in fluid communication with the oil channel. The adapter-mating end is pivotally secured to the tube-mating end through the ball mating with the socket. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The outlet tube may also include a cap covering the outlet end. The cap is configured to be selectively moved between a closed position, in which the outlet end is closed, and an open position, in which the outlet end is open. The cap may be an elastomeric cap that is configured to be stretched into the open position, and/or the cap may be configured to be pulled or rotated into the open position.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of &#x201c;including&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and variations thereof is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items and equivalents thereof. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a lateral view of a drain valve assembly <b>18</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The drain valve assembly <b>18</b> includes a resilient outlet tube <b>20</b> pivotally secured to an adapter pipe <b>22</b>. The resilient outlet tube <b>20</b> may be formed of rubber or a solid plastic, such as glass-filled nylon, or the like, while the adapter pipe <b>22</b> may be formed of the a similar material, or cast metal (such as zinc). </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The adapter pipe <b>22</b> includes a threaded end <b>24</b> integrally connected to a hex-nut <b>26</b>, which is in turn integrally connected to a tube-mating end <b>28</b>. The threaded end <b>24</b> is configured to be threadably secured to a structure, such as an oil sump (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of a small engine (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The hex-nut <b>26</b> is configured to receive a tool, such as a socket wrench, which may be used to securely torque the adapter pipe <b>22</b> into the oil sump. While the adapter pipe <b>22</b> is shown with the threaded end <b>24</b> and the hex-nut <b>26</b>, the adapter pipe <b>22</b> may, alternatively, be secured to the oil sump through various other configurations and methods. For example, the adapter pipe <b>22</b> may be bonded to the oil sump. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The tube-mating end <b>28</b> of the adapter pipe <b>22</b> includes a ball <b>30</b> that is configured to snapably mate into a socket. An oil channel (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) passes through the entirety of the adapter pipe <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The outlet tube <b>20</b> includes an adapter-mating end <b>32</b> integrally formed with an intermediate portion <b>34</b>, which is in turn integrally formed with an outlet end <b>36</b>. An oil passage (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is defined through the adapter-mating end, the intermediate portion <b>34</b>, and the outlet end <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The adapter-mating end <b>32</b> includes a socket <b>38</b> that is configured to snapably secure to the ball <b>30</b>. Once the socket <b>38</b> is secured to the ball <b>30</b>, the outlet tube <b>20</b> may pivot about the ball <b>30</b> through a wide range of directions. For example, the adapter-mating end <b>32</b> may pivot about the ball <b>30</b> in the directions denoted by arrows A, A&#x2032;, B, B&#x2032;, and all combinations thereof. Thus, if an outside object contacts the outlet tube <b>20</b>, the outlet tube <b>20</b> pivots, bends, or otherwise gives with respect to the adapter pipe <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The outlet end <b>36</b> includes an elastomeric cap <b>40</b>. The cap <b>40</b> may be selectively moved between open and closed positions. For example, in order to move the cap <b>40</b> into an open position, such that oil may flow through the outlet end <b>36</b>, the cap <b>40</b> is urged in the direction of arrow C. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the drain valve assembly <b>18</b> through line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an oil channel <b>42</b> is formed through the adapter pipe <b>22</b> and is in fluid communication with an oil passage <b>44</b> formed through the outlet tube <b>20</b>. The socket <b>38</b> of the outlet tube <b>20</b> is pivotally secured around the ball <b>30</b> of the adapter pipe <b>22</b>. While the outlet tube <b>20</b> is shown having the socket <b>38</b>, and the adapter pipe <b>22</b> is shown having the ball <b>30</b>, the outlet tube <b>20</b> may, alternatively, include a ball, while the adapter pipe <b>22</b> may, alternatively, include a corresponding socket <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The outlet end <b>36</b> of the outlet tube <b>20</b> gradually tapers toward its distal end <b>46</b>. An annular notch <b>48</b> is formed in the outlet tube <b>20</b> proximate the union of the outlet end <b>36</b> and the intermediate portion <b>34</b>. A securing ring <b>50</b> of the cap <b>40</b> is secured within the notch <b>48</b>. Thus, the notch <b>48</b> securely retains the cap <b>40</b> in a closed position. The notch <b>48</b> also ensures the cap <b>40</b> is not ejected from the outlet tube <b>20</b> when the cap is opened. The cap <b>40</b> also includes a plug <b>52</b> that plugs or otherwise closes an oil outlet <b>54</b> of the outlet tube <b>20</b> when the cap <b>40</b> is in the closed position. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to open the outlet tube <b>20</b>, the cap <b>40</b> is urged in the direction of arrow C. For example, the cap <b>40</b> may be grasped around a circumferential ledge <b>56</b> and pulled outward in the direction of arrow C. As the cap <b>40</b> is urged in this direction, the securing ring <b>50</b> may remain in the notch <b>48</b>, but, because the cap <b>40</b> is formed of an elastomeric material, the cap <b>40</b> may be anchored in the notch <b>48</b>, while it is stretched so that the plug <b>52</b> is removed from the oil outlet <b>54</b>. Once the stretching force is no longer exerted, the cap <b>40</b> returns to its original, closed position. Alternatively, as the cap <b>40</b> is urged in the direction of arrow C, the securing ring <b>50</b> may follow, thereby dislodging from the notch <b>48</b>. As such, the plug <b>52</b> is removed from the oil outlet <b>54</b>, and oil may pass out of the oil outlet <b>54</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the cap <b>40</b> may include beams <b>57</b> that integrally connect the plug <b>52</b> to the securing ring <b>50</b>. An opening <b>58</b> may be defined between the beams <b>57</b>. The securing ring <b>50</b> may include a ridge (not shown) that abuts against a catch (not shown) formed around the oil outlet <b>54</b>. Thus, the cap <b>40</b> may remain on the outlet tube <b>20</b>, even when in the open position. If the cap <b>40</b> remains on the outlet tube <b>20</b> in the open position, oil may drain from the oil outlet <b>54</b> and through the opening <b>58</b>. Optionally, the cap <b>40</b> may not include openings, but, instead, may be removable from the outlet end <b>36</b> in order to allow oil to drain from the oil outlet <b>54</b>. In order to close the oil outlet <b>54</b>, the cap <b>40</b> is urged in the direction of C&#x2032; until the securing ring <b>50</b> snapably secures into the annular notch <b>48</b>, and the plug <b>52</b> closes the oil outlet <b>54</b>. When the retaining ring <b>50</b> remains in the notch <b>48</b>, the elastic force of the elastomer cap <b>40</b> holds the plug <b>52</b> on the outlet, thereby keeping the oil drain closed. Also, the outlet end <b>36</b> may include barbs or ridges <b>55</b> at a distal end that assist in retaining the plug <b>52</b> on the outlet <b>54</b>. The ridges dig into the plug <b>52</b> to ensure that it remains firmly in place. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a lateral view of the drain valve assembly <b>18</b> secured to an oil sump <b>60</b> of a device <b>62</b>, such as an engine, or frame of a lawnmower or snowblower. The threaded end <b>14</b> of the adapter pipe <b>22</b> is threadably secured within a reciprocal oil outlet (not shown) of the oil sump <b>60</b>. The socket <b>38</b> of the outlet tube <b>20</b> is pivotally secured about the ball <b>30</b> of the adapter pipe <b>22</b>. Through this ball-and-socket connection, the outlet tube <b>20</b> may be pivoted through a variety of directions, such as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Oil may drain from the oil sump <b>60</b> into the oil channel <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the adapter pipe <b>22</b>. The oil then passes from the adapter pipe <b>22</b> into the oil passage <b>44</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the outlet tube <b>20</b>. In order to drain the oil from the drain valve assembly <b>18</b>, the cap <b>40</b> is urged into the open position, as discussed above, thereby opening the oil outlet <b>54</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, oil drains out of the drain valve assembly <b>18</b> through the oil outlet <b>54</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an isometric view of a drain valve assembly <b>64</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The drain valve assembly <b>64</b> includes an adapter pipe <b>66</b>, similar to the adapter pipe <b>22</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>), that pivotally retains an outlet tube <b>68</b>, similar to the outlet tube <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) in a similar fashion as that described above. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> A cap <b>70</b> is disposed over the distal end of the outlet tube <b>68</b>. The cap <b>70</b> is configured to rotate between open and closed positions. The cap <b>70</b> includes a curved channel <b>72</b> formed through an end <b>74</b> and a fluid opening <b>76</b>. In order to move the cap <b>70</b> into an open position, such that fluid may drain from the outlet tube <b>68</b>, the cap <b>70</b> is rotated in the direction of arc D. A post <b>78</b> extending outwardly from the outlet tube <b>68</b> and positioned through the channel <b>72</b> ensures that the cap <b>70</b> is not ejected from the outlet tube <b>68</b>. Fluid may flow through the fluid opening <b>76</b> while in the open position. Optionally, the cap <b>70</b> may be in the open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and, in order to move the cap <b>70</b> in the closed position, the cap is rotated in the direction of arc D. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an isometric view of a drain valve assembly <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The drain valve assembly <b>100</b> includes an adapter pipe <b>102</b>, similar to the adapter pipe <b>22</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>), that pivotally retains an outlet tube <b>104</b>, similar to the outlet tube <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) in a similar fashion as that described above. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> A cap <b>106</b> is disposed over the distal end of the outlet tube <b>104</b>. The cap <b>106</b> is configured to be moved between open and closed positions. The cap <b>106</b> includes a curved channel <b>108</b> formed through an end <b>110</b> and a fluid opening <b>112</b>. In order to move the cap <b>106</b> into an open position, such that fluid may drain from the outlet tube <b>104</b>, the cap <b>106</b> is rotated in the direction of arc D and pulled in the direction of E. During this motion, the cap <b>106</b> is removed from the post <b>114</b>. A retaining groove <b>116</b> formed around the outlet tube <b>104</b> ensures that the cap <b>106</b> is not ejected from the outlet tube <b>104</b> when the oil drain is open. That is, the cap <b>106</b> includes an interiorly-directed ridge (not shown) that is retained within the groove <b>116</b> to ensure that the cap <b>106</b> is not removed from the outlet tube <b>104</b>. Additionally, a snap ring <b>118</b> is formed around the outlet tube <b>104</b> close to the center of the outlet tube <b>104</b> than the retaining groove <b>116</b>. The snap ring <b>118</b> assists in retaining the cap <b>106</b> in the closed position by snapably securing the ridge (not shown) of the cap <b>106</b>. </p>
