<heading level="2" id="h-0003">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention is directed to systems and methods for providing presence tracking of nodes of a logical network in a distributed computing system. More particularly, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for automatically tuning a logical network with &#x201c;keep alive&#x201d; optimization(s). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Distributed computing is a field of study that has received increased attention and study in recent years, as network interconnectivity, from wired to wireless, of computing devices and objects continues to mature and computing devices and objects of all kinds continue to proliferate. To this end, a variety of protocols can be used to enable computing devices and objects of all sorts to communicate with one another in a manner that is independent of the particularities of the source and target computing devices. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Examples of such protocols that have been developed include Simple Control Protocol (SCP), x10, and CEBus&#xae;. SCP, for instance, is a lightweight device-control protocol that allows manufacturers to create small, intelligent devices that can communicate with each other in a secure and robust manner over low-speed communication networks such as household power lines. With SCP, devices with limited computing power and memory resources&#x2014;such as light switches, alarm clocks, and appliances&#x2014;can be part of a peer-to-peer network of other SCP devices. Devices in an SCP network can also participate in more sophisticated Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) networks through a software component called a UPnP to SCP bridge. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The following examples describe some typical scenarios that SCP and other protocols can make possible. Automated lights and light switches can be enabled using SCP such that light switches and fixtures can be controlled from a PC. A homeowner can change &#x201c;which switches control which lights&#x201d; without needing to call an electrician to rewire the physical circuits. Interactions among small appliances can also be enabled using SCP. For instance, an alarm clock can automatically start a coffee maker. Interactions among SCP and UPnP devices can also be enabled using SCP. For instance, a homeowner can place a tape in a UPnP-capable VCR and press &#x201c;Play.&#x201d; The VCR then sends a UPnP event to a rules engine, which places the room into a home theater mode. The rules engine then turns the UPnP TV on and connects it to the VCR audio and video outputs. Then, through an SCP to UPnP bridge, the engine tells the SCP room lights to dim and closes the SCP blinds. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> One can thus readily see that SCP, and other protocols like SCP, are powerful vehicles for communication across a variety of computing devices. One can also appreciate that a variety of scenarios are possible with SCP, when one considers the possibility of any computing device or object being able to communicate simply and easily with any other computing device or object. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> However, the above-described scenarios presume ideal, or near ideal, network conditions, and in contrast, often the actual physical medium utilized for communications in a logical network is not ideal. For instance, in the case of power line communications, data is not always guaranteed to arrive at its destination, or when it does, there may be some interference along the way that distorts the data or renders it unrecognizable. Similarly, on the reception side of data communications, interference can also be of impact. Moreover, various nodes may become disconnected from the network at widely variant rates, and thus, optimal presence assertion refresh or timeout rates of a first node may be widely different than optimal presence assertion refresh or timeout rates of a second node on the same logical network. For instance, plug-in devices such as a table lamp may have different network behavior characteristics from built-in devices, such as a furnace. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Accordingly, it would be desirable to minimize the number of failed messaging communications by keeping a current list of nodes in the logical network that are present and capable of receiving communications. It would be desirable, for instance, to skip messaging communications for nodes that are absent, and to prioritize messages based upon recency of presence and other assumption(s) or rule(s), which make messages more or less likely to arrive in a robust fashion. In connection with such logical network(s), therefore, it would be desirable to provide presence tracking across logical network(s) for dynamic tuning of the logical network(s) according to messaging conditions, and rates of nodes appearing in or vanishing from the network. It would be further desirable to provide an improved optimization of presence tracking variables across the logical network for lower bandwidth conditions. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In view of the foregoing, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for providing presence tracking of nodes of a logical network in a distributed computing system. Each node in a logical network tracks the presence of all other nodes on the network. This presence information is used by the protocol to optimize bandwidth utilization of the shared physical media, by not attempting to communicate with a device that does not appear to be or is unlikely to be present. In one embodiment, the presence tracking is applied to a power line carrier (PLC) physical media because of PLC's low-bandwidth characteristics, low baud rate characteristics and the widespread usage of plugged-in devices, the presence of which on the network is generally more transient by nature. Each node on the network asserts its presence by sending a periodic qualifying message and tracks the presence of other nodes by periodically sampling whether a keep-alive has been received. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In another embodiment, the invention tunes presence tracking on a logical network by splitting the logical network's node identification (node ID) address space in two parts, each part being assigned different values for sending and sampling keep-alives. A first group of node IDs are assigned to &#x201c;fast presence&#x201d; devices, while a second group of node IDs part are assigned to &#x201c;slow presence&#x201d; devices. This process can be managed by an Address Space Arbitrator by using a hint value provided in each device's description information. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000"> Overview </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> As described above, there is a need for improved presence tracking of nodes in a logical network, particularly in connection with a low data rate or baud rate, less than ideal physical network underlying the logical network, wherein low data rates, and transient presence hamper presence tracking. A naive approach would be to frequently refresh the presence of all nodes at the same rate; however, practically speaking, the assertion criteria for different kinds of nodes on the logical network should be flexible. The invention thus provides a simple, yet robust, optimization of &#x201c;keep alives&#x201d; in connection with such a low bandwidth, less than ideal physical network that enables dynamic tuning of logical network(s) according to messaging conditions, and rates of nodes coming and going in the network. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In accordance with the invention, each node in a logical network, such as Simple Control Protocol (SCP) network, tracks the presence of all other nodes on the network. This presence information is used by the protocol to optimize bandwidth utilization of the shared physical media, by not attempting to communicate with device(s) which do not appear to be present. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The invention recognizes that presence tracking can be especially critical on the power line carrier (PLC) physical media because of both its low-bandwidth (and therefore baud rate) characteristics and of the widespread usage of plugged-in devices, for which presence on the network is generally more transient by nature. A logical network may include built-in devices (a wall-mounted light control for example) and transient devices (a plugged in table lamp for example) which communicate with one another. Each node on an SCP network asserts its presence by sending a periodic qualifying message or by sending traffic to other nodes; each node tracks the presence of every other node by periodically sampling whether a keep-alive has been received from each node. A keep-alive for a node includes presence assertion by the node itself, or receipt of a qualifying message or packet from the node by another portion of the logical network. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In one embodiment, the invention tunes presence tracking on a logical network by splitting the logical network's node identification (node ID) address space in two parts, each part being assigned different values for sending and sampling keep-alives. The lower node IDs are assigned to &#x201c;fast presence&#x201d; devices, while upper node IDs part tracks &#x201c;slow presence&#x201d; devices. This process can be actively managed by an Address Space Arbitrator (ASA) by using a hint value provided in each device's description information. </p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000"> Exemplary Logical Network&#x2014;Overview of Simple Control Protocol (SCP) </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> As mentioned, embodiments of the invention apply to logical networks. An overview of SCP is provided herein. Various implementations of SCP support networks that use standard electrical wiring as the physical medium connecting the devices, e.g., the Power Line Carrier (PLC) implementation of SCP. Other SCP implementations for other physical network media such as radio frequency and infrared transmissions can also be utilized. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram overview of an exemplary SCP stack, and exemplary description of various aspects thereof follows. SCP is a protocol that makes use of a physical medium <b>240</b>, such as PLC. A protocol stack is a way to manage and organize nodes <b>200</b> in a distributed system via an API <b>210</b>, or other object. A node <b>200</b> can be either a software object or a hardware object, or a combination of both. One node, the address space arbitrator <b>200</b><i>asa, </i>handles discovery, acquisition and maintenance of nodes on the logical network. There is one ASA <b>200</b><i>asa </i>per logical network. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> A protocol comprises an application protocol (AP) and a network control protocol. The application protocol side implements a session layer <b>215</b>, a transport layer <b>220</b> and a network layer <b>225</b> which handle operations, transactions and messages, respectively. A data link layer <b>230</b> resides on top of the physical medium <b>240</b>, and handles the message packets <b>235</b> delivered and received by the network layer <b>225</b>. A protocol encrypts and decrypts communications for security purposes. Message communications make use of a logical address that includes a net ID <b>300</b>, a node ID <b>310</b> and a network key <b>320</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These enable all nodes associated in a logical network to share a secret, which allows for each to communicate securely with other nodes on the logical network. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> An SCP device is a component that uses the SCP to communicate with other devices connected to the same physical medium. SCP accommodates both &#x201c;hard&#x201d; and &#x201c;soft&#x201d; devices. A hard device is a piece of hardware such as a dimmer switch or a motion sensor. For hard devices, SCP is implemented as a set of integrated circuit (IC) chips that handle all of the protocol-level communication tasks for a device. This chipset, when added to a device, forms a communication subsystem that handles of the protocol-level communication tasks for the device. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> A soft device is a software application that runs on a PC under the SCP device emulation environment. This environment emulates the communication subsystem provided by the SCP chipset and allows multiple soft devices running on the same PC to share the same channel of communications to the physical network. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> At its simplest, an SCP network consists of two or more SCP devices and the physical medium connecting the devices. A network can also include other software components that run on a PC, such as the SCP to UPnP bridge, the Address-Space Arbitrator, and the Physical Network Manager. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The SCP to UPnP bridge is a special soft device that allows SCP devices to interoperate with UPnP devices. The bridge extends the full capabilities of UPnP to small devices that are not capable of implementing TCP/IP and native UPnP stacks. For example, the bridge allows the properties of an SCP device to be set by using messages sent across a TCP/IP network. All SCP device property relationships are established at the UPnP level through the bridge and propagate down to the SCP device level. The bridge also allows SCP devices to interoperate with devices that use other control protocols. If a bridge exists between those devices and a UPnP network, SCP devices can use UPnP as a common communication language. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> The Address-Space Arbitrator (ASA) is another special soft device that forms and manages a logical network of SCP devices. A logical network is a group of devices that are logically separate from other devices connected to the same physical network medium. SCP can support one or more logical networks within the same physical network. For example, a physical network can include a logical network for security devices, another for lighting devices, and yet another for audio-visual equipment. Logical networks are also used in environments such as apartment buildings where adjacent apartments share the same power line. Each apartment uses its own logical network so it does not interfere with the operation of the devices in a neighboring apartment. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> The Physical Network Manager is a software component that runs on a PC. It manages the connection to the physical network, allowing multiple soft devices running on the same PC to share the same connection. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> An SCP device presents itself on the network as a root device with optional nested sub-devices. Each device (or sub-device) supports one or more services. A service consists of a group of related properties and actions. Properties describe the state of a service, and actions change or access the state of a service. Taken together, the sub-devices, services, properties, and actions of a device are called its device model. The SCP device model is analogous to a programming object, where an object interface provides access to a set of properties and methods that operate on and describe the state of the object. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The SCP device model is based on the UPnP device model, e.g., the device model for an SCP device is a UPnP device description that has been augmented with SCP data. As a device developer, a device model is developed for the device, creating a binary version that the device uses at runtime. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> SCP devices work by exposing their properties and actions to other devices, and by using operations to access the properties and actions of other devices on the network. The operation is the fundamental unit of communication among devices. A device uses operations to set and retrieve property values on other devices, to invoke actions on other devices, and to notify other devices when the value of a property changes. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Devices use operations to accomplish many tasks, and one of the primary tasks involves implementing subscriptions. A subscription is a relationship that one device, called the subscriber, sets up between itself and a property on another device, called the publisher. After a subscription is established, the publisher sends notification messages to the subscriber whenever the value of the property changes. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Devices use subscriptions as the basis for setting up property routes. A property route is a one-way connection between two properties: a source property on a publisher device and a destination property on a subscriber device. When the value of the source property changes on publisher device, the subscriber device updates its destination property with the new value. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> To illustrate how subscriptions and property routes work, consider a device that exposes a simple timer service consisting of three properties: Increment, which specifies the timer countdown increment in milliseconds; Value, which specifies the current countdown time; and Trigger, which changes from False to True when Value goes to zero. The service also has three actions: Start, Stop and SetValue. For example, if it is desired that the Timer turn on some lights when the Timer's Value property goes to zero, a third-party (for example, a configuration utility) can tell each light to subscribe to the Timer's Trigger property and create a route between that property and the light's Intensity property. Then, when Trigger property becomes True, each light's Intensity property also changes to True, and the lights come on. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> One creates an SCP device by integrating the SCP communication subsystem into the device. For a hard device, this involves incorporating the SCP chipset into the circuitry of the device. For a soft device, it involves implementing code in a Windows application that takes advantage of the SCP emulation environment. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The application subsystem connects to the SCP communication subsystem through a serial peripheral interface (SPI) connection. One of the main tasks (besides creating the device model) is to implement a software interface to the SPI connection that allows the device application, running on the application processor, to communication with the communication subsystem. Code is also implemented that allows the device application to control the communication subsystem, using it to communicate with other devices on the network. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> To summarize, creating an SCP device involves accomplishing the following tasks. (1) Creating the device model that defines the services, properties, and actions provided by the device, (2) Implementing code in your device application that supports the SPI connection between the application subsystem and the SCP communication subsystem and (3) Implementing code in the application-processor that interacts with the communication subsystem to communicate with other devices in the network. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> Commonly assigned copending U.S. patent application. Ser. No. 09/556,279 (the '279 application), entitled &#x201c;System for Networked Component Address and Logical Network Formation and Maintenance&#x201d; describes a system for forming and maintaining one or more networks of devices connected to a shared media is provided. Aspects of the '279 application include processes for: (a) forming a logical network on the shared media; (b) discovering devices connected to the shared medium; (c) assigning (or acquiring) devices to a logical network; and (d) maintaining a logical network. Another aspect of the '279 application also defines a message format and protocol for communication over the shared media. The protocol uses a two-level address scheme (e.g., a logical network ID and a device ID) and defines several message types used to support the above processes and other useful features. Each device is expected to have a globally unique device ID, called the Device Serial Number (DSN). </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> A logical network includes an address space arbiter (ASA) and, typically, one or more devices attached to the shared media. An acquisition authority (AA), interacting with the ASA, is required to complete acquisition of a device by a logical network. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> An ASA can form a logical network by selecting a possible logical network ID, when first attached to the physical media. The ASA then broadcasts a message addressed to the entire network to determine whether the possible ID is already taken. If the possible ID is not taken, the ASA adopts the ID as its logical network ID and can begin acquiring devices. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> To join a logical network, a device attached to the shared media broadcasts an announce message addressed to the entire shared media. This is initiated at the request of an ASA attached to the shared media. ASAs receiving the announce message then determine whether the device is a &#x201c;discovered&#x201d; device. If the device is also not acquired, the AA decides whether to authorize the ASA to acquire the discovered device. If authorized, the ASA then assigns an available device ID to the device. The device ID must be unique within the logical network, but does not necessarily have to be globally unique. The ASA helps maintain the logical network by periodically sending a message to each device of the logical network and waiting for the appropriate response from that device. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> One advantage is that the system provides a simple way to segment a shared media into several logical networks. In addition, the system provides an easy-to-use mechanism for connecting devices to a network suitable for the general public. </p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that a computer or other client or server device can be deployed as part of a computer network, or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard, the present invention pertains to any computer system having any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units or volumes, which may be used in connection with the keep alives optimization(s) of the invention. The present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or distributed computing environment, having remote or local storage. The present invention may also be applied to standalone computing devices, having programming language functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities for generating, receiving and transmitting information in connection with remote or local services. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> Distributed computing facilitates sharing of computer resources and services by direct exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information, cache storage, and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity, allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard, a variety of devices may have applications, objects or resources that may implicate the keep alives optimization(s) of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> provides a schematic diagram of an e exemplary networked or distributed computing environment. The distributed computing environment comprises computing objects <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. and computing objects or devices <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i>etc. These objects may comprise programs, methods, data stores, programmable logic, etc. The objects may comprise portions of the same or different devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, televisions, personal computers, etc. Each object can communicate with another object by way of the communications network <b>14</b>. This network may itself comprise other computing objects and computing devices that provide services to the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, each object <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. or <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i>etc. may contain an application that might make use of an API, or other object, software or hardware, to request use of the keep alives optimization(s) of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> In a distributed computing architecture, computers, which may have traditionally been used solely as clients, communicate directly among themselves and can act as both clients and servers, assuming whatever role is most efficient for the network. This reduces the load on servers and allows all of the clients to access resources available on other clients, thereby increasing the capability and efficiency of the entire network. Services that use the keep alives optimization(s) in accordance with the present invention may thus be distributed among clients and servers, acting in a way that is efficient for the entire network. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Distributed computing can help businesses deliver services and capabilities more efficiently across diverse geographic boundaries. Moreover, distributed computing can move data closer to the point where data is consumed acting as a network caching mechanism. Distributed computing also allows computing networks to dynamically work together using intelligent agents. Agents reside on peer computers and communicate various kinds of information back and forth. Agents may also initiate tasks on behalf of other peer systems. For instance, intelligent agents can be used to prioritize tasks on a network, change traffic flow, search for files locally or determine anomalous behavior such as a virus and stop it before it affects the network. All sorts of other services may be contemplated as well. Since data may in practice be physically located in one or more locations, the ability to distribute services that make use of the keep alives optimization(s) described herein is of great utility in such a system. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> It can also be appreciated that an object, such as <b>110</b><i>c, </i>may be hosted on another computing device <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. or <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. Thus, although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many of the networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides the infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> In home networking environments, there are at least four disparate network transport media that may each support a unique protocol, such as Power line, data (both wireless and wired), voice (e.g., telephone) and entertainment media. Most home control devices such as light switches and appliances may use power line for connectivity. Data Services may enter the home as broadband (e.g., either DSL or Cable modem) and are accessible within the home using either wireless (e.g., HomeRF or 802.11b) or wired (e.g., Home PNA, Cat 5, even power line) connectivity. Voice traffic may enter the home either as wired (e.g., Cat 3) or wireless (e.g., cell phones) and may be distributed within the home using Cat 3 wiring. Entertainment media, or other graphical data, may enter the home either through satellite or cable and is typically distributed in the home using coaxial cable. IEEE 1394 and DVI are also emerging as digital interconnects for clusters of media devices. All of these network environments and others that may emerge as protocol standards may be interconnected to form an intranet that may be connected to the outside world by way of the Internet. In short, a variety of disparate sources exist for the storage and transmission of data, and consequently, moving forward, computing devices will require ways of sharing data, such as data accessed or utilized incident to program objects, which make use of keep alives optimization(s) in accordance with the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The Internet commonly refers to the collection of networks and gateways that utilize the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which are well-known in the art of computer networking. TCP/IP is an acronym for &#x201c;Transport Control Protocol/Interface Program.&#x201d; The Internet can be described as a system of geographically distributed remote computer networks interconnected by computers executing networking protocols that allow users to interact and share information over the networks. Because of such wide-spread information sharing, remote networks such as the Internet have thus far generally evolved into an open system for which developers can design software applications for performing specialized operations or services, essentially without restriction. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> Thus, the network infrastructure enables a host of network topologies such as client/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The &#x201c;client&#x201d; is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. Thus, in computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to &#x201c;know&#x201d; any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, computers <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. can be thought of as clients and computer <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. can be thought of as the server where server <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. maintains the data that is then replicated in the client computers <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote network such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> Client and server communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by a protocol layer. For example, Hypertext-Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW). Typically, a computer network address such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address is used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. For example, communication can be provided over a communications medium. In particular, the client and server may be coupled to one another via TCP/IP connections for high-capacity communication. SCP, x10 and CEBus&#xae; are other examples of protocols used for logical network(s). </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an exemplary networked or distributed environment, with a server in communication with client computers via a network/bus, in which the present invention may be employed. In more detail, a number of servers <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc., are interconnected via a communications network/bus <b>14</b>, which may be a LAN, WAN, intranet, the Internet, etc., with a number of client or remote computing devices <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i><b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>e, </i>etc., such as a portable computer, handheld computer, thin client, networked appliance, or other device, such as a VCR, TV, oven, light, heater and the like in accordance with the present invention. It is thus contemplated that the present invention may apply to any computing device in connection with which it is desirable to implement logical network(s). </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> In a network environment in which the communications network/bus <b>14</b> is the Internet, for example, the servers <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. can be Web servers with which the clients <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i><b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>e, </i>etc. communicate via any of a number of known protocols such as HTTP. Servers <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. may also serve as clients <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i><b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>e, </i>etc., as may be characteristic of a distributed computing environment. Communications may be wired or wireless, where appropriate. Client devices <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i><b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>e, </i>etc. may or may not communicate via communications network/bus <b>14</b>, and may have independent communications associated therewith. For example, in the case of a TV or VCR, there may or may not be a networked aspect to the control thereof. Each client computer <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>c, </i><b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>e, </i>etc. and server computer <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. may be equipped with various application program modules or objects <b>135</b> and with connections or access to various types of storage elements or objects, across which files may be stored or to which portion(s) of files may be downloaded or migrated. Any computer <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i><b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. may be responsible for the maintenance and updating of a database <b>20</b> or other storage element in accordance with the present invention, such as a database or memory <b>20</b> for storing application variable(s) or data processed according to the invention. Thus, the present invention can be utilized in a computer network environment having client computers <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. that can access and interact with a computer network/bus <b>14</b> and server computers <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>etc. that may interact with client computers <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>etc. and other like devices, and databases <b>20</b>. </p>

It should be understood, however, that handheld, portable and other computing devices and computing objects of all kinds are contemplated for use in connection with the present invention. While a general purpose computer is described below, this is but one example, and the present invention may be implemented with a thin client having network/bus interoperability and interaction. Thus, the present invention may be implemented in an environment of networked hosted services in which very little or minimal client resources are implicated, e.g., a networked environment in which the client device serves merely as an interface to the network/bus, such as an object placed in an appliance. In essence, anywhere that data may be stored or from which data may be retrieved is a desirable, or suitable, environment for operation of the techniques utilizing keep alives optimization(s) of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Although not required, the invention can be implemented via an operating system, for use by a developer of services for a device or object, and/or included within application software that operates in connection with keep alives optimization(s) of the invention.

The Network layer <b>225</b> is also supported by special messages from Network Control Protocol (NCP) <b>250</b> that are used to indicate when a node <b>200</b> comes online, goes offline in a graceful way, and signals its continued presence, e.g., when it has not sent any other packets for a certain amount of time. Node presence tracking may run in either robust or unsecured mode. In unsecured mode (address in the clear), any packet sent qualifies to indicate its presumed originator is present on the logical network, while in robust mode, only authentic and time stamped messages qualify. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> In one embodiment, each node keeps track of the presence states of other nodes in the logical network, as per the exemplary non-limiting presence state flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, at startup, each node tracked is placed in the &#x201c;presumed present&#x201d; state <b>400</b>. Once qualifying traffic is received from that node anywhere on the logical network, or when the node asserts its presence, i.e., signs on, the node is placed in the &#x201c;present&#x201d; state <b>410</b>. If, however, a failed transaction implicating or targeting the node fails, the node is considered to have entered the &#x201c;absent&#x201d; state <b>420</b>. Similarly, if nothing, e.g., no keep alive message, is heard from the node for a predetermined amount of time, i.e., the node times out, the node is considered to have entered the absent state <b>420</b>. Moreover, if the node signs off, the node is placed in the absent state <b>420</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Once in the present state <b>410</b>, if a failed transaction implicating or targeting the node fails, the node is considered to have entered the absent state <b>420</b>. Similarly, if the node signs off, the node is considered to have entered the absent state <b>420</b>. Another way for the node to leave the present state is if a predetermined period of time passes, i.e., if a timeout occurs, without hearing from the node. In such a case, the node leaves the present state <b>410</b> for the &#x201c;was present&#x201d; state <b>430</b>. In such circumstances, the node is given special treatment since the node was in fact heard from at some point due to actual traffic from the node, but the timeout condition has been reached. Since timeout may have occurred due to a temporary network aberration as opposed to the node's actual absence, the node is not placed in the absent state <b>420</b>, but rather is placed into the intermediate was present state <b>430</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> Once in the was present state <b>430</b>, as a result of a timeout from the present state <b>410</b>, a node re-enters the present state <b>410</b> as a result of the receipt of keep-alive or sign on message from the node. If, however, an additional pre-determined period of time occurs without hearing from the node, then a sufficient period of time has passed such that the node can be considered to have entered the absent state <b>420</b>. Moreover, if a failed transaction implicating or targeting the node fails while the node is in the was present state <b>430</b>, the node is then considered to have entered the absent state <b>420</b>. From the absent state <b>420</b>, the node can only enter the present state <b>410</b> upon receipt of a keep alive or sign on message from the node. A node can also enter the absent state <b>420</b> by sending a sign off message from any other state. How often a node sends refresh traffic and how long the timeout conditions are can be set as network tuning parameters. Also, as will be appreciated from other embodiments below, some devices merit different settings based upon their characteristic behavior on the network. In one embodiment, the four states, i.e., presumed present <b>400</b>, present <b>410</b>, was present <b>430</b> and absent <b>420</b>, are represented with 2 bits. Thus, for instance, in a logical network comprising 2048 nodes, only 512 bytes are required to represent presence information. This is suited for an SCP/PLC implementation on an embedded microcontroller with limited memory resources, such as RAM, as noted above. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an exemplary non-limiting choice for a timeout period to refresh period ratio is 2.5, such that there is the possibility of missing a refresh message on the network without removing the node from the present state <b>410</b>. Additionally, even if two or three refresh messages are missed, the node is not placed in the absent state <b>420</b> until 5 or more refresh messages are missed due to the existence of the intermediate was present state <b>430</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> As mentioned above, the presence tracking model of the invention works well with power line carrier (PLC) physical media because of both its low-bandwidth (and therefore low baud rate) characteristics and of the widespread usage of plugged-in devices, for which presence can be a transient quality. Thus, with respect to an exemplary implementation in an SCP network, each node on an SCP network asserts its presence by sending a qualifying message (keep-alive) at least every PresenceRefresh seconds and each node tracks the presence of every other node by sampling every PresenceTimeout seconds whether a keep-alive has been received from each node. As noted above, an exemplary non-limiting heuristic choice is for PresenceTimeout to be set to greater than or equal to 2.0 times PresenceRefresh. This heuristic choice is intended in no way to limit the scope of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> The invention thus enables a framework for tuning presence tracking on a logical network. In one embodiment, the invention additionally splits the logical network's node identification (node ID) address space in two parts, with each part being assigned different values for PresenceRefresh and PresenceTimeout. In this regard, and as illustrated in the exemplary data structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, presence information is stored for a given node, which are indexed by nodeID. Devices stored above the SlowBaseID are considered fast devices, and devices stored below the SlowBaseID are considered slow. Alternatively, the lower node IDs can also be assigned to &#x201c;fast presence&#x201d; devices, while upper node IDs can track &#x201c;slow presence&#x201d; devices. In one embodiment, this process is actively managed by the SCP Address Space Arbitrator, which is described in further detail in commonly assigned copending U.S. patent application. No. AA/BBB,CCC, filed MM/DD/YYYY (ASA, 186568.1), incorporated herein by reference, by using a hint value called PresenceLease provided in each SCP device's description information. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> The invention thus enables the optimization of network bandwidth utilized for presence tracking in what are real-world scenarios for protocols using less than ideal physical media, such as SCP/PLC. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> In an embodiment of the invention relating to SCP, SCP's network layer protocol implements a presence tracker, which runs independently on each node.

<p id="p-0088" num="0095"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary non-limiting flow diagram that makes use of the concept(s) described above. At <b>600</b>, a presence tracker of a node or device resets counters. At <b>605</b>, counters are updated with an elapsed time (initially zero) and processing to other tasks yields for the update. At <b>610</b>, a determination is made whether the nodeID of a node is less than the SlowBasedID. If so, at <b>615</b>, the refresh TimeOut value for the node is set to the fast time out value. If not, at <b>625</b>, the refresh time out value is set to the slow time out value. At <b>630</b>, a determination is made whether a refresh counter is greater than the refresh TimeOut value. If so, a keep alive message is sent and the refresh counter is reset at <b>635</b>, and the flow proceeds to <b>640</b>. If not, the flow proceeds to <b>640</b>, where a determination is made whether the fast presence counter is greater than the presence fast timeout variable. If so, at <b>645</b>, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and every node tracked node is declared as less present. In one embodiment, the term &#x201c;less present&#x201d; is construed differently for different nodes depending upon their presence states. For nodes that are in the was present or presumed present state, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and any node for which a keep alive has not been received since the last sampling is declared as absent. For a node that are in the present state, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and the node is declared as &#x201c;was present.&#x201d; having a less present state than previously, i.e., for a node that is presumed present, the node is declared as absent and for a node that is &#x201c;was present,&#x201d; the node is declared as absent. For a node that is present, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and the node is declared as &#x201c;was present.&#x201d; The fast presence counter is also reset and the flow proceeds to <b>650</b>. If not, the flow proceeds to <b>650</b>, where a determination is made whether the slow presence counter is greater than the presence slow timeout variable. If so, at <b>645</b>, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and every node tracked node is declared as less present. For nodes that are in the was present or presumed present state, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and any node for which a keep alive has not been received since the last sampling is declared as absent. For a node that are in the present state, the presence table is scanned up to the SlowBaseID and the node is declared as &#x201c;was present.&#x201d; The slow presence counter is also reset and the flow proceeds to <b>605</b>. If not, the flow proceeds to <b>605</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096"> As mentioned above, presence tracking may run in either robust or unsecured mode. In unsecured mode, any packet sent qualifies to indicate its presumed originator is present on the logical network, while in robust mode, only authentic and time stamped messages qualify. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097"> The address space is separated in two groups of devices: those that tend to time out quickly and those that tend to time out slowly, respectively. In one embodiment, the ASA controls the operating mode and the quick vs. slow devices using application variables. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098"> With respect to presence notifications, various embodiments can be implemented. In one embodiment, the Network layer notifies the higher layers of the following events for a given node: (A) the node just signed on, (B) the node appeared on the logical network, (C) the node vanished from the logical network (timing out), (D) the node presence is placed into the absent state on that node and (E) the node signed off. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099"> These rules help to prevent wasted communication effort and channel bandwidth, as well as stalled message transmission, until SCP detects activity on the part of the node again. The cycle of forcing the absent state, and then re-appearance due to activity, causes a higher layer retry cycle. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100"> An asymmetric (one way) communication fault between two nodes that lasts longer than the maximum time a node is allowed to be silent can cause a corresponding asymmetry in device presence and thus error control protocols used with the node presence mechanism of the invention can optionally take this case into consideration. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101"> It can be appreciated that even at power loss, it is desirable for a node to send an Network Control Protocol sign off message. However, this may not always be possible due to network delays beyond the device's power hold-up time, unacceptable cost of power hold-up components, or abrupt network disconnection (e.g., yanking the plug out of the wall socket), etc. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102"> In robust mode, SCP bases node presence or absence upon the following messages, in the event that the messages are authentic and time stamped with a valid network time: Any application protocol (AP) message that fits in a single packet, whether unicast, multicast or broadcast to the logical network, including (A) an NCP_NetSignOn message, (B) an NCP_NetTimeAssert message, tunneled in an AP packet which is not checked for a valid time stamp, (C) an NCP_NetSignOff message and (D) an NCP_NetPresence message. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103"> In unsecured mode, SCP bases node presence upon either the messages noted above or upon Data Link AP packet source node IDs. In this mode, nodes substitute the NCP_NetPresence message with an empty packet to assert presence, utilizing network bandwidth efficiently. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0104"> Since Data Link AP packet addresses are always sent in the clear, a node's presence can be spoofed. However, if this spoofing is done while the real node is active, SCP activates the Data Link imposter detection mechanism. If the spoofing is done while the real node is inactive, no harm is done because the spoofing device cannot cause any action without sending valid (encrypted) Network layer AP messages. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105"> An embodiment for security-critical applications implements an Application layer presence protocol beyond the node presence detection provided by the Network layer. For example, an intruder or fire alarm may require a minimum rate of operations, which causes a fault notification if not maintained. Network load must be carefully considered in such circumstances. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0106"> With respect to exemplary, presence protocol, whenever a node becomes active on its logical network, the node sends a NCP_NetSignOn message to try to notify the other nodes of its presence. In one embodiment, the node sends this message as a robust NCP message with normal priority. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107"> If at all possible when reset or powered down, and whenever it is removed from network membership, a node sends the NCP_NetSignOff message to try to notify the other nodes of its absence. In one embodiment, the node sends this message as a robust NCP message with high priority. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108"> The Node identifier (ID) Node ID space is separated in two using the PresenceSlowBaseId application variable. Node IDs starting at this value are tracked as slow presence nodes. The Network layer tracks presence of every other node on the logical network by sampling a presence table at a regular timed interval. If a node has sent a qualifying message during the last sampling interval, it is considered present on the network. This sampling interval is different for quick nodes and slow nodes, as set by the application variables PresenceFastTimeout and PresenceSlowTimeout. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0109"> In a further embodiment, it is the responsibility of each node to assert its presence on the network if it has not sent any qualifying messages (what qualifies depends on the presence mode the network is operating in, based on the application variable RobustPresenceFlag) within the time specified by PresenceFastRefresh or PresenceSlowRefresh (whether its node ID is&#x3e;=PresenceSlowBaseld). In robust mode, the node sends an NCP_NetPresence message, and otherwise an empty AP packet. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110"> As alluded to earlier, refresh time variables are typically set at least two times smaller than the matching time out variable for the network to operate reliably. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111"> Also, the values for these variables may be set statically by the device manufacturer or the installer based on its expected use. They may also be optimized dynamically by the ASA, using an application variables distribution mechanism and the PresenceLease value provided for each device on the network. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112"> The 'ZZZ application referenced above describes the use of application variables in a distributed computing system. Application variables allow dynamic tuning and optimization of the protocol of logical network(s) under various operating conditions, which enables reliable operation in connection with low bandwidth physical media. When very high bandwidth physical media is utilized, some inefficiency can potentially be afforded because such inefficiency is hardly noticed from a performance perspective. When a lower bandwidth physical media, such as PLC, is utilized, however, with potential noise considerations as well, dynamic tuning of the network conditions is desirable. For instance, it may be the case that certain message requests from a particular client/server node combination reach the server node quickly and efficiently, however, the return responses to the client over the same physical media periodically are lost, or arrive late. In such a case, it would be desirable to dynamically determine that increased attention to the return responses is desirable. Since such inefficiencies with the return responses may occur intermittently and infrequently, it would be desirable to be able to dynamically make such determinations. The 'ZZZ application thus describes some exemplary non-limiting application parameters that may be utilized to tune the network optimally to operating conditions. The present invention applies similar tuning techniques, optimized for node presence tracking. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113"> Application variables are thus network tuning parameters for a protocol, and may be utilized in connection with the node presence tracking of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114"> The following variables and corresponding non-limiting default values for an exemplary SCP/PLC implementation of node presence tracking for use in tuning network conditions are illustrated in Table I.
