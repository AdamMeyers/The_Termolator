<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to an antenna device, a wireless communication apparatus using the antenna device, a control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus, a program product therefor, and a computer-readable storage medium therefor. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Recently, a wireless communication function has been often implemented in an information processing apparatus such as a personal computer, a communication terminal such as a mobile phone and a personal digital assistance (PDA), and any various kinds of consumer appliances such as an audio instrument, video equipment, a camera, a printer, and an entertainment robot. Further, such the wireless communication function has been often implemented in not only the electronics but also an access point for a wireless local area network (LAN) and a so-called accessory card of small size such as a card specified by personal computer memory card international association (PCMCIA), a compact flash card (trademark), and a mini peripheral component interconnection (PCI) card. The accessory card has been adapted to any wireless card module having such the wireless communication function and a storage function. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Under an actual application environment of these wireless communication functions, radio waves comes from various directions because there are any reflections by a building and an object or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> English Publication, &#x201c;Small Beam-Switched Antenna with RF Switch for Wireless LAN&#x201d;, by K. Mori. 34th European Microwave Conference, p. 837, on October 2004, discloses a Yagi antenna device of slot type, which can improve its communication performance by using a sector antenna (a directional antenna) This Yagi antenna device of slot type performs a communication test according to a WLAN communication system to increase gain of reception and/or transmission signals in the radio waves. Such the communication test allows a throughput to be relatively increased by compared with a related omnidirectional antenna. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Japanese Publication, &#x201c;New Antenna Engineering&#x201d; by Hiroyuki ARAI, Sougou Electronics Publisher, in 1996, discloses a Yagi antenna device as a typical directional antenna. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a configuration of a Yagi antenna device <b>10</b> of monopole type according to a related art. This Yagi antenna device <b>10</b> has a base disk <b>7</b> that is a grounding base, and a printed board <b>9</b> having antenna elements. The base disk <b>7</b> and the printed board <b>9</b> are combined with each other. The base disk <b>7</b> has an opening <b>6</b> through which a wire for power supply passes on a predetermined position thereof. The printed board <b>9</b> is positioned on the base disk <b>7</b> so that they are intersected with each other at right angles. The antenna elements are patterned on the printed board <b>9</b> with a parasitic antenna element <b>1</b> for waveguide, which has a length L<b>1</b>, an excited antenna element <b>2</b>, which has a length L<b>2</b>, and a parasitic antenna element <b>3</b> for reflector, which has a length L<b>3</b>, being arranged in order (L<b>3</b>&#x3e;L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>1</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> If radio wave having a wavelength of &#x3bb; is radiated from the Yagi antenna device <b>10</b>, the length L<b>2</b> of the excited antenna element (monopole element) <b>2</b> is a quarter wavelength long. The parasitic antenna element <b>1</b> is away from the excited antenna element <b>2</b> by an optional distance D<b>1</b>. Similarly, the parasitic antenna element <b>3</b> is away from the excited antenna element <b>2</b> by an optional distance. The excited antenna element <b>2</b> is connected to a signal source <b>8</b> via a wired line extending from the excitation antenna element <b>2</b> to an end of the signal source <b>8</b> though the opening <b>6</b>. The signal source <b>8</b> transmits a signal to the excited antenna element <b>2</b> through the wired line. The other end of the signal source <b>8</b> is grounded. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Thus, the Yagi antenna device radiates radio wave toward a direction like an arrow (directed from left side to right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Japanese Publication, &#x201c;Transactions of Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers&#x201d; by MARUYAMA, UEHARA and KAGOSHIMA, Vol. J80-B No. 5, in 1997 discloses a multi directional Yagi antenna device. This multi directional Yagi antenna device has some Yagi antenna devices each similar to the Yagi antenna device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which are directed toward some directions on a circumference of the base disk, so that the multi directional Yagi antenna device can get multiple directivities. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> A phased array antenna and an adaptive array antenna are derived from the sector antenna. These array antennas reinforce the effective radiation pattern of the array antenna in a desired direction and suppress it in undesired directions, which is so-called as &#x201c;beamforming&#x201d;. These antennas can vary its directivity according to any receiving conditions of radio waves. Varying the directivity enables any communication performance to be increased. The communication performance is increased based on not only large gain of radio wave but also prevention of undesired radio wave from being received and transmitted. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-24431 discloses the array antenna device relative to such the beamforming technology. This array antenna device constitutes electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an antenna device <b>80</b> with the beamforming functions. The antenna device <b>80</b> has a base disk <b>75</b>, an excited antenna element <b>82</b>, and parasitic antenna elements <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, which are respectively arranged on both sides of the excited antenna element <b>82</b> at a suitable distance D<b>2</b> from the excited antenna element <b>82</b>. Items of variable reactance <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> are respectively connected to the parasitic antenna elements <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. If items of variable reactance <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> are inductive, they act as extension coils, so that electrical length of each of the parasitic antenna elements <b>81</b>, <b>83</b> can be extended to act as the reflectors. If items of variable reactance <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> are capacitive, they act as shortened capacitor, so that electrical length of each of the parasitic antenna elements <b>81</b>, <b>83</b> can be shortened to act as the waveguides. Thus, the antenna device <b>80</b> can radiate radio wave toward a desired direction by controlling the variable reactance <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> of the parasitic antenna elements <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In the above Yagi antenna device <b>10</b>, if taking into consideration any performance on one-to-one communication by the wireless communication apparatuses, it is possible to improve any performance of throughput by using the directional antenna disclosed in the above English Publication, &#x201c;Small Beam-Switched Antenna with RF Switch for Wireless LAN&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In a wireless local area network (wireless LAN), user's wireless communication apparatus generally communicates with plural access points ordinarily under the circumstances of home, office or the like. The user's wireless communication apparatus and the plural access points constitute a network. On the network, frequency bands and channels, which can be used by the plural wireless communication apparatuses, are fixed and finite according to their capacities. If any control is performed on them, any collisions and/or interferences of the radio waves occur between the plural wireless communication apparatuses, thereby causing only the incomplete communication to be implemented. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In a standard 802.11 on the wireless LAN, an access control function is installed in order to avoid the collisions and/or interferences of the radio waves. This standard is called as &#x201c;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)&#x201d;. According to the standard CSMA/CA, when a user wants to communicate with any destination, it is first sensed whether any other than the wireless communication apparatus that communicates does not communicate. The wireless communication apparatus can communicate only if it does not interfere with this other wireless communication apparatus (see Japanese Publication, &#x201c;Realization of high-speed communication and its stabilization, the newest antenna technology, MIMO, WIRELSS PLUS&#x201d;, by Eiji TAKAGI, Web Magazine, in 2004). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Under the wireless LAN environment in which plural wireless communication apparatuses are present, however, it may be difficult to communicate with any destination after having sensed a carrier when using a directional antenna. In this case, the directional antenna reinforces the reception of radio wave from a desired direction and suppresses the reception of radio wave from another direction. Thus, irrespective of a case where any other than the wireless communication apparatus that wants to communicate any destination communicates, this wireless communication apparatus can transmit a radio wave with it failing to sense a carrier, so that it may interfere with the other wireless communication apparatus that communicates. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> In the wireless LAN, it is desirable to use an omnidirectional antenna that can receive radio waves from every direction theoretically, not using a directional antenna. It is conceivable that, in the wireless LAN, an omnidirectional antenna can be used when sensing a carrier as well as a directional antenna can be used when carrying out any communication. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> In order to cope well with this, two antennas of directional one and omnidirectional one are installed in the wireless communication apparatus and it is necessary to switch them or to arrange many parasitic antenna elements on a circumference of a base disk and to adjust load elements to radiate radio waves toward every direction. This causes an antenna device and a wireless communication apparatus to be made large-scaled and/or to be made expensive. Thus, there is a need for providing an antenna device, a wireless communication apparatus, a control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus, a computer program product therefor, and a computer-readable storage medium therefor that are possible to adjust directivity, radiated polarization and radiation direction of an antenna to desired ones without making an antenna device and a wireless communication apparatus large-scaled and/or expensive. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> According to an embodiment of the invention, there is provided an antenna device. The antenna device has semi-conductive antenna bodies each having a predetermined length, which are positioned on a dielectric substrate, and control electrodes that are respectively connected with the antenna bodies. Direct-current biased voltage that is applied across each of the control electrodes is controlled to switch each of the antenna bodies between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In this embodiment of the antenna device, the semi-conductive antenna bodies each having a predetermined length are positioned on the dielectric substrate. The control electrodes are respectively connected with the antenna bodies across each of which the direct-current biased voltage is applied. This direct-current biased voltage is controlled to switch each of the antenna bodies between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> For example, the antenna device has two line antenna bodies having different lengths, which are positioned on both sides of a dielectric substrate, and a conductive antenna body that is arranged on a middle of the dielectric substrate with it being away from each of the line antenna bodies by a predetermined distance. The conductive antenna body is fed. Forward biased voltage is applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive line antenna bodies or reverse biased voltage is applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive line antenna bodies. In this moment, forward biased voltage is applied across each of the control electrodes so that the ion can be moved from the dielectric substrate to the line antenna bodies, thereby making the line antenna bodies conductive. Reverse biased voltage is applied across each of the control electrodes so that the ion can be moved from each of the line antenna bodies to the dielectric substrate, thereby making the line antenna bodies insulated. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Thus, plural antenna bodies that have been made conductive are combined to configure a directional antenna device including a waveguide, a reflector, and the like. When the conductive antenna body remains as a feeder and the waveguide and the reflector are made insulated in the directional antenna, this enables omnidirectional antenna device to be implemented. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Thus, it is possible to adjust directivity/omnidirectivity, radiated polarization and radiation direction of the antenna device to desired ones without making the antenna device large-scaled and/or expensive. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> According to another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a wireless communication apparatus. The wireless communication apparatus has an antenna device, a reception-and-transmission circuit that transmits and receives a signal according to a predetermined communication system, which are connected to the antenna device, and a communication control unit that controls the antenna device based on a signal received from the reception-and-transmission circuit. The antenna device includes semi-conductive antenna bodies each having a predetermined length, which are positioned on a dielectric substrate, and control electrodes that are respectively connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies. The communication control unit controls the direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes to switch each of the semi-conductive antenna bodies between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> To this embodiment of the wireless communication apparatus according to the invention, the embodiment of the above antenna device according to the invention is applied. Further, the communication control unit that controls the antenna device is also provided. Controlling the direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies that are positioned on the dielectric substrate allows each of the semi-conductive antenna bodies to be switched between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> This enables a directional antenna including a waveguide and a reflector to be configured by combining plural semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive states. When the conductive antenna body remains as a feeder and the waveguide and the reflector are made insulated in the directional antenna, this enables omnidirectional antenna device to be implemented. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> For example, setting the direct-current biased voltage applied across the control electrode connected with a predetermined semi-conductive antenna body in the antenna device according to carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) due to IEEE802.11a wireless LAN standard allows a carrier sense to be performed by using the omnidirectional antenna formed of the semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive state or their insulated state. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Further, setting the direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies in the antenna device allows a directional antenna to be formed by combining a waveguide and a reflector which are formed of the semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive state or their insulated state. This enables any feedback setting on the direct-current biased voltage applied across the control electrodes to be implemented by guiding any wireless communication condition to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Thus, in the embodiment of the wireless communication apparatus according to the invention, it is possible to adjust directivity/omnidirectivity, radiated polarization, and radiation direction of the antenna device to desired ones without making the wireless communication apparatus large-scaled and/or expensive, thereby enabling to be implemented any wireless communication according to CSMA/CA. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> According to further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a control method of controlling a wireless communication apparatus that has an antenna device. The antenna device includes semi-conductive antenna bodies each having a predetermined length, said antenna bodies being positioned on a dielectric substrate, and control electrodes that are respectively connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies. Direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes is controlled to switch each of the semi-conductive antenna bodies between their insulation state and their conductive state. The control method has the steps of setting the direct-current biased voltage to be applied across each of the control electrodes; and performing a carrier sense by using an omnidirectional antenna that has been formed by the set direct-current biased voltage that is applied across each of the control electrodes. The control method also has the steps of setting feedback on the direct-current biased voltage that is applied across each of the control electrodes by guiding the carrier sense and a wireless communication condition to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node; and adaptively switching directivity, radiated polarization, and radiation direction of the antenna formed by the feedback direct-current biased voltage that is applied across each of the control electrodes. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> To this embodiment of the control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus according to the invention, the embodiment of the above antenna device according to the invention is applied. Further, the communication control unit that controls the antenna device is also provided. Controlling the direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies that are positioned on the dielectric substrate allows each of the semi-conductive antenna bodies to be switched between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> This enables a directional antenna including a waveguide and a reflector to be configured by combining plural semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive states. When the conductive antenna body remains as a feeder and the waveguide and the reflector are made insulated in the directional antenna, this enables omnidirectional antenna device to be implemented. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> For example, in any wireless communication system according to CSMA/CA due to IEEE802.11 wireless LAN standard, setting the direct-current biased voltage to be applied across the control electrode connected with a predetermined semi-conductive antenna body in the antenna device allows a carrier sense to be performed by using the omnidirectional antenna that has been formed by the semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive states or their insulated states. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Further, setting the direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes connected with the semi-conductive antenna bodies in the antenna device allows a directional antenna to be formed by combining a waveguide and a reflector which are formed of the semi-conductive antenna bodies that have been switched to their conductive states or their insulated states. This enables any feedback setting on the direct-current biased voltage applied across the control electrodes to be implemented by guiding any wireless communication condition to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Thus, by the embodiment of the control method according to the invention, it is possible to adjust directivity/omnidirectivity, radiated polarization and radiation direction of the antenna device to desired ones without making the wireless communication apparatus large-scaled and/or expensive, thereby enabling optimal condition of any transmission performance to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node to be maintained. This allows any wireless communication according to CSMA/CA or the like to be performed. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> According to additional embodiments of the invention, there are provided a program product allowing a computer to carry out the above control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus and the computer-readable storage medium that stores the above control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In these embodiments of the program product and the computer-readable storage medium according to the invention, a computer including a microcomputer, CPU, and a signal-processing LSI can perform any processes running the program product and using the storage medium. Thus, it is possible to adjust directivity/omnidirectivity, radiated polarization and radiation direction of the antenna device to desired ones with good reproducibility without making the antenna device large-scaled and/or expensive, thereby enabling optimal condition of any transmission performance to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node to be maintained. This allows any wireless communication according to CSMA/CA or the like to be performed. </p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a configuration of a Yagi antenna device <b>100</b> of monopole type according to a first embodiment of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The Yagi antenna device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has a base disk <b>71</b> as a base plate for grounding, and a dielectric substrate <b>19</b> having antenna bodies. The base disk <b>71</b> is constituted of a printed board having a diameter D<b>100</b>. The base disk <b>71</b> has at predetermined positions three openings <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>c </i>through which control wires are passed. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> The dielectric substrate <b>19</b> is positioned on the base disk <b>71</b> with them being intersected with each other. The dielectric substrate <b>19</b> has, for example, a height of H<b>100</b> and a length of L<b>100</b>. The dielectric substrate <b>19</b> is made of solid electrolyte material selected from silicon gel, acrylonitrile gel, polysaccharide polymer and the like, which are used for a lithium ion battery or the like. The solid electrolyte material is subject to anion movement. The antenna bodies include a parasitic antenna element <b>11</b> for a waveguide, which has a predetermined length L<b>1</b><i>a</i>, an excited antenna element <b>12</b> for a feeder, which has a length L<b>2</b><i>a</i>, and a parasitic antenna element <b>13</b> for a reflector, which has a length L<b>3</b><i>a</i>. These antenna elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are arranged and patterned on the dielectric substrate <b>19</b> in order. Each of the antenna elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> has a length corresponding to a wavelength of a frequency within any one of a millimeter wave band, a micrometer wave band, and an ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. They have a relationship on their lengths indicated by L<b>1</b><i>a</i>&#x3c;L<b>2</b><i>a</i>&#x3c;L<b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> For example, if radio wave having a wavelength of &#x3bb; is radiated from the Yagi antenna device <b>100</b>, the length L<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the excited antenna element (monopole element) <b>12</b> is a quarter wavelength long. The excited antenna element <b>12</b> is made of metallic material such as copper, bronze, and gold. Such the metallic material is patterned by any of their foils. The parasitic antenna element <b>11</b> is away from the excited antenna element <b>12</b> by a distance D<b>1</b><i>a</i>, for example, a quarter wavelength long. Similarly, the parasitic antenna element <b>13</b> is away from the excited antenna element <b>12</b> by a distance D<b>2</b><i>a</i>, for example, a quarter wavelength long. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> The parasitic antenna elements are respectively made of semi-conductive plastic material. Such the semi-conductive plastic material is made so that any species of ion is doped into an insulating resin in order to obtain same conductivity as metal.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> In this embodiment, if direct-current biased voltage that has a desired direction is applied across a layer of the semi-conductive plastic material and a layer of the solid electrolyte material, ion can be moved according to the direction of the applied voltage. Thus, the semi-conductive plastic material is made conductive or insulated. This embodiment of the invention utilizes such this behavior of the semi-conductive plastic material. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> The parasitic antenna element <b>11</b> is provided with a control electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>at its one end, which meets a side of the dielectric substrate <b>19</b>.

The direct-current biased voltage applied across each of the control electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>is controlled to switch each of the semi-conductive antenna elements <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> between their insulation state and their conductive state. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> The excited antenna element <b>12</b> is connected to a signal source <b>8</b> via a wired line extending from the excitation antenna element <b>12</b> to an end of the signal source <b>8</b> though the opening <b>6</b><i>b</i>.

The dielectric substrate <b>19</b> is arranged on the base disk <b>71</b> across the opening <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the like.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> The antenna bodies such as the parasitic antenna element <b>11</b> are formed on the dielectric substrate <b>19</b> by patterning the semi-conductive plastic material thereto.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> The control electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>is arranged on a lower end of the parasitic antenna element <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Although the Yagi antenna device <b>100</b> has been described to have the two layer structure, the invention is not limited thereto.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156"> The antenna device <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> has a base plate <b>74</b> that is patterned by the semi-conductive plastic material as the antenna pattern. The base plate <b>74</b> has a rectangular shape which covers a whole dielectric substrate <b>49</b>. For example, the base plate <b>74</b> has an excited antenna slot <b>36</b><i>a </i>for exposing an excited antenna element <b>42</b> at a middle position thereof and parasitic antenna slots <b>36</b><i>b</i>, <b>36</b><i>c </i>for exposing parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> at both sides thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"> Behind the base plate <b>74</b>, a dielectric substrate <b>49</b> is positioned. The dielectric substrate <b>49</b> has, for example, a height of H<b>400</b> and a length of L<b>400</b>. Similar to the first, second, and third embodiments of the invention, the dielectric substrate <b>49</b> is made of solid electrolyte material selected from silicon gel, acrylonitrile gel, polysaccharide polymer and the like, which are used for a lithium ion battery or the like. The solid electrolyte material is subject to anion movement. </p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"> On the dielectric substrate <b>49</b>, antenna bodies having different lengths are provided in addition to the base plate <b>74</b>. The antenna bodies include the parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> each having a predetermined length L<b>1</b><i>d</i>, the excited antenna element <b>42</b> for a feeder which has a length L<b>2</b><i>d</i>, and length-adjustment elements <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>each having a length L<b>4</b><i>d</i>. These antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and the length-adjustment elements <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>are arranged and patterned on the dielectric substrate <b>49</b> at the predetermined positions thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"> For example, the excited antenna element <b>42</b> is positioned in the excited antenna slot <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The excited antenna element <b>42</b> has a length corresponding to a wavelength of a frequency within any one of a millimeter wave band, a micrometer wave band, and an ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. The parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> and the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>are positioned in the parasitic antenna slot <b>36</b><i>b </i>in order on a longitudinal direction thereof. Because the parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> has the length L<b>1</b><i>d </i>and the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>has the length L<b>4</b><i>d</i>, the parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> and the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>act as a reflector having a length L<b>3</b><i>d</i>=L<b>1</b><i>d</i>+L<b>4</b><i>d </i>when the parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> and the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>are made conductive. The parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> acts as a waveguide having a length L<b>1</b><i>d </i>when the parasitic antenna element <b>41</b> is made conductive but the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>is made insulated. </p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"> The parasitic antenna element <b>43</b> and the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>b </i>are positioned in the parasitic antenna slot <b>36</b><i>c </i>in order on a longitudinal direction thereof.

The parasitic antenna element <b>43</b> acts as a waveguide having a length L<b>1</b><i>d </i>when the parasitic antenna element <b>43</b> is made conductive but the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>b </i>is made insulated. </p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"> The antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and the like have a relationship on their lengths indicated by L<b>1</b><i>d</i>&#x3c;L<b>2</b><i>d</i>&#x3c;L<b>3</b><i>d</i>. For example, if radio wave having a wavelength of &#x3bb; is radiated from the antenna device <b>400</b>, the length L<b>2</b><i>d </i>of the excited antenna element <b>42</b> is a half wavelength long. </p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"> The parasitic antenna slot <b>36</b><i>b </i>is away from the excited antenna slot <b>36</b><i>a </i>by a distance D<b>1</b><i>d</i>, for example, a quarter wavelength long.

As the semi-conductive plastic material, polyacetylene, polythiophene, polyaniline, polypyrrol, polyazulene and the like are used, which have been described in the first embodiment. The parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b>, the excited antenna element <b>42</b>, the length-adjustment elements <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, and the base plate <b>74</b>, which are divided in six, are respectively switched between their conductive state and their insulation state, thereby controlling directivity/omnidirectivity and polarization of radiation by the antenna device <b>400</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"> In this embodiment, if direct-current biased voltage that has a desired direction is applied across a layer of the semi-conductive plastic material and a layer of the solid electrolyte material, ion can be moved according to a direction of the applied voltage. This enables the semi-conductive plastic material to be made conductive or insulated. This embodiment of the invention utilizes such the behavior of the semi-conductive plastic material to switch the antenna functions by the line parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> and the parasitic antenna slots <b>36</b><i>b</i>, <b>36</b><i>c. </i></p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0210"> The following will describe a control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus according to the fifth embodiment of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart for showing the control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus <b>500</b> to which the antenna device <b>400</b> is applied. </p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212"> In this embodiment, it is estimated that a multi functional diversity is adopted in this embodiment; after performing a carrier sense and confirming that any other wireless communication apparatus than the transmitting wireless communication apparatus does not stay within a network, the transmitting wireless communication apparatus can communicate with a destined node; and combinations I of the switches are changed so that a communication performance between them can become optimum. In this embodiment, a setting where its transmission rate is maximum is found out with the combinations I of on/off of the six switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> changing for N (N=1 to N) species of combinations. The transmitting wireless communication apparatus then can receive and/or transmit a signal from/to the destined node. </p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"> Thus, suppose that such the operation setting is given, at step A<b>1</b> of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the combination I of on/off of the six switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> is set as I=1. In this moment, the control device <b>55</b> controls the antenna device <b>400</b> via the bias circuits <b>47</b><i>a </i>through <b>47</b><i>f </i>and the switch circuit <b>48</b>. For example, the control device <b>55</b> transmits the switch selection signal Si to the switch <b>51</b> to switch between the reception and the transmission of the antenna device <b>400</b>. Further, the control device <b>55</b> transmits to the switch circuit <b>48</b> switch selection data D<b>41</b> for setting the combination I of the switches as I=1. </p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"> The process then goes to step A<b>2</b> where a carrier sense is performed by using the antenna device <b>400</b>, which indicates an antenna of slot type, omnidirectivity, and a horizontal polarization, formed of the combination <b>1</b> of the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b>. For example, only the switch SW<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> switches off and the switches SW<b>2</b> through SW<b>6</b> respectively switch on. In this moment, the parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b>, the length-adjustment elements <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, and the base plate <b>74</b> are made conductive but the excited antenna element <b>42</b> is made insulated. This equals to form a slot in the base plate <b>74</b> so that the excited antenna slot <b>36</b><i>a </i>can act as the excited antenna element. In other words, this forms a slot antenna. This antenna has an omnidirectivity and a horizontal polarization. Using such the omnidirectional antenna enables a carrier sense to be performed. By this carrier sense, it is possible to confirm that a node to which a user wants to transmit a frame is communicating at the present time. Further, it is possible to confirm that any other wireless communication apparatus than the user does not stay within a network. </p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215"> At step A<b>3</b>, it is determined whether the communication should be performed. If no communication should be performed, namely, in a case where the destined node is communicating, the process goes to step A<b>4</b> where the user waits for collision avoidance until the destined node finishes communicating. If the destined node finishes communicating, any nodes that want to transmit a frame start to transmit the frame. In this moment, every node has a transmission right equally (multiple access). If the communication should be performed at the step A<b>3</b>, the process goes to step A<b>5</b> where transmission rate of the data received by the antenna device <b>400</b> that has been formed by the combination <b>1</b> of the switches is measured. For example, RSSI of the reception circuit <b>52</b><i>a </i>is measured. </p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216"> The process then goes to step A<b>6</b> where it is determined (detected) whether or not the transmission rate is maximum. If it is determined (detected) that the transmission rate is maximum, the process goes to step A<b>7</b> where setting on the combination of switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> is stored. The process then goes back to the step A<b>6</b> where it is determined (detected) whether the transmission rate is maximum. If the transmission rate is not maximum at the step A<b>6</b>, the process goes to step A<b>8</b> where the combination number of the on/off of the six switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> is incremented by one (I=I+1) and the process goes to step A<b>9</b>. At the step A<b>9</b>, it is determined whether N (six in this embodiment) species of combinations of the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> have been completed. If N species of combinations have not yet been completed, namely, I&#x3c;N, the process goes back to the step A<b>5</b> where transmission rate of the data received by the antenna device <b>400</b> that has been formed by the combination <b>2</b> of the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> is measured. </p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217"> When setting the combination <b>2</b> of the switches, the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>3</b> and SW<b>6</b> switch off and the switches SW<b>4</b>, SW<b>5</b> switches on. In this moment, the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the base plate <b>74</b> are made conductive but the parasitic antenna elements <b>41</b>, <b>43</b>, the length-adjustment element <b>44</b><i>b</i>, and the excited antenna element <b>42</b> are respectively made insulated. This equals to form a slot for a waveguide, an excited antenna slot, and a slot for reflector in the base plate <b>74</b>. In other words, this forms a Yagi antenna of slot type. This antenna has directivity, a horizontal polarization and a radiation direction <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Using this directional antenna allows direct-current biased voltage that is applied across the control electrodes <b>45</b><i>b</i>, <b>45</b><i>c </i>to be fed back and set based on any wireless communication conditions to a wireless communication apparatus of a destined node. </p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218"> Then, the process such as determination, storage, and increment, in steps A<b>6</b> through A<b>8</b> are repeated. </p>

<p id="p-0224" num="0223"> If at the step A<b>9</b>, N species of combinations of the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b> have been completed (I=N (six in this embodiment)), the process goes to step A<b>10</b> where the setting is fixed. This enables any communication to be implemented under the setting of the combinations of the switches SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>6</b>, optimal qualities of which have been detected. Using the polarization used in this case allows to be implemented any wireless communication process by a multi functional diversity system that is preferably suitable for user's environment. </p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224"> Thus, to the wireless communication apparatus and the control method of controlling the wireless communication apparatus according to the fifth embodiment of the invention, the antenna device <b>400</b> according to the embodiment of the invention is applied.

<p id="p-0226" num="0225"> If the switch circuit <b>48</b> sets the combination I of the switches as I=2, the antenna device <b>400</b> forms a Yagi antenna of slot type and has a directivity, a horizontal polarization and a radiation direction <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.
