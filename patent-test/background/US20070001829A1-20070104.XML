<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> (a) Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention is related to a motorcar burglarproof system mounted to the steering wheel, and more particularly, to one performs physical ID of the driver, locks up the steering wheel, sounds the alarm, and retrieves the image of the burglar in providing an active burglar proof function. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> (b) Description of the Prior Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Generally, the door lock for a motorcar is the basic equipment to prevent burglar form entering into the motorcar. The shame is that practically all the door locks no matter how advanced and sophisticated, installed by the genuine motor makers can be easily opened up by the burglar; and even they do stop the burglar, the burglar could break up the window and get into the car. This fact alone warrants the installation of a secondary burglarproof system. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> To keep the motorcar on the road, it takes the running engine and the steering wheel to control the motorcar driving in the correct direction. Therefore, many burglarproof systems generally available in the market are essentially designed to lock up the steering wheel while the motorcar is parked. However, all these systems are limited to a mechanical locking system to restrict the turning of the steering wheel; once the mechanical structure to restrict the steering wheel is tempered, the motorcar could still be easily stolen. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a motorcar burglarproof system essentially comprised of a frame adapted with a locking member to restrict the steering wheel, an image retrieve device, and a control circuit linked to the alarm mounted to the motorcar and integrated with power supply loop, IC chip, image recording unit, digital image process loop, locking member drive loop and alarm drive loop. The IC chip records the physical features of the genuine driver with the data to be compared with that of the image taken by the image retrieve device. If the comparison results fit, the locking member is released from the steering wheel; if not, the steering wheel remains locked, the image taken is filed, and the alarm is activated for the parties concerned to take action. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The control circuit may be further integrated with a radio communication module to transmit the image taken by the image retrieve device to the cellular phone of the owner of the motor car and/or to the main frame at a security company to read the image of the burglar and the status of the tempered door of the motorcar for taking the proper response at the first time.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>(A), a preferred embodiment of the present invention is essentially comprised of a frame <b>10</b> adapted with a locking member <b>20</b> to restrict a steering wheel <b>70</b>, an image retrieve device <b>30</b> (in the form of CCD, CMOS photo-sense device, digital image retrieve device or analog image retrieve device), a control circuit <b>41</b> built in the frame <b>10</b> integrated with a power supply loop <b>41</b>, a microprocessor <b>42</b>, an IC chip <b>43</b>, an image recording unit <b>44</b>, a digital image process loop <b>45</b>, a locking member drive loop <b>46</b>, an alarm drive loop <b>47</b>, and a radio communication module <b>48</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> is further connected to an alarm (not illustrated) mounted to the motorcar. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Two motors <b>50</b> subject to the control by the locking member drive loop <b>46</b> and also integrated with the control circuit <b>40</b> are respectively provided on both sides of the frame <b>10</b>. The locking member <b>20</b> is related to a clamping device with its angle changeable by being subject to the revolution of the motor <b>50</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In use, the frame <b>10</b> is fixed to an instrument panel <b>60</b> at where close to a steering wheel <b>70</b>. Before the burglarproof system is activated, the locking member <b>50</b> is located with an angle not yet locking up the steering wheel <b>70</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Once the burglarproof system is activated after the owner leaves his motorcar and if the door is opened, the system operates as illustrated in the block chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>(A). The image retrieve device <b>30</b> is immediately activated to take the image in the direction of the driver's seat. The image taken is then compared to that of the physical features of the genuine driver recorded in the IC chip <b>43</b>. If the comparison results fit, the motor is activated to release the locking member <b>20</b> from the steering wheel <b>70</b> for the motorcar to enter into the normal stand-by status. On the contrary, if the comparison results do not fit, the steering wheel <b>70</b> remains to be restricted by the locking member <b>20</b> while the image of the person sitting in the driver's seat is recorded and saved in the image recording unit <b>44</b> comprised of flash memory, burner and hard disk. Meanwhile, the alarm is activated to notify parties concerned for taking responses in time. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> An adapter <b>11</b> is provided to the frame <b>10</b> to be plugged in by another IC chip <b>43</b>&#x2032;. The electric circuit of the adapter <b>11</b> is linked to the control circuit <b>40</b> so to integrate the IC chip <b>43</b> and the built-in IC chip <b>43</b> with the control circuit <b>40</b>. The IC ship <b>43</b>&#x2032; maintains the data of physical features e.g., pattern of fingerprint, or pupil of the genuine driver or the motorcar owner. Accordingly, once the system is activated, the motor <b>50</b> drives the lock member <b>20</b> to an angle to restrict the steering wheel <b>70</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The control circuit <b>40</b> and the door opening mechanism are linked to each other so that when the door is opened, the control circuit functions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>(B). Wherein, the user plugs the IC chip <b>43</b>&#x2032; into the adapter <b>11</b> to activate the image retriever device <b>30</b> to retrieve the image recorded in the direction of the driver's seat and have the image to compare with that of the genuine driver recoded in the built-in IC chip <b>43</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> If the results of comparison fit, the motor <b>50</b> is activated to release the locking member <b>20</b> from the steering wheel <b>70</b> for the driver to use his motorcar. On the contrary, when the comparison results do not fit, the locking member <b>20</b> maintains its status of restricting the steering wheel <b>70</b> and the image of the unauthorized driver is immediately recorded and saved in the image recording unit <b>44</b> comprised of flash memory, burner, and hard disk while the alarm is activated to notify parties concerned for taking responses in time. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Furthermore, the image taken of the burglar by the image retrieve device <b>30</b> is transmitted to the cellular phone of the car owner and/or the main frame of the security company through radio communication for the car owner or the security company to have access to the image of the burglar and the status of the door of the motorcar for coming up with proper response. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The present invention may be further incorporated with the audio prompt function to alert the driver to insert the IC chip and approach to the image retrieve device in sequence. The audio prompt function operates on independent power source supplied by a rechargeable battery to prevent from being disabled due to the circuit of the motorcar is damaged. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The prevent invention provides an improved mechanism of motorcar burglarproof system, and the application for a utility patent is duly filed accordingly. However, it is to be noted that that the preferred embodiments disclosed in the specification and the accompanying drawings are not limiting the present invention; and that any construction, installation, or characteristics that is same or similar to that of the present invention should fall within the scope of the purposes and claims of the present invention. </p>
