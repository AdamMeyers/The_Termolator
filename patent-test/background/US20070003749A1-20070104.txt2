CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) 
 This application claims priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 60/696,470, filed Jul. 1, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.


FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates generally to porous reticulated composite materials and methods for the production thereof. The present invention further relates to processes for the production of porous composite materials which may include the steps of providing a mixture capable of flowing which can have at least one inorganic and/or organic reticulating agent and at least one matrix material that may be a polymer or a polymer mixture, and solidifying the liquid mixture. 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 Porous materials can be important in different application fields in industry for use as membranes for filtration and separation of fluid mixtures, sensors, electrodes, electrical capacitors, dielectric materials in microelectronics, catalytic surfaces, in biomedicine technology for use as implantable materials or drug carriers, etc. 
 Composite materials can also be important in mechanical or structural applications, e.g., in aeronautical or automotive engineering, medical engineering, membrane technology and other fields of application. The use of composite materials can provide a combination of components having different physico-chemical properties, resulting in a composite material which may have new or improved properties. Composite materials may exhibit a similar or superior stability, biocompatibility and/or strength at less overall weight when compared to non-composite materials. 
 Composite materials may allow for adjustment of individual material properties such as, e.g., thermal or electrical isolation, thermal coefficient of expansion, corrosive properties, absorption properties, conductivity of thermal and/or electrical energy, conduction of acoustic noise, thermal and/or chemical resistance, etc. For example, such properties may be varied by suitably selecting the components used to make the composite material. Porous composite materials may be used increasingly in coating applications, e.g., to functionalize materials with specific physical, electrical, magnetic or optical properties. Consequently, they can also be important in photovoltaic, sensor, catalytic or electrochromatic display technologies. 
 Porous composite materials may be prepared using conventional sintering methods. For example, powders that may include fibers, dendritic or spherically-formed precursor particles can be pressed into molds or extruded and then subjected to a sinter process. In such materials, the rigidity of the material, the pore size and/or the surface area may depend on the packaging density as well as on the size, form and/or the composition of particles in the powders. 
 One potential disadvantage of conventional sintering methods may be that the adjustment of pore sizes can be difficult to control, and the mechanical properties may not be sufficiently tailored, for example, with respect to pore size, porosity or specific surface area. Parameters used in a sintering process may also have an influence on the strength, pore size and surface area of the porous materials. Pore sizes can be adjusted in additional processing steps, e.g. by deposition from the gas phase, electroplating or electroless plating, which may decrease the size of large pores by adding further material while providing a more homogeneous pore size distribution. These techniques, however, can reduce the available surface in porous materials. Other techniques that may be used can include of spray-coating of pre-sintered porous materials with a slurry, subsequent drying, and repeated sintering. These techniques may provide a pore diffusion of material from the slurry into the porous sintered structured, and to insufficient adhesion of the material deposited in the procedure, which can result from different thermal coefficients of expansion and shrinking of the deposited material. 
 International Patent Publication WO 04/054625 describes a technique in which a pre-sintered porous material is coated by powdered nanoparticle material and subsequently re-sintered. International Patent Publication WO 99/15292 describes a process in which porous fiber-containing composite structures may be obtained from a dispersion of fibers with the use of binders and subsequent gasification of the mixture prior to, during or after sintering. 
 A further potential disadvantage of the above-described methods may be that the sintering processes are conventionally performed at high temperatures, which can make it difficult or impossible to produce porous composites of polymers and inorganic and/or organic components if the sintering temperature is above the melting point of the polymer components. Another potential disadvantage of these methods may be that the material is processed in costly molding processes into a stable two- or three-dimensional structure, and only restricted forms may be obtainable due to the brittleness of the materials. 
 Conventional processing of porous materials can also require several post-treatment processing steps, and the sintering process may likely be applicable only to inorganic composites because of necessary process conditions. 
 Thus, there may be a need for providing porous composite materials having improved properties, and coating materials which have physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, that may be adapted to specific application requirements. Furthermore, there may be a need to functionalize porous composite materials, e.g., by a suitable combination of components, which may provide certain electrical, dielectric, magnetic and/or optical properties, for example, semiconducting, ionically conducting, magnetic or superconducting properties. 
 There may also be a need for providing porous composite materials which may be produced in a cost efficient manner, and a process for manufacture thereof, which can avoid high costs for energy consumption when applying high pressures and/or high temperatures. Furthermore, there may be a need to provide porous composite materials that can have improved homogeneity as compared with conventional powder sintered materials, including coatings made from such composite materials. 
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION 
 Therefore, it is one of the objects of the present invention to provide a porous composite material, which may be based on organic and/or inorganic particles in combination with suitable matrix materials and which has properties which may be easily modifiable. For example, the adjustment of the thermal coefficient of expansion, the electric, dielectric, conducting or semiconducting, magnetic and/or optical properties, or further physico-chemical properties, may be facilitated by exemplary embodiments of the present invention. 
 A further object of the present invention is to provide adjustable network-like structural properties in a material which may be self-organizing, and the material may be structured in two or three dimensions. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fine structuring in materials such as, e.g., adjustment of porosity, which may be achieved without deteriorating the chemical and/or physical stability of the material. 
 Another object of the present invention is the provision of, e.g., adjustable, preferably self organizing, network-like structural properties, e.g. allowing, on the basis of the same material, to produce any possible two- and three-dimensional structure as well as a fine structure, such as the individual adjustment of porosity, preferably substantially without deteriorating the chemical and/or physical stability of the material. 
 Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a material that may be used as a coating as well as a bulk material, where the material has specific physico-chemical properties. 
 Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a method for a production of porous reticulated composite materials from inexpensive starting materials which may have broadly variable properties, in a cost-efficient manner and using relatively few process steps. 
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing porous composite materials which can be made from porous composite materials, where the properties of the material, e.g., thermal coefficient of expansion, electric, dielectric, conductive or semi-conductive and magnetic or optical properties can be adjusted. 
 These and other objects of the invention can be achieved by exemplary embodiments of the present invention which may provide a process for the production of porous composite materials. For example, the composite material can be formed by a procedure, via which a liquid mixture that includes at least one reticulating agent and at least one matrix material that includes at least one organic polymer can be provided, and the mixture can be caused to be solidified. 
 In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the liquid mixture used in procedures as described herein may include at least one solvent and a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution, or alternatively the liquid mixture may be substantially free of solvents. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents included in the composite materials, as described above, may comprise inorganic materials such as, for example, metals, metal compounds, metal oxides, semiconductive metal compounds, and/or carbon species such as carbon fiber, graphite, soot, carbon black, fullerenes, or nanotubes. The reticulating materials may include particulate organic materials or fibers made of organic materials such as polymers, oligomers or pre-polymers, for example, a synthetic homopolymer or copolymer of an aliphatic or aromatic polyolefin, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, or a biopolymer. 
 In still a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the composite material may include one or more reticulating agents provided in the form of particles, such as nano- or micro-crystalline particles. The reticulating agents may comprise at least two particle size fractions of the same or different materials, where the fractions differ in size by a factor of at least 1.1, or at least 2. 
 In yet a further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents included in composite materials as described above may comprise at least one inorganic material in combination with at least one organic material, or a combination of at least one particulate material with at least one material having a form selected from tubes, fibers or wires. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the invention, the matrix materials included in the composite materials and devices produced therefrom, as described above, may include oligomers, polymers, copolymers or prepolymers, thermosets, thermoplastics, synthetic rubbers, extrudable polymers, injection molding polymers, or moldable polymers such as, for example, epoxy resins, phenoxy resins, alkyd resins, epoxy-polymers, poly(meth)acrylate, unsaturated polyesters, saturated polyesters, polyolefines, rubber lattices, polyamides, polycarbonates, polystyrene, polyphenol, polysilicone, polyacetale, cellulose, or cellulose derivatives. 
 In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the liquid mixture used in procedures as described above can include further additives such as, e.g., cross linkers, fillers, surfactants, acids, bases, pore-forming agents, plasticizers, lubricants, flame resistants, biologically active compounds, therapeutically active compounds, agents for diagnostic purpose, or markers, and the liquid mixture may have, e.g., a total solids content below about 20% by weight. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, reticulating agents included in the composite materials as described above may be capable of forming a network-like structure and/or self-orienting into a three dimensional structure. 
 In other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the relative amounts of the reticulating agent(s) and the matrix component(s) provided in a liquid mixture used in the exemplary procedures described herein may be selected to form a three-dimensional network in the solid phase upon removal of the solvent or during a change in viscosity of a solvent-free mixture during a solidification procedure. For example, a network may form as a result of a phase separation between the solvent phase and the solids phase that can occur during a solidification procedure. 
 In other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the composite material may be produced by a procedure which can include a solidification procedure. The solidification procedure may include a thermal treatment, drying, freeze-drying, application of a vacuum, e.g. evaporation of the solvent, or cross linking, wherein the cross linking may be induced chemically, thermally or by radiation. The solidification procedure may also include a phase separation in the liquid mixture comprising the reticulating agent and the matrix material into a solid phase and a liquid phase, or precipitation of solids from the liquid mixture, for example, before or during removal of the solvent, and/or by cross linking of the matrix material. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a phase separation or precipitation which can be used in processes as described above may be induced by an increase of the viscosity of the liquid mixture, which may be produced by, for example, cross linking, curing, drying, rapidly increasing the temperature, rapidly lowering the temperature, or rapidly removing the solvent. 
 According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the matrix material may not decompose substantially during the manufacture of the composite material so that, e.g., the reticulating agents may be embedded in the formed composite material. 
 According to still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a liquid mixture which may be used in processes for manufacturing a composite material as described herein may include at least one cross linker, which may be selected such that cross linking during processing of the liquid mixture before the solidification procedure does not produce a significant viscosity change in the system, and/or the cross linking reaction begins during solidification. 
 In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the reticulating agent can include soot, fullerenes, carbon fibers, silica, titanium dioxide, metal particles, tantalum particles, or polyethylene particles, and the matrix material can include epoxy resins or phenoxy resins. The liquid mixture may comprise an organic solvent, and the solidification procedure used can include removal of the solvent using a heat treatment procedure, which may provide a rapid removal of the solvent. Optionally, the resulting solvent-free material may be subsequently heat treated in an inert atmosphere at temperatures of up to about 300       C. without decomposing the matrix material. 
 In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the porous composite material resulting from the exemplary procedures described above may be impregnated, coated or infiltrated with therapeutically active agents, which can optionally be resolved or extracted from the material in the presence of physiologic fluids. 
 In a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention a porous reticulated composite material or a porous coating is provided, which can be produced using the exemplary processes described above. These materials may be used, for example, for the manufacture of a medical device for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes, which can optionally comprise a marker, or as a scaffold for tissue engineering in vivo or in vitro. A composite material that is used as a scaffold may be loaded with microorganisms, viral vectors, cells or living tissue. 
 In accordance with further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the degree of porosity and/or pore sizes of the composite materials may be selectively adjusted, for example by suitably selecting the amount and type of reticulating agents, their geometry and/or particle size, and/or by combining different particle sizes of the reticulating agent and the matrix material. 
 In still further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a fine structuring of the material with regard to the degree of porosity, the pore size and the morphology may be selectively influenced, e.g., by suitably selecting solidification conditions during manufacture. Additionally, composite materials may be produced by combining reticulating agents and a suitable matrix material. For example, the mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties thereof can be selectively adjusted, e.g., by the solids content of the reticulating agent and/or the matrix material in the liquid mixture, the type of solvent or solvent mixture, the ratio of reticulating agents to matrix material and/or by suitably selecting the materials according to their primary particle size and their structure and type. For example, by suitably selecting conditions in the liquid mixture, e.g., conditions upon solidifying the mixture, the reticulating particles may be oriented in the form of a solid network which can influence and/or determine the porosity and other properties of the resulting composite material. 
 In additional exemplary embodiments of the present invention, components and processing conditions used to form a composite material may be selected such that the solids in a liquid mixture may form a self-organizing network structure, e.g., a reticulated structure before and/or during a solidification procedure. Suitable reticulating agents, for example mixtures of reticulating agents of different sizes and/or mixtures of reticulating agent particles with tubes, fibers or wires, may tend to self-aggregate in the liquid mixture, and this aggregation may be enhanced, for example, by suitably selecting the matrix material, the solvent, if any, as well as certain additives. 
 These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS 
 In accordance with exemplary embodiment of the present invention process is provided, wherein a mixture capable of flowing can be prepared comprising at least one reticulating agent and at least one matrix material which may be a polymer or a combination of polymers that can be subsequently solidified. The mixture may include a liquid composition provided in the form of a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution, optionally comprising a solvent or solvent mixture. 
 In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mixture may be substantially free of any solvents and may utilize a liquid matrix material, which can be a material in a molten state, e.g., a melt of the matrix material. 
 The terms         liquid mixture         and         mixture capable of flowing         can refer to a mixture capable of flowing, which may contain or may exclude a solvent, and which can have melts, slurries or pasty materials having a high viscosity, or substantially dry flowable powder or particle mixtures. 
 A liquid mixture may be prepared using conventional techniques, e.g., by dissolving or dispersing one or more solid components in a solvent or a matrix material in any suitable order, by mixing solids in a dry state and optionally adding one or more solvents, by melting a matrix material and dispersing one or more reticulating agents therein, optionally before adding a solvent, or by preparing a paste or slurry and subsequently diluting it with a solvent or a dispersion of other components in a solvent. 
 In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the reticulating agent and the matrix material can be a synthetic material, e.g., a material which is not of natural origin. For example, extracellular matrix materials of biological origin may be excluded from the components of the composite material. The reticulated material can be a rigid, substantially non-elastic material. 
 The term         reticulating agent         can refer to a material that can be oriented into a network or network-like structure under certain conditions described herein for converting a liquid mixture into a porous solidified composite material. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, reticulating agents can include materials that are capable of self-orienting or promoting self-orientation into a network or network-like structure. A         network         or         network-like structure         can be understood to refer to a regular and/or irregular three-dimensional arrangement which may have void space or pores within it. The porous structure of a reticulated material as described herein may, e.g., permit or promote growth of biological tissue thereon and/or proliferation of the tissue into the material. The porous structure may also be used, for example, to store and/or release active agents, diagnostic markers and the like. 
 A reticulating agent may comprise organic and/or inorganic materials of any suitable form or size, or any mixtures thereof. For example, the reticulating agent(s) may include inorganic materials such as, for example, zero-valent metals, metal powders, metal compounds, metal alloys, metal oxides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, metal carbonitrides, metal oxycarbides, metal oxynitrides, metal oxycarbonitrides, organic or inorganic metal salts, including salts from alkaline and/or alkaline earth metals and/or transition metals, including alkaline or alkaline earth metal carbonates, -sulfates, -sulfites, semi conductive metal compounds, including those of transition metals and/or metals from the main group of the periodic system; metal based core-shell nanoparticles, glass or glass fibers, carbon or carbon fibers, silicon, silicon oxides, zeolites, titanium oxides, zirconium oxides, aluminum oxides, aluminum silicates, talcum, graphite, soot, flame soot, furnace soot, gaseous soot, carbon black, lamp black, minerals, phyllosilicates, or any mixtures thereof. 
 Reticulating agents may also be biodegradable metal-based compositions, for example, alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts or compounds such as magnesium-based or zinc-based compounds or the like, or nano-alloys or any mixture thereof. The reticulating agents used in certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention may include magnesium salts, oxides or alloys, which can be used in biodegradable coatings or molded bodies, and which can be provided in the form of an implant or a coating on an implant that may be capable of degradation when exposed to bodily fluids, and which may further result in formation of magnesium ions and hydroxylapatite. 
 Reticulating agents may also include, but are not limited to, powders, including nanomorphous nanoparticles, of zero-valent-metals, metal oxides or combinations thereof, e.g., metals and metal compounds which may be selected from the main group of metals in the periodic table, transition metals such as copper, gold and silver, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium or platinum, or rare earth metals. Metal-based compounds which may be used include, e.g., organometallic compounds, metal alkoxides, carbon particles such as, for example soot, lamp-black, flame soot, furnace soot, gaseous soot, carbon black, graphite, carbon fibers or diamond particles, and the like. Reticulating agents may also include metal-containing endohedral fullerenes and/or endometallofullerenes, including those comprising rare earth metals such as, e.g., cerium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese or mixtures thereof such as iron-platinum-mixtures or alloys. Magnetic super paramagnetic or ferromagnetic metal oxides may also be used including, e.g., iron oxides or ferrites, e.g. cobalt-, nickel- or manganese ferrites. Magnetic metals or alloys may be used to provide materials having magnetic, super-paramagnetic, ferromagnetic or signaling properties, such as ferrites, e.g. gamma-iron oxide, magnetite or ferrites of Co, Ni, or Mn. Examples of such materials are described in International Patent Publications WO83/03920, WO83/01738, WO88/00060, WO85/02772, WO89/03675, WO90/01295 and WO90/01899, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,773, 4,675,173 and 4,770,183. A reticulating agent can include any combination of materials listed herein. 
 Additionally, semiconducting compounds and/or nanoparticles may be used as a reticulating agent in further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, including semiconductors of groups II-VI, groups III-V, or group IV of the periodic system. Suitable group II-VI-semiconductors include, for example, MgS, MgSe, MgTe, CaS, CaSe, CaTe, SrS, SrSe, SrTe, BaS, BaSe, BaTe, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgS, HgSe, HgTe or mixtures thereof. Examples of group III-V semiconductors include, for example, GaAs, GaN, GaP, GaSb, InGaAs, InP, InN, InSb, InAs, AlAs, AlP, AlSb, AlS, or mixtures thereof. Examples of group IV semiconductors include germanium, lead and silicon. Also, combinations of any of the foregoing semiconductors may be used. 
 In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it may be preferable to use complex metal-based nanoparticles as the reticulating agents. These may include, for example, so-called core/shell configurations such as those described by Peng et al., Epitaxial Growth of Highly Luminescent CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Nanoparticles with Photostability and Electronic Accessibility, Journal of the American Chemical Society (1997, 119: 7019-7029). The core of semiconducting nanoparticles having a core-shell configuration may have a diameter of about 1 to 30 nm, or preferably about 1 to 15 nm, upon which further semiconducting nanoparticles may be crystallized to a depth of about 1 to 50 monolayers, or preferably about 1 to 15 monolayers. Cores and shells may be present in combinations of the materials listed above, including CdSe or CdTe cores, and CdS or ZnS shells. 
 In a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the reticulating agents may be selected based on their absorptive properties for radiation in a wavelength ranging anywhere from gamma radiation up to microwave radiation, or based on their ability to emit radiation, particularly in the wavelength region of about 60 nm or less. By suitable selection of a reticulating agent, materials having non-linear optical properties may be produced. These include, for example, materials that can block IR-radiation of specific wavelengths, which may be suitable for marking purposes or to form therapeutic radiation-absorbing implants. The reticulating agents, their particle sizes and the diameter of their core and shell may be selected to provide photon emitting compounds, such that the emission is in the range of about 20 nm to 1000 nm. Alternatively, a mixture of suitable compounds may be selected which is capable of emitting photons of differing wavelengths when exposed to radiation. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, fluorescent metal-based compounds may be selected that do not require quenching. 
 In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agent may include carbon species such as nanomorphous carbon species, for example, fullerenes such as C36, C60, C70, C76, C80, C86, C112, etc., or any mixtures thereof. Reticulating agents may also include multi-, double- or single-walled nanotubes, such as MWNT, DWNT or SWNT, randomly-oriented nanotubes, as well as so-called fullerene onions or metallo-fullerenes, or graphite, soot, carbon black and the like. 
 Additionally, the reticulating agents may include organic materials such as polymers, oligomers or pre-polymers; shellac, cotton, or fabrics; or any combinations thereof. 
 In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulafing agent may comprise a mixture of at least one inorganic material and at least one organic material. 
 Reticulating agents comprising one or more of the materials mentioned herein may be provided in the form of particles which may have an essentially spherical or sphere-like irregular shape, or fibers. They may also be provided in the form of nano- or microcrystalline particles, powders or nanowires. The reticulating agents may have an average particle size of about 1 nm to about 1,000        m, preferably about 1 nm to 300        m, or more preferably from about 1 nm to 6        m. 
 The reticulating agents may comprise at least two particles which may be formed of the same or different material, and which may have sizes that differ by a factor of greater than about 2, or greater than about 3, 5, or 10. Differences in particle sizes of reticulating agents may promote self-orientation of the agents when forming a network structure. 
 In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents may include a combination of carbon particles such as soot, carbon black or lamp black, with fullerenes or fullerene mixtures. The carbon particles may have an average size ranging from about 50 to 200 nm, or from about 90 to 120 nm. The reticulating agent may alternatively or additionally include a combination of metal oxide particles such as, for example, silica, alumina, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, or zeolites or combinations thereof, with fullerenes or fullerene mixtures. The metal oxide particles may have an average size ranging from about 5 to 150 nm, or from about 10 to 100 nm. In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agent may include a combination of one or more metal powders with metal oxide particles such as, e.g., silica, alumina, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, zeolites or combinations thereof. The metal oxide particles may have an average size ranging from about 5 to 150 nm, or from about 10 to 100 nm, and the metal powder may have an average particle size in the micrometer range, e.g. from about 0.5 to 10        m, or from about 1 to 5        m. Reticulating agents can be combined with a matrix material such as, e.g., epoxy resins, which may be thermally curable and/or cross linkable phenoxy resins. 
 Alternatively, or in addition, the reticulating agent can be provided in the form of tubes, fibers, fibrous materials or wires, including nanowires, which can comprise any of the materials mentioned above. Examples of such agents may include carbon fibers, annotates, glass fibers, metal nanowires or metal microwires. These reticulating agents can have an average length of about 5 nm to 1,000        m, or about 5 nm to 300        nm, or preferably about 5 nm to 10        nm, or about 2 to 20        m, and/or an average diameter between about 1 nm and 1        m, about 1 nm to 500 nm, preferably about 5 nm to 300 nm, or about 10 to 200 mm. 
 The particle sizes can be provided as a mean or average particle size, which may be determined by laser techniques such as a TOT-method (Time-Of-Transition), which may be determined, e.g., on a CIS Particle Analyzer of Ankersmid. Further suitable techniques for determining particle size can include powder diffraction techniques or TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) techniques. 
 In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, solvent-free mixtures may be used, wherein the matrix material may include, for example, a liquid prepolymer or a melt, e.g., a molten matrix material, which can be subsequently solidified by techniques such as cross linking or curing. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agent and the matrix material may exclude fibers or fibrous materials, and the resulting composite may be substantially free of fibers. 
 In further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents may be modified, e.g., to improve their dispersibility or wettability in solvents or in the matrix material, to generate additional functional properties or to increase compatibility between the agent and the matrix. Conventional techniques may be used to modify the particles or fibers, if necessary, depending on the requirements of the particular composition and the materials used. For example, silane compounds such as organosilanes may be used to modify the reticulating agents. Examples of suitable organosilanes and other modifying agents are described, for example, in International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2006/050622 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/346,983, filed Feb. 3, 2006, and these may be employed in exemplary embodiments of the present invention, as well as compositions described in such applications and herein as cross linkers. 
 In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents may be modified with alkoxides, metal alkoxides, colloidal particles and/or metal oxides and the like. The metal alkoxides may have the general formula M(OR)x where M is any metal from a metal alkoxide that may, e.g., hydrolyze and/or polymerize in the presence of water. R may be an alkyl radical comprising between 1 and about 30 carbon atoms, which may be straight, chained or branched, and x can have a value equivalent to the metal ion valence. Metal alkoxides such as Si(OR)4, Ti(OR)4, Al(OR)3, Zr(OR)3 and Sn(OR)4 may also be used. R may also be a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl radical.

 The matrix material may be provided in a liquid form, e.g., as a liquid prepolymer, a melt, polymer or a solution, dispersion, or emulsion, and it may be mixed with one or more reticulating agents in the absence or presence of a solvent, or it may be provided in a solid form. 
 In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the reticulating agents can be combined with the matrix material, optionally in the presence or absence of a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, to form a mixture capable of flowing, e.g., a solution, suspension, dispersion or emulsion, or a melt, slurry, paste or flowable particle mixture. The liquid mixture may be substantially uniform and/or substantially homogenous. However, uniformity or homogeneity of the liquid mixture may not be required or important to form such medical devices. 
 Suitable solvents may comprise water, sols or gels, or nonpolar or polar solvents such as, e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, butoxydiglycol, butoxyethanol, butoxyisopropanol, butoxypropanol, n-butyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, butylene glycol, butyl octanol, diethylene glycol, dimethoxydiglycol, dimethyl ether, dipropylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, ethoxyethanol, ethyl hexane diol, glycol, hexane diol, 1,2,6-hexane triol, hexyl alcohol, hexylene glycol, isobutoxy propanol, isopentyl diol, methylethyl ketone, ethoxypropylacetate, 3-methoxybutanol, methoxydiglycol, methoxyethanol, methoxyisopropanol, methoxymethylbutanol, methoxy PEG-10, methylal, methyl hexyl ether, methyl propane diol, neopentyl glycol, PEG4, PEG-6, PEG-7, PEG-8, PEG-9, PEG-6-methyl ether, pentylene glycol, PPG-7, PPG-2-buteth-3, PPG-2 butyl ether, PPG-3 butyl ether, PPG-2 methyl ether, PPG-3 methyl ether, PPG-2 propyl ether, propane diol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol butyl ether, propylene glycol propyl ether, tetrahydrofurane, trimethyl hexanol, phenol, benzene, toluene, or xylene, any of which may be mixed with dispersants, surfactants or other additives, or mixtures of the above-named substances. 
 Solvents that may be readily removable, e.g., easily volatized, may be used. These solvents may have a boiling point below 120       C., below 80       C., or optionally below 50       C. The solvent or solvent mixture can be used to facilitate effective dispersion of the solids, especially where uniform or homogenous liquid mixtures are preferred. 
 The solvent used in certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention may comprise solvent mixtures that may be suitable for dissolving or swelling the matrix material or at least a portion thereof if, e.g., the matrix material is a composite or mixture. Solvents that can substantially or completely dissolve the matrix material may be preferred in exemplary embodiments of the present invention. 
 In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the liquid mixture may be in the form of a colloidal solution, a solid solution, a dispersion, a suspension or an emulsion, which comprises at least one matrix material and at least one reticulating agent. The matrix material, the reticulating agent, the solvent and optional additives may be selected in order to provide, for example, an essentially stable and optionally homogeneous dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution. 
 The dynamic viscosity of the liquid mixture, e.g., a solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion comprising a solvent, a matrix material and a reticulated agent, can be at least about 10 to 99%, preferably about 20 to 90%, or between about 50 to 90% below the viscosity of the matrix material at the application temperature of the liquid mixture before solidifying, which may preferably be about 25       C. 
 If the mixture capable of flowing does not include a solvent, the temperature and/or composition of the liquid mixture or the matrix material can be selected such that the dynamic viscosity of the mixture capable of flowing, free of any solvent, may be at least about 10% to 99%, preferably about 20% to 90% or about 50% to 90% below the viscosity of the matrix material at the temperature. These percentage values can be understood to refer to the mixture before any significant cross linking occurs and/or before cross linkers are added. Viscosities may be measured by conventional methods, e.g., in a capillary viscometer or using a Brookfield apparatus. 
 The combination of reticulating agents, the solvent and the matrix material can be selected such that reticulating agents are wetted by the solvent, the matrix material and/or the liquid mixture. Optionally, the reticulating agents may be modified by using suitable additives or surface modifiers, such as those described herein above, to increase their wettability, or optionally to be essentially fully wetted. 
 The reticulating agent and the matrix material may be combined in a specific weight or volume ratio, e.g., to optimize the structure of the porous composite formed under the conditions used for solidifying the liquid mixture. The specific ratio used may depend on the molecular weight, the particle size and the specific surface area of the particles. The ratio used can be selected such that upon removal of the solvent during the solidification procedure or upon changing the viscosity of the matrix component, a phase separation into a solvent phase and a solid phase comprising the matrix material and the reticulating agent can be achieved. The viscosity change can be achieved, e.g., by changing the temperature to higher or lower values, or by the addition of cross linkers, particularly in solvent free systems. 
 This phase separation can facilitate the formation of a three-dimensional network of the solid phase, e.g., by self-orientation of the components used. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the ratio of the total volume of the reticulating agents and the total volume of the matrix material can range from about 20:80 to 70:30, preferably from about 30:70 to 60:40, or from about 50:50 to 60:40. 
 In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the solids content in the liquid mixture may be up to about 90% by weight of the total weight of the liquid mixture, preferably up to about 80%, or below about 20% by weight, preferably below about 15% by weight, e.g., below about 10% by weight or optionally below about 5% by weight. 
 Mechanical, optical and thermal properties of the material may be further adjusted and/or varied through the use of additives, which may be particularly suitable for producing tailor-made coatings. Thus, in certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, further additives can be added to the liquid mixture. 
 Examples of suitable additives include, e.g., fillers, further pore-forming agents, metals and metal powders, etc. Examples of inorganic additives and fillers include silicon oxides and aluminum oxides, aluminosilicates, zeolites, zirconium oxides, titanium oxides, talc, graphite, carbon black, fullerenes, clay materials, phyllosilicates, silicides, nitrides, metal powders, including transition metals such as copper, gold, silver, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium or platinum. 
 Other suitable additives can include cross linkers, plasticizers, lubricants, flame resistants, glass or glass fibers, carbon fibers, cotton, fabrics, metal powders, metal compounds, silicon, silicon oxides, zeolites, titan oxides, zirconium oxides, aluminum oxides, aluminum silicates, talcum, graphite, soot, phyllosilicates and the like. 
 Additives that may be used to facilitate cross linking may include, e.g., organosilanes such as tetraalkoxysilanes, alkylalkoxysilanes, and aryltrialkoxysilanes such as those described herein above, or those described, e.g., in International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2006/050622 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/346,983, filed Feb. 3, 2006. 
 Further additives may be added, e.g., for wetting, dispersing and/or sterically stabilizing the components of the mixture, or electrostatic stabilizers, rheology or thixotropy modifiers, such as the various additives and dispersing aids sold under the trademarks Byk      , Disperbyk       or Nanobyk       by Byk-Chemie GmbH, Germany, or equivalent compositions from other manufacturers. 
 Emulsifiers may also be included in the liquid mixture. Suitable emulsifiers may include, for example, anionic, cationic, zwitter-ionic or non-ionic surfactants or any combinations thereof. Anionic surfactants can include soaps, alkylbenzolsulfonates, alkansulfonates such as sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS) and the like, olefinsulfonates, alkyethersulfonates, glycerinethersulfonates,        -methylestersulfonates, sulfonated fatty acids, alkylsulfates, fatty alcohol ether sulfates, glycerine ether sulfates, fatty acid ether sulfates, hydroxyl mixed ether sulfates, monoglyceride(ether)sulfates, fatty acid amide(ether)sulfates, mono- and di-alkylsulfosuccinates, mono- and dialkylsulfosuccinamates, sulfotriglycerides, amidsoaps, ethercarboxylicacid and their salts, fatty acid isothionates, fatty acid arcosinates, fatty acid taurides, N-acylaminoacids such as acyllactylates, acyltartrates, acylglutamates and acylaspartates, alkyoligoglucosidsulfates, protein fatty acid condensates, including plant-derived products based on wheat; and alky(ether)phosphates. 
 Suitable cationic surfactants may include quaternary ammonium compounds such as dimethyldistearylammoniumchloride, Stepantex       VL 90 (Stepan), esterquats such as quaternized fatty acid trialkanolaminester salts, salts of long-chain primary amines, quaternary ammonium compounds such as hexadecyltrimethyl-ammoniumchloride (CTMA-Cl), Dehyquart       A (cetrimonium-chloride, available from Cognis), or Dehyquart       LDB 50 (lauryldimethylbenzyl-ammoniumchloride, available from Cognis). 
 Several additives may optionally be used to produce a stable dispersion, suspension or emulsion in the liquid mixture. 
 Additional fillers can be used to further modify the size and/or the degree of porosity. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, non-polymeric fillers may be used. Non-polymeric fillers can include compositions that can be removed or degraded, for example, by thermal treatment, washing out, or other techniques, without adversely affecting the material properties. Some fillers can be dissolvable in a suitable solvent and may be removed in this manner from the final material. Furthermore, non-polymeric fillers, which can be converted into soluble substances under certain thermal conditions, can also be used. Non-polymeric fillers may include, for example, anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactants, which can be removed and/or degraded under certain thermal conditions. Fillers can also include inorganic metal salts, particularly salts from alkaline and/or alkaline earth metals, such as alkaline or alkaline earth metal carbonates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, phosphites, halides, sulfides, and oxides. Other suitable fillers can comprise organic metal salts, e.g. alkaline or alkaline earth and/or transition metal salts, their formiates, acetates, propionates, malates, maleates, oxalates, tartrates, citrates, benzoates, salicylates, phthalates, stearates, phenolates, sulfonates, and amines, as well as mixtures thereof. 
 In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, polymeric fillers can be used. Suitable polymeric fillers can include those mentioned herein above as encapsulation polymers, particularly if provided in the form of spheres or capsules. Certain examples may include saturated, linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, which can be homo- or copolymers, e.g. polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, polyisobutene, polypentene as well as copolymers and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, polymer particles formed of methacrylates or polystearine, as well as electrically conducting polymers as described herein above, e.g. polyacetylenes, polyanilines, poly(ethylenedioxythiophenes), polydialkylfluorenes, polythiophenes or polypyrroles, can also be used as polymeric fillers, e.g., for providing electrically conductive materials. 
 In the above-mentioned procedures, soluble fillers and polymeric fillers can be combined, where these fillers may be volatile under the thermal conditions used, e.g., in a solidification process, or they can be converted into volatile compounds during a thermal treatment. In this manner, pores formed by the polymeric fillers can be combined with pores formed by the reticulating agents and/or other fillers to achieve an isotropic or anisotropic pore distribution such as, for example, a hierarchical pore size distribution. 
 Suitable particle sizes of the non-polymeric fillers can be selcted based on the desired porosity and/or size of the pores of the resulting composite material. 
 Solvents which may be suitable for removal of the fillers or for cleaning procedures after solidification of the material may include, for example, water, hot water, diluted or concentrated inorganic or organic acids, bases, or any of the solvents mentioned herein above. Suitable inorganic acids may include, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, or diluted hydrofluoric acid. Suitable bases may include, for example, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, carbonate, or organic amines. Suitable organic acids may include, for example, formic acid, acetic acid, trichloromethane acid, trifluoromethane acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, and mixtures thereof. 
 Fillers can be partly or completely removed from the reticulated composite material, depending on the nature and time of treatment with the solvent. Complete removal of the filler after solidification may be preferred in certain applications. 
 The solidification procedure selected may depend on specific properties and composition of the liquid mixture used. Solidification may be achieved, e.g., by thermal treatment such as heating or cooling, variation of pressure, e.g. evacuation, flushing or ventilation, drying with gases, including inert gases, drying, freeze-drying, spray-drying, filtration, or chemical or physical curing or hardening, e.g., with the use of cross linkers, optionally combined with a thermal cross linking or radiation-induced cross linking, or any combinations thereof. 
 Solidification may occur without significant decomposition of the matrix material or the combination of the reticulating agent and matrix material, e.g., without significant thermolysis or pyrolysis of the matrix material. The reticulating agent(s) may be embedded in the matrix material. 
 Suitable solidification conditions such as temperature, atmosphere or pressure, can be selected to provide a substantially complete solidification based on the desired properties of the composite material being formed and the components used. 
 In additional exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the solidification procedure may include a phase separation of the liquid mixture into a solid phase and a liquid phase, e.g., by precipitating the solids from the liquid mixture. Such a phase separation or precipitation may facilitate or promote the development of a reticulated structure in the resulting composite material. The structural development may occur substantially before the solvents are removed, e.g., the phase separation or precipitation may be induced before removal of the at least one solvent. The phase separation or precipitation can be induced by removal of solvent, cross linking of the matrix material, and/or increasing the viscosity of the liquid mixture. 
 The increase in viscosity of the liquid mixture may be provided by, e.g., cross linking, curing, drying, rapidly increasing the temperature, rapidly lowering the temperature, or rapidly removing the solvent.         Rapidly         can refer to a time period less than about 5 hours, preferably less than about one hour, or within less than about 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes or less than about 2 minutes or less than about 1 minute after increasing of the viscosity is initiated. The time period required may depend on the mass of the liquid mixture being processed. 
 A thermal treatment may include heating or cooling in a temperature range between about         78       C. to 500       C., and may include a heating process, a freezing process, a freeze-drying process, and the like. 
 The solvent can be removed from the liquid mixture prior to a thermal treatment. This can be achieved by filtration, or alternatively by a thermal treatment of the liquid mixture, e.g., by cooling or heating the liquid mixture to temperatures between about         200       C. to 300       C., between about         100       C. to 200       C., or between about         50       C. to 150       C. Temperatures between about 0       C. to 100       C. or about 50       C. to 80       C. may also be used. An evaporation of the solvents at room temperature or in a stream of hot air or other gases can also be used. Drying may be performed by spray drying, freeze-drying, or similar conventional methods. 
 The solidification treatment may also include a thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, with or without prior removal of the solvent, which may be performed at temperatures between about 20       C. to 4000       C., or between about 100       C. to 3500       C. Temperatures between about 100       C. and 2000       C. or between about 150       C. and 500       C. may also be used. The thermal treatment can optionally be performed under reduced pressure or vacuum, or in the presence of inert or reactive gases. 
 A solidification process that does not decompose any of the components can be performed at temperatures up to about 500       C. In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it may be preferred to partially or totally carbonize, pyrolize or decompose at least one of the components of the composite material during or after the solidification process. This can be achieved at higher temperatures, which may range from about 150       C. to about 4000       C. These higher temperatures can be used in further exemplary embodiments of the present invention where an additional sintering step may be desired. 
 Sintering procedures at high temperatures, e.g., temperatures above 500       C., may not be required or desired when forming certain composite materials, and treatment steps involving decomposition of matter, e.g., pyrolysis or carbonization steps, may preferably be avoided. The solidification procedure that may be performed in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be performed at temperatures between about 20       C. and 500       C., or between about 30       C. and 350       C. Temperatures between about 40       C. and 300       C., or below about 200       C., e.g., between about 100       C. and 190       C., may also be used. 
 The solidification procedure can be performed in different atmospheres. For example, it can be performed in an inert atmosphere such as, for example, nitrogen, SF6, or a noble gas such as argon, or any mixtures thereof. The solidification procedure may also be performed in an oxidizing atmosphere comprising, e.g., oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen oxide. Furthermore, an inert atmosphere can be blended with reactive gases, e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, C1-C6 saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane and butane, or mixtures thereof. 
 In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the atmosphere in the solidification procedure, particularly when thermally treating the liquid mixture, can be an oxidizing atmosphere such as air, oxygen or oxygen enriched inert gases. Alternatively, the atmosphere during the solidification procedure can be substantially free of oxygen, e.g., the oxygen content may be below about 10 ppm, or even below about 1 ppm. 
 The solidification process can also be performed using laser applications, e.g., by using a selective laser sintering (SLS) technique, and/or may be radiation-induced, e.g., when using UV or gamma radiation to activate and cure cross linkers that can be present in the mixture. 
 Solid components can be precipitated from a solvent-based liquid mixture by thermal treatment, by cross linking, and/or by evaporating the solvent. A low viscosity of the liquid mixture may be preferred when forming a substantially homogeneous porous structure in the resulting composite material and/or to promote a network-like or reticulated orientation of particles in the liquid mixture, which may be accompanied by a rapid viscosity increase of the solid phase during the solidification procedure. This can be achieved by separating the solid phase from the solvent phase, where the temperature for this process may be selected based on the freezing point or the boiling point, respectively, of the solvent and the matrix material. 
 If solidification is achieved by increasing the temperature of the mixture, the solvent may have a boiling point that is lower than the melting point of the matrix material by at least about 5       C. and up to about 200       C., between about 30       C. and 200       C. lower, or between about 40       C. and 100       C. below the melting point of the matrix material, so that there may be little or no reduction of the viscosity of the matrix material, and/or no melting or incomplete thermal decomposition of the matrix material or the reticulating agents during thermal treatment of the liquid mixture and/or during removal of the solvent. 
 In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a rapid lowering of the temperature may be used to solidify the liquid mixture. This can be achieved with liquid mixtures that may or may not include a solvent. In a solvent-based mixture, the solvent may have a boiling point that is at least 10       C. to 100       C. above the melting point of the matrix material, preferably about 20       C. to 100       C. higher, or more preferably about 30       C. to 60       C. above the melting point of the matrix material. 
 By providing a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or solution at a temperature close to that of the melting point of the matrix material, which may be a polymer, a network of the reticulating agents may be formed by rapidly lowering the temperature, resulting in a rapid increase of the viscosity of the liquid mixture. To incorporate the reticulating agents in the matrix material, the solvent phase can subsequently be removed from the liquid mixture by using, e.g., a vacuum treatment. 
 Cross linkers can be added to a dispersion, suspension or emulsion that may be provided as the liquid mixture. Cross linkers may include, for example, isocyanates, silanes, diols, di-carboxylic acids, (meth)acrylates, for example such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, propyltrimethoxysilane, 3-(trimethylsilyl)propyl methacrylate, isophoron diisocyanate, polyols, glycerin and the like. Biocompatible cross linkers such as glycerin, diethylentriaminoisocyanate and 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, may be preferred, e.g., if the liquid mixture is to be converted into the solid composite material at relatively low temperatures, e.g., below about 100       C. 
 The composition and type of the cross linker can be selected such that the cross linking that may occur during solidification of the liquid mixture does not generate a significant viscosity change of the system before the solid composite phase has formed by phase separation or evaporation of the solvent. Cross linking may be interrupted, and components of the matrix material which are not already cross linked or only partially cross linked may be dissolved and removed by treating the system with suitable solvents, in order to modify the morphology and the overall structure of the composite material. 
 The liquid mixture and/or the formed composite material that may be used to form or coat the medical device may be subjected to further processing, depending on the particular intended use. For example, reductive or oxidative treatment procedures can be applied in which the solidified material or coating may be treated one or more times with suitable reducing agents and/or oxidizing agents such as, e.g., hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen, air, or nitrous oxide, or oxidizing acids such as nitric acid and the like, and optionally mixtures of these agents, to modify pore sizes and/or surface properties. Activation of surface properties with air may also be performed. This can be achieved at an elevated temperature, e.g., between about 40       C. and 1000       C., or between about 70       C. and 900       C., or between about 100       C. and 850       C. Temperatures between, about 200       C. and 800       C. may also be used, or the selected temperature may be approximately 700       C. The composite material produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention can also be modified by reduction or oxidation, or by a combination of these treatment steps at approximately room temperature. Boiling of the composite material in oxidizing acids or bases may also be used to modify surface and bulk properties. 
 The pore size and/or pore structure of the composite material formed can be varied according to the type of oxidizing agent or reducing agent used, the activation temperature selected, and/or the duration of the activation. The porosity can be adjusted by, e.g., washing out fillers that may be present in the composite material, as described above. These fillers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, powdered aluminum, fatty acids, microwaxes or emulsions thereof, paraffins, carbonates, dissolved gases or water-soluble salts, which may be removed, e.g., by treatment of the material with water, solvents, acids or bases, or by distillation or oxidative and/or non-oxidative thermal decomposition. Suitable treatment methods to achieve removal of fillers are described, for example, in German Patent Publication No. DE 103 22 187 and International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2004/005277. 
 The properties of the material produced may optionally be altered by structuring the surface with powdered substances such as, e.g., metal powder, carbon black, phenolic resin powder or fibers, including carbon fibers or natural fibers. 
 The composite material may also be optionally subjected to a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process or a chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process to further modify the surface structure and/or pore structure and/or its physico-chemical properties. This can be achieved by treating the composite material or coating with suitable precursor gases that can release carbon at high temperatures. For example, a diamond-like carbon coating or film can be applied using these techniques. Other elements, such as silicon, may also be deposited onto or into the composite material using these conventional techniques. Many saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons having sufficient volatility under CVD conditions may be used as a precursor to split off carbon. Suitable ceramic precursors include, for example, BCl3, NH3, silanes such as SiH4, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), dichlorodimethylsilane (DDS), methyltrichlorosilane (MTS), trichlorosilyldichloroborane (TDADB), hexadichloromethylsilyloxide (HDMSO), AlCl3, TiCl3 or mixtures thereof. Using CVD techniques, the size of pores in the material can be reduced in a controlled manner, or the pores may be completely closed and/or sealed. This exemplary process can allow controlled adjustment or variation of sorptive properties and/or mechanical properties of the composite material. The composite materials or coatings can be modified by a CVD process using silanes or siloxanes, optionally in a mixture with hydrocarbons, to form a carbide or oxycarbide, which can achieve increased resistance of the material to oxidation. 
 The materials or devices produced according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be further coated and/or modified using sputtering techniques or ion implantation/ion bombardment techniques. Carbon, silicon, metals and/or metal compounds can be applied using conventional techniques and suitable sputter targets. For example, by incorporating silicon compounds, titanium compounds, zirconium compounds, tantalum compounds or metals into the material using CVD or PVD techniques, carbide phases can be formed which may increase the stability and oxidation resistance of the material. 
 The composite material can also be worked mechanically to produce porous surfaces. For example, controlled abrasion of the surface layer(s) by suitable methods can lead to modified porous surface layers. One technique that may be used to achieve this can include cleaning and/or abrasion in an ultrasonic bath, where defects in the material and further porosity can be produced in a targeted manner by admixture of abrasive solids of various particle sizes and degrees of hardness, and by appropriate input of energy and a suitable frequency of the ultrasonic bath as a function of treatment time. Aqueous ultrasonic baths, to which alumina, silicates, aluminates or the like have been added, preferably alumina dispersions, may be used. Any solvent that is suitable for ultrasonic baths may also be used instead of or in combination with water. 
 Ion implantation of metal ions, in particular transition metal ions and/or non-metal ions, can be used to further modify the surface properties of the composite material. For example, nitrogen implantation may be used to incorporate nitrides, oxynitrides or carbonitrides, in particular those of the transition metals. The porosity and strength of the surface of the materials can be further modified by implantation of carbon. 
 The composite reticulated materials can be further modified, e.g., by applying biodegradable, resorbable and/or non-biodegradable resorbable polymers, which optionally may be provided in a porous form, as a layer form or an overcoat onto the composite material. 
 Parylenation of the composite reticulated materials provided in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be performed before or after any activation procedure(s) described herein to further modify their surface properties and/or porosity. A device can first be treated with para-cyclophane at an elevated temperature, which may be approximately 600       C., to form a polymer film of poly(p-xylylene) on the surface of the device. This film can optionally be converted to carbon using a subsequent conventional carbonization step. 
 If desired, the reticulated material may be subjected to additional chemical and/or physical surface modifications. Cleaning steps to remove residues and/or impurities that might be present can be performed on the composite material. For example, acids such as oxidizing acids, or solvents may be used, but boiling in acids or solvents may be used. Carboxylation of certain materials can be achieved by boiling in oxidizing acids. Washing with organic solvents, optionally combined with application of ultrasound energy, and optionally performed at elevated temperatures, may also be used for further processing of the devices. 
 The reticulated materials and devices formed therefrom may be sterilized using conventional methods, e.g., by autoclaving, ethylene oxide sterilization, pressure sterilization or gamma-radiation. The various modification and cleaning procedures described herein may be performed in any combination, depending on the components of the material formed and the desired properties. 
 Coatings or bulk compositions comprising the porous composite material may be structured in a suitable manner, before or after solidification, using such techniques as, for example, folding, embossing, punching, pressing, extruding, gathering, injection molding and the like. These techniques may be applied before or after the composite material is applied to the substrate or molded or formed. In this way, certain structures of a regular or irregular type can be incorporated, for example, into a coating produced using the composite material provided according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The composite material can be further processed using conventional techniques to provide a desired shape, e.g., by providing molded paddings and the like, or by forming coatings on medical devices. 
 The composite materials can be produced in any desired form. By applying multi-layered half-finished molded shapes, asymmetric constructions can be formed from the composite materials. The materials can be brought into the desired form by applying any appropriate conventional technique, including but not limited to casting processes such as sand casting, shell molding, full mold processes, die casting and centrifugal casting, or by pressing, sintering, injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, calendaring, fusion welding, pressure welding, jiggering, slip casting, dry pressing, drying, firing, filament winding, pultrusion, lamination, autoclave, curing or braiding. 
 Coatings of the reticulated material can be applied in a liquid, pulpy or pasty form, for example, by painting, furnishing, phase-inversion, dispersing atomizing or melt coating, extruding, die casting, slip casting, dipping or as a hot melt. Coatings may be applied directly in the form of the liquid mixture before solidification of the mixture is performed. If the coating material is already in a solid state, it may be applied on a suitable substrate by, e.g., powder coating, flame spraying, sintering or the like. Techniques such as, for example, dipping, spraying, spin coating, ink-jet-printing, tampon and microdrop coating or 3-D-printing may also be used to apply the liquid mixture onto a substrate. The application of the liquid mixture can be performed using a high frequency atomizing device such as, for example, the one described in International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2005/000041, or by print or roller coating using a device such as the one described, e.g., in International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/042045. Such devices and techniques may also be used to coat the medical device with additional agents, e.g. therapeutically or diagnostically active agents, or with further coatings as described herein below. A coating of the reticulated material can be provided, for example, by applying a layer of the liquid mixture to a medical device, drying it, and optionally performing a thermal treatment. 
 Coated devices can be provided by a transfer process, in which the reticulated material may be applied to a device substrate in the form of a prepared lamination. The coated device can be dried, cured and the coating may then optionally be treated or further processed. A coated medical device can also be obtained using suitable printing procedures, e.g., gravure printing, scraping or blade printing, spraying techniques, thermal laminations, or wet-in-wet laminations. More than one thin layer can be applied, for example, to produce an error-free composite film. By applying the above-mentioned transfer procedures, multi-layer gradient films may be formed from different layers and/or different sequences of layers which, after the solidification procedure is performed, can provide gradient materials where the density of the reticulated material may vary with location in the film. 
 The liquid mixture can also be dried or thermally treated and then ground or pulverized using conventional techniques, for example, by grinding in a ball mill or a roller mill and the like. The pulverized composite material can be provided, for example, as a powder, a flat blank, a rod, a sphere, or a hollow sphere in different grainings, and can be processed using conventional techniques into granulates or extrudates in various forms. Hot-pressure-procedures, optionally accompanied by suitable binders, can be used to form the medical device or parts thereof from the reticulated material. 
 Additional processing options may include, for example, the formation of powders by other conventional techniques such as spray-pyrolysis or precipitation, or the formation of fibers by spinning techniques such as gel spinning. 
 By selecting the components and the processing conditions, the processes described herein allow, e.g., for the production of bioerodible or biodegradable materials, devices or coatings, and/or coatings of reticulated materials which may be dissolvable or which may be peeled off from substrates in the presence of physiologic fluids. For example, coatings may be produced which can be used in the medical field for coronary implants such as stents, where the coating may comprise a therapeutically and/or diagnostically active agent. 
 In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the composite material can comprise at least one active agent for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes. The therapeutically and/or diagnostically active agent may be included in the medical device as a component of the reticulating agent, the matrix material or an additive, or it may be applied onto or into the composite material, e.g., after the solidification procedure is performed. 
 A diagnostically active agent may include, for example, a marker, a contrast medium or a radiopaque material, and can be formed at least in part from one or more materials having signaling properties, e.g., materials that can produce a signal detectable by physical, chemical or biological detection methods. Examples of such materials are described above as reticulating agents. Further suitable diagnostic agents having signaling properties are described in, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/322,694, filed Dec. 30, 2005, and International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2005/013732. Certain matrix materials may also have signaling properties and thus may be used to provide a marker or a contrast medium. The composite reticulated material may also be suitably modified, for example, to allow for a controlled release of the diagnostic agent. The terms         diagnostically active agent,                 diagnostic agent,                 agent for diagnostic purpose         and         marker         can refer to such diagnostically active agents as described herein above. 
 Markers or agents having signaling properties can produce signals detectable by physical, chemical or biological detection techniques such as, e.g., x-ray techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, computer tomography techniques, scintigraphy techniques, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques, ultrasonic techniques, radiofrequency (RF) techniques, and the like. 
 For example, metal-based reticulating agents which may be used as markers can be encapsulated in a polymer shell, and thus can be prevented from interfering with the composite material itself or a device on which it is coated. For example, a device can be made from an implant material, which may also comprise a metal, and interference between the two metal-containing compositions may lead to, e.g., electrocorrosion or similar undesirable effects. Coated implants may be produced which contain encapsulated markers, where the coating can remain on the implant permanently or for an extended period of time. 
 Therapeutically active reticulating agents, if used, may be encapsulated in bioerodible or resorbable materials, which may optionally allow a controlled release of the active ingredient under physiologic conditions. Also, coatings or composite materials having a known and/or controlled porosity may be infiltrated or loaded with therapeutically active agents, which can be resolved or extracted in the presence of physiologic fluids. Thus, medical devices or implants may be provided which are capable of controllably releasing active agents. Examples of such devices include, and are not limited to drug eluting stents, drug delivery implants, drug eluting orthopedic implants and the like. 
 The exemplary processes described herein may be used to produce, e.g., porous bone or tissue grafts (erodible and non-erodible), porous implants or joint implants, or porous traumatologic devices such as nails, screws or plates. Such devices may optionally be coated, and can further be provided, e.g., with enhanced engraftment properties, therapeutic functionality, and/or excitable radiating properties, e.g., for performing local radiation therapy of tissues and organs. 
 Reticulated composite materials and/or coatings formed therefrom can include conductive fibers such as, e.g., carbon nanotubes, which may reflect or absorb electromagnetic irradiation and therefore can provide shielding properties for electronic medical devices, such as metal implants, pacemakers or parts thereof. 
 Carbon nanotube- and nanofiber-based porous composite materials having high specific surface areas and particular thermal conductivity and/or anisotropic electrical conductivity can be produced for use, e.g., as actuators for micro- and macro-applications, or as thin film materials which can be used to make, e.g., artificial muscles or actuating fibers and films. 
 The exemplary processes and procedures described herein may be used in non-medical applications, e.g., for the production of sensors with porous texture for venting of fluids; porous membranes and filters for nanofiltration, ultrafiltration or microfiltration, as well as mass separation of gases. Catalytic active porous materials can also be produced with high specific surfaces containing covalently or non-covalently bound catalytic active agents such as, e.g., catalytic metals, enzymes or reactive agents for catalytic applications. 
 Porous composite material coatings having controlled reflection and/or refraction properties may also be produced. For example, optical coatings can be provided with improved functional properties such as, e.g., electromagnetic shielding, electrical conductivity, nanoporosity, high light transmittance, optical transparency and/or anti-reflexive properties. Such optical coatings may be used for, e.g., advanced touch screens, large area displays, flexible displays, solar voltaic collectors with high specific surface area, etc. 
 Average pore sizes of the composite materials provided in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be determined by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) techniques, adsorptive techniques such as gas adsorption or mercury intrusion porosimetry, or by chromatographic porosimetry. Porosity and specific surface areas may be determined by N2 or He absorption techniques, e.g., using an exemplary BET technique. Particle sizes, including those of the reticulating agents, may be determined using a CIS Particle Analyzer (Ankersmid), a TOT technique (Time-Of-Transition), an X-ray powder diffraction technique, a laser diffraction technique, or a TEM (Transmission-Electron-Microscopy) technique. Average particle sizes in suspensions, emulsions or dispersions may also be determined using, e.g., dynamic light scattering techniques. Solids contents of liquid mixtures may be determined using, e.g., gravimetric techniques or humidity measurements. 
 Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be further described by way of the following non-limiting examples. 
EXAMPLE 1 
 A homogeneous dispersion of soot, lamp-black (Degussa, Germany) having a primary particle size of about 90 to 120 nm in a phenoxy resin (Beckopox       EP 401, Cytec) was prepared using the following exemplary procedure. First, a parent solution of methylethylketone (31 g), 3.1 g Beckopox       EP 401 and 0.4 g of glycerin (Sigma Aldrich) (a cross linker) was prepared. A soot paste was prepared using 1.65 g Lamp Black and 1.65 g of a dispersing additive (DisperbykE 2150, solution of a block copolymer in 2-methoxy-1-methylethylacetate, Byk-Chemie, Germany), and adding a portion of the methylethylketone/Beckopox       EP 401 parent solution. Subsequently, the paste was converted into a dispersion by adding the remaining parent solution using a Pentraulik       dissolver for 15 minutes to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. 
 The dispersion was observed to contain a total solids content of about 3.5%, which was determined using a humidity measurement device (Sartorius MA 50). The particle size distribution in the dispersion was D50=150 nm, which was determined using a laser diffractometer (Horiba LB 550). 
 The dispersion was sprayed onto a steel substrate to an average areal weight of 4 g/m2. Immediately after spraying, the layer was dried with hot air for 2 minutes. The sample was then thermally treated under a nitrogen atmosphere in a conventional tube furnace with a heating and cooling temperature rate of 1.33 K/min. The sample was heated to a maximum temperature, Tmax, of 280       C., held for 30 minutes at this temperature, and then cooled. The sample obtained from this process was examined with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FIG. 1 shows a 50,000       magnification of the resulting porous composite material layer having an average pore size of 100 to 200 nm. 
EXAMPLE 2 
 A homogeneous dispersion of soot, lamp-black (Degussa, Germany) having a primary particle size of 90 to 120 nm, and fullerenes (Nanom Mix, FCC) and a phenoxy resin (Beckopox       EP 401, Cytec) was prepared using an exemplary procedure similar to the procedure described in Example 1 above. A paste of the reticulating particles was prepared from 0.9 g lamp black, 0.75 g of the fullerene mixture and 1.65 g of a dispersing additive (Disperbyk       2150, Byk-Chemie, Germany). The amounts of all other components used are the saem as those described in Example 1. The resulting dispersion had a total solids content of about 3.4%, as determined using a humidity measurement device (Sartorius MA 50). The particle size distribution in the dispersion was D50=1        m, which was determined using a laser diffractometer (Horiba LB 550). 
 The resulting dispersion was sprayed onto a steel substrate to an average areal weight of 3.8 g/m2 and dried with hot air for 2 minutes. The sample was subjected to a thermal treatment as described above in Example 1. The resulting porous composite-coated steel substrate was examined with the use of scanning electron microscopy. FIG. 2 shows an exemplary SEM image at 20,000       magnification of the resulting porous composite layer, which has an average pore size of about 1        m. 
EXAMPLE 3 
 The sample produced in Example 2 was subjected to a 30-minute treatment in an ultrasonic bath in acetone at 35       C. The sample was then dried in a ordinary convection oven at 200       C. for 2 hours. The exemplary SEM picture in FIG. 3 shows a 20,000       magnification of the spongy composite layer formed on this sample. 
EXAMPLE 4 
 A homogeneous dispersion was prepared as described in Examples 1 to 3 above. However, 1.65 g of carbon nanofibers with a medium length of about 2        m and an average diameter of about 200 nm (Polytech) were used to form the dispersion instead of soot and/or fullerenes. The resulting dispersion had a total solids content of about 3.6%. The dispersion was sprayed onto a steel substrate to an areal weight of 4.2 g/m2 and dried with hot air for 2 minutes. 
 The sample was then thermally treated as described in Examples 1 to 3 above. The sample was subsequently treated in an ultrasonic bath in acetone at 35       C. for 30 minutes. After drying in a convection oven for 2 hours at 200       C., the sample was examined with a scanning electron microscope. FIG. 4 shows an exemplary SEM picture at 5,000       magnification of the resulting mesh or textile-like composite layer formed on the sample. The average pore size of such material was about 2        m. 
EXAMPLE 5 
 A homogeneous dispersion in a phenoxy resin was prepared as described in Example 1. However, 1.6 g of silica (Aerosil R972, Degussa, Germany) was used instead of soot. The dispersion was observed to have a total solids content of about 3.2%, and the average particle size distribution was D50=150 nm. The dispersion was sprayed onto a steel substrate to an average areal weight of 3.3 g/m2 and dried with hot air for 2 minutes. A thermal treatment was then performed on this sample under the same conditions described in Example 1. 
 The resulting porous composite layer produced in this example is shown in the exemplary scanning electron microscopy image of FIG. 5 at 20,000       magnification. The sample was observed to have an average pore size of about 150 nm. 
EXAMPLE 6 
 A homogeneous dispersion of tantalum nanoparticles (Sigma Aldrich), having a particle size distribution of D50=100 nm, and Beckopox       EP 401 (Cytec) was prepared. A parent solution of Beckopox       EP 401 (0.59 g) which included 0.13 g of a liquid aliphatic polyisocyanate based on a low viscosity HDI trimer (Desmodur       N3600, Degussa) as a cross linker and solvent ethoxypropylacetate (EPA) 0.38 g was prepared, and a paste was prepared in a mortar from 0.98 g tantalum powder with the subsequent addition of portions of the parent solution. The dispersion had a total solids content of about 80%, determined as described above. The particle size distribution in the dispersion was D50=200 nm. 
 The dispersion was dropped onto a magnesium substrate and dried with hot air for 2 minutes. Subsequently, a thermal treatment was carried out in a conventional convection oven under a nitrogen atmosphere up to a maximum temperature Tmax of 280       C. and held at that temperature for 30 minutes, as described in Example 1 above. The sample was examined with a scanning electron microscope. FIG. 6 shows an exemplary SEM picture at 200       magnification of the porous composite produced in this example. The material had an average pore size of about 200 mm. 
EXAMPLE 7 
 1.87 g of a phenoxy resin (Beckopox EP 401 (Cytex) was placed in a mortar, and subsequently 0.635 g of tantalum particles having a medium particle size of about 3        m (H. C. Stark) was added in portions, and the mixture was ground to form a substantially homogeneous paste. 
 Separately, 0.626 g of titanium dioxide particles having a medium particle size of about 21 nm (Aeroxide P25, Degussa, Germany) was combined with 1.268 g of a dispersion aid (Dysperbyk P-104, Byk Chemie, Germany), ground to form a paste, and then diluted to form a dispersion by adding 4.567 g of methylethylketone. The dispersion was combined with the homogeneous paste of tantalum particles in the phenoxy resin, and 0.649 g of ethoxypropylacetate, 0.782 g of glycerin (a cross linker), 0.057 g of polyethylene particles having an average particle size of about 150        m (Microscrub, Impag Company) and 0.126 g of polyethylene oxide (MW 300,000, Sigma Aldrich) were added. The resulting mixture was homogenized in a swing mill (Retsch) at 25 kHz for 2 minutes in the presence of 3 steel balls, each having a diameter of 1 cm. The resulting dispersion was dropped with a pipette onto a circular blank made of titanium and dried for 30 minutes in a conventional air convection oven at about 50       C. Subsequently, the sample was thermally treated at about 300       C. under a nitrogen atmosphere to cure the resin. The resulting material revealed microscopic pores having a size of about 100 to 200        m, as shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the material revealed smaller pores having a reticulated, sponge-like structure in combination with the microscopic pores, resulting in a hierarchical porosity, as shown in FIG. 7a (100       magnification) and FIG. 7b (20,000       magnification). 
EXAMPLE 8 
 A tantalum-containing paste was produced as described above in Example 7. However, Dysperbyk       180 (Byk Chemie, Germany) was used as the dispersion aid. This paste was then combined with a titanium dioxide-containing dispersion produced using the same components and quantities as that described in Example 7 above. Subsequently, 0.649 g of ethoxypropylacetate, 0.782 g glycerin (a cross linker), 0.057 g of polyethylene particles having a medium particle size of about 150        m (Microscrub, available from Impag Company), and 0.126 g of polyethylene oxide (MW 300,000, Sigma Aldrich) were added as fillers or porogenes, respectively. The resulting mixture was homogenized in a swing mill (Retsch) at 25 kHz for 2 minutes with 3 steel balls, each having a diameter of 1 cm. The resulting dispersion was dropped with a pipette onto a circular blank made of titanium and dried for 30 minutes at 50       C. in a conventional air convection oven. The samples revealed a microscopically porous surface having a medium pore size of about 100        m, as shown in FIG. 8a. FIG. 8b shows a 100       magnification of the image shown in FIG. 8a; which reveals the presence of macroscopic pores in a finely structured composite material having a microporous structure.

It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise numerous systems, arrangements and methods which, although not explicitly shown or described herein, embody the principles of the invention and are thus within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
