 This application claims the priority benefit of Taiwan application serial no. 94121792, filed on Jun. 29, 2005. All disclosure of the Taiwan application is incorporated herein by reference. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to charge pumps, and particularly to a charge pump for generating arbitrary voltage levels. 
 2. Description of Related Art 
 In an electronic circuit, power source voltages of different levels are often required; therefore, a charge pump circuit for generating power source voltages of different levels with the present power source voltage is usually equipped therein. 
 FIG. 1A is a circuit diagram of a conventional charge pump. FIG. 1B is a timing sequence diagram of control signals for illustrating the charge pump according to FIG. 1A. Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B together, the charge pump has five transistors; the control signals ph1 and ph2 are opposite in phase, wherein it is Vdd when at high voltage level and it is zero when at low voltage level. 
 During the charging period (CP) of a capacitor C1, the control signals ph1 and ph2 are respectively at low voltage level and high voltage level. Therefore, the transistors M1 and M3 are turned off while the transistors M0, M2 and M4 are turned on. The voltage at the terminal of the capacitor C1 which is coupled to the control signal ph1 is zero. The power source voltage Vdd charges the capacitor C1 via the transistor M0 until the voltage difference between the two terminals is Vdd        Vt; wherein, Vt is a threshold voltage of the transistors M0 to M4. 
 During the pumping period (PP) of the capacitor C1, the control signals ph1 and ph2 are respectively at high voltage level and low voltage level, therefore the transistors M1 and M3 are turned on while the transistors M0, M2 and M4 are turned off. The voltage at the terminal of the capacitor C1 which is coupled to the control signal ph1 is Vdd. Because a charge of voltage difference of Vdd        Vt has been stored during the charging period CP, the voltage of another terminal of the capacitor C1 will raise up to 2Vdd        Vt. Also, the voltage of a terminal of a capacitor C2 which is coupled to the control signal ph2 is zero, therefore the voltage 2Vdd        Vt of another terminal of the capacitor C1 charges the capacitor C2 via the transistor M1 until the voltage difference between the two terminals of the capacitor C2 is 2Vdd        2Vt. 
 Then, by analyzing the voltage variation according to the foregoing method, it can be known that the output voltage Vo from the charge pump is 5      (Vdd        Vt). Similarly, if the charge pump has N transistors, the output voltage is N      (Vdd        Vt). It can be known from the formula of the output voltage Vo that the charge pump can only generate some power source voltages having certain voltage levels.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS 
 In order to more clearly illustrate the embodiment of the invention, a charge pump composed of three pump units is exemplified herein; those who are skilled in related art may obtain charge pumps composed of one or more pump units in accordance with the invention. 
 FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of a charge pump in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to FIG. 2, a charge pump 20 includes three pump units PU1, PU2, PU3, four first switches S1, S2, S3, S4 and an output capacitor CL. Each of the pump units PUi includes a first terminal Ni,1, a second terminal Ni,2, a third terminal Ni,3, a fourth terminal Ni,4, two second switches SWi,1, SWi,2 and a capacitor Ci, wherein,         i         is an integer and 0      i        3. The first terminal Ni,1 is coupled to a reference voltage Vi,1 and a second terminal Ni,2 is coupled to a reference Vi,2. 
 Only the pump unit PU1 will be illustrated as an example herein; the architecture of other pump units is similar to that of the pump unit PU1 and thus description is omitted. The pump unit PU1 includes a first terminal Ni,1 coupled to a reference voltage V1,1, a second terminal Ni,2 coupled to a reference voltage V1,2, a third terminal N1,3, a fourth terminal N1,4, a second switch SW1,1, a second switch SW1,2 and a capacitor C1; wherein, the first terminal and the second terminal of the second switch SW1,1 are respectively the first terminal N1,1 and the fourth terminal N1,4 of the pump unit PU1; the first terminal and the second terminal of the second switch SW1,2 are respectively the third terminal N1,3 and the second terminal N1,2 of the pump unit PU1; and the first terminal and the second terminal of the capacitor C1 are respectively coupled to the second terminal of the second switch SW1,1 and the first terminal of the second switch SW1,2. 
 First switches S1, S2, S3 and S4 are coupled respectively to the corresponding pump units PU1, PU2 and PU3. The first terminal of the first switch S1 is adapted for receiving an input voltage Vi and the second terminal of the first switch S1 is coupled to the third terminal N1,3 of the pump unit PU1. The first terminal and the second terminal of the first switch S2 are respectively coupled to the fourth terminal N1,4 of the pump unit PU1 and the third terminal N2,3 of the pump unit PU2. The first terminal and the second terminal of the first switch S3 are respectively coupled to the fourth terminal N2,4 of the pump unit PU2 and the third terminal N3,3 of the pump unit PU3. The first terminal of the first switch S4 is coupled to the fourth terminal N3,4 of the pump unit PU3 and the second terminal of the first switch S4 outputs the output voltage Vo. 
 The timing sequence diagram of the control signals ph1 and ph2 of the charge pump 20 shown in FIG. 2 may be the same as that shown in FIG. 1B. Referring to ph1 and ph2 which are opposite in phase, the charge pump 20 makes the second switches SW1,1, SW1,2, SW2,1, SW2,2, SW3,1 and SW3,2 (all of which are controlled by control signal ph1) turn on, and the first switches S1, S2, S3 and S4 (all of which are controlled by control signal ph2) turn off during the first period; and the second switches SW1,1, SW1,2, SW2,1, SW2,2, SW3,1 and SW3,2 turn off, and the first switches S1, S2, S3 and S4 turn on during the second period. Herein, when at high levels the voltages of the control signals ph1 and ph2 are not necessary to be Vdd, and when at low voltage levels the voltages of the control signals ph1 and ph2 are not required to be zero as long as the voltages at high levels can control the switches to be turned on and at low levels the switches are turned off. Furthermore, considering the design of the switches, it is not a must to turn on the switches with a high level and to turn off the switches at a low level. Such switches may be constituted of NMOS transistors, PMOS transistors, transmission gates or a combination of such components. 
 Moreover, a retaining circuit (e.g. an output capacitor CL) is coupled between the second terminal of the first switch S4 and grounding for retaining the voltage level of output voltage Vo when the first switch S4 is turned off. Herein, other retaining circuit design can also be adopted for obtaining similar performance. As arbitrary voltages, the input voltage Vi and all the reference voltages V1,1, V1,2, V2,1, V2,2, V3,1 and V3,2 can be provided by a power source voltage or a voltage regulator. 
 FIGS. 3A and 3B are equivalent circuit of the charge pump 20 shown in FIG. 2 respectively during the first and the second periods. Wherein, the charge pump 20 is for generating a positive voltage. To simplify the illustration, the unnecessary components, terminals and nodes are not shown in the figures. 
 Referring to FIG. 3A, in the first period, the second switches SWi,1 and SWi,2 are turned on, and the first switch Sj is turned off. The equivalent circuit of the charge pump 20 is as shown in FIG. 3A. The charge pump 20 charges the capacitor Ci according to reference voltages Vi,1 and Vi,2. As an example, suppose Vi,1      Vi,2, namely V1,1      V1,2, V2,1      V2,2, and V3,1      V3,2, then the capacitors C1 to C3 are respectively charged to have voltage differences        V1 to        V3, wherein        V1=V1,1        V1,2,        V2=V2,1        V2,2 and        V3=V3,1        V3,2. Thus, the first period is a charging period. 
 Referring to FIG. 3B, in the second period, the second switches SWi,1 and SWi,2 are turned off, and the first switches Sj is turned on. The equivalent circuit of the charge pump 20 is as shown in FIG. 3B. Herein, the pump unit PUi makes the capacitor Ci provide voltage to the fourth terminal Ni,4 according to the voltage level of the third terminal Ni,3. For example, the voltage of the fourth terminal N1,4 of the pump unit PU1 is the sum of the voltage Vi of the third terminal N1,3 and the voltage difference        V1 of the capacitor C1. Thus, the output voltage is Vo=Vi+       V1+       V2+       V3, wherein        V1      0,        V2      0,        V3      0, and the range of voltage increase can be adjusted via designing Vi and        Vi. Thus, the second period is a pumping period, and a positive voltage is produced. 
 In the first embodiment, Vi,1=Vdd and Vi,2=0, namely the terminals of all pump units PU1 to PU3 receive voltage Vdd while the second terminals are grounded, thus        V1=       V2=       V3 and the output voltage is Vo=Vi+3Vdd. However, the aforementioned charge pump 20 is only a special example in accordance with the invention. Practically, the invention may also connect with multiple pump units in series to increase voltage for obtaining an output voltage at arbitrary positive voltage level. For example, if a charge pump according to the invention connects with         M         pieces of pump units in series which needs         M+1         pieces of first switches, the output voltage is Vo=Vi+M      Vdd. Accordingly, the value of         M         and the input voltage Vi can be determined in accordance with the requirement of the output voltage. Generally, the input voltage Vi is lower than the power source voltage Vdd. 
 In another embodiment, Vi,1=Vi and Vi,2=0, thus        Vi=Vi. If a charge pump connects with M pieces of pump units in series, the output voltage is Vo=Vi+M      Vi. 
 FIGS. 4A and 4B are equivalent circuit of the charge pump 20 shown in FIG. 2 respectively during the first and the second periods; wherein, the charge pump 20 is for generating a negative voltage. Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the equivalent circuit is respectively similar to that in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The difference is that the reference voltages Vi,1 are smaller than Vi,2, namely V1,1      V1,2, V2,1      V2,2 and V3,1      V3,2. Hence, the capacitors C1 to C3 are respectively charged to have voltage differences        V1 to        V3, wherein        V1=V1,1        V1,2,        V2=V2,1        V2,2 and        V3=V3,1        V3,2. However, the polarities of the capacitors C1 to C3 in FIG. 4A are opposite to those of the capacitors C1 to C3 in FIG. 3A. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 4B, in the second period, the output voltage is Vo=Vi+       V1+       V2+       V3, wherein        V1      0,        V2      0,        V3      0, and a negative voltage is produced. In an aspect of the embodiment, Vi,1=0 and Vi,2=Vdd, thus the output voltage Vo=Vi        3Vdd. In another aspect of the embodiment, Vi,1=Vi and Vi,2=0, thus the output voltage Vo=Vi        3Vi. Of course, the invention may also connect with multiple pump units in series to decrease voltage for obtaining an output voltage at arbitrary negative voltage level. 
 In summary, the charge pump according to the present invention employs a plurality of pump units connected in series incorporating with adjustable input voltage Vi and the adjustable reference voltages of all the pump units. Thus, arbitrary positive/negative voltage levels can be obtained.
