<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates generally to systems for mounting a headrail for a covering for an architectural opening and more specifically to a mounting bracket having a lever lock for securing the headrail to the mounting bracket. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Description of the Relevant Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Coverings for architectural openings such as windows, doors, archways and the like typically include a retractable panel of material supported by a headrail. The coverings are typically movable between extended positions wherein the panel of material extends across the architectural opening and a retracted position where the panel of material is either wrapped or gathered within or immediately adjacent to the headrail. The headrail further includes control systems for moving the covering between extended and retracted positions and in the case of *Venetian blinds for tilting the slats of the blind between open and closed positions. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Headrails are provided in various forms and configurations dictated partly by aesthetics and partly by function. In any circumstance, mounting brackets are provided that can be secured to a frame around the architectural opening and utilized to support the headrail. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In most instances, the mounting brackets have some form of a release mechanism so that the headrail is releasably secured to the mounting bracket whereby when in use it is reliably secure to prevent an inadvertent removal but can be released and removed for cleaning purposes or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Systems for releasably securing a headrail to mounting brackets have taken numerous forms including brackets with detents, depressible release arms, snap-on fingers or the like and efforts are continuing for devising more reliable and easy to operate systems. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention embodies a system for releasably mounting a headrail for a covering for an architectural opening to mounting brackets in a reliable, efficient, and easy to operate manner. The headrail and mounting brackets are complementary in that the headrail can be temporarily snapped onto the mounting brackets and then firmly locked in a mounted position with a readily accessible lever arm. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The mounting bracket has a depressible catch arm that is automatically depressed by a ledge on the headrail as the headrail is advanced to a predetermined position relative to the mounting bracket at which point the catch arm snaps into a temporarily secured position. A lever arm on the bracket can then be manually pivoted to a lock position to activate a slide-lock bar that prevents the catch arm from again being depressed thereby securely locking the headrail to the mounting bracket to prevent an inadvertent removal of the headrail. The lever arm of course can be moved to a release position to permit depression of the catch arm by applying reasonable manual force to the headrail. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Other aspects, features, and details of the present invention can be more completely understood by reference to the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the drawings and from the appended claims. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a pair of mounting brackets <b>30</b> in accordance with the present invention are seen with a headrail <b>32</b> for a covering for an architectural opening (not shown). While the frame for the architectural opening to which the brackets <b>30</b> can be mounted is not illustrated, the connection will be fully appreciated with the description of a bracket hereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Before describing a bracket <b>30</b> in detail, it is best to understand the structure of the headrail <b>32</b> adapted for mounting on the bracket and the headrail is probably best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The headrail can be seen to have a generally flat front wall <b>34</b> with an arcuate lower edge <b>36</b> and a relatively flat top wall <b>38</b> projecting rearwardly from the top edge of the front wall. The top wall has a depressed ledge <b>40</b> along its rearwardmost edge defining a bevel surface <b>42</b> and a rib spacer <b>44</b> projecting downwardly at an intermediate location between the front wall <b>34</b> and the ledge <b>40</b>. The headrail is typically extruded so that all of its features extend the full length of the headrail. At a predetermined spacing below the top wall, a support arm <b>46</b> extends rearwardly from the front wall of the headrail with the support arm having a lip <b>48</b> along its rearwardmost edge. The lip <b>48</b>, ledge <b>40</b>, and rib spacer <b>44</b> all cooperate in defining a pocket <b>50</b> in which a portion of the mounting bracket can be inserted. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the headrail <b>32</b> is shown connected to a mounting bracket <b>30</b> of the present invention with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing the mounting bracket in a release position and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in a locking position. Further, a roller <b>52</b> which might be found in a headrail of a roll-up shade is illustrated positioned within the headrail and beneath the mounting bracket for illustrative purposes only. The mounting bracket is probably best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-18</figref>. The bracket is made of a somewhat rigid plastic material having some flexibility depending upon the thickness of the plastic for purposes which will become apparent with the description hereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The bracket <b>30</b> can be seen to have a horizontal base <b>54</b>, a downturned back wall <b>56</b> off the rear edge of the base, and upper <b>58</b> and lower <b>60</b> horizontal flanges extending rearwardly from the back wall. The upper flange, the back wall, and the base all have openings <b>62</b> therethrough as possibly best seen in FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>,<b>14</b>, and <b>18</b> through which fasteners (not shown) can extend to secure the bracket to the frame around an architectural opening. The openings <b>62</b> are provided in both vertical and horizontal surfaces of the bracket so the bracket can be mounted to a vertical or horizontal surface of the frame depending upon the type of mounting desired for the covering. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> The base <b>54</b> has a relatively thick rear portion <b>64</b> with a flat upper surface <b>66</b> and a slide plate <b>68</b> projecting forwardly from the rear portion along a lower edge thereof. The slide plate has a pair of support arms <b>70</b> along opposite sides and an integral lead bar <b>72</b> connecting the support arms along the forwardmost edge of the slide plate so as to define a rectangular opening <b>74</b> therebetween. The opening has a spring catch arm <b>76</b> positioned therein with the catch arm having a relatively thin portion <b>78</b> integrally connected with and extending forwardly from the relatively thick rear portion <b>64</b> of the base in a living hinge and a bevel head <b>80</b> at the forwardmost end of the thin portion. The bevel head has front <b>82</b> and rear <b>84</b> upwardly directed bevel surfaces for purposes to be described hereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> The thin portion <b>78</b> is adapted to flex slightly at the living hinge so that the bevel head <b>80</b> can be depressed within the rectangular opening <b>74</b> in the slide plate <b>68</b>. The thin portion of the catch arm itself has a rectangular slot <b>86</b> formed therein for a purpose to be described hereafter. A pair of overhanging lips <b>88</b> project forwardly from the relatively thick rear portion <b>64</b> of the base in spaced overlying relationship with a rear portion of the slide plate <b>68</b>. The overhanging lips define a space therebetween that is continuous with a shallow groove <b>90</b> formed in the flat upper surface <b>66</b> of the rear portion <b>64</b> of the base. A vertical hole <b>92</b> is provided in the shallow groove for receipt of a removable pivot pin <b>94</b> having an enlarged head as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>-<b>11</b>. The pivot pin pivotally secures a lock lever <b>96</b> to the base as will be described later. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> As possibly best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the rectangular opening <b>74</b> in the slide plate <b>68</b> in which the spring catch arm <b>76</b> is positioned is continuous with a relatively narrow recessed channel <b>98</b> in the bottom of the relatively thick rear portion <b>64</b> of the base, which in turn is continuous with a slot-like opening <b>100</b> through the rear portion. As possibly best appreciated by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 13</figref>, a pair of support shoulders <b>102</b> extend along the sides of the slot-like opening <b>100</b> in the base along the bottom thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> A slide-lock bar <b>104</b> shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 19</figref>-<b>24</b> is slidably positioned within the opening <b>74</b> in the slide plate, the continuous recessed channel <b>98</b> and slot-like opening <b>100</b> in the rear portion of the base. The slide-lock bar slidably underlies the spring catch arm <b>76</b>. Referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-24</figref>, the slide-lock bar can be seen to have a flat paddle head <b>106</b> with a beveled leading edge <b>108</b>, a guide block <b>110</b> extending upwardly from a rear portion of the paddle head and a slide arm <b>112</b> extending rearwardly from the paddle head. The slide arm has a raised block <b>114</b> at approximately its longitudinal center with the raised block having a cylindrical guide pin <b>116</b> projecting upwardly. The underside of the slide arm has an elongated centered tongue <b>118</b> formed integrally thereon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) which projects downwardly a small amount from the remainder of the slide arm. The tongue is also relatively narrow so as to define support edges <b>120</b> along opposite sides of the slide arm which are adapted to ride upon the support shoulders <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> As probably best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-13</figref>, the slide-lock bar <b>104</b> is positioned in the base <b>54</b> so that the support edges <b>120</b> on the underside of the slide-lock bar are supported on the support shoulders <b>102</b> for sliding movement and the paddle head <b>106</b> is disposed within the rectangular opening <b>74</b> in the slide plate <b>68</b> immediately beneath the spring catch arm <b>76</b>. The guide block <b>110</b> on the paddle head projects into the rectangular slot <b>86</b> formed in the spring catch arm to assist in guiding sliding movement of the slide-lock bar. The slide-lock bar is also made of a relatively thin plastic so it too has some flexibility along its length. It should be noted that when the spring catch arm is depressed downwardly, it engages the top surface of the paddle head of the slide-lock bar also depressing the paddle head downwardly due to their uniform flexibility. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The lock lever <b>122</b>, which is used to engage and disengage the locking mechanism in the bracket, is seen in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-28</figref>. It can there be seen to have an elongated relatively flat body <b>124</b> with a diagonal gripping rib <b>126</b> at one end, a semicircular opposite end <b>128</b>, a circular passage <b>130</b> extending vertically through the body at a location relatively close to the opposite end and an arcuate push-pull slot <b>132</b> extending vertically through the flat body between the circular opening and the opposite end of the flat body from the gripping rib. The push-pull slot while being arcuate extends at approximately a 45 degree angle relative to the length of the lever arm for a purpose to be described hereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> The lock lever <b>122</b> is secured to the base <b>54</b> by positioning the gripping rib <b>126</b> at a location beyond the slide plate <b>68</b> of the base with the opposite end <b>128</b> of the lock lever being positioned within the shallow groove <b>90</b> provided in the top surface of the base. The circular passage <b>130</b> through the lock lever is aligned with the hole <b>92</b> in the shallow groove in the base and the pivot pin <b>94</b> is inserted into the hole to pivotally connect the lock lever to the base. It should be appreciated the width of the lock lever body <b>124</b> is less than the width of the shallow groove so the lock lever is free to pivot within limits about the pivot pin. A notch <b>134</b> is provided in a side of the flat body <b>124</b> to accommodate the adjacent overhanging lip <b>88</b> when the lock lever is in the locking position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. With the lock lever attached to the base as described, the guide pin <b>116</b> on the slide-lock bar <b>104</b> extends into the push-pull slot <b>132</b> of the lock lever. As will be appreciated by pivoting the lock lever about the pivot pin, the push-pull slot forces the guide pin to move linearly along the length of the bracket so that the slide-lock bar can be moved reciprocally forwardly and rearwardly along the length of the bracket with pivotal movement of the lock lever. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> As will be appreciated with the description later, when the lock lever <b>122</b> is aligned with the base as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the slide-lock bar <b>104</b> is fully retracted toward the rear of the bracket <b>30</b> whereas when the lock lever is pivoted into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the push-pull slot <b>132</b> advances the guide pin <b>116</b> pulling the slide-lock bar forwardly relative to the base <b>54</b>. This movement of the slide-lock bar is probably best appreciated by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The lock lever has arcuately spaced detents <b>136</b> in its opposite end <b>128</b> that releasably receives vertical beads <b>138</b> formed in the adjacent arcuate wall <b>140</b> of the shallow groove <b>90</b>. The detents and beads assist in retaining the lock lever in either a locking or release position to be described in more detail hereafter. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> Looking next at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the mounting bracket <b>30</b> is shown positioned to receive the headrail <b>32</b> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> showing the headrail having been advanced partially onto the mounting bracket so that the lead bar <b>72</b> of the slide plate <b>68</b> is inserted into the pocket <b>50</b> in the headrail between the rib spacer <b>44</b> and the support arm <b>46</b>. It should be noted in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the front bevel <b>82</b> on the bevel head <b>80</b> has engaged and passed by the rear ledge <b>40</b> of the top wall <b>38</b>. The engagement of the front bevel with the rear ledge cams the bevel head downwardly into the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the headrail is shown fully advanced onto the bracket in a neutral position where it will be appreciated the bevel head is positioned immediately in front of the bevel <b>42</b> on the rear ledge <b>40</b> of the top wall of the headrail. The rear bevel surface <b>84</b> on the catch arm <b>76</b> is engaged with the bevel <b>42</b> on the top wall of the headrail so that the headrail is temporarily but releasably secured to the bracket. As will be appreciated, if the headrail were to be pulled forwardly from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the beveled engagement of the bevel <b>42</b> on the top wall with the rear bevel <b>84</b> on the catch arm would cam the catch arm downwardly as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which would allow the headrail to be released from the bracket with a predetermined amount of force. As mentioned previously, the catch arm can be depressed from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> even though the slide-lock bar <b>104</b> is positioned therebeneath because both elements are somewhat flexible. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> With the headrail <b>32</b> temporarily connected to the mounting bracket <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, however, the lock lever <b>122</b> can be pivoted into the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which as mentioned previously, causes the slide lock bar <b>104</b> to move forwardly relative to the base <b>54</b> and as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, this extreme forward limited movement of the slide-lock bar causes the paddle head <b>106</b> to overlie the lip <b>48</b> on the support arm <b>46</b> of the headrail which prevents the slide-lock bar and the overlying catch arm <b>76</b> from being pivoted downwardly. As will be appreciated, if the catch arm cannot pivot downwardly, the headrail is prevented from removal from the mounting bracket due to the engagement of the bevel surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>84</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> Obviously, to remove the headrail <b>32</b> from the support bracket <b>30</b>, the lock lever <b>122</b> is simply pivoted into alignment with the base <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> causing the slide-lock bar <b>104</b> to be retracted further into the base so that the paddle head <b>106</b> no longer overlies the lip <b>48</b> of the support arm <b>46</b> whereby upon an outward pull on the headrail, the beveled engagement of the surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>84</b> will cause the catch arm <b>76</b> to pivot downwardly with the slide-lock bar as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> permitting removal of the headrail from the support bracket. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> As mentioned previously, the transverse profile of the headrail <b>32</b>, as illustrated in the drawings, is continuous along the length of the headrail so that any number of support brackets <b>30</b> can be positioned for receipt of the headrail. Each support bracket would be operated similarly to remove the headrail from the support bracket or to permit its mounting. It should also be appreciated the gripping rib <b>126</b> on the lock lever protrudes forwardly from the front wall <b>34</b> of the headrail <b>32</b> a sufficient distance to allow an operator to grip the lock lever and move it between locking and release positions. Further, the lock lever can be made of a clear plastic material so as to be less visible for aesthetic purposes. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood the present disclosure has been made by way of example and changes in detail or structure may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </p>
