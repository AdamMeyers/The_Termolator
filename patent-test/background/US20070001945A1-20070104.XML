<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The invention relates to a display device having a pixel including a light emitting element and a driving method thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> A flat type display device having a pixel including an electroluminescence element (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;a light emitting element&#x201d;) has been developed. This display device is said to have a wider viewing angle than a liquid crystal display device as a light emitting element in a pixel emits light by itself despite that a screen has a flat shape. Further, an advantage of this display device in that it can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display device is attracting attentions. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In the case where a pixel is formed of a light emitting element, an analog grayscale method to control a current value or a voltage level supplied to the light emitting element is known as a method for controlling the luminance of the pixel (for example, see Patent Document 1). Moreover, a time grayscale method to control light emission time of a light emitting element is known (for example, see Patent Document 2). Besides, an area grayscale method to divide one pixel into a plurality of regions and control a light emission state of each divided pixel is known (for example, see Patent Document 3). </p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000"> [Patent Document 1]</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-288055 </p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000"> [Patent Document 2]</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-123219 </p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000"> [Patent Document 3]</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-184015 </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> However, a light emitting element has a problem in that its luminance changes by a temperature change or passage of light emission time. Such deterioration of luminance is considered an issue to be solved since it appears notably as deterioration of image quality in a display device which employs an area grayscale method. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In view of this, the invention improves and stabilizes image quality of a display device which performs area grayscale display by using a light emitting element. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The point of the invention is that a portion of a display device having a pixel including a light emitting element is provided with a light emitting element having the same configuration as the pixel so as to function as a monitor light emitting element, thereby a voltage or a current supplied to the light emitting element is corrected in consideration of a change of the monitor light emitting element. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> The invention provides a display device including a plurality of monitor light emitting elements, a monitor line for monitoring a change in potential of an electrode included in the plurality of monitor light emitting elements, and a unit for electrically blocking a current supply to a shorted monitor light emitting element through the monitor line when any of the plurality of monitor light emitting elements is shorted. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The invention provides a display device having a display pixel including a plurality of subpixels including light emitting elements with approximately the same light emission color, and a monitor pixel with the same configuration as the display pixel. It is preferable that a light emitting element provided in this pixel and a light emitting element provided in the monitor pixel be formed simultaneously in a manufacturing step and have the same configurations. The light emitting element of each of the subpixels in the monitor pixel is connected to different constant current sources. The display device includes a differential amplifier circuit which changes a potential applied to the light emitting element in the display pixel for each subpixel in accordance with a potential change of the light emitting element in the monitor pixel for each subpixel. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> By providing a monitor light emitting element with the same configuration as a light emitting element provided in a pixel, luminance variations caused by a change in an environmental temperature or deterioration with time can be suppressed. As a result, image quality can be improved or stabilized. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> Although the present invention will be fully described by way of embodiment modes with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the invention, they should be construed as being included therein. Note that identical portions in embodiment modes are denoted by the same reference numerals and detailed descriptions thereof are omitted. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> It is to be noted in the specification that connected elements are electrically connected. Therefore, connected elements may have a semiconductor element, a switching element, or the like between them. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In this specification, a source electrode and a drain electrode of a transistor are thus called for convenience in order to distinguish electrodes other than a gate electrode in the configuration of the transistor. In the invention, in the case where the conductivity of a transistor is not limited, the source electrode and the drain electrode are changed in name depending on the conductivity of the transistor. Therefore, a source electrode or a drain electrode is described as one electrode or the other electrode in some cases. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0008">Embodiment Mode 1 </heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> In this embodiment mode, a configuration of a panel including a monitor light emitting element is described with reference to the drawings. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a configuration of a panel including a pixel portion <b>40</b>, a signal line driver circuit <b>43</b>, a first scan line driver circuit <b>41</b>, a second scan line driver circuit <b>42</b>, and a monitor circuit <b>64</b>. This panel is formed using an insulating substrate <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> The pixel portion <b>40</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>10</b>. Each pixel includes a first light emitting element <b>13</b> and a first driving transistor <b>12</b> which is connected to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and has a function to control a current supply. The first light emitting element <b>13</b> is connected to a power source <b>18</b>. Moreover, each pixel may include a second driving transistor <b>114</b> and a second light emitting element <b>14</b> which are connected in the same way as the first driving transistor <b>12</b> and the first light emitting element <b>13</b>. The second driving transistor <b>114</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> may be connected in parallel to the first driving transistor <b>12</b> and the first light emitting element <b>13</b> with a common power source. Here, the second light emitting element <b>14</b> may have a configuration in which two light emitting elements with equivalent or almost equivalent functions to the first light emitting element are connected in parallel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the invention is not limited to this and one light emitting element may be provided such as the first light emitting element <b>13</b>. Further, a plurality of light emitting elements of three or more may be connected in parallel or the functions of the plurality of light emitting elements may not be equivalent to one another. For example, the light emitting element as the second light emitting element <b>14</b> may have a different light emission area from that of the first light emitting element <b>13</b>. That is to say, it is required in one pixel that the second driving transistor <b>114</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> are connected in parallel to the first driving transistor <b>12</b> and the first light emitting element <b>13</b>. It is to be noted that a more specific configuration of the pixel <b>10</b> is described in the following embodiment mode as an example. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The monitor circuit <b>64</b> includes a first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b>, a first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> connected to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b>, and a first inverter <b>112</b>. The first inverter <b>112</b> has an output terminal connected to a gate electrode of the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b>. An input terminal of the first inverter <b>112</b> is connected to one of a source electrode and a drain electrode of the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b>. A constant current source <b>105</b> is connected to the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> through a power supply line <b>113</b>. Other monitor controlling transistors in the monitor circuit <b>64</b> each has a function to control a current supply from the power supply line <b>113</b> to each of a plurality of monitor light emitting elements. The power supply line <b>113</b> which is connected to electrodes of the plurality of monitor light emitting elements can have a function to monitor a change in potential of the electrodes. Moreover, the constant current source <b>105</b> is only required to have a function to supply a constant current to the power supply line <b>113</b>. Further, the monitor circuit <b>64</b> may have a second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b>, a second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> and a second inverter <b>116</b> which are connected in parallel to the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b>, the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the first inverter <b>112</b>, with a common power source similarly to the pixel <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> is formed in the same step with the same conditions so as to have the same configuration as the first light emitting element <b>13</b>. Therefore, the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the first light emitting element <b>13</b> have the same or almost the same characteristics against a change in an environmental temperature and deterioration with time. The first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> is connected to the power source <b>18</b>. Here, the power source connected to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the power source connected to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> have the same potentials; therefore, they are expressed as the power source <b>18</b> with the same reference numeral. It is to be noted in this embodiment mode that the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> has p-channel conductivity, however, the invention is not limited to this and the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> may have an n-channel conductivity as well. In that case, a circuit configuration in the periphery is appropriately changed. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>, the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b>, and the second inverter <b>116</b> are similar to the aforementioned. The second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> is formed in the same step with the same conditions so as to have the same configuration as the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. Therefore, the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> have the same or almost the same characteristics against a change in an environmental temperature and deterioration with time. The second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> is connected to the power source <b>18</b>. Here, the power source connected to the second light emitting element <b>14</b> and the power source connected to the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> have the same potentials; therefore, they are expressed as the power source <b>18</b> with the same reference numeral. It is to be noted in this embodiment mode that the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> has p-channel conductivity, however, the invention is not limited to this and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> may have an n-channel conductivity as well. In that case, a circuit configuration in the periphery is appropriately changed. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> A position to provide the monitor circuit <b>64</b> is not limited, and it may be provided between the signal line driver circuit <b>43</b> and the pixel portion <b>40</b> or between the first or the second scan line driver circuit <b>41</b> or <b>42</b> and the pixel portion <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> A buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> is provided between the monitor circuit <b>64</b> and the pixel portion <b>40</b>. The buffer amplifier circuit has such features that an input and an output have the same potentials, with high input impedance and high output current capacitance. Therefore, a circuit configuration can be appropriately determined as long as the circuit has such features. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> In such a configuration, the buffer amplifier circuit has a function to change a voltage applied to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> included in the pixel portion <b>40</b> in accordance with a change in potential of one electrode of each of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> In such a configuration, the constant current source <b>105</b> and the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> in a control circuit <b>100</b> may be provided over the same insulating substrate <b>20</b> or different substrates. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> In the aforementioned configuration, a constant current is supplied from the constant current source <b>105</b> to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>. When an environmental temperature changes or deterioration with time occurs in such a state, the resistance of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> change. For example, when deterioration with time occurs, the resistance of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> increase. As a result, potential differences between opposite ends of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> change since current values supplied to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> are constant. In specific, potential differences between opposite electrodes of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> change. At this time, a potential of the electrode connected to the power source <b>18</b> is fixed, therefore, a potential of an electrode connected to the constant current source <b>105</b> changes. This change in potential of the electrode is supplied to the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> through the power supply line <b>113</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> In other words, a change in potential of the aforementioned electrode is inputted to the input terminal of the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b>. Moreover, a potential outputted from the output terminal of the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> is supplied to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> through the first driving transistor <b>12</b> and the second driving transistor <b>114</b>. In specific, the outputted potential is given as a potential of one electrode of the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> In this manner, changes of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> caused by an environmental temperature change and deterioration with time are fed back to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. As a result, the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> can emit light at luminance in accordance with the environmental temperature change and deterioration with time. Therefore, a display device which can perform display independent of an environmental temperature change and deterioration with time can be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Further, as a plurality of the first monitor light emitting elements <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting elements <b>166</b> are provided, these potential changes can be averaged and supplied to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. That is, in the invention, it is preferable to provide a plurality of the first monitor light emitting elements <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting elements <b>166</b> since potential changes can be averaged. Further, by providing a plurality of the first monitor light emitting elements <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting elements <b>166</b>, one monitor light emitting element can be a substitute for a shorted monitor light emitting element. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> It is preferable to provide the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b> in addition to the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> connected to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> respectively. These inverters are provided in consideration of an operation defect of the monitor circuit <b>64</b> caused by a defect (including an initial defect or a defect occurring with time) of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>. For example, in the case where the constant current source <b>105</b> and the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> are connected without any other transistors or the like, an anode and a cathode of a certain first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and a certain second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> are shorted (short-circuit) among a plurality of monitor light emitting elements due to a defect in a manufacturing step or the like. Then, a current supplied from the constant current source <b>105</b> is supplied more to the shorted first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the shorted second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> through the power supply line <b>113</b>. As the plurality of monitor light emitting elements are connected in parallel, if more current is supplied to the shorted first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the shorted second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>, a predetermined constant current is not supplied to the other monitor light emitting elements. As a result, an appropriate potential change of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> cannot be supplied to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> A short-circuit of the monitor light emitting element means that an anode and a cathode of the monitor light emitting element have the same potentials. For example, a short-circuit could occur due to a dust or the like between an anode and a cathode in the manufacturing step. Moreover, in addition to the short-circuit between the anode and the cathode, the monitor light emitting element could be shorted due to a short-circuit between a scan line and an anode, or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In view of this, in this embodiment mode, the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b> are provided in addition to the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b>. The first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> block a current supply to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> in order to prevent a large amount of current supply due to a short-circuit or the like of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> as described above. That is, a shorted monitor light emitting element and a monitor line are electrically cut off. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> The first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b> have a function to output a potential to turn off a monitor controlling transistor when any of the plurality of monitor light emitting elements is shorted. In addition, the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b> have a function to turn on the monitor controlling transistor when none of the plurality of monitor light emitting elements is shorted. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> A specific operation of the monitor circuit <b>64</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, when an electrode on a high potential side of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> is an anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>and an electrode on a low potential side is a cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c, </i>the anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>is connected to an input terminal of the first inverter <b>112</b> and the cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c </i>is connected to the power source <b>18</b> and has a fixed potential. Therefore, when an anode and a cathode of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> are shorted, a potential of the anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>becomes close to that of the cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c. </i>As a result, a low potential close to the potential of the cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c </i>is supplied to the first inverter <b>112</b>, therefore, a p-channel transistor <b>112</b><i>p </i>included in the first inverter <b>112</b> is turned on. Then, a potential (Va) on a high potential side is outputted from the first inverter <b>112</b> and applied as a gate potential of the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b>. That is, the potential inputted to the gate of the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> becomes Va and the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> is turned off. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Similarly, when an electrode on a high potential side of the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> is an anode electrode <b>166</b><i>a </i>and an electrode on a low potential side is a cathode electrode <b>166</b><i>c, </i>the anode electrode <b>166</b><i>a </i>is connected to an input terminal of the second inverter <b>116</b> and the cathode electrode <b>166</b><i>c </i>is connected to the power source <b>18</b> and has a fixed potential. Therefore, when an anode and a cathode of the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> are shorted, a potential of the anode electrode <b>166</b><i>a </i>becomes close to that of the cathode electrode <b>166</b><i>c. </i>As a result, a low potential close to the potential of the cathode electrode <b>166</b><i>c </i>is supplied to the second inverter <b>116</b>, therefore, a p-channel transistor <b>116</b><i>p </i>included in the second inverter <b>116</b> is turned on. Then, a potential (Va) on a high potential side is outputted from the second inverter <b>116</b> and applied as a gate potential of the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b>. That is, the potential inputted to the gate of the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> becomes Va and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> is turned off. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> It is to be noted that VDD to be a high potential (High) is set equal to or higher than an anode potential. Moreover, a low potential (Low) of the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b>, a potential of the power source <b>18</b>, a potential on a low side of the power supply line <b>113</b>, and a potential on a low side applied to Va can be all set equal. In general, the low side potential is set at ground. However, the invention is not limited to this and the low side potential may be determined so as to have a predetermined potential difference from a high side potential. The predetermined potential difference may be determined depending on a current, a voltage, luminance characteristics of a light emission material or the specifications of a device. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> Here, an order to supply a constant current to the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> is required to be paid attention to. A constant current is required to start to be supplied to the power supply line <b>113</b> when the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> are on. In this embodiment mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a current starts to be supplied to the power supply line <b>113</b> with Va remaining Low. After the potential of the power supply line <b>113</b> is saturated, Va is set to be VDD. As a result, a capacitor and parasitic capacitance attached to the power supply line <b>113</b> can be charged even when the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> are on. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Meanwhile, in the case where the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> are not shorted, potentials of the anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>and the anode electrode <b>166</b><i>a </i>are supplied to the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b>. Therefore, n-channel transistors <b>112</b><i>n </i>and <b>116</b><i>n </i>are turned on. As a result, a potential on a low potential side is outputted from the first inverter <b>112</b> and the second inverter <b>116</b>, thereby the first monitor controlling transistor <b>111</b> and the second monitor controlling transistor <b>115</b> are turned on. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> In this manner, a current supply from the constant current source <b>105</b> to a shorted monitor light emitting element can be blocked. Therefore, when a monitor light emitting element is shorted in the case where there are a plurality of monitor light emitting elements, by blocking a current supply to the shorted monitor light emitting element, a potential change of the power supply line <b>113</b> can be suppressed to be the least. As a result, an appropriate potential change of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> can be supplied to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> It is to be noted in this embodiment mode that the constant current source <b>105</b> is only required to be a circuit which can supply a constant current. For example, the constant current source <b>105</b> can be formed of a transistor. In this embodiment mode, a monitor circuit <b>64</b> includes a plurality of monitor light emitting elements, monitor controlling transistors, and inverters; however, the invention is not limited to this. For example, the inverter may be any circuit which has a function to block a current supply to a shorted monitor light emitting element through a monitor line when detecting a short-circuit of the monitor light emitting element. In specific, a function to turn off the monitor controlling transistor for blocking a current supply to the shorted monitor light emitting element is only required. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> Further, in this embodiment mode, a plurality of monitor light emitting elements are used. In this case, even when one of the monitor elements generates an operation defect, other operating monitor elements can monitor characteristics change of light emitting elements due to an environmental temperature change and deterioration with time; thereby the luminance of the light emitting element in the pixel <b>10</b> can be corrected. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> In this embodiment mode, the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> is provided for preventing a potential change. Therefore, another circuit capable of preventing a potential change may be used instead of the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b>. That is, in the case of providing a circuit for preventing a potential change between the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b>, and the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> when applying the potential of one electrode of the first monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> and the second monitor light emitting element <b>166</b> to the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> respectively, such a circuit is not limited to the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> and a circuit with any configuration such as an operational amplifier circuit may be used. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Here, in this embodiment mode, other circuit configurations are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has the same arrangement of elements in each of the pixels <b>10</b> and the monitor circuit <b>64</b> as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, a power source is connected differently from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, a power supply line <b>117</b> is provided in addition to the power supply line <b>113</b> which is used in common in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that each subpixel can be driven with an independent power source. In this manner, in this embodiment mode, a power supply line may be independently connected for each subpixel. In that case, each power source may independently have the constant current source <b>105</b> and the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> In this manner, providing a power supply line, and the constant current source <b>105</b> and the buffer amplifier circuit <b>110</b> in a control circuit <b>200</b>, which are connected to the power supply line in each subpixel is advantageous in that a current value supplied to the monitor element can be set for each subpixel, thereby the precision of correction can be improved. In the case of performing an area grayscale display by using a subpixel as described in this embodiment mode, characteristics of the first light emitting element <b>13</b> and the second light emitting element <b>14</b> can be set different. For example, when the luminance of a light emitting element of one subpixel becomes twice as high as the other subpixel in the case where the same voltage is applied to the both subpixels, four grayscales with a luminance ratio of 0, 1, 2, and 3 can be displayed without changing a driving voltage or a light emission duty. In this manner, when the characteristics of the light emitting element in each subpixel are different, the characteristics do not always change in the same way by deterioration and temperature. Therefore, the change in characteristics of a combination of elements with different characteristics become quite complicated.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> A reverse bias voltage can be applied to a light emitting element and a monitor light emitting element. In this embodiment mode, description is made of the case of applying a reverse bias voltage. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> When a voltage applied so that the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> emit light is called a forward voltage, a reverse bias voltage is a voltage obtained by inverting a high side potential and a low side potential of the forward voltage. In specific, in the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b>, the potential of the power supply line <b>113</b> is set lower than the potential of the power source <b>18</b> so as to invert the potentials of the anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>and the cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> In specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the potential of the anode electrode <b>66</b><i>a </i>(anode potential: Va) and the potential of the cathode electrode <b>66</b><i>c </i>(cathode potential: Vc) are set at Low potentials. At this time, the potential of the power supply line <b>113</b> (V<b>113</b>) is inverted at the same time. A period in which the anode potential and the cathode potential are inverted is called a reverse bias voltage applying period. Then, the cathode potential is brought back after a predetermined reverse bias voltage applying period passes and a certain current is supplied through the power supply line <b>113</b>, thereby charging is completed. That is, after the voltage is saturated, the potential is brought back. At this time, the potential of the power supply line <b>113</b> is brought back in a curved shape because a constant current is used for charging a plurality of the monitor light emitting elements and further the parasitic capacitance. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> It is preferable to invert an anode potential prior to inverting a cathode potential. Then, after a predetermined reverse bias voltage applying period passes, the anode potential is brought back and then the cathode potential is brought back.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> As a result of applying a reverse bias voltage to the light emitting element, defective states of the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> can be improved, which leads to improved reliability. Moreover, an initial defect may occur in the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> in that an anode and a cathode are shorted due to a foreign substance, a pinhole caused by a minute projection of the anode or the cathode or unevenness of a light emitting layer. Such an initial defect prevents light emission and non-light emission in accordance with signals, and most of the current flows to the shorted element. As a result, display of an image cannot be performed favorably. Moreover, this defect may occur in an arbitrary pixel. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> When a reverse bias voltage is applied to the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> as in this embodiment mode, a current flows locally to a shorted portion, thereby the shorted portion generates heat and can be oxidized or carbonized. Consequently, the shorted portion can be insulated. A current flows to other regions than the insulated portion, and the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> can operate normally. By applying a reverse bias voltage in this manner, an initial defect can be fixed if generated. It is to be noted that such a short-circuit portion is preferably insulated before shipment. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> Moreover, not only an initial defect, but an anode and a cathode may be newly shorted as time passes. Such a defect is also called a progressive defect. In view of this, as in this invention, a reverse bias voltage is applied to the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> regularly. As a result, a progressive defect can be fixed if generated. Thus, the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> can operate normally. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In addition, by applying a reverse bias voltage, image sticking can be prevented. Image sticking is caused by the deterioration of the light emitting element <b>13</b>. The deterioration can be lowered by applying a reverse bias voltage. As a result, image sticking can be prevented. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> In general, the deterioration of the light emitting element <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting element <b>66</b> progresses at a faster rate in the initial period, and the progress rate thereof decreases with time.

In view of this, all the light emitting elements <b>13</b> and the monitor light emitting elements <b>66</b> may emit light before shipment, when displaying no image, or the like. By generating deterioration in a pixel which has not deteriorated in this manner, the deterioration levels of all the pixels can be averaged.

Other erasing operations and writing operations, and signals are specifically described in the following embodiment mode.

When the insulating film <b>31</b> is formed by using an organic material to improve uniformity, the surface uniformity on which the pixel electrode is formed is improved, which allows a constant voltage to be applied and prevents a short-circuit. </p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"> Unwanted coupling capacitance may occur in the area <b>430</b> where the first conductive film overlaps the pixel electrode <b>19</b>. This is unwanted coupling capacitance. </p>

The structure of the light emitting layer <b>33</b> is not limited to the aforementioned stacked-layer structure. </p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"> As a host material for forming the light emitting layer <b>33</b>, an inorganic material can be used.

That is to say, it is not necessary to apply high voltage to a light emitting element, therefore, the light emitting element which can operate with a low driving voltage can be obtained. Moreover, because the light emitting element can emit light with a low driving voltage, power consumption can be reduced. Moreover, the element which becomes another light emission center may further be included. </p>

Moreover, it is preferable that the concentration of the second impurity element be 0.05 to 5 atom % in the host material. Moreover, it is preferable that the concentration of the third impurity element be 0.05 to 5 atom % in the host material. A light emitting material with such a structure can emit light with a low voltage. Therefore, a light emitting element which can emit light with a low driving voltage with reduced power consumption can be obtained.

<p id="p-0233" num="0232"> With a semiconductor integrated device formed of amorphous silicon, it is difficult to form what is called a CMOS circuit where transistors with different conductivity are integrated because of its manufacturing steps. Even if possible, the manufacturing steps inevitably become complicated as compared to the case of forming only transistors with single conductivity.

In the case of designing a semiconductor integrated device formed of amorphous silicon, it is required to consider constituting a circuit using only transistors with single conductivity. </p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233"> A transistor formed of amorphous silicon is different from a transistor formed of bulk silicon or polysilicon in that it deteriorates with time, in particular, a threshold value increases faster by continuing operation. It is a major factor of the increase in threshold value that a charge trapped in a gate insulating film increases and defect density of a channel portion becomes high when a positive voltage keeps being applied to a gate electrode of the transistor. In order to suppress these phenomena and suppress a threshold value shift of the transistor, for example, there is a method to provide a period to apply a negative voltage to the gate electrode. </p>

When the pixel is selected, the potential of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>2800</b> becomes low and the potential of the source or drain electrode becomes higher than that. Therefore, the transistor <b>2800</b> is turned off. When the pixel is selected, data is written, and the transistor <b>2800</b> does not disturb the writing operation.
