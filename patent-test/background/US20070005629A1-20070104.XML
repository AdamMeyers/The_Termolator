<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to a program recording apparatus for recording and reproducing a program, and specifically, to a technology for generating a title list of the recorded programs. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Program recording apparatuses allow the users to record broadcast programs therein and play back the recorded programs at their free time or the like. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The users can record more broadcast programs than before due to the lately started digital broadcasting that broadcast programs on a number of channels using digital broadcast waves, and due to the prevalence of program recording apparatuses having a higher-capacity recording medium. The increase in the number of programs the users can record makes it difficult for the users to select a program to watch among a lot of recorded programs. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> This problem is addressed by a technology in which a program recording apparatus automatically creates a title list that includes titles of recorded programs. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> However, only a limited number of characters can be used to generate a title to be contained in the title list. Generally, the title list is composed of sequences of a predetermined number of characters that have each been extracted from the beginning of a corresponding program title. Accordingly, when a group of programs (hereinafter, referred to as a program series) composed of a plurality of programs that each have a same main title and a different sub title is recorded, all titles contained in the title list created for the recorded program series may be the same, namely, they may be the same main title. Such a title list is useless since it makes it difficult for the users, who try to select a program for viewing, to identify the programs in the program series. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a program list generating apparatus that facilitates the user's selection of a program that the user desires to view, even in the case of recording a program series. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The above object of the present invention is fulfilled by a program list generating apparatus for generating a program list, comprising: an acquiring unit operable to acquire a first title being a title of a first program; an extracting unit operable to extract a first difference from the first title, the first difference being a portion of the first title and not being contained in a second title being a title of a second program; and a program list generating unit operable to generate the program list based on the first difference extracted by the extracting unit. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> With the above-stated construction, the generated program list includes the first difference that is a portion of the first title and is not contained in the second title. This enables the user to recognize the first title when referring to the program list. More specifically, suppose that the first and second programs belong to a same program series, and the first and second titles have a same main title and a different sub title. Even in such a case, the user can easily select a program that the user desires to view since the program list shows only the sub titles. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In the above-described program list generating apparatus, the acquiring unit may acquire the first and second titles from a program guide which shows information of a plurality of programs, and the extracting unit extracts the first difference by removing, from the first title, one or more characters that are contained in both the first and second titles. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> With the above-stated construction, the user does not need to enter the title since the program list generating apparatus acquire the first and second titles from the program guide. Furthermore, the program list generating apparatus extracts the first difference with reliability since it removes a same character sequence contained in the first and second titles in common, from the first title. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In the above-described program list generating apparatus, the extracting unit may further extract a character sequence having a predetermined length from the first difference, and the program list generating unit generates the program list, which contains the character sequence having the predetermined length extracted by the extracting unit. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a unique program list that does not depend on, for example, a format set in a recording medium. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In the above-described program list generating apparatus, the extracting unit may prestore information indicating a number of bytes that corresponds to the predetermined length, and extracts, from the first difference, the character sequence having the number of bytes indicated by the information. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a program list that displays program titles having a predetermined length that is uniquely set for the program list generating apparatus, without depending on, for example, a format set in a recording medium. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In the above-described program list generating apparatus, if a character sequence constituting the first difference is shorter than the character sequence having the number of bytes, the extracting unit combines part or all of the one or more characters with part or all of the character sequence constituting the first difference to generate a combination character sequence having the number of bytes indicated by the information, and the program list generating unit generates the program list, which contains the combination character sequence generated by the extracting unit. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> With the above-stated construction, even if the first difference is shorter than the predetermined length, the maximum number of characters can be extracted for display. This makes the program list more convenient for the user who selects a program to view referring to the program list. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may further comprise: a receiving unit operable to receive the first program; and a recording unit operable to record the received first program into a recording medium in conformity with a first recording format, wherein the extracting unit extracts, from the first difference, the character sequence having the predetermined length, which corresponds to the first recording format. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> In the above-described program list generating apparatus, the recording unit may select the first recording format among a plurality of recording formats that respectively correspond to a plurality of types of recording mediums, and records the first program into the recording medium in conformity with the first recording format, and the extracting unit prestores information that indicates a correspondence between the plurality of recording formats and one or more lengths, and extracts, from the first difference, a character sequence having a length that corresponds to the first recording format. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a program list that conforms to the recording format, without depending on, for example, a format set in a recording medium. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may be connected to a monitor, wherein the character sequence, which is extracted from the first difference by the extracting unit, conforms to a display format of the program list on the monitor. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may further comprise: a display format receiving-unit operable to receive a display format of the program list on the monitor, wherein the extracting unit prestores information that indicates a correspondence between the plurality of display formats and one or more lengths for each of a plurality of display formats, and extracts, from the first difference, a character sequence having a length that corresponds to the display format received by the display format receiving unit. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a program list in accordance with the customization of the GUI design, without depending on, for example, a format set in a recording medium. Since the GUI design is selected by the user, this construction allows the program list generating apparatus to generate a program list that suits the user's taste. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may be connected to a monitor, wherein the character sequence extracted by the extracting unit conforms to an attribute of the monitor. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may further comprise: a monitor information acquiring unit operable to acquire monitor information indicating a resolution of the monitor, from the monitor, wherein </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> the extracting unit prestores information that indicates a correspondence between a plurality of resolutions and one or more lengths, and extracts, from the first difference, a character sequence having a length that corresponds to the resolution indicated by the monitor information acquired by the monitor information acquiring unit. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a program list in accordance with an attribute of the monitor, such as the resolution. This allows the program list generating apparatus to generate a program list that is easy for the user to watch. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may further comprise: a receiving unit operable to receive the first and second programs; and a recording unit operable to record the received first and second programs, wherein the extracting unit extracts the first difference from the first title, and extracts a second difference from the second title, the first and second differences being respectively portions of the first and second titles and being different from each other, and the program list generated by the program list generating unit contains the first and second differences. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus generates a title list composed of titles that are different from each other by extracting differences from the first and second titles of the first and second programs. This enables the user to identify the first and second programs by referring to the title list. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The above-described program list generating apparatus may further comprise: a program list outputting unit operable to output the generated program list to an external monitor connected to the program list generating apparatus; a program selection receiving unit operable to receive a selection of a program that is made by a user viewing the program list displayed on the monitor; and a program reproduction unit operable to output reproduction of the program selected by the user, to the monitor. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> With the above-stated construction, the program list generating apparatus displays the title list on the monitor, enabling the user to select a program that the user desires to reproduce, by referring to the displayed title list. When the first and second programs belong to a same program series, and the first and second titles have a same character sequence, the remaining portion of each title (difference) after removing the same character sequence is displayed in the title list. This enables the user to identify the first and second programs by referring to the title list.</p>

This indicates recording of a program of channel 4 that is broadcast from 11.45 a.m. to noon Monday through Friday. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> The preset information <b>123</b> is composed of a broadcast day &#x201c;October 22 (Wed)&#x201d;, a broadcast period &#x201c;20:00-21:00&#x201d;, and a channel number &#x201c;1&#x201d;. This indicates recording of a program of channel 1 that is broadcast from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on October 22, Wednesday. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> It should be noted here that hereinafter, the term &#x201c;program recording presetting&#x201d; refers to a recording presetting which is done using a piece of preset information that includes a broadcast day, namely a piece of preset information such as preset information <b>123</b> that specifies a program, and that the term &#x201c;series recording presetting&#x201d; refers to a recording presetting which is done using a piece of preset information including a broadcast pattern, namely a piece of preset information such as preset information <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> that corresponds to a plurality of programs. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> The control unit <b>105</b> refers to a latest EPG stored in the EPG storage unit <b>105</b><i>a </i>to judge for each piece of preset information written in the preset table <b>120</b> whether the contents of the preset information matches information written in the latest EPG. For example, the broadcast period written in the preset information may be different from the broadcast period written in the latest EPG when a sports relay broadcast is extended, when an urgent news is broadcast, or when a first or final episode of a drama series is broadcast longer than normal. In such a case, <b>105</b> replaces the broadcast period written in the preset information with the broadcast period written in the latest EPG. The control unit <b>105</b> may perform the above-described judgment and replacement each time a latest EPG is acquired. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> After the above-described operation, the control unit <b>105</b> instructs the tuner <b>102</b> to select a channel based on the preset information, and instructs the signal processing unit <b>103</b> to output program data to the recording unit <b>106</b>. </p>

<p id="p-0210" num="0209"> As stated earlier, the present invention relates to a program recording apparatus for recording programs and generating a title list of the recorded programs. </p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210"> The present invention is not limited to the program recording apparatus <b>100</b> or the program recording apparatus <b>200</b> described above as specific examples, but may be modified as follows. </p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211"> (1) In the above-described embodiment, the program recording apparatus <b>100</b> generates a title having a predetermined number of bytes, and the program recording apparatus <b>200</b> generates a title having bytes less than the maximum number of bytes that is determined in advance for each recording format. However, the length of the title (the number of bytes) to be displayed in the title list may be determined in accordance with the customized GUI design. </p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212"> For example, the program recording apparatus may store a GUI customization program. The GUI customization program is a computer program that receives a GUI design selected by the user, and achieves the selected GUI design. Suppose, as an example, that the user can select either of &#x201c;Child GUI&#x201d; and &#x201c;Adult GUI&#x201d; as the GUI design. </p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flowchart showing part of the operation by the program recording apparatus in executing the GUI customization program. The operation described here is an operation in which the program recording apparatus records a program series, and generates title information of the recorded program. </p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"> The program recording apparatus receives a selection of GUI design (step S<b>301</b>). If the selected GUI design is &#x201c;Adult GUI&#x201d; (&#x201c;ADULT&#x201d; in step S<b>302</b>), the program recording apparatus deletes a common character sequence from a title of the program series, and extracts 32 bytes from the remaining portion of the title (step S<b>303</b>), and goes to step S<b>306</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215"> If the selected GUI design is &#x201c;Child GUI&#x201d; (&#x201c;CHILD&#x201d; in step S<b>302</b>), the program recording apparatus deletes a common character sequence from a title of the program series, and extracts 16 bytes from the remaining portion of the title (step S<b>304</b>). The program recording apparatus then enlarges the font of the extracted title in width and height (step S<b>305</b>). That is to say, after this enlargement, the font of &#x201c;Child GUI&#x201d; is larger than &#x201c;Adult GUI&#x201d; in width and height. The program recording apparatus then generates a piece of title information that includes the broadcast date/time, the channel number, and the extracted title (step S<b>306</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216"> A title list <b>291</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> is generated when &#x201c;Child GUI&#x201d; is selected. A title list <b>292</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> is generated when &#x201c;Adult GUI&#x201d; is selected. The title list <b>291</b> has larger font size and fewer characters than the title list <b>292</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217"> It should be noted here that each type of GUI design may be different from each other not only in width and height of the font, but in the font type, and that a plurality of types of GUI designs may be used, not limited to two as in &#x201c;Child GUI&#x201d; and &#x201c;Adult GUI&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218"> If a GUI customization program is stored in a DVD-RAM or BD-RE, programs may be recorded in the DVD-RAM or BD-RE. Then, when the title list is generated for the programs recorded in the DVD-RAM or BD-RE, the program recording apparatus may read the GUI customization program from the DVD-RAM or BD-RE and execute it, and determine the number of bytes of the title to be displayed in the title list, in accordance with the GUI design selected by the user. </p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000"> (2) The program recording apparatus may determine the number of bytes of the title to be displayed in the title list, in accordance with the attribute of the TV to which the apparatus is connected. </p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219"> More specifically, the program recording apparatus stores, in advance, the attributes of the TV and the number of bytes in correspondence with each other. </p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220"> For example, the digital TV is correlated with 32 bytes, and the analog TV is correlated with 16 bytes. The program recording apparatus, when it is connected to a TV, acquires, from the TV, identification information for identifying the attribute of the TV. The program recording apparatus then extracts 32 bytes from each title shown in the EPG if the identification information indicates that the TV is a digital TV, and extracts 16 bytes from each title shown in the EPG if the identification information indicates that the TV is an analog TV. </p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221"> The program recording apparatus may store not only information of the number of bytes, but information of the font size or font type in correspondence with the attributes of TV, and generate title information in accordance with the stored information. </p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222"> (3) In the above-described embodiment or modifications, the program recording apparatus extracts a predetermined number of bytes from a title shown in the EPG if the title has more bytes than the maximum number of bytes that can be used for displaying the title in the title list, and discards the rest of the title. However, the present invention is applicable to a case where the rest of the title is not discarded, but is stored in a specific storage area. </p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223"> In this case, upon receiving a request from the user, the program recording apparatus restores the original title of the program by combining information of a predetermined number of bytes, which is included in the title information, with information stored in the specific storage area. This enables the user to edit or process the title list. </p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224"> (4) In the above-described modification, the maximum number of bytes (the table <b>270</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), which the program recording apparatus holds for each recording medium, may not necessarily match, or may exceed, the number of bytes that is permitted by the format of the recording medium itself. </p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225"> For example, according to the table <b>270</b>, each title contained in the title information for the programs recorded in BD-RE can have 40 bytes at the maximum.

The control unit <b>305</b> includes an EPG storage unit <b>305</b><i>a </i>and a recommendation list generating unit <b>305</b><i>b</i>. The reproduction unit <b>307</b> is connected to an external TV <b>310</b>. The TV <b>310</b> includes a monitor <b>310</b><i>a </i>and a speaker <b>310</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230"> The program recording apparatus <b>300</b> is more specifically a computer including a microprocessor, a ROM, a RAM, a hard disk drive unit and the like. It is supposed here that the program recording apparatus <b>300</b> is a hard disk recorder for receiving broadcast programs that are broadcast on digital broadcast waves, recording the received broadcast programs onto an embedded hard disk, and reproducing the recorded broadcast programs. </p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231"> The antenna <b>301</b>, tuner <b>302</b>, signal processing unit <b>303</b>, operation input unit <b>304</b>, recording unit <b>306</b>, reproduction unit <b>307</b>, storage unit <b>308</b>, and remote controller <b>309</b> of the program recording apparatus <b>300</b> have the same functions as the antenna <b>101</b>, tuner <b>102</b>, signal processing unit <b>103</b>, operation input unit <b>104</b>, recording unit <b>106</b>, reproduction unit <b>107</b>, storage unit <b>108</b>, and remote controller <b>109</b> of the program recording apparatus <b>100</b>, and their detailed explanation is omitted here, and the following description focuses on differences from the program recording apparatus <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232"> The program recording apparatus <b>300</b> acquires the EPG from the received broadcast data, retrieves new programs from the EPG, and records each broadcast of the new programs starting with their first broadcast. The program recording apparatus <b>300</b> generates a title list for new programs and rerun programs having been recorded, shows the generated title list, and receives a selection from the user. In the present embodiment, it is presumed that the EPG includes information regarding programs to be broadcast after the date and time at which the EPG was transmitted. </p>

It is presumed here that the EPG <b>320</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, is stored as the latest EPG in the EPG storage unit <b>305</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234"> The EPG <b>320</b> includes a plurality of pieces of program information each of which includes a broadcast day, a broadcast period, a channel number, a title, and a comment. It should be noted here that the mark &#x201c;new&#x201d; put before the title of a program indicates that the program is a new program. </p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235"> The control unit <b>305</b> reads the EPG <b>320</b> from the EPG storage unit <b>305</b><i>a</i>, and refers to the column &#x201c;title&#x201d; to retrieve programs to which the mark &#x201c;new&#x201d; is attached. In this example, the control unit <b>305</b> retrieves &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; to be broadcast from 9 p.m. on August 13 (Sat) on Channel 8 and &#x201c;Trip To World Heritage Sites&#x201d; to be broadcast from 8 p.m. on August 14 (Sun) on Channel 4. </p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236"> After retrieving a program with the mark &#x201c;new&#x201d;, the control unit <b>305</b> retrieves, from the EPG <b>320</b>, programs having the same title as the program, and detects a broadcast pattern of the program. For example, it is detected that a program &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; is broadcast from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. every Saturday on Channel 8. Having detected the broadcast pattern, the control unit <b>305</b> generates a piece of preset information, and writes it into the preset table. Description of the preset information and the preset table is omitted here since they are the same as those described in Embodiment 1. </p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237"> The control unit <b>305</b> instructs the tuner <b>302</b> to select a channel based on the preset information, and instructs the signal processing unit <b>303</b> to output program data to the recording unit <b>306</b>.

In this example, the comparison reveals that the three rerun programs have the same title and comment, and therefore the control unit <b>305</b> judges that the three rerun programs belong to the same program series. When it detects a program series, the control unit <b>305</b> refers to the column &#x201c;broadcast day&#x201d; of the EPG <b>330</b> and detects a broadcast pattern of the program series and the broadcast day on which the first episode of the rerun program is broadcast. </p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246"> The control unit <b>305</b>, in the present example, detects from the EPG <b>330</b> that the broadcast pattern of &#x201c;Autumn Wind Sonata&#x201d; is Monday through Friday. Further, the control unit <b>305</b> judges that the first episode of the rerun of &#x201c;Autumn Wind Sonata&#x201d; is broadcast on December 10 (Tue), from the fact that another program &#x201c;It's Four O'clock&#x201d; is to be broadcast for the same period and on the same channel as &#x201c;Autumn Wind Sonata&#x201d; before December 10 (Tue). </p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247"> Having detected the broadcast pattern and the broadcast day of the first episode, the control unit <b>305</b> generates a piece of preset information including the broadcast pattern, broadcast period, channel number, and recording start day, and writes the generated piece of preset information into the preset table. </p>

The control unit <b>305</b> then refers to the EPG to detect the broadcast pattern of the program series, and generate the preset information (step S<b>406</b>). The control unit <b>305</b>, the <b>304</b>, and the <b>306</b> record the program series in accordance with the preset information (step S<b>407</b>). The program information of the program that was recorded in step S<b>407</b> is generated, and a recommendation list is generated from the generated program information (step S<b>408</b>). </p>

<p id="h-0037" num="0000"> &#x3c;Modification&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258"> Here, a program recording apparatus, which is a modification of Embodiment 2 and generates a recommendation list for convenience of the user when the titles of a program series are each composed of a main title and a sub title, will be explained. </p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259"> The construction of the program recording apparatus is not illustrated since it is the same as that of the program recording apparatus <b>300</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260"> Suppose, for example, that the program recording apparatus records a program series and generates a recommendation list based on the EPG <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>. The titles of the program series &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; are each composed of a main title and a sub title, different from the titles shown in the EPG <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The title of the first episode is &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (1) Encounter&#x201d;, the title of the second episode is &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (2) A Lie Of Her&#x201d;, and the title of the third episode is &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (3) A Lie Of Me&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261"> The following explanation focuses on how the program recording apparatus generates the title information for the second episode of the program series. The program recording apparatus extracts the title of the second episode &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (2) A Lie Of Her&#x201d; from the EPG <b>410</b>, and further extracts &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (1) Encounter&#x201d; which is the title of the first episode that is broadcast a week before, or extracts &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (3) A Lie Of Me&#x201d; which is the title of the third episode that is broadcast a week after. Here, it is presumed, as an example, that the program recording apparatus extracts &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (3) A Lie Of Me&#x201d; which is the title of the third episode. </p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262"> The program recording apparatus compares the titles &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (2) A Lie Of Her&#x201d; and &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata (3) A Lie Of Me&#x201d; and judges whether the two titles have a same character sequence at the beginning of the titles. In this example, both titles contain &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; at the beginning thereof. Therefore, the program recording apparatus removes &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; and extracts &#x201c;(2) A Lie Of Her&#x201d; from the title of the second episode. </p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263"> The program recording apparatus then generates a piece of title information that includes broadcast date/time &#x201c;8/13 21:00&#x201d;, a mark &#x201c;LONG&#x201d; that indicates an extension of the broadcast period, channel number &#x201c;8&#x201d;, and the extracted title &#x201c;(2) A Lie Of Her&#x201d;. The program recording apparatus writes the generated piece of title information into the recommendation list. The program recording apparatus adds the removed common character sequence &#x201c;Midsummer Sonata&#x201d; to the title of the recommendation list. </p>

However, not limited to this, the program recording apparatus of the present invention may retrieve program series other than the new or rerun program series. Also, the program recording apparatus may not necessarily retrieve both of new and rerun program series, but may retrieve one of them from the EPG. For example, the program recording apparatus may retrieve program series using a retrieval algorithm that is different for each broadcasting station. This will be explained more specifically using an example. </p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275"> As is the case with the above embodiment, the EPG includes a plurality of pieces of program information each of which includes a broadcast date/time, a channel number, a title, and a comment, where the plurality of pieces of program information are classified into groups corresponding to broadcasting stations that are identified by the broadcasting station codes. </p>

<p id="p-0296" num="0295"> With the above-stated construction in which the program recording apparatus retrieves information of a program series and records each program contained in the program series, the user is not required to enter a recording instruction into the program recording apparatus for each program that the user desires to record. Also, since the program recording apparatus records each program contained in the program series, the program recording apparatus prevents the user from failing to record a program that the user desires to record by forgetting to enter the recording instruction for the program. </p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296"> In the above-described program recording apparatus, the series retrieving unit may store therein a plurality of retrieval algorithms, select one or more retrieval algorithms from the plurality of retrieval algorithms, and retrieve the program series in accordance with the selected one or more retrieval algorithms. </p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297"> With the above-stated construction in which the series retrieving unit stores therein a plurality of retrieval algorithms, it is possible to retrieve a variety of program series. </p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298"> In the above-described program recording apparatus, the series retrieving unit may select the one or more retrieval algorithms in accordance with a broadcasting station that broadcasts the program series. </p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299"> With the above-stated construction, it is possible to retrieve a program series more efficiently by specifying a retrieval algorithm based on the characteristics or the like of the broadcasting station. </p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300"> In the above-described program recording apparatus, the plurality of retrieval algorithms stored in the series retrieving unit may include an algorithm for retrieving new program information, which indicates a new program series, from the program guide, and the series recording unit generates recording presetting information that indicates receiving and recording each program contained in the new program series indicated by the retrieved new program information, and receives and records each program contained in the new program series by referring to the generated recording presetting information. </p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301"> With the above-stated construction, the program recording apparatus refers to the program guide and recognizes that a new program is broadcast, and records the new program. This eliminates the user's need to enter a recording instruction into the program recording apparatus for each program that the user desires to record. There are many users who fail to watch the first episode of a program series and lose all interest in watching the following episodes. However, the program recording apparatus of the present invention prevents the user from failing to watch the first episode of a program series since it never fails to record the first episode of the program series. </p>

<p id="p-0312" num="0311"> With the above-stated construction, the user does not need to enter the title since the program recording apparatus acquire the first and second titles from the program guide. Furthermore, the program recording apparatus extracts the first difference with reliability since it removes a same character sequence contained in the first and second titles in common, from the first title. </p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312"> In the above-described program recording apparatus, the extracting unit further extracts a character sequence having a predetermined number of bytes from the extracted first difference, and the program list generating unit generates the program list, which contains the character sequence having the predetermined number of bytes. </p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313"> With the above-stated construction, the program recording apparatus generates a unique program list that does not depend on, for example, a format set in a recording medium. </p>
