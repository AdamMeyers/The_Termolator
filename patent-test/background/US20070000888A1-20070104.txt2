The setup station 100 for a laser processing tool includes: a tool station 200 equipped with a tool change magazine for laser processing tools having a torch and a nozzle respectively and machining tools; and a nozzle station 300 equipped with a nozzle change magazine for nozzles of the laser processing tools. 
 FIGS. 8A-8C are the views to illustrate the configuration of a lower end portion of the processing head 50. The processing head 50 has a mounting section 510 at the lower end portion thereof to which a processing tool is exchangeably mounted. To both sides of the mounting section 510, a pair of clamping devices 520 are arranged. Each clamping device 520 has a piston 522 and wedge shaped pawls 524 which are operated by the piston 522. 
 FIG. 8A shows pawls 610 at the top of the laser processing tool 60, and the pawls 610 are controlled to be engaged or disengaged with cavities 512 in the mounting section 510 of the processing head 50 in the perpendicular direction. The piston 522 is in communication with an air flow path 530 on the side for unclamping tools and an air flow path 532 on the side for clamping tools. 
 FIG. 8B shows a state in which a tool 60 is clamped by supplying air through the air flow path 532 on the side for clamping tools so that the wedge shaped pawls 524 are drawing in to engage the pawls 610 of the laser processing tool 60. 
 FIG. 8C shows a state in which a tool 60 is clamped by supplying air through the air flow path 530 on the side for unclamping tools so that the piston 522 is forced out to cause the wedge shaped pawls 524 to disengage the pawls 610 of the tool 60. A spring for balancing 526 is provided to press the two wedge shaped pawls 524 against the pawls 610 of the tool with an even force. 
 The mounting section 510 of the processing head 50 has a bottom surface where the openings of an air flow path 551 for clamping a rod member which has a condenser lens of a laser processing tool, an air flow path 552 for unclamping the same, an air flow path 553 for lowering the condenser lens, and an assist gas flow path 554 are arranged. A connector 555 to a sensor table is also arranged in the bottom surface. 
 The processing head 50 according to the present invention includes the plurality of air flow paths described above and an assist gas flow path, and has a laser processing lens which can be automatically focused as will be described below. The present invention utilizes this mechanism to exchangeably mount a machining tool to a processing head and drive a rotating tool by an air turbine. Thus, a mechanism similar to the pawl at the upper end portion of a laser processing tool is also provided to the upper end portion of a machining tool. 
 FIGS. 9 to 14 are the views to illustrate the operations for mounting a laser processing tool 60 to a processing head of a laser processing machine. 
 In FIG. 9, a laser processing tool 60 includes a tool body 620 and a rod 630 which is mounted in the body 620 movable in the vertical direction, and a condenser lens 632 is provided in the rod 630. The rod 630 includes a cylinder section 632, and a piston 650 is arranged around the outer circumferential surface of cylinder section 632. When the piston 650 abuts on a wedge 640 on the side toward the rod 630, the rod 630 is clamped, and when the piston 650 is separated from the wedge 640, the rod 630 is unclamped. A stopper cylinder 560 provided on the side toward a processing head includes a piston 562 which extends and retracts relative to the cylinder 560. FIG. 9 shows an operation for attaching a laser processing tool 60 to a mounting section 510 of a processing head 50 by lowering the processing head 50 in the Z axis direction. 
 FIG. 10 shows a state in which air is supplied through a switching valve 551a from an air source 551b to an air flow path for clamping 551. When the air pushes up the pistons 650 in the laser processing tool 60, the pistons 650 abuts on the wedges 640 by pressure, which clamps the rod 630. This clamping air is also diverged to be sent into a line 551c for a stopper cylinder 560 to retract a stopper piston 562. In this state, the laser processing tool 60 is able to perform a normal laser processing. Here, an assist gas is supplied from an assist gas source 554b through an NC controlled electropneumatic regulator 554a and an assist gas flow path 554 to the laser processing tool 60. 
 Next, referring to FIGS. 11 to 13, operations for automatic focusing of a laser processing tool will be explained. 
 FIG. 11 shows a state in which air is supplied through the switching valve 551a from the air source 551b to an air flow path for unclamping 552. The piston 650 is pushed down by the air and is separated from the wedge 640 to unclamp the rod 630 relative to the body 620. The air is sent to the stopper cylinder 560 through a line 552c. The stopper piston 562 is pushed out by the air. 
 In the next operation, as shown in FIG. 12, the air is sent through an air check valve 553a of an air source 553b into an air flow path for lowering a lens 553. This air flows into a chamber 634 between the body 620 and the rod 630 to lower the rod 630 and the lens 632 along the Z axis to the lowest point. 
 In FIG. 13, the processing head 50 is lowered to an optional coordinate position along the Z axis in corresponding to an NC command. This operation defines an adjustable focal length G relative to the lens 632 and the body 620. This achieves an automatic focus adjustment of the condenser lens 632. 
 Then, the operation returns to the state of FIG. 10, and in the state, the air is sent to the clamping circuit 551 to clamp the rod 630 to the body 620 and retract the stopper piston. Here, an assist gas is supplied to resume a laser processing. 
 FIGS. 14A-14B are the views to illustrate the configuration of a machining tool used in the present invention. A machining tool, which is generally shown by reference numeral 70, has a body 720 with hooks 722 on outside surfaces thereof along its center line. The hooks 722 are used to hang the machining tool 70 in a magazine. Four pawls 710 are provided with at the upper end of the body 720 which engage with clamping pawls of a tool change device for the processing head. 
 A piston member 730 is disposed in the body 720, and a pressurizing chamber 784 is formed between the piston member 730 and the upper surface 724 of the body 720. In the piston member 730, an air motor 740 is equipped with. The output of the air motor 740 is controlled to be reduced by a reducer 750, and drives a tool chuck 760. To the tool chuck 760, for example a tap 762 for threaded holes is chucked. 
 Piston seals 734 are attached to the top and bottom of the outer circumference of the piston member 730. To the top of the piston member 730, a dumper 732 is also provided. A spring 770 is further provided between the bottom of the piston member 730 and the body 720 to bias the piston member 730 upward. A dumper 774 at the lowest end position of the piston member 730 provides cushioning. A switching valve 785 is provided at the upper portion of the air motor 740 to switch between a normal rotation and a reverse rotation of the air circuit. 
 The upper surface 724 of the body 720 has an opening of an air flow path 781 for the normal rotation of the air motor which is in communication with an air flow path for clamping rod, and an opening of an air flow path 782 for the reverse rotation of the air motor which is in communication with an air flow path for unclamping rod in using a laser processing tool. A path to supply an assist gas is connected to the flow path 783 in the body 720 for the pressurizing chamber 784. 
 FIG. 15 shows a state in which an assist gas having an adjusted pressure is sent into the pressurizing chamber 784 through the NC controlled electropneumatic regulator, and the gas causes the piston member 730 to be lowered against the spring 770. The tap 762 which is driven by the air motor 740 is projected out from the body 720 to perform a tapping operation to a work. 
 Now, referring to FIGS. 16-21, operations for machining with a machining tool 70 mounted to the processing head 50 will be explained. 
 In FIG. 16, the processing head 50 has a configuration similar to that in the description for the laser processing tool, so similar numerals are used to explain similar parts, and the processing head 50 will not be described or illustrated in detailed below. The processing head 50 is lowered in the Z axis direction toward a machining tool 70 which is displaced at a tool change position, and clamps the machining tool 70. 
 In FIG. 17, among the air flow paths in the mounting section 510 of the processing head, the circuit 551 for clamping the rod having a lens of a laser processing tool, and the circuit 552 for unclamping the same are used, and the circuit 553 for lowering the lens is not used. The assist gas flow path 554 is used to operate a cylinder member 730. 
 In FIG. 18, air is supplied from the air source 551b through the switching valve 551a to a circuit for clamping 551. The air through the circuit 781 of the machining tool 70 is sent into an air motor 740 and the reducer 750 by switching the switching valve 785 to rotate the tap 762 in a normal direction R1. 
 In this state, as shown in FIG. 19, an assist gas having an adjusted pressure is supplied from an assist gas source 554b through the NC controlled electropneumatic regulator 554a into an assist gas circuit 554. The assist gas is sent to the pressurizing chamber 784 to lower the cylinder member 730 against the spring 770. The tap 762 in a normal rotation contacts a work W1 and starts a tapping operation. Once the tapping operation is started, the tap 762 is threaded into the work W1 by its own operation for completion of the tapping. 
 After the tapping is completed, as shown in FIG. 20, air is supplied to an unclamping circuit 552. The air switches the switching valve 785 to rotate the air motor 740 into a reverse direction R2. The tap 762 rotates in the reverse direction to be out of the work W1. Here, the pressure of the assist gas in the pressurizing chamber 784 is balanced so that no excess thrust is applied to the tap 762. 
 After the tap 762 is out of the tapped hole T1 of the work W1, as shown in FIG. 21, the assist gas supply to the pressurizing chamber is stopped, and the piston member is raised to the highest position by the action of the spring 770, which returns the tap to the initial state. 
 FIGS. 22A-22B are the views to illustrate another example according to the present invention. In this example, a tool chuck 760 of a machining tool 70 is equipped with a milling or grinding tool 764 which performs a laser processing for forming a hole H1 in a work W1 supported on a supporting member K1. The dross D1 which is produced in the laser processing adheres to the wall of the hole H1 and solidifies there, which leads a deterioration in the processing accuracy of the hole H1. In this example, the milling or grinding tool 764 cuts or grinds off the dross D1 that adheres to the inside of the hole H1 to improve the processing accuracy of the hole H1. 
 FIGS. 23A-23B are the views to illustrate further another example according to the present invention. Some works W1 have mirror finished surfaces S1. In this case, the laser beam LB is reflected at such a mirror surface, which makes it difficult to perform a laser processing on the surface. In the device according to the present invention, a surface roughing tool such as a surface milling or surface grinding tool 766 and the like is equipped to the chuck 760 of the machining tool 70 to perform roughing to increase the roughness of the mirror surface S1. A surface Ss having a high surface roughness has a low degree of reflectance of the laser beam LB, so a processing such as for a piercing hole PH is easily performed, which improves the efficiency of the laser processing. 
 As described above, the present invention increases the types of processings and improves the efficiency of the processings because a laser processing tool and a machining tool can be automatically exchanged and mounted to a laser processing head to perform a laser processing and machining. 
 In the above examples, tool change magazines are arranged in a single line in a tool setup station 100 which is displaced at an end of the bed 10. The tool change magazines, however, may be arranged in a plurality of lines or in a matrix at other positions. The tool change magazines may be specially displaced in a plane (for example, the Z axis) which crosses a plane defined by the X axis and the Y axis, in addition to be displaced in the plane defined by the X axis and the Y axis. In addition, it is also possible to place the magazines at appropriate positions where they do not interfere with processing. 
 Also, in the above examples, a linear motor is used for driving along the X axis and the Y axis. However, the present invention may be applied to a case in which a ball screw is used for driving.
