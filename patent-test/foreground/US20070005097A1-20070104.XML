<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The invention relates generally to intravascular filters and methods of their formation. In particular, the invention relates to intravascular filters configured for improved vasculature interaction. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Heart and vascular disease are major problems in the United States and throughout the world. Conditions such as atherosclerosis result in blood vessels becoming blocked or narrowed. This blockage can result in lack of oxygenation of the heart, which has significant consequences since the heart muscle must be well oxygenated in order to maintain its blood pumping action. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Occluded, stenotic, or narrowed blood vessels may be treated with a number of relatively non-invasive medical procedures including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and atherectomy. Angioplasty techniques typically involve the use of a balloon catheter. The balloon catheter is advanced over a guidewire such that the balloon is positioned adjacent a stenotic lesion. The balloon is then inflated and the restriction of the vessel is opened. During an atherectomy procedure, the stenotic lesion may be mechanically cut away from the blood vessel wall using an atherectomy catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> During angioplasty and atherectomy procedures, embolic debris can be separated from the wall of the blood vessel. If this debris enters the circulatory system, it could block other vascular regions including the neural and pulmonary vasculature. During angioplasty procedures, stenotic debris may also break loose due to manipulation of the blood vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Because of this debris, a number of devices, such as intravascular filters, have been developed to filter out this debris. A need remains for improved intravascular filters. A need remains for improved methods of manufacture of intravascular filters. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The invention is directed to intravascular filters such as embolic protection filters that are configured to capture embolic debris when deployed within a patient's vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Accordingly, an example embodiment of the invention can be found in a filter assembly that includes a support hoop, a filter membrane that has a proximal end that is secured to the support hoop, and stagnation prevention means that extend proximally from the support hoop. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Another example embodiment of the invention can be found in an embolic protection filter that includes a support hoop, a filter membrane having a proximal region secured to the support hoop, and a filter fillet that is positioned proximate the support hoop and that extends proximally from the support hoop. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another example embodiment of the invention can be found in a method of forming a filter. A support hoop is provided. A filter membrane is formed, where the support hoop is positioned such that a proximal region of the filter membrane forms around the support hoop and encapsulates the support hoop. The filter membrane includes an extension that extends proximally from the support hoop. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Another example embodiment of the invention can be found in a method of capturing stagnant emboli. A filter is provided that includes a support hoop and a filter membrane. The filter membrane includes an extension portion that extends proximally from the support hoop. The filter is deployed within a vasculature including a vascular wall, where the proximal portion of the filter membrane and the extension portion contact the vascular walls. The extension portion is configured to prevent emboli from stagnating proximate the support hoop and the vascular wall.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is generally employed in its sense including &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The following description should be read with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals indicate like elements throughout the several views. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict illustrative embodiments of the claimed invention. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an example intravascular filter <b>10</b>, which includes a filter membrane <b>12</b>. The filter membrane <b>12</b> can be formed from any suitable moldable material or combination of materials. For example, the filter membrane <b>12</b> can include polymers such as polyether block amide, polybutylene terephthalate/polybutylene oxide copolymers sold under the Hytrel and Arnitel trademarks, Nylon 11, Nylon 12, polyurethane, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene naphthalene dicarboxylate, olefin/ionomer copolymers, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, ethylene terephthalate, butylene terephthalate, ethylene naphthalate copolymers, polyamide/polyether/polyester polyamides, aromatic polyamides, polyurethanes, aromatic polyisocyanates, polyetheretherketone, polycarbonates, polyamide/polyether, and polyester/polyether block copolymers, among others. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In some embodiments, the filter membrane <b>12</b> can be formed from at least one of polyether block amide, olefin/ionomer copolymers, nylon, polyurethane, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene naphthalene dicarboxylate and mixtures or copolymers thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The filter membrane <b>12</b> can be porous, having pores <b>14</b> that are configured to permit blood flow while retaining embolic material of a desired size. The pores <b>14</b> are seen in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. While the pores <b>14</b> as illustrated are at least substantially circular in profile, other profiles are contemplated as well. The filter membrane <b>12</b> can have a mouth <b>16</b> and a closed end <b>18</b> and is capable of moving between an open state and a closed state. The mouth <b>16</b> can be sized to occlude the lumen of the body vessel in which the filter may be installed, thereby directing all fluid and any emboli through the filter. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> A support hoop <b>20</b> can be attached to the filter membrane <b>12</b> at or proximal to the mouth <b>16</b>. The support hoop <b>20</b> can be attached to the filter membrane <b>12</b> through melt bonding or other suitable means. In some embodiments, as discussed in greater detail hereinafter, the support hoop <b>20</b> can be integrally molded within the filter membrane <b>12</b>. The support hoop <b>20</b> has an expanded state and a compressed state. The expanded state of the support hoop <b>20</b> is configured to urge the mouth <b>16</b> to its full size, while the compressed state permits insertion into a small lumen. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The support hoop <b>20</b> can be made from a flexible metal such as spring steel, from a super-elastic elastic material such as a suitable nickel-titanium alloy, or from other suitable material. The support hoop <b>20</b> can be a closed hoop made from a wire of uniform diameter, it can be a closed hoop made from a wire having a portion with a smaller diameter, it can be an open hoop having a gap, or it can have another suitable configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> A strut <b>22</b> can be fixedly or slideably attached to and extend from the support hoop <b>20</b>. An elongate member <b>24</b> can be attached to and extend from the strut <b>22</b>. The elongate member <b>24</b> can be attached to the strut <b>22</b> at an angle or the strut <b>22</b> can have a small bend, either at a point or over a region. The strut <b>22</b> can be attached to the support hoop <b>20</b> at a slight angle such that when the elongate member <b>24</b>, the strut <b>22</b>, and the support hoop <b>20</b> are in an unconstrained position, the elongate member <b>24</b> can generally extend perpendicular to the support hoop <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In the unconstrained position, the elongate member <b>24</b> can also lie along an axis which passes through the center of the region created by the support hoop <b>20</b>. This may help position the support hoop <b>20</b> in contact with the wall of a vascular lumen or it may help in enhancing predictability or reliability during deployment. In some embodiments, the elongate member <b>24</b> can terminate at the strut <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the elongate member <b>24</b> can extend through the filter membrane <b>12</b>, as shown. Whether or not the elongate member <b>24</b> extends through the filter membrane <b>12</b>, it may be fixedly or slideably/rotatably attached to the filter membrane <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The filter membrane <b>12</b> can include a waist <b>26</b> at the closed end <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the waist <b>26</b> can be integrally formed with the filter membrane <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, the filter membrane <b>12</b> can be further processed to form the waist <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, integrally forming the waist <b>26</b> with the filter membrane <b>12</b> can reduce the outer diameter of the filter device when in a compressed state, increase the reliability and uniformity of the bond between the filter membrane and the elongate member, and reduce the number of steps or components needed to form the filter device. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The waist <b>26</b> is a region largely incapable of moving between two states and having a lumen of substantially constant diameter therethrough. The elongate member <b>24</b> can extend through and be bonded to the waist <b>26</b>. This bonding can be heat bonding such as laser bonding or may be an adhesive or other suitable means. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the intravascular filter <b>10</b> can be deployed within a vasculature <b>28</b> that can include an artery or a vein within a patient. For illustration purposes only, the vasculature <b>28</b> will be referred to herein as the vessel <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the vessel <b>28</b> can include vessel walls <b>30</b>. As can be seen, the open mouth end <b>16</b> can be in substantial contact with the vessel walls <b>30</b> at a contact point <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, at least a proximal portion <b>32</b> of the filter membrane <b>12</b> can also be in substantial contact with the vessel walls <b>30</b>, depending on the particular geometry of the vessel <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an axially aligned partial section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, taken near the contact point <b>34</b>. In this illustration, the support hoop <b>20</b> can be seen embedded within the filter membrane <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, a fillet <b>36</b> that is integrally formed with the filter membrane <b>12</b> can extend proximally beyond the support hoop <b>20</b>. The fillet <b>36</b> can extend circumferentially at least partially around the support hoop <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> can extend circumferentially substantially or completely around the support hoop <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fillet <b>36</b> provides a more gradual transition to the open mouth end <b>16</b> of the intravascular filter <b>10</b>. The fillet <b>36</b> can taper from a more distal position <b>38</b> proximate the support hoop <b>20</b> to a proximal position <b>40</b>. At the distal position <b>38</b>, the fillet <b>36</b> can have a material thickness T that is about equal to that of the filter membrane <b>12</b>. The fillet <b>36</b> can have an overall thickness W at the distal position <b>38</b> that is about equal to a cross-sectional diameter D of the support hoop <b>20</b> plus twice the thickness T of the filter membrane <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> At the proximal position <b>40</b>, the fillet <b>36</b> can have a thickness W that tapers to about zero. The fillet <b>36</b> can have any suitable length L. In some embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> has a length L that is about one to four times a cross-sectional diameter D of the support hoop <b>20</b>. In particular embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> can have a length L that is about one to two times the cross-sectional diameter D of the support hoop <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> The intravascular filter <b>10</b> can be built to any suitable dimensions. In some embodiments, the support hoop <b>20</b> can have a cross-sectional diameter D that is in the range of about 0.001&#x2033; to about 0.010&#x2033;. In some embodiments, the filter membrane <b>12</b> can have a thickness T that is in the range of about 0.0004&#x2033; to about 0.003&#x2033;. In such embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> can have an overall thickness W that is in the range of about 0.002&#x2033; to about 0.016&#x2033; (equal to D+2T) and a length L that is in the range of about 0.001&#x2033; to about 0.004&#x2033; (1D to 4D) and in particular embodiments a length L that is in the range of about 0.010&#x2033; to about 0.040&#x2033; (1D to 2D). </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The fillet <b>36</b> can be configured with any suitable shape or profile, provided that the shape or profile provides for relatively smooth blood flow between a region <b>42</b> that is upstream of the intravascular filter <b>10</b> and the open mouth end <b>16</b> of the intravascular filter <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, providing for relatively smooth blood flow in this region can reduce or eliminate the formation or collection of emboli that could otherwise form or collect just upstream of the contact point <b>34</b>. As shown, the fillet <b>36</b> tapers linearly from the distal position <b>38</b> to the proximal position <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> can taper in a concave or convex configuration between the distal position <b>38</b> and the proximal portion <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The filter membrane <b>12</b> can be formed in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the filter membrane <b>12</b> can be formed using spray molding in which an appropriately shaped mandrel is provided. A number of layers of polymeric material are sprayed onto the mandrel to form the filter membrane. After several layers of polymeric material are sprayed onto the mandrel, the support loop <b>20</b> can be positioned over the mandrel, and additional polymeric layers can be sprayed onto the mandrel. In some embodiments, the fillet <b>36</b> can be formed by positioning the support loop <b>20</b> an appropriate distance distally of the proximal end of the sprayed polymeric layers. As a result, the support loop <b>20</b> is encapsulated within the filter membrane <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In some embodiments, the tapered profile of the fillet <b>36</b> can be created by masking during the spray molding process. In some embodiments, the tapered profile of the fillet <b>36</b> can be formed in a post-spraying grinding or milling process. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> It should be understood that this disclosure is, in many respects, only illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of steps without exceeding the scope of the invention. The invention's scope is, of course, defined in the language in which the appended claims are expressed. </p>
