<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The devices, systems, and methods described here are in the field of local drug delivery to treat paranasal sinus conditions. More specifically, the treatment of paranasal sinus inflammation and rhinosinusitis is described. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Rhinosinusitis is a common paranasal sinus condition that is generally understood as encompassing sinusitis and/or rhinitis. Typically, rhinosinusitis is characterized by such major symptoms such as nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial congestion, facial pain/pressure, loss of smell, and fever, and such minor symptoms as headache, ear pain/pressure, halitosis, dental pain, cough, and fatigue. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The paranasal sinuses are air-filled cavities within the facial skeleton. Each paranasal sinus is contiguous with a nasal cavity and opens into the nasal cavity through a sinus ostium. The key to normal sinus function is its mucociliary transport system which is comprised of epithelial goblet cells and submucosal seromucous glands that produce nearly a quart of mucus in the sinus a day, and a ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium that lines the sinuses and which moves the mucous toward the natural sinus ostia. Any alteration in sinus ostia patency, ciliary function, or the quality of mucous may disrupt the system and lead to rhinosinusitis. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> One important factor in the pathogenesis of rhinosinusitis is the patency of the sinus ostia. Partial obstruction of the sinus ostia often results in stagnation of mucous secretions, and a decrease in pH and oxygen tension within the sinus. These physiologic changes are thought to create a favorable environment for microbial infection. The microbial infection subsequently causes or enhances mucosal inflammation that may further reduce ostial patency or completely obstruct the ostia. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The medical treatment for rhinosinusitis typically includes a combination of oral antibiotics, topical or oral decongestants, steroid nasal sprays, or oral steroids such as prednisone. When medical therapy fails, which is often the case with rhinosinusitis, sinus surgery is an alternative. The most common surgery performed today is functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The goal of FESS is to improve the drainage of the sinuses by enlarging the ostia of the maxillary and frontal sinuses, and opening the ethmoid sinus area by removing the ethmoid air cells under direct visualization. However, FESS itself creates inflammation, which can lead to post-operative fibrosis, stenosis, and/or polyposis that frequently obstructs the newly opened sinuses, requiring the surgeon to reoperate to revise the ostia and insert stenting devices to keep sinus ostia patent. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,455 (Shikani) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,065 (Rains) describe stents for insertion into sinus ostia and/or sinus antrostomies or fenestrations to improve sinus drainage, reduce the degree of adhesion formation, and prevent ostial stenosis. Furthermore, stents such as the Parrell Frontal Sinus T-Stent (Medtronic Xomed, Inc., Jacksonville, Fla.), the Jasin Frontal Sinus Ostent&#x2122; Stent (Medtronic Xomed, Inc., Jacksonville, Fla.), and the Salman FES Stent (Boston Medical Products, Westborough, Mass.) are currently used after endoscopic sinus surgery for the same purpose. However, these stents are nonbiodegradable and thus require a follow-up procedure for removal. Furthermore, because these stents do not deliver a therapeutically active agent to the sinuses, they often only delay stenosis due to postoperative inflammation and the normal wound healing process. Thus, they are typically used in combination with systemic oral corticosteroids, which may result in undesirable side-effects the longer they are administered. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Sinus stents that elute drug have been proposed by others. For example, a nonbiodegradable or biodegradable polymeric &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; device for placement into surgically created frontal sinus fenestrations is described in U.S. Published Application No. U.S. 2004/0116958 to Goferich et al. The spacer is tubular or shaped like an hour-glass, and capable of releasing medicinal substances such as glucocorticosteroids, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mitosis inhibitors around newly created fenestrations. An hour-glass or tubular shape is described as preferred because it allows secretions to drain from the sinus. The spacer is placed solely at the sinus ostium and does not undergo a structural change, for example, to transition between a collapsed and expanded configuration, upon delivery to the sinus ostium. Furthermore, the spacer primarily lies within the natural ostium or surgically created fenestration. It does not have a portion that extends into the sinus cavity to contact the sinus cavity wall. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another implantable device for treating sinusitis is described in U.S. Publication No. 2005/0245906 to Makower et al. This application describes a biodegradable polymeric device having a spacer for positioning within a sinus ostium, and a body comprised of a plurality of substance-eluting struts. The struts are configured to lie substantially parallel to the flow of mucus along the sinus cavity walls without substantially touching the walls so that mucociliary transport is not interrupted. It is uncertain how a device of this design would be constructed or deployed. Furthermore, given that the sinus mucosa is a source of water needed for device degradation and drug release, it is questionable whether this device is capable of providing a dosing regimen effective for treating rhinosinusitis because it does not substantially contact the walls of the sinus cavity. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Other compositions for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, such as aqueous solutions, creams, or gels, for topical application in the nose have also been formulated, but usually never travel far enough into the nose to reach the sinuses, are blocked from entering the sinuses due to obstructed ostia, or have such short contact with the sinus mucosa that absorption of the agent is low. For similar reasons, nasally inhaled steroid and anti-infective aerosols that have been developed to treat sinusitis are equally ineffective. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Another method that has been described for locally treating sinusitis is to place a biodegradable implant into the sinus. For example, the delivery of ampicillin from a rolled-up 1.5 cm&#xd7;1.5 cm poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) film to increase residence time of the antibiotic in rabbit sinuses has been investigated for the treatment of sinusitis (Min et al. Mucociliary Activity and Histopathology of Sinus Mucosa in Experimental Maxillary Sinusitis: A Comparison of Systemic Administration of Antibiotic and Antibiotic Delivery by Polylactic Acid Polymer. <i>Laryngoscope </i>105:835-342 (1995) and Min et al. Application of Polylactic Acid Polymer in the Treatment of Acute Maxillary Sinusitis in Rabbits. <i>Acta Otolaryngol </i>115:548-552 (1995)). Although clinical signs of sinusitis improved over 28 days, the procedure for placing the film was quite invasive, requiring that a hole be drilled through the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> A less invasive method of placing a biodegradable implant into a sinus for the local treatment of sinusitis is described in commonly owned U.S. Publication No. 2005/0043706. In this application, the implant is generally delivered into the sinus through a sinus ostium, and has at least one characteristic that substantially prevents its clearance by the mucociliary transport system. For example, the implant is typically formed to possess a mucoadhesiveness that substantially prevents implant clearance from the sinus. A mucoadhesive polymer is incorporated into the implant to make it mucoadhesive. Mucoadhesive polymers are usually hydrophilic, and upon moistening, absorb water to swell and become adhesive. This implant lacks a structural component that physically maintains patency of the sinus ostium. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Consequently, new devices for locally administering active agents to the paranasal sinuses for treating paranasal sinus conditions, e.g., sinus inflammation (including, but not limited to, rhinosinusitis and sinus procedures, e.g., FESS), and for maintaining patency of sinus ostia, as well as methods for delivering the devices to the sinus cavity are desirable. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The devices, systems, and methods of this invention are generally used to treat patients having a paranasal sinus condition. The paranasal sinus condition to be treated is typically postoperative paranasal sinus inflammation due to functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for sinusitis, but also includes conditions such as, but not limited to, acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, sinusitis that recurs after FESS, upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, tonsillitis and other chronic diseases of the tonsils and adenoids, laryngitis, tracheitis, nasal and sinus polyposis, neoplasms of the large and small airways, and nasal, sinus, or nasopharynx tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, plasmacytomas, inverted papillomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and lymphomas, when they involve the sinuses or nasal passage. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;paranasal sinus inflammation&#x201d; or &#x201c;sinus inflammation&#x201d; refer to any reaction of sinus tissue, sinus ostial tissue, or tissue in the nasal passage proximate the sinus ostia that involves the inflammatory response. The inflammation may be caused by processes such as allergy (hypersensitivity), injury to sinus mucosa due to, e.g., trauma; surgery; infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, chemicals, or drugs; and benign or malignant tumors. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The devices are formed in such a way to locally deliver one or more active agents into the sinus cavity, sinus ostium, and/or nasal passage for at least about one week to treat the paranasal sinus condition. The described devices are useful in surgical, non-surgical, and other therapeutic interventions related to the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages to restore anatomical function and treat any of the aforementioned conditions. Accordingly, the devices may be used to support sinus and nasal surgery, reduce the need for surgical revision, and/or prevent, delay, or reduce recurrence of rhinosinusitis. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> The devices for treating paranasal sinus conditions may include a cavity member that has a first collapsed configuration that permits the device to pass through a sinus ostium and a second expanded configuration after placement into the sinus cavity. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;expand&#x201d;, &#x201c;expansion&#x201d;, or &#x201c;expanding&#x201d;, refer to a device that undergoes physical expansion, e.g., from a compressed to an expanded state, not expansion due to the absorption of water. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> In their expanded configuration, the devices in some variations have a surface area to volume ratio that is substantially unchanged from that of the devices in their collapsed configuration. In other variations, upon expansion, the cavity member also at least partially conforms to the shape of the sinus cavity and substantially contacts the mucosa of the sinus cavity. The devices may be made from any biocompatible material. For example, they may be formed from various metals and their alloys, biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymers, and combinations thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> In addition to a cavity member, the devices may include a nasal portion and an ostial member that is configured to reside within the sinus ostium. The cavity member is attached to the distal end of the ostial member. The nasal portion is attached to the proximal end of the ostial member and lies within the nasal passage. The active agent may be incorporated into all portions of the device or only included in the expandable cavity member, the ostial member, or nasal portion. In one aspect, the active agent is released from the cavity member and the ostial member. In another aspect, the active agent is released from the cavity member and nasal portion. In yet a further aspect, the active agent is released from the nasal portion and the ostial member. The cavity member, ostial member, and nasal portion may contain and deliver the same or different active agents. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The paranasal sinus devices may deliver an active agent(s) over at least about one week, over at least about two weeks, over at least about three weeks, over at least about one month, over at least about two months, over at least about three months, over at least about four months, over at least about five months, or over at least about six months or more. Typically, the active agent is delivered over about four weeks. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The devices may be formed from one or more polymeric pliable filaments. For example, the filaments may be configured to form cavity members that resemble a fringed structure, a flexible mesh, a whisk-like structure, and the like. The cavity members may be formed to be expandable. In one variation, the cavity members self-expand. In another variation, the devices expand after application of an expansive or mechanical force. For example, the devices may expand after balloon inflation. In some instances, the cavity members expand to substantially contact the sinus cavity wall after deployment within the sinus. Contact with the sinus cavity wall may be verified by incorporation of radiopaque markers on or within the cavity members, or visualization using endoscopy or other imaging modalities. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In another variation, the pliable filament(s) may contain a plasticizer or a solvent which softens the biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer. Balloon inflation or other mechanical types of expansion may be used to expand variations of the plasticized cavity member that are not configured to self-expand. Upon contact of the plasticized cavity member to the mucosal tissue, the plasticizer diffuses out of the cavity member. The plasticizer diffusion hardens the cavity member in such a way that the cavity member substantially conforms to the shape of the sinus cavity. As an example, a filament made from lactide/glycolide polymer may be plasticized with materials such as triethyl citrate, acetone and other ketones, ethanol and other alcohols, N-methylpyrrolidone, ethyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Upon placement of the filament into the sinus, the plasticizer, triethyl citrate, for example, diffuses out of the filament polymer to result in a hardened filament that substantially conforms to the shape of the sinus cavity. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> The devices described here for treating a paranasal sinus condition may include an active agent dispersed within a biodegradable polymer matrix, in which the device comprises a cavity member, an ostial member, and optionally a nasal portion, and exhibits an in vivo cumulative release profile in which a therapeutically effective amount of said active agent is maintained in a sinus tissue for at least about 4 days, at least about 14 days, at least about 25 days, or at least about 35 days after implantation of the device. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The paranasal sinus devices may be delivered into a sinus using inserters of various designs. Typical inserters include a conduit, e.g., a catheter, needle, or angiocatheter, having a lumen. For example, the conduit may be made such that it has variable stiffness along its length. In addition, the distal portion of the conduit may be pre-angulated to facilitate access of the sinus ostium, or made such that the distal portion is malleable such that the physician may angulate the conduit prior to accessing the sinus ostium. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The paranasal sinus devices and inserters for their deployment may be used in a system for treating a paranasal sinus condition. In general, the system works by first placing the inserter having one or more devices in a collapsed, folded, or constrained configuration within or carried on its distal end through the sinus ostium. Once within the sinus, the cavity member of the device transitions from the first collapsed, folded, or constrained configuration to a second expanded configuration. For example, a sheath may be retracted to slidably deploy a self-expanding cavity member that contacts a substantial portion of the sinus cavity wall. Balloon inflation or other mechanical types of expansion may be used to expand variations of the cavity member that are not configured to self-expand. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> The paranasal sinus devices of this invention may take various forms. For example, some are designed to include a cavity member, an ostial member, and a nasal portion, and deliver active agents for the treatment of paranasal sinus conditions, e.g., sinus inflammation. The cavity member may have a first collapsed configuration that permits it to be inserted through a sinus ostium or surgically created fenestration, and a second expanded configuration upon placement into the sinus cavity. In this variation, once expanded, the structure of the cavity member generally has a surface area to volume ratio that is not substantially different from the surface area to volume ratio of the cavity member in its collapsed configuration. This may be important because the sinus mucosa is a source of water needed for the release of the active agent from the paranasal sinus device. Thus, if the surface area of a device available for contacting the sinus mucosa is decreased, e.g., in relation to its volume, dissolution (and subsequent absorption) of the active agent should also be decreased. Furthermore, once expanded, the cavity member may also substantially contact the sinus cavity wall. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The nasal portion generally functions to position and/or anchor the device at the sinus ostium, preventing lateralization of the middle turbinate, occlusion of the middle meatus, and formation of tissue adhesions. The ostial member located at the proximal end of the cavity member typically functions to maintain patency of the sinus ostium. However, as further described below, each component of the device may have various functions, depending on factors such as the particular structure of the cavity member, ostial member, or nasal portion and whether the component is capable of releasing an active agent. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> As used herein, the terms &#x201c;paranasal sinus&#x201d; and &#x201c;sinus&#x201d; are used interchangeably, and refer to all sinuses, i.e., the maxillary, frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoidal sinuses. Each sinus cavity opens into the nasal cavity through a sinus ostium. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the maxillary sinus <b>10</b> opens into nasal cavity <b>12</b> at maxillary sinus ostium <b>14</b>, and the frontal sinus <b>16</b> opens into nasal cavity <b>12</b> at frontal sinus ostium <b>18</b>. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treat&#x201d;, &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refer to the resolution, reduction, or prevention of a paranasal sinus condition or its symptoms, prevention of complications attributable to a paranasal sinus condition, or provision of a beneficial substance, to a paranasal sinus. For example, the beneficial substance may be used to promote general health of the sinus. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> Once expanded, the cavity member may be configured to conform at least partly to the shape of the sinus cavity and substantially contact the sinus cavity wall. By &#x201c;substantially contact&#x201d; it is meant the percentage of surface area of the cavity member generally required to contact a sinus cavity wall (sinus mucosa) that provides the appropriate release kinetics for the active agents throughout a treatment period, for example, for at least one week, for at least two weeks, for at least three weeks, or for at least four weeks or more. Accordingly, depending on the amount of surface area needed for contact, &#x201c;substantial contact&#x201d; may refer to contact of about 10% to about 100%, about 20% to about 100%, about 30% to about 100%, about 40% to about 100%, about 50% to about 100%, about 60% to about 100%, about 70% to about 100%, about 80% to about 100%, or about 90% to about 100% of the surface area of the device to the sinus cavity wall. Importantly, the pressure of the cavity member on the sinus mucosa is sufficient for maintaining contact of the cavity member against the sinus mucosa but does not cause significant damage or necrosis to the mucosa. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> As used herein, the terms &#x201c;active agent&#x201d;, &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d;, and &#x201c;drug&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to any substance used to treat a paranasal sinus condition. Furthermore, as used herein, the term &#x201c;therapeutic amount&#x201d; refers to a concentration of active agent that has been locally delivered to a sinus or nasal passage that is appropriate to safely treat a paranasal sinus condition. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> General elements. The paranasal sinus devices described here may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, they may be formed from one or more filaments, which include any linear structure such as strands, capillaries and tubular and non-tubular structures, but may also be formed from a film or sheet-like starting material. The filaments may be of variable stiffness and take a variety of suitable forms, such as threads, ribbons, strips, beaded structures, tubes, and the like, so long as they are flexible enough to substantially contact a portion of a sinus cavity wall after deployment, exhibit the desired release kinetics, and deliver an amount of drug therapeutic for a paranasal sinus condition. The filaments may be of different shapes generally, and have a variety of cross-sectional shapes, as desired or as useful to maintain mucosal contact and consistent deployment. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2M</figref>, they may be shaped to be circular (<b>2</b>A), square (<b>2</b>B), elliptical (<b>2</b>C), winged (<b>2</b>D), diamond-like (<b>2</b>E), rectangular (<b>2</b>F), wedged (<b>2</b>G), ramped (<b>2</b>H), tubular (<b>2</b>I), parallelogram-like (<b>2</b>J), arc-like (<b>2</b>K), dog bone/dumbbell shaped (<b>2</b>L), slightly concave (<b>2</b>M), and the like on transverse cross-section. If desired, the pliable filaments may also be combined to form woven structures such as cords, ropes, braids, mesh, and the like. Tubular filaments may be combined into structures with multiple lumens, in either concentric or adjacent configurations, or directly formed as filaments with multiple lumens. Films and sheets may also include non-woven meshes and largely two dimensional materials, where dimensional thickness is much less than dimensional length or width. Other materials such as gelfoam may form such filaments upon their application. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> In some variations the pliable filaments may be configured to include one or more anchoring elements to help affix the filaments to the sinus mucosa or otherwise enhance contact of the filaments to the sinus mucosa. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6F</figref>, the anchoring element may be one or more hooks (<b>6</b>A), spikes (<b>6</b>B), opposed spikes (<b>6</b>C), arrows (<b>6</b>D), ridges (<b>6</b>E), barbs (<b>6</b>F), and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, ridges may also be formed to be triangular, square, round, semicircular, and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> Cavity member. The cavity members are generally biodegradable, but they may also be made to be nonbiodegradable. Additionally, whether formed as biodegradable or nonbiodegradable, the cavity members may be attached to a component, for example, a wire or suture, that extends from the cavity member and out through the ostium, which could be grasped by an instrument to remove it from the sinus. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> In one variation, the pliable filaments are configured to form a fringed structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a cross-section of fringed structure <b>20</b> includes a plurality of pliable filaments or prongs <b>22</b> (expanded configuration). Pliable filaments <b>22</b> are secured at their proximal ends <b>24</b> to a tubular ostial member <b>26</b>. Once deployed in a paranasal sinus such as maxillary sinus <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, pliable filaments <b>22</b> radially expand, unfurl, or otherwise are adapted to undergo a change in configuration after insertion into a sinus, to substantially contact the sinus cavity wall <b>23</b> and to deliver an active agent into the sinus <b>21</b>. The length of the pliable filaments <b>22</b> is usually between about 1 cm and about 6 cm, more usually between about 2 cm to about 6 cm, and more usually still between about 3 cm and 6 cm. In addition, ostial member <b>26</b> is placed at the sinus ostium <b>25</b> to maintain ostium patency so that drainage from the sinus <b>21</b> to the nasal cavity is uninterrupted. Nasal portion <b>28</b> may also be provided on the proximal end of the device. Nasal portion <b>28</b> extends into the nasal cavity and may minimize lateralization of the middle turbinate to the lateral nasal wall and ostia opening, further reducing the possible risk of occlusion and adhesion formation in the middle meatus. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> In another variation, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, pliable filaments <b>32</b> are configured to form a fringed structure <b>30</b> in a frontal sinus <b>31</b>. Like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, pliable filaments <b>32</b> are secured to ostial member <b>36</b> at their proximal ends <b>34</b>, and once deployed, substantially contact the sinus cavity wall <b>38</b> to deliver drug into frontal sinus <b>31</b>. The length of pliable filaments <b>32</b> are usually between about 1 cm and about 5 cm, and more usually between about 2 cm and about 5 cm. However, because of the longer passageway from the nasal cavity to the frontal sinus ostium <b>33</b> than to the maxillary ostium, and because the frontal sinus device <b>30</b> is subject to gravitational pull, as well as encompasses a longer narrower cavity prone to stenosis, adhesions and scarring, the tubular ostial member <b>36</b> is generally formed to be longer in a frontal sinus device. However, the length of ostial member <b>36</b> may be shortened if the fringed structure <b>30</b> (or other cavity member) is configured to anchor the device within the sinus cavity, or if the risk of such aforementioned complications has been reduced through varying surgical techniques (more or less extensive) or anatomical variations. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Turning to the variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the pliable filaments are configured to form a flexible mesh. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> (collapsed configuration), flexible mesh <b>40</b> is secured to an ostial member <b>42</b> (and in some instances, also to nasal portion <b>46</b>) by methods well known in the art, e.g., by welding, annealing, heat bonding, attachment bands or adhesives such as thermoplastic adhesives, thermosetting adhesives, rubber-resin blend adhesives, and other adhesives well known in the art. Upon expansion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, flexible mesh <b>40</b> forms a spherical structure capable of at least partially conforming to the shape of a sinus cavity. The weave of the mesh may be adjusted to be looser or tighter, or the width of the pliable filaments may be adjusted to correspondingly adjust the flexibility of the mesh. The flexible mesh may be expanded to a diameter between about 1 cm to about 5 cm, and more usually between about 2 cm to about 5 cm, and as further described below, may form a self-expanding, controllably expandable, or balloon expandable cavity member. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> The cavity member may be of various other designs. In one variation, the cavity member <b>70</b> is configured as a single pliable filament <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). Single pliable filament <b>72</b> may curve in such a way to at least partially conform to the shape of the sinus of implantation and substantially contact the sinus cavity wall. In another variation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the cavity member <b>74</b> comprises a single pliable filament configured as a coil <b>76</b>. The number of turns of the coil will vary depending on such factors as the sinus of implantation, placement and deployment technique used, and whether or not the coil is to be used as an anchor or for drug delivery, and flexibility of the filament. Similarly, a cavity member <b>78</b> may be made from a single pliable filament configured and/or inserted as a random coil <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> In other variations, the cavity member is formed from a plurality of one or more arced or looped filaments. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, the expanded cavity member <b>82</b> is formed from two pliable filaments <b>84</b>. Pliable filaments <b>84</b> are configured to form concentric loops crossing each other. The loops are usually affixed to each other by methods described above to form a distal apex <b>86</b>. The proximal ends <b>88</b> of pliable filaments <b>84</b> may be joined and otherwise configured to form an ostial member <b>230</b> and/or nasal portion <b>232</b>, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In another variation, expanded cavity member <b>90</b> is formed from a plurality of pliable filaments <b>92</b> configured to form multiple free loops (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>). The proximal ends <b>94</b> of pliable filaments <b>92</b> may also be joined or otherwise configured to form an ostial member and/or nasal portion of the device. In yet a further variation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, the expanded cavity member may be formed from a plurality of pliable filaments <b>98</b> configured as a whisk-like structure. The spacing <b>100</b> between the filaments may be varied depending on the particular desired cavity member configuration. The filaments may be shaped by adjusting their degree of flexibility, e.g., by addition of plasticizer, use of various molding, casting, bonding, and extrusion techniques, and by other methods well known in the art. The angle between each looped filament may also be varied depending on the particular desired cavity member configuration. Any number of filaments may also be employed to fabricate devices with any number of arced or looped cavity members. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In yet other variations, the cavity members may be formed from ribbon or strip-like filaments. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>, the cavity member <b>100</b> is formed from a plurality of strip-like sub-filaments <b>102</b> resulting from slitting a single tubular filament structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7H</figref>, the cavity member <b>104</b> is formed from a plurality of strip-like filaments <b>106</b> configured as a pronged structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, the cavity member <b>108</b> is made from a plurality of strip-like filaments <b>110</b> resulting from slitting and deformation of &#x201c;children&#x201d; filaments from the end of a single &#x201c;parent&#x201d; tubular filament structure. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7J-7O</figref> show yet further cavity member design variations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7J</figref>, cavity member <b>112</b> is formed from a plurality of corrugated ribbon-like filaments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7K</figref>, cavity member <b>116</b> is formed from a plurality of filaments configured like springs <b>118</b>. The cavity member may also be made from one or more filaments <b>122</b> comprising gelfoam. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7M-7O</figref> also include features allowing the irreversible deployment of one or more filaments in an open or tensed configuration using ridges (for example <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>) on the filaments and opposing ridges upon the adjacent lumens or other structures at their insertion site. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7M</figref>, a cavity member <b>124</b> consisting of a single ridged loop is inserted into the sinus and against the sinus wall (arrows) through a lumen with an opposing ridge <b>125</b> on the ostial member <b>126</b> of the device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7N</figref>, a cavity member <b>128</b> consisting of two opposed loops <b>129</b> is similarly inserted. These ridges <b>130</b> may alternatively deform the structure of the sinus cavity member. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7O</figref>, a cavity member <b>131</b> of the type described in above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</figref> is modified by the addition of ridges <b>133</b> on the interior of strip-like filaments <b>135</b>, and an additional interior tubular member with opposing ridges <b>137</b> positioned concentrically within the parent slit tube. The device's cavity member strip-like filaments <b>135</b> are deployed through their deformation along the intersection of the strip ridges and those of the opposing interior ridges as the concentric member <b>137</b> is independently pulled back (towards the proximal direction) while maintaining constant the position of the external sinus cavity parent slit tube. The result is a splayed and deformed open pattern of slit &#x201c;children&#x201d; filaments along the sinus cavity wall. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7R</figref>, the cavity member <b>132</b> is formed from a plurality of filaments <b>134</b> woven as a mesh and configured as a funnel-type structure. The cavity members may also be formed from a film, non-woven, or sheet-like material. For example, the film or sheet may be pleated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7P and 7Q</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7P</figref> the sheet <b>140</b> has pleats <b>138</b> that allow the cavity member <b>136</b> to be configured as a pleated cone. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7Q</figref>, the sheet <b>142</b> has pleats <b>144</b> that allow the cavity member <b>146</b> to be configured as a pleated fan. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> The cavity members of the invention may be adapted to self-expand, e.g., if they are made from a shape memory polymer or if they are constrained by a sheath prior to sinus insertion and deployed in the sinus after retraction of the sheath. They may also be expanded via methods involving mechanical expansion. For example, they may be expanded by inflating a balloon or pulling a cord or wire attached to the distal end of the device, or by the application of expansive force at the proximal end of the device, or by deflecting or deforming the cavity member along the sinus walls. However, in addition to the methods previously described, the invention also contemplates mechanical expansion of cavity members made from less pliable filaments that are equipped with one or more joints or hinges and which expand by movement of the pliable filaments at the joints or hinges. The joint or hinge may be an area of greater flexibility along the filament due to use of a polymer in that area having a lower durometer, decreasing the width of the filament, or by adjusting other surface features or mass density of the filament in that area. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> The active agent may be included in any portion of the device, e.g., the cavity member, ostial member, and/or nasal portion. When filaments are used, the active agent may be incorporated in the filaments as drug dispersed or dissolved within a polymeric matrix, or coated on the pliable filaments, or first encapsulated, such as microencapsulated, and then incorporated within or coated onto the pliable filaments. In some instances, the pliable filaments may be constructed to have one or more pouches or pockets for holding pellets of drug. The dosage of active agent delivered by the cavity member may be adjusted by, e.g., increasing or decreasing the number of drug-containing filaments in the cavity member, increasing or decreasing the amount of drug contained within or coated on the filaments, or by forming the pliable filaments such that they can be broken or cut into smaller filaments either before or after insertion into a sinus cavity. For example, the pliable filaments may include predetermined fracture lines or markings that a physician can use as a guide to adjust filament length prior to insertion, or after insertion into the sinus, the filaments may be adapted to preferentially degrade at the fracture lines into smaller filaments. In some instances, it may be desirable to include filaments having different active agents in the cavity member. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> Cavity members may also be made from a combination of pliable filament configurations or from combinations of filaments and other described cavity member configurations. For example, the structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> could be used to support the flexible mesh of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. If desired, a radiopaque marker may also be included on one or more pliable filaments to indicate the degree of expansion of the cavity member upon radiographic imaging. Usually, the marker will be detected by fluoroscopy, and if nonbiodegradable, will exit the sinus with the normal mucus flow if and after the expandable cavity member has degraded. Biodegradable radiopacifiers such as particles of an iodinated contrast agent or bismuth salts may also be used. Contact with the sinus cavity wall may be verified by incorporation of radiopaque markers on or within the cavity members, or visualization using endoscopy or other imaging modalities. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> Contact and/or anchoring of the cavity member to the sinus cavity wall may be enhanced by the addition of mucoadhesive materials, that may or may not be polymeric, to the pliable filaments, as further described below, by adjusting filament dimensions (e.g., decreasing filament diameter or otherwise decreasing aspect ratio), or by forming the filaments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6F</figref>, such that they include hooked (<b>7</b>A), spiked (<b>7</b>B), double spiked (<b>7</b>C), arrow-like (<b>7</b>D), ridged (<b>7</b>E), or barb-like structures (<b>7</b>F), or other anchoring or texturizing elements for grasping the sinus mucosa. In other variations, the filaments may be configured toward their distal ends as screws or springs which are capable of being fixed in sinus mucosa or other sinus tissue by insertion or tension. In yet other variations, the filaments may be fixed to the sinus cavity wall by stapling or suturing. The cavity member may also be anchored in the sinus by adjusting its size such that it is too large to move out of the ostium, or configuring the cavity member such that it expands to fill the entire sinus cavity or expands to exert sufficient pressure to maintain it within the sinus cavity. Furthermore, the paranasal sinus devices may have pliable filaments configured to have flexibility such that portions of the cavity members can differentially bow to conform to the shape of the sinus in which it is deployed. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Ostial member. The ostial member may be used to keep the ostia patent and/or anchor the nasal portion or cavity member of the device. In some variations, its inclusion may be to simply connect the cavity member to a nasal portion or other extra-sinus portion of the device. The ostial member is mounted to the proximal end of the cavity member, and is positioned at or relatively near the sinus ostium. Again, the pressure generated by the ostial member on the sinus mucosa is sufficient to keep the ostium open, but not so great that it compromises blood flow to the sinus mucosa. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> The ostial member may be of various designs. In some variations, the ostial member is formed form a one or more pliable filaments. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, ostial member <b>148</b> is formed from a single pliable filament <b>150</b> configured as an expandable coiled filament or wire which may be varied in its pitch, number and density of coils, coil linear and non-linear or patterned architecture and other like features. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows the corkscrew ostial member <b>148</b> positioned within an ostium, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> shows an end view ostial member <b>148</b>. Lumen <b>151</b> allows flow of mucus out of the sinus cavity. Ostial member <b>148</b> is adapted to be laterally compressible and/or bendable as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, in which case the coil diameter will increase or decrease. In another variation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a plurality of filaments <b>154</b>, which may be tubular filaments (having lumens), are attached to form tubular ostial member <b>152</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows the tubular ostial member <b>152</b> within a sinus ostium and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> shows an end view of the ostial member <b>152</b>. Lumen <b>156</b> allows flow of mucus out of the sinus cavity, as would the lumens of any tubular filament(s) if used in its construction. The ostial member <b>158</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16C</figref> is similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref> except that the filaments <b>160</b> are formed as strips. Ostial member <b>158</b> also has a lumen <b>162</b> that permits mucus to flow from the sinus cavity to into the nasal passage. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> In other variations, the ostial member is formed from a film or sheet-like material. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, ostial member <b>164</b> is formed from a pleated sheet (or alternatively from a plurality of tubular ring structures linked together) <b>166</b> configured as a reversibly compressible and/or bendable (as indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) accordion-like tubular structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> depicts ostial member <b>164</b> within a sinus ostium, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> shows an end view of ostial member <b>164</b>. Lumen <b>168</b> allows flow of mucus out of the sinus cavity. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, ostial member <b>170</b> includes a plurality of shaped apertures <b>172</b> cut out or punched out from film or sheet material <b>174</b>, creating a non-woven mesh Although the apertures are shown as hexagonal in shape, it is understood that various other aperture shapes may be used. For example, the apertures <b>172</b> may be triangles, squares, octagons, diamonds, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows ostial member <b>170</b> within a sinus ostium. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, it is shown how an ostial member of this design allow mucus to flow out through lumen <b>176</b> as well as through apertures <b>172</b> (see direction of arrows). Ostial member <b>170</b> may be also be formed to be compressible, expandable, bendable, and the like. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref>, <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>C, and <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C, the film or sheet-like material <b>176</b> may also be configured to form a simple tube <b>178</b>, a tubular hexagon <b>180</b>, and a furled tube <b>182</b>. Lumens <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, and <b>188</b> allow passage of mucus from the sinus cavity to the nasal passage. Pressure may be applied in the direction of the arrows to the furled tube <b>182</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> to adjust the diameter of lumen <b>188</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> In another variation, the ostial member <b>164</b> is formed from a plurality of sheets or strip-like filaments <b>166</b> configured as a star or asterisk-like structure. Spaces <b>168</b> between each strip allow mucus to flow past the ostial member <b>164</b> and optionally through a central lumen <b>165</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows ostial member <b>164</b> within a sinus ostium, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> depicts an end view of ostial member <b>164</b>. Further variations are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17C</figref>, tubular ostial member <b>190</b> (top) is formed from a corrugated or pleated film or sheet <b>192</b>. The ostial member <b>190</b> may be expanded in the direction of the arrows (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>) to form an ostial member of larger diameter <b>194</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18C</figref>, the tubular ostial member <b>196</b> is made from gelfoam <b>198</b>, with a pierced lumen <b>199</b>, which may or not be supported by the addition of a tube. The ostial member <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19C</figref> is a solid but porous cylinder <b>204</b> having a plurality of lumens <b>202</b>. Lumens <b>202</b> extend through the tubular ostial member <b>200</b>, either directly (as in a tube) or indirectly by connection through other internal cavities and/or lumens (not shown) such that mucus may pass out the end walls <b>206</b> and outer wall <b>208</b> of cylinder <b>204</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> The ostial member may be formed to be rigid or flexible, and may also be formed to be coated with drug, coated with microencapsulated drug, or made as a polymer matrix with dispersed or dissolved drug. The drug included with the ostial member may be the same or different from that delivered by the expandable cavity member. The ostial member may be made from a biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer, a metal, or combinations thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> The dimensions of the ostial member will generally vary with the intended sinus of deployment. For example, for the maxillary sinus, the length of the ostial member may be less than 2 mm, but is usually between about 2 mm to about 6 mm, more usually between about 2 mm to about 5 mm, and more usually still between about 2 mm to about 4 mm. The outer diameter of the maxillary ostial member is usually between about 5 mm to about 10 mm, more usually between about 5 mm to about 9 mm, and more usually still between about 8 mm to about 10 mm. The internal diameter of the maxillary ostial member is usually between about 3 mm to about 9 mm, more usually between about 3 mm to about 8 mm, and more usually still between about 3 mm to about 7 mm. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> For the frontal sinus, the length of the ostial member may be between about 0.5 mm to about 5 cm, between about 0.5 cm to about 4 cm, between about 0.5 cm to about 3 cm, between about 0.5 cm to about 2 cm, or between about 0.5 cm to about 1 cm. The outer diameter of the ostial member is usually about 5 mm, and the internal diameter about 3 mm. However, the inner and outer diameters may be smaller, especially in the instance where anchoring of the device is accomplished by the cavity member or nasal portion. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> Nasal portion. The paranasal sinus devices of the invention may include a nasal portion, e.g., a nasal plate <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>), to aid in maintaining the position of the ostial member at the sinus ostium, or as an aid in reducing turbinate lateralization, possible occlusion of the middle meatus around the ostia, and tissue adhesions. If included, the nasal portion (e.g., element <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> and element <b>232</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) is secured to the proximal end of the ostial member to extend into the nasal passage, and may lie against the nasal mucosa. The nasal portion is configured to have at least one opening through which mucus flowing from the ostial member can drain into the nasal passage. The opening may be eccentrically located, or formed to be in the center of the nasal portion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, opening <b>212</b> is in the center of nasal plate <b>210</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20E</figref>, nasal plate <b>214</b> has a plurality of openings <b>216</b> that allow drainage of mucus from the sinus into the nasal passage. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> In other variations, the nasal portion is configured from one or more pliable filaments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, nasal portion <b>218</b> is formed from a plurality of filaments <b>220</b> configured as radially extending spokes, which may be inserted as a more compact bundle of aligned parallel spokes, then deployed or unfurled so as to encircle the insertion point (see arrows and insertion view). Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, nasal portion <b>226</b> is formed from a plurality of strip-like filaments <b>228</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, nasal portion <b>222</b> is formed from a single pliable filament <b>224</b> configured as a spiral/helical structure. Another exemplary nasal portion is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20F</figref>, which comprises a compressible woven or nonwoven fold of sheeted material in the form of a wing-shaped tube, intended to adjustably conform to and support the middle meatus space and turbinate anatomy directly outside of an ostium. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> The nasal portion may be formed to be rigid, flexible, or self-expanding, and may also be formed to be coated with drug, coated with microencapsulated drug, or made as a polymer matrix with dispersed or dissolved drug within the polymer matrix. The drug included with the nasal portion may be the same or different from that delivered by the cavity member. The nasal portion may be made from a biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer, a metal, or combinations thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> The shape of the nasal portion may also vary depending on such factors as the sinus of deployment and whether additional sinuses, e.g., the ethmoid sinus, are to be treated. For example, in an individual needing treatment for both maxillary and ethmoid sinus inflammation, a maxillary paranasal sinus device having a nasal portion shaped to contact a portion of the ethmoid air cells is particularly desirable. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> The paranasal sinus devices may include any combination of the aforementioned cavity members, ostial members, and nasal portions. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, device may include a multiple looped cavity member <b>228</b> (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>) and a tubular ostial member (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>). Nasal portion <b>232</b> is also formed from a plurality of filaments <b>234</b> configured as splayed prongs. Each component of the device, i.e., the cavity member, ostial member, and nasal portion, may be formed contiguously (each filament, tube, sheet, or film forms all components) or separately, and then attached by methods previously described. Each component may also be perforated, contain pores, or have other structural or surface features which enhance or alternatively prevent impedence of mucociliary clearance, and aid in the placement and deployment of the device. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> In another variation, paranasal sinus device <b>236</b> includes a whisk-like cavity member <b>238</b> (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>), a tubular ostial member <b>240</b> (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>), and another whisk-like component <b>242</b> similar to cavity member <b>238</b> as the nasal portion <b>242</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> shows an end view from the nasal portion of the device. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> In a further variation, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23C</figref>, paranasal sinus device <b>244</b> includes a multiple looped cavity member <b>246</b> (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>) and a nasal plate <b>248</b> (previously described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of device <b>244</b> and an cross-section end view through line A-A is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>. </p>

The amount of active agent used will usually depend on factors such as the particular agent incorporated, the paranasal sinus condition being treated, and the severity of clinical symptoms, but in all instances will usually be an amount that is effective for treating the paranasal sinus condition upon delivery into a sinus. For example, when treating paranasal sinus inflammation, the device may be formed to deliver per day, from about 1 &#x3bc;g to about 100 &#x3bc;g, from about 10 &#x3bc;g to about 50 &#x3bc;g, from about 10 &#x3bc;g to about 40 &#x3bc;g, from about 10 &#x3bc;g to about 30 &#x3bc;g, from about 10 &#x3bc;g to about 25 &#x3bc;g, or from about 10 &#x3bc;g to about 20 &#x3bc;g of mometasone furoate into the sinus.

In another variation, the active agent may be coated onto the surface of the cavity member, ostial member, and/or the nasal portion. An exemplary way the coating may be achieved is by dissolving or suspending the active agent in a solution or melt of a biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer. In another exemplary way, the active agent may be powder coated onto the surface of the filament that has been made adhesive by, e.g., heating or softening with a solvent or plasticizer. In yet another variation, microencapsulated drug may be attached to the surface of the cavity member, ostial member, and/or the nasal portion. As previously mentioned, the active agent may be incorporated throughout all portions of the device or in particular portions of the device (e.g., the cavity member and ostial member, nasal portion and cavity member, etc.). </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"> The active agent may be included in the device such that differential release results. The differential release may be of the same active agent or for different active agents. For example, variable release of a single active agent may be achieved using methods such as bulk loading, surface coating (e.g., by having a higher load layer), surface loading (e.g., by embedding, spraying, or absorbing drug onto the device surface, etc.), and other techniques well known in the art. Variable release of different active agents may be achieved, e.g., by segmenting the drugs into different layers, reservoirs and/or microspheres, which themselves may have differing permeability or biodegradation profiles, as well as by other techniques well known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> Polymers. When the devices are made with polymers, selection of the biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer to be employed will vary depending on the residence time and release kinetics desired, method of device delivery, particular therapeutic agent used, and the like.

The biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer may constitute at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 100% by weight of the device or component that it makes (e.g., sinus cavity member, ostial member, or nasal portion). </p>

Biodegradable shape memory polymers, such as those commercialized by nmemoScience in Aachen, Germany, or those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,189,110 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,832, may also be employed. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> As used herein, a poly(lactide); a poly(glycolide); a poly(lactide-co-glycolide); a poly(lactic acid); a poly(glycolic acid); a poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) will all be referred to as PLG, PLG polymers, or lactide/glycolide polymers. Lactide/glycolide polymers for the drug delivery devices and compositions of this invention are typically made by melt polymerization through the ring opening of lactide and glycolide monomers. Some polymers are available with or without carboxylic acid end groups. When the end group of the poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(lactide), or poly(glycolide) is not a carboxylic acid, for example, an ester, then the resultant polymer is referred to herein as blocked or capped. The unblocked polymer, conversely, has a terminal carboxylic group. In one variation, linear lactide/glycolide polymers are used; however, star polymers may be used as well. In other variations, high molecular weight polymers may be used to form the devices of this invention, for example, to meet strength requirements and extend bioabsorption time. In other instances, low molecular weight polymers may be used when resorption time and not material strength is important. The lactide portion of the polymer has an asymmetric carbon. Racemic DL-, L-, and D-polymers are commercially available to include in the devices of this invention. The L-polymers are more crystalline and resorb slower than DL-polymers. In addition to copolymers comprising glycolide and DL-lactide or L-lactide, copolymers of L-lactide and DL-lactide are also commercially available. Additionally, homopolymers of lactide or glycolide are commercially available. Star polymers of lactide or glycolide or lactide/glycolide copolymers are also commercially available. </p>

In one variation, the biodegradable polymer contains from about 0 to about 100 mole %, from about 40 to about 100 mole %, from about 50 to about 100 mole %, from about 60 to about 100 mole %, from about 70 to about 100 mole %, or from about 80 to about 100 mole % lactide, and from about 0 to about 100 mole %, from about 0 to about 60 mole %, from about 10 to about 40 mole %, from about 20 to about 40 mole %, or from about 30 to about 40 mole % glycolide, wherein the amount of lactide and glycolide is 100 mole %. In other variations, the biodegradable polymer may be poly(lactide), about 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), about 75:25 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), about 65:35 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), or about 50:50 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), where the ratios are mole ratios. </p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> If a nonbiodegradable polymer is used to make or incorporate into the device or composition, suitable nonbiodegradable polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl acetate), silicone polymers, polyurethanes, polysaccharides such as a cellulosic polymers and cellulose derivatives, acyl substituted cellulose acetates and derivatives thereof, copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(butylene terephthalate), polystyrenes, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl fluoride, poly(vinyl imidazole), chorosulphonated polyolefins, polyethylene oxide, and copolymers and blends thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> Furthermore, the devices may be made from any biocompatible, biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer that is mucoadhesive. In some instances, the cavity member, ostial member, and/or nasal plate may be coated with a mucoadhesive, which may or may not be a polymer. The devices may also be made from a polymer that carries a charge. </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"> In another variation, natural polymers may be used. Representative natural polymers that may be included in the devices include, but are not limited to, proteins, such as zein, modified zein, casein, chitin, gelatin, gluten, serum albumin, or collagen, and polysaccharides, such as cellulose, dextrans, and polyhyaluronic acid. Hydrogel or sol-gel mixtures of polysaccharides are may also be employed. </p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"> Other materials. In some variations, the devices may be made from a metal. Examples of suitable metals include, but are not limited to, cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, stainless steel, titanium, tantalum, and any of their alloys, e.g., nickel-titanium alloys, and combinations thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"> Additional agents. The devices and compositions of this invention may further include components such as preservatives, buffers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, and any other excipients necessary to maintain the structure and/or function of the devices. For example, the pliable filaments may be formed to contain a plasticizer or solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl lactate, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, or ethyl acetate/alcohol blends that would soften the biodegradable or nonbiodegradable polymer of the device. The plasticizer or solvent would diffuse or otherwise be released from the device into the sinus mucosa after deployment and expansion of the cavity member to harden the polymeric filaments (of the device) such that the device substantially conforms to the shape of the sinus cavity, and to the extent that a better friction fit of the cavity member against the sinus cavity wall is provided. </p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"> Furthermore, as previously described, the pliable filaments may also include a mucoadhesive polymer to enhance contact of the cavity member to the sinus mucosa. Examples of mucoadhesive polymers that may be employed include homopolymers of acrylic acid monomers such as polyacrylic acid and any of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts; copolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, styrene, or vinyl ethers; vinyl polymers such as polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; cellulosic derivatives such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose; polysaccharides such as alginic acid, sodium alginate, and tragacanth gum; collagen; gelatin; and any combination thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"> Release kinetics. The devices described here may be formulated with particles of an active agent dispersed or dissolved within a biodegradable polymer matrix, and formulated to provide sustained release of the active agent. If made from a non-swellable polymer, e.g., lactide/glycolide polymers, release of the active agent from the matrix is most likely achieved by erosion of the biodegradable polymer matrix and/or by diffusion of the active agent into the mucous layer of the sinus. Factors that may influence the release kinetics include such characteristics as the size of the active agent particles, the solubility of the active agent, the ratio of active agent to polymer(s), the porosity of the polymer, the method of device manufacture, the exposed surface area of the device, the surface area to volume ratio of the device, and the erosion rate of the matrix polymer(s). </p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"> The active agent may be released from the device over a prolonged time period including, but not limited to, at least about one week, at least about two weeks, at least about three weeks, or at least about four weeks, at least about two months, at least about three months, at least about four months, at least about five months, or at least about six months or more. In one variation, the therapeutic agent is released over about two weeks to about four weeks. </p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"> The drug release profile of the paranasal sinus devices may be adjusted by various techniques, such as through use of different drug, polymer, and excipient formulations or adjustment of their amounts in the formulations, use of release and drug barrier layers, differential bead, microsphere, or microcapsule constructions (with shells of varying molecular weights or thicknesses), and the like, as is well known in the art. The duration of release can also be adjusted through polymer blending ratios, monomer average molecular weights, and coatings. </p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"> As previously mentioned, differential release of the drug(s) may also be effected. The differential release may be of the same active agent or for different active agents. For example, variable release of a single active agent may be achieved using methods such as bulk loading, surface coating (e.g., by having a higher load layer), surface loading (e.g., by embedding, spraying, or absorbing drug onto the device surface, etc.), and other techniques well known in the art. Variable release of different active agents may be achieved, e.g., by segmenting the drugs into different layers, reservoirs and/or microspheres, as well as by other techniques well known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"> Delayed drug release, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is useful for adjunctive therapy, as when tapering off of intravenous or oral steroids previously given to a patient, or when releasing anti-scarring and anti-restenosis agents later in the healing process. </p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"> Substantially zero order drug release, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> is useful for chronic disease maintenance therapy without trauma or scarring, or for anti-infective agent courses of therapy, providing a constant equilibrium concentration of drug and maximizing receptor target occupation levels. </p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"> Upfront bolus drug release, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref> during the first five to ten days is useful for treatment of post-surgical or implant insertion trauma and for creating maximum diffusion into the adjacent surgical anatomy. </p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"> Delayed bolus drug release, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24D</figref> is useful in post-operative treatment, particularly amelioration of trauma in post-operative debridement therapy. </p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"> Degradation dependent release, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24E</figref>, increasing as the device is fully bioabsorbed, is useful for prevention of any implant/device elimination trauma or complications due to bioabsorption. </p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"> Combinations are possible of any of the above drug release curves by integrating various drug release methods (for one or more drugs) in a single device. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24F</figref>, a combination of an initial bolus, followed by substantially zero order release, followed by a final release burst is particularly useful in post-surgical application of the device, treating surgical and implantation trauma (initial bolus) then surgical healing and disease recurrence (substantially zero order), and ultimately any implant elimination trauma (final release burst). Applications. </p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"> Therapeutic action of device. The structure of the paranasal sinus device itself may also have a therapeutic function. For example, the device may provide such functions as fixation or splinting tissue via space filling, fastening, deflection, in order to provide support and to keep a body structure open, as in stenting or packing to prevent the lateralization of the middle turbinate and occlusion of the middle meatus, or by providing a physical barrier to adhesions which may form between various post-surgical and/or inflamed tissue surfaces. For example, any device incorporating a solid, semi-solid (gel) or woven or nonwoven mesh structure could be used to practice this method. In another variation, the device may non-occlusively maintain patency through the implant feature area providing the device action by direct provision and maintenance of a channel, fenestration or port from the sinuses to the infundibulum, osteomeatal complex, meatus or nasal passage by which mucociliary flow may travel. Such a channel may be within and support the structure of natural ostia or within and support a surgically created or modified antrostomy to the sinus, but may not totally occlude such openings. For example, any device with a lumen or pore such as a tube or cannula, or stent with a lumen, could be used to practice this method, as could a highly porous packing material, three dimensional mesh, or surface or interior structured device through which mucus can flow and which does not become occlusive of the provided channel through absorbancy, expansion, or degradation. </p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"> Reduction of complications upon implantation. In yet another variation, the device may possess a structural feature or active agent that helps to reduce the complications of device implantation. For example, the device may: 1) prevent trauma due to device removal by use of bioabsorbable materials; 2) prevent biofilm formation by use of coatings, physical surface treatments, and/or incorporation or elution of an anti-infective or antiseptic substance; 3) prevent foreign body reactions by incorporating low-dose anti-inflammatory substances including steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (for example, including the anti-inflammatory effects of low dose macrolide antibiotics); and 4) prevent device migration by specific active or passive fixation and anchoring features incorporated in the device. Substances that may be used to prevent biofilm formation include, but are not limited to, alcohol, chlorhexidine, iodine, triclosan, hexachlorophene, and silver-based agents (e.g., silver chloride, silver oxide, silver nanoparticles). In other variations, the surface of the device may treated by a process (e.g. ion embedding, plasma etching, etc.) altering the physical properties of the surface of the device in order to prevent biofilm formation. </p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"> Exploitation of mucociliary clearance. Normal mucociliary clearance may be used to extend drug diffusion and effect beyond the physical location of the device. This is useful in both normal and particularly diseased mucociliary flow patterns. In the later case, the device is useful in effecting the build up of therapeutically desirable concentrations of released drug at blockages when the normal mucociliary flow is interrupted or impeded by disease, and increasing drug concentration gradients where mucociliary function is most impacted by disease. Anatomical blockages and areas of mucociliary dysfunction or ciliary dysmotility may be particularly desirable areas of such drug treatments (e.g., anti-inflammatories and anti-infectives, but also including chemotherapeutic agents), so as to &#x201c;chemically open&#x201d; the blockage and to increase treatment of the damaged mucosa. Thus, the natural sinus and upstream locations along the mucociliary clearance pathway may serve as drug depots, with drug traveling to desired sites downstream in the pathway. This contrasts with previous and current teachings in the field which seek to impede or reduce mucociliary clearance of active agents in order to maximize dose duration. </p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"> In addition to treating any one of the aforementioned paranasal sinus conditions, the devices described herein may be placed during, or as an adjunct to, a surgical, non-surgical, or other therapeutic intervention of the sinuses or nasal passages. For example, the device may be used during or as an adjunt to such procedures including, but not limited to, septoplasty (surgical removal or adjustment of the nasal septum); turbinoplasty (surgical removal or adjustment of the turbinate bones); rhinoplasty generally; sinus surgery (including the exploration, revision, repair, tissue dissection or removal of some or part of any of the sinuses, including the ethmoid sinuses (as in ethmoidectomy), maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, or sphenoid sinuses); polyp removal in any part of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages; cannulation, irrigation, and therapy instillation or injection of any of the above sinuses or the nasal passages, including through nasal, trans-ostial, and external puncture approaches (such as through antral puncture, trephination or &#x201c;Caldwell-Luc&#x201d; procedures); surgical revision, dissection, reconstruction or repair of the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages, including any removal or adjustment of neoplasms, foreign bodies, lesions, adhesions, defects, stenosis, and fistula of the natural or post-surgical anatomy; ligation, cauterization, and ablation procedures to control nasal bleeding and repair vasculature in the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages, or as an adjunct or technique to perform any such surgical or non-surgical procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"> Thus, the devices described here may have a variety of functions. For example, they may deliver an active agent to treat rhinosinusitis, have a structure that prevents lateralization of the middle turbinate and formation of adhesions, have a structure which directly or indirectly preserves ostial patency, as well as have a coating that prevents biofilm formation. The devices may be formed to include any number and combination of functions listed above. </p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"> Delivery devices and methods of use. The paranasal sinus devices may be placed into the sinus using various types of sinus inserters. The inserter may include a conduit, e.g., a catheter with a lumen. The conduit may be flexible or rigid, or may be designed to have varying degrees of stiffness along its length, e.g., the distal portion of the conduit may be stiffer than the proximal portion. In addition, the distal portion of the conduit may be variously angulated to facilitate positioning and advancement of the conduit through the sinus ostium. For example, the distal portion may be angulated from about 0&#xb0; to about 175&#xb0;, from about 0&#xb0; to about 135&#xb0;, or from about 0&#xb0; to about 90&#xb0;. If desired, the distal portion of the conduit may also be formed to be malleable. </p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"> The conduit may be made from any biocompatible material including, but not limited to, stainless steel and any of its alloys; titanium alloys, e.g., nickel-titanium alloys; polymers, e.g., polyethylene and copolymers thereof, polyethylene terephthalate or copolymers thereof, nylon, silicone, polyurethanes, fluoropolymers, poly(vinylchloride), and combinations thereof, depending on the amount of flexibility or stiffness desired. </p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"> The inserter may be preloaded with a single paranasal sinus device on or within the distal end of the conduit, but more than one device may be preloaded if desired. It may be preloaded on or within the inserter by the physician prior to insertion or preloaded on or within the inserter during the manufacturing process. Once access through a sinus ostium or surgically created fenestration has been obtained with the conduit, the sheath may be retracted to slidably deploy the nasal portion of the device. If the cavity member is self-expanding, then retraction of a sheath also causes the cavity member to be deployed. If expansion using a balloon is required, any balloon catheter (including double balloon catheters) known in the art may be advanced through the lumen in the conduit until the balloon lies within the cavity member. Inflation of the balloon thereby causes the cavity member to change from a first collapsed configuration to a second expanded configuration and contact the sinus cavity wall. An endoscope may also be used while positioning the inserter to aid with visualization of the ostium. Irrigation tools and electrocautery may also be employed if needed. </p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"> The following description provides an exemplary way of a how a single device might be deployed into a sinus using a sinus inserter. The sinus inserter typically includes a distal portion, a sinus device in its collapsed configuration on the distal portion, a handle, a conduit having a lumen, and a sheath connected to a retractable knob. Upon pulling the retractable knob, the knob moves proximally to abut the handle and slidably deploy the self-expanding nasal plate of the device. A balloon catheter may then be advanced through the lumen of the conduit into the distal portion of the inserter and inflated to expand the sinus device, such as the flexible mesh 40 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"> Method of manufacture. The method of preparing the devices of this invention will generally depend on the particular active agent or polymer used, form of the cavity member, and the release kinetics desired, but may be made by any one of the numerous methods known in the art. For example, the devices may be made by such processes as extrusion; injection or form molding; blow, film, or melt casting; welding; and other manufacturing techniques well known in the art (e.g., cutting and annealing). The filaments may be wet or melt spun, formed by laser or other cutting, formed by slitting, formed by extrusion, injection or other molding, or casting. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0009">Melt Extrusion of Fiber Containing 5 wt % Mometasone Furoate </heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"> Extruded ribbon fiber was made with mometasone furoate and poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide). The desired mometasone furoate content in the device was 5 wt % mometasone furoate. The poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was ester capped with a molar ratio of 70/30 DL-lactide/glycolide and had an inherent viscosity of 0.81 dL/g. The inherent viscosity was measured at 30&#xb0; C. with 0.5 gm/dL polymer concentration in chloroform. </p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"> First mometasone furoate (0.5 gm) and the poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (9.5 gm) were dissolved in methylene chloride (40 gm). A thin film was cast from the resulting solution. The cast film was dried in a vacuum oven for 48-96 hours to remove residual methylene chloride. The cast film was cut into thin strips approximately 10-20 mm wide and 100-150 mm long. Next a Tinius Olsen Model UE-4-78 melt plastometer was used to extrude the cast film strips. The Tinius Olsen is a solid block of steel about 80 mm in diameter and about 160 mm high/long with a hollow core about 13 mm in diameter. The discharge of the core has a shoulder that allows different size &#x201c;dies&#x201d; to be used based on the desired diameter of extruded rod. For this run, a custom machined die was used with internal core dimensions of 0.3556 mm&#xd7;2.0015 mm. The main block of the Tinius Olsen has heater bands encased by insulation and a shroud that allow the Tinius Olsen to be heated to a desired temperature. A thermocouple was used to measure the temperature of the block. The control system then uses the thermocouple values to either turn the heater bands on or off. Throughout the extrusion process, the heater bands will switch off and on to maintain the desired temperature. The cast film strips, approximately 4 gm, were loaded into the Tinius Olsen which had been equilibrated to 120&#xb0; C. A charging rod was placed in the core of the Tinius Olsen to compress the blend and a weight of 10 kg was placed oh the end of the charging rod to aid in the compaction of the blend. The equilibration time for the blend to melt lasted for about 20 minutes. After an extrusion load of 10,000 gm was placed on the charging rod, the plug was removed from the discharge area to begin the extrusion run. As the ribbon fiber was extruded from the discharge, it was pulled using a conveyor belt to the desired dimensions (0.3-0.4 mm&#xd7;1.0-1.2 mm). The 4-gm charge afforded 7-10 segments of extruded fiber each having a length of about 100 cm. </p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139"> A fiber formulation can be made with fluticasone proprionate with poly(DL-lactide) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide). The poly(lactide) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) can be capped or have acid end groups. The desired fluticasone proprionate content in the fiber can range from 0.1 wt % to 20 wt %. To prepare a long-acting formulation of fluticasone proprionate, particles of fluticasone proprionate and poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) can be dry blended in a variety of ways including the use of a mortar/pestle or by mixing preformed polymer and peptide particles in a V-blender to form a blended powder. Next this blend or admixture can be added to a twin-screw extruder having a machined die with a 2-mm diameter. The temperature of the extruder should be about 120&#xb0; C. As the fiber is extruded from the extruder, it will be collected on a conveyor belt. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0019">In Vitro Release of Mometasone Furoate From Candidate Compositions </heading>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"> The in vitro release of mometasone furoate from candidate formulations was determined, and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. To carry out this in vitro release study, each device was placed at 37&#xb0; C. in 1.0 wt % sodium dodectyl sulfate (SDS) in nanopure water, the receiving fluid. At each time point, the receiving fluid was removed completely and fresh receiving fluid was added. The amount of mometasone released into the receiving at each time point was quantified by HPLC. </p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"> In a first in vitro cumulative release study, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, cumulative release of mometasone furoate from a 2% mometasone/4% TEC fiber was about 6% at day 7, about 11% at day 14, about 14% at day 21, and about 15% at day 28. For the 5% mometasone/0% TEC fiber, cumulative mometasone release was about 4% at day 7, about 10% at day 14, about 12% at day 21, and about 12 at day 28. The 5% mometasone/2% TEC fiber cumulative mometasone release was about 3% at day 7, about 7% at day 14, about 9% at day 21, and about 9% at day 28. For the 10% mometasone/2% TEC fiber, cumulative mometasone release measured to be about 4% at day 7, 9% at day 14, 12% at day 21, and 12% at day 28. Additional drug release due to in vivo polymer biodegradation and clearance was demonstrated and directly observed as described above in the tissue concentration data. </p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"> Published in vitro cellular models using cultured human airway epithelial cells indicate drug concentration dose response curves for the most potent glucocorticoids, mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate, beginning as low as 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M (picomolar) and EC<sub>50 </sub>levels of transcriptional response at 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M (100 picomolar; maximal transcriptional response was seen in most cases by 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M (nanomolar) drug concentrations). These in vitro models have been accepted as equivalent to and highly correlated with in vivo models of efficacy (Romestan C. et al Fluticasone Propionate and Mometasone Furoate Have Equivalent Transcriptional Potencies, Clin Exp Allergy 2003; 33: 895-901). </p>
