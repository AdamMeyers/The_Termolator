<p id="p-0030" num="0032"> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. The detailed description and the drawings illustrate specific exemplary embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033"> Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein unless the context dictates otherwise. The meaning of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references. The meaning of &#x201c;in&#x201d; includes &#x201c;in&#x201d; and &#x201c;on.&#x201d; A reference to the singular includes a reference to the plural unless otherwise stated or inconsistent with the disclosure herein. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the use of an exemplary embodiment of a depilation device <b>100</b>. Device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a housing <b>102</b> which is of a size and shape suitable for being held in the hand <b>104</b> of a user. Certain components of the device <b>100</b> are housed within the housing <b>102</b>. The device <b>100</b> includes an active surface <b>106</b> which is placed against a skin surface <b>108</b> on which are hairs <b>110</b> that are to be shaved or trimmed. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a depilation device <b>100</b> of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Depilation device <b>100</b> includes housing <b>102</b> and active surface <b>106</b>. Located within housing <b>102</b> are a proximity sensor <b>112</b>, control circuitry <b>114</b>, light source <b>116</b>, and a high numerical aperture lens <b>118</b>. Proximity sensor <b>112</b> detects proximity of active surface <b>106</b> to the skin surface <b>108</b> and transmits proximity sense signal <b>113</b> to control circuitry <b>114</b>. High numerical aperture lens <b>118</b> modifies a beam of light from light source <b>116</b> to form a beam which converges to a narrow beam waist <b>120</b> and subsequently diverges. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036"> In use, depilation device <b>100</b> is positioned over skin surface <b>108</b> with active surface <b>106</b> adjacent skin surface <b>108</b>. When the active surface <b>106</b> of depilation device <b>100</b> is positioned at a distance d<sub>1 </sub>from skin surface <b>108</b>, beam waist <b>120</b> is located at a distance d<sub>2 </sub>from skin surface <b>108</b>. At this distance, a hair <b>110</b> located in the beam may be severed at beam waist <b>120</b>, while the beam will have diverged before reaching the skin surface to reduce the possibility of damage or irritation of the skin.

<p id="p-0036" num="0038"> An embodiment of a depilation method may include detecting proximity of a depilation device to a skin surface, responsive to detecting proximity of the depilation device to skin surface delivering a beam of highly convergent light from the depilation device to the skin surface, and delivering the light for a duration and with an intensity sufficient to sever at least one hair shaft. The beam of light may have a beam waist positioned substantially at the base of at least one hair shaft. Detecting proximity of the depilation device to the skin surface may include determining that the depilation device is within a predetermined distance range of the skin surface. The depilation device may include a light source, which in some embodiments may be enclosed within the depilation device. Alternatively, the light source may be located remote from the depilation device, with the depilation device receiving light from the remote light source via an optical coupling. In most embodiments the duration and the intensity of the light at the skin surface will be controlled so that they are insufficient to cause skin damage or irritation. The light may be delivered as a single pulse or a series of pulses. Pulse duration may be selected based upon one or more parameters of a hair shaft on which it is focused, e.g. light absorption spectrum, shaft dimension, etc. The device may be operable within a range of distances of the skin surface. Proximity or position sensing may be used to detect that the device is within the specified distance range, and permitting the device to be activated manually by the user (e.g. with a switch) when it is within the specified distance range. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039"> In some embodiments, the depilation device may include a light source, a lens, a proximity sensor, and control circuitry. The light source may be capable of producing light of a wavelength band absorbed by hair. The lens may be positioned to receive light from the light source and configured to form a highly convergent beam having a narrow spatially limited beam waist from the received light. The proximity sensor may be capable of detecting proximity of the light source to a skin surface and generating a proximity sense signal indicative of the proximity. The control circuitry is configured to gate the light in response to the proximity sense signal. The detected proximity may correspond to a selected distance range of the light source from the skin surface. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040"> In certain embodiments the beam of light may have an angle of convergence of between about 30 and about 80 degrees relative to the axis of the beam. In other embodiments, angles of convergence of between about 40 and about 60 degrees may be used. In still other embodiments, angles of convergence between about 45 and about 55 degrees relative to the axis of the beam may be used. Delivering a beam of highly convergent light may include the step of focusing a beam of light. It may also include forming a short narrow beam waist. The term short beam waist, as used herein, includes beam waists in the range of about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, and more specifically, in the range of about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 30 &#x3bc;m. The diameter of the beam at the skin surface may be between about two and about ten times the diameter of the beam at the beam waist. In some embodiments, the diameter of the beam at the skin surface may be between about two and three times the diameter of the beam waist. The intensity of the beam of light at the skin surface may be between about one fourth and about one ninth the intensity of the beam at the beam waist. In other embodiments the intensity of the beam at the skin surface may between about one fourth and one hundredth of the intensity of the beam at the beam waist. The duration and intensity of the light may be sufficient to cause absorption of light by the hair shaft, at the beam waist, of between about 50 and about 200 joules per gram. In other embodiments the duration and intensity of the light may be sufficient to cause absorption of between about 50 and about 100 joules per gram of energy from the light by the hair shaft at the beam waist. In most cases the absorption of light by the hair shaft will preferably be sufficient to cause mechanical damage or disruption of the hair shaft, while the light absorption at the skin surface will preferably be in a range that does not cause irritation or damage to the skin. In some embodiments, the duration and intensity of the light may be sufficient to cause absorption of between about 20 and about 40 joules per gram of energy from the light by the skin surface. In still other embodiments the duration and intensity of the light may be sufficient to cause absorption of between about 10 and about 80 joules per gram of energy from the light by the skin surface. The light fluence at the beam waist may be between about 4 and about 100 times the light fluence at the skin surface, or, in some embodiments, the light fluence at the beam waist is between about four and about nine times the light fluence at the skin surface. Light fluence levels below the level that causes mechanical damage or severing of the hair shaft may produce bleaching of the hair shaft. </p>

The device position is adjusted until it is determined at step <b>256</b> that the device is within the specified distance range of the skin surface. Process control then moves to step <b>258</b>, where a light source is activated to produce a highly convergent beam with a narrow, spatially limited beam waist. Rate of movement of the device across the skin surface is detected at step <b>260</b>, and the dwell time of the device over the current skin region is calculated at step <b>262</b>. If it is determined at step <b>264</b> that the calculated dwell time is less than the maximum permitted dwell time, process control returns to step <b>258</b>, and generation of a convergent beam with a narrow spatially limited beam waist is continued. Detection of rate of movement across the skin surface at step <b>260</b> and calculation of the dwell time over the skin region at step <b>262</b> are repeated until it is found, at step <b>264</b>, that the maximum permitted dwell time has been reached or surpassed. The light source is then deactivated at step <b>266</b>. If a user instruction to quit has been received, as determined at step <b>268</b>, the process ends. If no quit instruction has been received, process control returns to step <b>252</b>, the device position is adjusted, and the process continues as described previously, until a user instruction to quit is received. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of a depilation device <b>100</b>. As described previously, device <b>100</b> includes a light source <b>116</b> and a high numerical aperture lens <b>118</b> that modifies light from light source <b>116</b> to form a beam that converges to form a narrow beam waist. Device <b>100</b> further includes proximity sensor <b>112</b> and image detector <b>280</b>, both of which provide signals to control circuitry <b>114</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068"> Image detector <b>280</b> may be, for example, a CMOS or CCD image sensor. Control circuitry <b>114</b> generates a driver control signal <b>283</b> that is input to light source driver <b>284</b>, which in turn generates light source drive signal <b>285</b>. Image detector <b>280</b> detects an image of the skin surface, and image analyzer <b>282</b> processes the detected image signal to generate information which is utilized by control circuitry <b>114</b>. Image analyzer <b>282</b> may, for example, be configured to identify the presence of one or more hairs on the skin surface, so that light may be targeted to the hairs. Alternatively, image analyzer <b>282</b> may be configured to detect other characteristics of the skin which may be used to generate feedback control signals, such as skin color, which may indicate skin irritation (e.g., if redness is detected). Proximity sensor <b>112</b> may be any of a number of different types of proximity sensors, including but not limited to the exemplary proximity sensors illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>. When active surface <b>106</b> of depilation device <b>100</b> is positioned at a distance d, from skin surface <b>108</b>, beam waist <b>120</b> is located at a distance d<sub>2 </sub>from skin surface <b>108</b>. At this distance, a hair <b>110</b> located in the beam may be severed at beam waist <b>120</b>, providing the light fluence is sufficiently high at the beam waist to melt, vaporize, or otherwise cause sufficient mechanical damage or weakening of the hair shaft. The beam diverges between the beam waist and the skin surface so that the light fluence at the skin surface does not cause damage or irritation to the skin. </p>

The beam may cause cutting or mechanical damage to the hair shaft, or may have some other effect (bleaching, coloring, etc.). In some embodiments the effect of the beam may be varied along the length of the hair shaft, e.g. to produce bleaching in a desired pattern or to cause controlled texturing, shaping, coloring, or other effects in a pattern that varies along the length of the hair shaft. </p>

The plurality of mounting regions may be of defined width and arranged in a linear array. Each light source may be of a type that emits light having a waveband absorbed by hair. Each light source <b>606</b><i>a</i>-<b>606</b><i>j </i>may have a lens <b>610</b><i>a</i>-<b>610</b><i>j, </i>respectively, or other optical system or structure, associated therewith to produce a desired beam configuration. Each light source <b>606</b><i>a</i>-<b>606</b><i>j </i>is movable within its corresponding mounting region <b>604</b><i>a</i>-<b>604</b><i>j, </i>with the use of positioner <b>608</b><i>a</i>-<b>608</b><i>j. </i>The device may include a plurality of positioners, each corresponding to one light source and configured to adjust the position of the light source within its corresponding mounting region to direct light from the light source onto a targeted hair shaft. The device may also include one or more optical detectors (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, but generally as described and illustrated in connection with previous embodiments), configured to detect the presence and location of one or more hair shafts on the skin surface when the depilation device is positioned adjacent the skin surface. When depilation device <b>600</b> is positioned over a skin surface <b>108</b>, each mounting region <b>604</b><i>a</i>-<b>604</b><i>j </i>is positioned over a corresponding skin region <b>624</b><i>a</i>-<b>624</b><i>j. </i>If a hair (e.g. hair <b>620</b><i>b</i>) is detected within a skin region (e.g. <b>624</b><i>b</i>), the position of the corresponding light source (e.g. <b>606</b><i>b</i>) and its associated lens (e.g. <b>610</b><i>b</i>) is adjusted so that light from light source <b>606</b><i>b </i>is directed toward hair <b>620</b><i>b. </i>Each skin region corresponds to one of the plurality of mounting regions. By positioning and activating light sources within multiple mounting regions simultaneously, it is possible to remove hairs from multiple skin regions simultaneously. By moving depilation device <b>600</b> across the skin surface <b>108</b> in a direction perpendicular to the row of mounting regions, it is possible to depilate a swath of skin that is as wide as the array of mounting regions. The length of the swath will depend on how long, and at what speed, the depilation device <b>600</b> is moved over the skin surface. Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> the plurality of mounting regions is arranged in a substantially linear array, in other embodiments, other arrangements of mounting regions may be used, including two-dimensional arrays and non-linear arrays. Moreover, optical components, such as lenses, scanners, diffractive elements having reflective, refractive or diffractive charcteristics, or other components may direct light from one or more of the light sources (e.g., <b>606</b><i>b</i>) to spatially distinct locations. The device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may include a controller configured to drive each positioner in response to detection of one or more hair shafts by one or more optical detectors, and to drive each light source to generate light with an intensity and duration sufficient to produce mechanical failure of each targeted hair shaft. Light sources used in this embodiment may be light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, lasers, or other light sources. Light from each light source is focused by the corresponding lens to form a beam of light that converges to a short narrow beam waist and subsequently diverges. Each light source may be positioned by the positioner to locate the beam waist on a targeted hair shaft at a sufficient distance above the skin so surface that mechanical failure (or other effect of treatment) of the hair shaft occurs at the beam waist without the production of damage or irritation at the skin surface. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083"> In another alternative embodiment, instead of generating a convergent beam having a short, narrow beam waist, a depilation device may produce multiple beams of light that overlap to produce a high fluence overlap region having fluence sufficient to sever or produce mechanical damage to or failure of a hair shaft. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, three light sources <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, and <b>704</b> mounted in depilation device <b>705</b> are used. Beams <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, and <b>710</b> from light sources <b>700</b>, <b>702</b> and <b>704</b>, respectively, overlap to form overlap region <b>712</b>. The light sources are aimed so that light from the light sources overlaps spatially at an overlap region located at a desired distance above the skin surface. The light fluence at the overlap region may be controlled such that it is sufficient to cause mechanical failure of a hair within the overlap region, while light from the light sources striking the skin surface (e.g. at regions <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>718</b>) is sufficiently nonoverlapping that the light fluence at the skin surface is below the threshold for causing tissue damage or irritation. Light fluence at the overlap region may be sufficient to cause absorption of between about 50 and about 200 joules per gram by hair at the overlap region. In some embodiments, light fluence at the overlap region may be sufficient to cause absorption of between about 50 and about 100 joules per gram by hair at the overlap region. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, it is not necessary that the beams (e.g., <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, and <b>710</b>) be focused to form a converging beam if overlap of multiple beams is used to produce a sufficiently high light fluence at the overlap region. Individual beams may diverge, providing the fluence at the overlap region is sufficiently high to cause mechanical weakening or failure of the hair, while the fluence at the skin surface is low enough to avoid causing damage or irritation to the skin. However, in some embodiments it may be desirable to utilize individual light beams that are focused to form a beam waist, with the beams oriented so that the overlap occurs substantially at the beam waist(s) of one or more individual beams. Various numbers and configurations of light sources may be used to produce an overlap region. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is merely exemplary, and overlap of any number of beams, from two or more, may be used in various embodiments. Surface and target sensing, signal analysis, device powering, and control of light sources may operate generally as described previously in connection with other embodiments. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084"> In the broadest terms, a set of multiple light sources, which converge to an overlap region, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, or a single light source used in combination with suitable optics to generate a convergent beam with a narrow beam waist, can both be considered sources of convergent light with a restricted high fluence region.

<p id="p-0083" num="0085"> With regard to the hardware and/or software used in the control of depilation systems according to the present image, and particularly to the sensing, analysis, and control aspects of such systems, those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency or implementation convenience tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a solely software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will require optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware. </p>

Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.).

For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should NOT be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense of one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together).
