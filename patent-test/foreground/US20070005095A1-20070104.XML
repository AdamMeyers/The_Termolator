<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present invention relates to medical devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a removable vena cava clot filter that can be percutaneously placed in and removed from the vena cava of a patient. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Filtering devices that are percutaneously placed in the vena cava have been available for over thirty years. A need for filtering devices arises in trauma patients, orthopedic surgery patients, neurosurgery patients, or in patients having medical conditions requiring bed rest or non-movement. During such medical conditions, the need for filtering devices arises due to the likelihood of thrombosis in the peripheral vasculature of patients wherein thrombi break away from the vessel wall, risking downstream embolism or embolization. For example, depending on the size, such thrombi pose a serious risk of pulmonary embolism wherein blood clots migrate from the peripheral vasculature through the heart and into the lungs. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> A filtering device can be deployed in the vena cava of a patient when, for example, anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated or has failed. Typically, filtering devices are permanent implants, each of which remains implanted in the patient for life, even though the condition or medical problem that required the device has passed. In more recent years, filters have been used or considered in preoperative patients and in patients predisposed to thrombosis which places the patient at risk for pulmonary embolism. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The benefits of a vena cava filter have been well established, but improvements may be made. For example, filters generally have not been considered removable from a patient due to the likelihood of endotheliosis of the filter or fibrous reaction matter adherent to the endothelium during treatment. After deployment of a filter in a patient, proliferating intimal cells begin to accumulate around the filter struts which contact the wall of the vessel. After a length of time, such ingrowth prevents removal of the filter without risk of trauma, requiring the filter to remain in the patient. As a result, there has been a need for an effective filter that can be removed after the underlying medical condition has passed. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Moreover, conventional filters commonly become off-centered or tilted with respect to the hub of the filter and the longitudinal axis of the vessel in which it has been inserted. As a result, the filter including the hub and the retrieval hook engage the vessel wall along their lengths and potentially become endothelialized therein. This condition is illustrated in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>in which a prior art filter <b>113</b> has been delivered by a delivery sheath <b>125</b> through the vessel <b>150</b> of a patient. In the event of this occurrence, there is a greater likelihood of endotheliosis of the filter to the blood vessel along a substantial length of the filter wire. As a result, the filter becomes a permanent implant in a shorter time period than otherwise. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Furthermore, further improvements may be made related to the delivery or retrieval of vena cava filters. For delivery of vena cava filters, an introducer system having an introducer tube may be percutaneously inserted in the vena cava of a patient through the femoral vein or the jugular vein. A part of an introducer assembly <b>120</b> is illustrated in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>in which the prior art filter <b>113</b> is percutaneously delivered through the jugular vein <b>154</b> of a patient. As shown, the filter <b>113</b> in its collapsed configuration is placed at the distal end <b>121</b> of an inner sheath <b>122</b> with anchoring hooks <b>116</b> of the filter <b>113</b> extending past the distal end <b>121</b>. An outer sheath <b>126</b> is then disposed over the inner sheath <b>122</b> to avoid undesirably scratching or scraping of the anchoring hooks <b>116</b> against the introducer tube <b>130</b>. The inner and outer sheaths <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> along with a pusher member <b>132</b> are then moved together through the introducer tube <b>130</b> to deliver the filter <b>113</b> to the vena cava of the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> It has been a challenge to design a vena cava filter with features that lessen the concerns of undesirably scratching or scraping of the anchoring hooks against outer walls of an introducer tube or a blood vessel while maintaining the effectiveness of the filter. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> One embodiment of the present invention generally provides a removable vena cava filter configured for simplified delivery to and retrieval from the vena cava of a patient. The filter is shaped for easy delivery and retrieval. The filter is shaped to reduce the risk of scraping or tearing an introducer tube of a delivery/retrieval assembly for the filter. The filter includes primary struts having anchoring hooks which are configured to be positioned inwardly away from the walls of the blood vessel when in a collapsed state. Thus, the filter is configured to reduce the likelihood of undesirably scratching or scraping of the anchoring hooks against outer walls of an introducer tube or a blood vessel in the collapsed state. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The present invention provides a removable vena cava filter for capturing thrombi in a blood vessel. In one embodiment, the filter comprises a plurality of primary struts configured to form a netting pattern and receive thrombi in a vena cava of a patient. The primary struts have first ends attached together along a central or longitudinal axis. Each primary strut has an arcuate segment extending from the first end to an anchoring hook. The primary struts are configured to move between an expanded state for engaging the anchoring hooks with the blood vessel and a collapsed state for filter retrieval or delivery. Each primary strut is configured to cross another primary strut along the longitudinal axis in the collapsed state such that each anchoring hook faces or is inwardly positioned along the longitudinal axis away from the walls of the blood vessel for simplified filter retrieval or delivery. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In another embodiment, the removable filter further comprises a plurality of secondary struts having connected ends attached together along the longitudinal axis. Each secondary strut has a first arch extending from the connected end and a second arch extending from the first arch to a free end. The second arch is configured to engage the blood vessel to centralize the filter in the expanded state of the blood vessel. The filter further includes a hub configured to axially house the first ends of the plurality of primary struts and the connected ends of the secondary struts, and a retrieval hook extending from the hub opposite the plurality of primary struts for removal of the filter from the blood vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In yet another embodiment, the anchoring hooks in the expanded state define a first axial portion. The secondary struts in the expanded state define a second axial portion spaced from the first axial portion to centralize the filter in the blood vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In certain embodiments, pairs of secondary struts are positioned between pairs of primary struts. Each pair of secondary struts is twisted together near the connected ends of the secondary struts to form a twisted section. The twisted sections of the secondary struts effectively stiffen the struts to enhance their centering capabilities to prevent the filter from tilting when the filter is deployed in the blood vessel. Hence, engagement between the struts and the blood vessel is minimized which reduces the potential for the struts to become endothelialized within the blood vessel. A further feature of the twisted sections is that they prevent or at least minimize the secondary struts from entangling with the primary struts. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Further aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from consideration of the following description and the appended claims when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a vena cava filter <b>10</b> implanted in the vena cava <b>50</b> for the purpose of lysing or capturing thrombi carried by the blood flowing through the iliac veins <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> toward the heart and into the pulmonary arteries. As shown, the iliac veins <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> merge at juncture <b>58</b> into the vena cava <b>50</b>. The renal veins <b>60</b> from the kidneys <b>62</b> join the vena cava <b>50</b> downstream of juncture <b>58</b>. The portion of the vena cava <b>50</b>, between the juncture <b>58</b> and the renal veins <b>60</b>, defines the inferior vena cava <b>52</b> in which the vena cava filter <b>10</b> has been percutaneously deployed through one of the femoral veins. Preferably, the vena cava filter <b>10</b> has a length smaller than the length of the inferior vena cava <b>52</b>. If the lower part of the filter extends into the iliac veins, filtering effectiveness will be compromised and if the filter wires cross over the origin of the renal veins the filter wires might interfere with the flow of blood from the kidneys. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> This embodiment of the present invention will be further discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref> in which filter <b>10</b> is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>illustrates filter <b>10</b> in an expanded state and comprising four primary struts <b>12</b> each having first ends that emanate from a hub <b>11</b>. Hub <b>11</b> attaches by crimping first ends <b>14</b> of primary struts <b>12</b> together at a center point A in a compact bundle along a central or longitudinal axis X of the filter. The hub <b>11</b> has a minimal diameter for the size of wire used to form the struts. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Preferably, the primary struts <b>12</b> are formed of a superelastic material, stainless steel wire, Nitinol, cobalt-chromium-nickel-molybdenum-iron alloy, cobalt-chrome alloy or any other suitable material that will result in a self-opening or self-expanding filter. In this embodiment, the primary struts <b>12</b> are preferably formed from wire having a round or near round cross-section with a diameter of at least about 0.015 inches. Of course, it is not necessary that the primary struts have a round cross-section. For example, the primary struts <b>12</b> could take on any shape with rounded edges to maintain non-turbulent blood flow. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Each primary strut <b>12</b> includes an arcuate segment <b>16</b> having a soft S-shape. Each arcuate segment <b>16</b> is formed with a first curved portion <b>20</b> that is configured to softly bend away from the longitudinal or central axis X of the filter <b>10</b> and a second curved portion <b>23</b> that is configured to softly bend toward the longitudinal axis of the filter <b>10</b>. Due to the soft bends of each arcuate segment <b>16</b>, a prominence or a point of inflection on the primary strut <b>12</b> is substantially avoided to aid in non-traumatically engaging the vessel wall. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the primary struts <b>12</b> terminate at anchoring hooks <b>26</b> that will anchor in the vessel wall when the filter <b>10</b> is deployed at a delivery location in the blood vessel. The primary struts <b>12</b> are configured to move between an expanded state for engaging the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> with the blood vessel and a collapsed state for filter retrieval or delivery. In the expanded state, each arcuate segment <b>16</b> extends arcuately along a longitudinal axis X (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) and linearly relative to a radial axis R (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>) from the first end <b>14</b> to the anchoring hook <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, the primary struts <b>12</b> radially extend from the first ends <b>14</b>, defining the radial axis R. In this embodiment, the primary struts <b>12</b> extend linearly relative to the radial axis R and avoid entanglement with other struts. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> As discussed in greater detail below, the soft bends of each arcuate segment <b>16</b> allow each primary strut <b>12</b> to cross another primary strut <b>12</b> along the longitudinal axis X in the collapsed state such that each anchoring hook <b>26</b> faces or is inwardly positioned along the longitudinal axis X away from the blood vessel walls for filter retrieval or delivery. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> When the filter <b>10</b> is deployed in a blood vessel, the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> engage the walls of the blood vessel to define a first axial portion to secure the filter in the blood vessel. The anchoring hooks <b>26</b> prevent the filter <b>10</b> from migrating from the delivery location in the blood vessel where it has been deposited. The primary struts <b>12</b> are shaped and dimensioned such that, when the filter <b>10</b> is freely expanded, the filter <b>10</b> has a diameter of between about 25 mm and 45 mm and a length of between about 3 cm and 7 cm. For example, the filter <b>10</b> may have a diameter of about 35 mm and a length of about 5 cm when freely expanded. The primary struts <b>12</b> have sufficient spring strength that when the filter is deployed the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> will anchor into the vessel wall. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> In this embodiment, the filter <b>10</b> includes a plurality of secondary struts <b>30</b> having connected ends <b>32</b> attached that also emanate from hub <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. Hub <b>11</b> attaches by crimping the connected ends <b>32</b> at the center point A of the secondary struts <b>30</b> together with the primary struts <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, each primary strut <b>12</b> has two secondary struts <b>30</b> in side-by-side relationship with the primary strut <b>12</b>. The secondary struts <b>30</b> extend from the connected ends <b>32</b> to free ends <b>34</b> to centralize the filter <b>10</b> in the expanded state in the blood vessel. As shown, each secondary strut <b>30</b> extends arcuately along the longitudinal axis and linearly relative to the radial axis from the connected end <b>32</b> to the free end <b>34</b> for engaging the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> with the blood vessel. As with the primary struts <b>12</b>, the secondary struts <b>30</b> extend linearly relative to the radial axis and avoid entanglement with other struts. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The secondary struts <b>30</b> may be made from the same type of material as the primary struts <b>12</b>. However, the secondary struts <b>30</b> may have a smaller diameter, e.g., at least about 0.012 inches, than the primary struts <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, each of the secondary struts <b>30</b> is formed of a first arc <b>40</b> and a second arc <b>42</b>. The first arc <b>40</b> extends from the connected end <b>32</b> away from the longitudinal axis X. The second arc <b>42</b> extends from the first arc <b>40</b> towards the longitudinal axis X. As shown, two secondary struts <b>30</b> are located on each side of one primary strut <b>12</b> to form a part of a netting configuration of the filter <b>10</b>. The hub <b>11</b> is preferably made of the same material as the primary struts and secondary struts to minimize the possibility of galvanic corrosion or molecular changes in the material due to welding. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> When freely expanded, free ends <b>34</b> of the secondary struts <b>30</b> will expand radially outwardly to a diameter of about 25 mm to 45 mm to engage the vessel wall. For example, the secondary struts <b>30</b> may expand radially outwardly to a diameter of between about 35 mm and 45 mm. The second arcs <b>42</b> of the free ends <b>34</b> engage the wall of a blood vessel to define a second axial portion where the vessel wall is engaged. The secondary struts <b>30</b> function to stabilize the position of the filter <b>10</b> about the center of the blood vessel in which it is deployed. As a result, the filter <b>10</b> has two layers or portions of struts longitudinally engaging the vessel wall of the blood vessel. The length of the filter <b>10</b> is preferably defined by the length of a primary strut <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the diameter of the hub <b>11</b> is defined by the size of a bundle containing the primary struts <b>12</b> and secondary struts <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the eight secondary struts <b>30</b> minimally add to the diameter of the hub <b>11</b> or the overall length of the filter <b>10</b>, due to the reduced diameter of each secondary strut <b>30</b>. This is accomplished while maintaining the filter <b>10</b> in a centered attitude relative to the vessel wall and formed as a part of the netting configuration of the filter <b>10</b>. As shown, removal hook <b>46</b> extends from hub <b>11</b> opposite primary and secondary struts <b>12</b> and <b>30</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> In this embodiment, each arcuate segment <b>16</b> has a thickness of at least about 0.015 inch and a tensile strength of between about 285,000 pounds per square inch (psi) and 330,000 psi. Each anchoring hook <b>26</b> is integral with the arcuate segment <b>16</b> and has the thickness and the tensile strength of the arcuate segment. Each secondary strut <b>30</b> has a thickness of at least about 0.012 inch and a tensile strength of between about 285,000 psi and 330,000 psi. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>illustrates the filter <b>10</b> in a collapsed state disposed in a delivery/retrieval tube <b>94</b> for delivery or retrieval. As shown, the filter <b>10</b> is shaped for each primary strut <b>12</b> to cross another primary strut <b>12</b> along the longitudinal axis X. As a result, shown in the collapsed state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> are configured to be inverted or be inwardly faced or positioned along the longitudinal axis X away from the blood vessel walls for retrieval and delivery of the filter <b>10</b>. This inverted or inwardly facing configuration of the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> allows for simplified delivery and retrieval of filter <b>10</b>. For example, a concern that the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> in the collapsed state may scrape, scratch, or tear the inner wall of a delivery/retrieval tube is eliminated, since the filter <b>10</b> of the present invention is shaped to have the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> inwardly face toward or positioned adjacent each other and away from the walls of the blood vessel. In fact, a set of inner and outer delivery/retrieval sheaths (see prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) may be eliminated during the delivery or retrieval of the filter <b>10</b> through the jugular or femoral vein. Rather, merely one delivery/retrieval tube with a loop snare mechanism may be used to deliver or retrieve the filter <b>10</b> of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>in the collapsed state, each primary strut <b>12</b> is configured to cross another primary strut <b>12</b> along the longitudinal axis X such that the arcuate segments <b>16</b>, first curved portions <b>20</b> or second curved portions <b>23</b>, occupy a first diameter D<sub>1</sub>. In this embodiment, the first diameter is greater than a second diameter D<sub>2 </sub>occupied by the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> for filter retrieval or delivery. It has been found that the first diameter of the arcuate segments <b>16</b> serves to clear a path of retrieval, reducing radial force from the sheath or blood vessel on the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> during removal of the filter <b>10</b> from a patient. Reducing the radial force on the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> assists in preventing the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> from scraping, scratching, or tearing the inner wall of a sheath during removal of the filter <b>10</b> from a patient. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> In this embodiment of the present invention, it is to be noted that the filter <b>10</b> may be delivered or retrieved by any suitable introducer (delivery or retrieval) tube. However, it is preferred that the introducer tube has an inside diameter of between about 4.5 French and 16 French, and more preferably between about 6.5 French and 14 French. </p>

The distal bend <b>43</b> allows the filter <b>10</b> to filter thrombi effectively at a smaller inside diameter of a blood vessel than otherwise would be possible while maintaining the ability to collapse for delivery or retrieval. </p>

For deployment of the filter <b>10</b>, a delivery tube is percutaneously inserted through the patient's vessel such that the distal end of the delivery tube is at the location of deployment. In this embodiment, a wire guide is preferably used to guide the delivery tube to the location of deployment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the filter <b>10</b> is inserted through the proximal end of the delivery tube <b>48</b> with the removal hook <b>46</b> leading and anchoring hooks <b>26</b> of the primary struts <b>12</b> held by a filter retainer member for delivery via the femoral vein of a patient. </p>

In this embodiment, a pusher wire having a pusher member at its distal end may be fed through the proximal end of the delivery tube <b>50</b> thereby pushing the filter <b>10</b> until the filter <b>10</b> reaches the distal end of the delivery tube <b>50</b> to a desired location. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> During deployment, the secondary struts <b>30</b> expand first to centralize or balance the filter within the vessel. When the free ends of the secondary struts emerge from the distal end of either of the delivery tubes <b>48</b> or <b>50</b>, the secondary struts <b>30</b> expand to an expanded position as shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. The second arcs <b>42</b> engage the inner wall of the vessel.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> When the filter <b>10</b> is fully expanded in the vena cava, the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> of the primary struts <b>12</b> and the second arcs <b>42</b> of the secondary struts <b>30</b> are in engagement with the vessel wall. The anchoring hooks <b>26</b> of the primary struts <b>12</b> have anchored the filter <b>10</b> at the location of deployment in the vessel, preventing the filter <b>10</b> from moving with the blood flow through the vessel. As a result, the filter <b>10</b> is supported by two sets of struts that are spaced axially along the length of the filter. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the filter <b>10</b> fully expanded after being deployed in inferior vena cava <b>52</b>.

The direction of the blood flow BF is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the arrow that is labeled BF. The anchoring hooks <b>26</b> at the ends of the primary struts <b>12</b> are shown as being anchored in the inner lining of the inferior vena cava <b>52</b>. The anchoring hooks <b>26</b> include barbs <b>29</b> that, in one embodiment, project toward the hub <b>11</b> of the filter. The barbs <b>29</b> function to retain the filter <b>10</b> in the location of deployment. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The spring biased configuration of the primary struts <b>12</b> further causes the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> to engage the vessel wall and anchor the filter at the location of deployment. After initial deployment, the pressure of the blood flow on the filter <b>10</b> contributes in maintaining the barbs <b>29</b> anchored in the inner lining of the inferior vena cava <b>52</b>.

The netting pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>functions to catch thrombi carried in the blood stream prior to reaching the heart and lungs to prevent the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. The netting pattern is sized to catch and stop thrombi that are of a size that are undesirable to be carried in the vasculature of the patient. Due to its compacted size, the hub minimally resists blood flow. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>illustrates the netting pattern including primary struts and secondary struts at substantially equal angular space relative to each other. The netting pattern provides an even distribution between the primary and secondary struts to the blood flow, increasing the likelihood of capturing thrombi. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, it is to be understood that each of the sets of primary struts <b>312</b> and secondary struts <b>330</b> may be independently spaced substantially equally at their respective portions relative to radial axis R&#x2032;. For example, the secondary struts <b>330</b> may be spaced equally relative to the other secondary struts <b>330</b> and the primary struts <b>312</b> may be spaced equally relative to the other primary struts <b>312</b>. As a result, the netting pattern in this embodiment shown by the cross-sectional view of the vena cava (taken along line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b>) will have uneven or unequal spacing between the primary struts <b>312</b> and secondary struts <b>330</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>illustrate part of a retrieval device <b>65</b> being used in a procedure for removing the filter <b>10</b> from the inferior vena cava <b>52</b>. In this embodiment, the retrieval device <b>65</b> is percutaneously introduced into the superior vena cava via the jugular vein. Of course, the filter may be retrieved via the femoral vein. In this procedure, a removal catheter or sheath <b>68</b> of the retrieval device <b>65</b> is inserted into the superior vena cava. A wire <b>70</b> having a loop snare <b>72</b> at its distal end is threaded through the removal sheath <b>68</b> and is exited through the distal end of the sheath <b>68</b>. The wire <b>70</b> is then manipulated by any suitable means from the proximal end of the retrieval device such that the loop snare <b>72</b> captures the removal hook <b>46</b> of the filter <b>10</b>. Using counter traction by pulling the wire <b>70</b> while pushing the sheath <b>68</b>, the sheath <b>68</b> is passed over the filter <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> As the sheath <b>68</b> passes over the filter <b>10</b>, the primary struts <b>12</b> and then the secondary struts <b>30</b> engage the edge of the sheath <b>68</b> and are caused to pivot or undergo bend deflection at the hub <b>11</b> toward the longitudinal axis of the filter. The pivoting toward the longitudinal axis causes the ends of the struts <b>12</b> and <b>30</b> to be retracted from the vessel wall. In this way, only surface lesions <b>74</b> and small point lesions <b>76</b> on the vessel wall are created in the removal procedure. As shown, the surface lesions <b>74</b> are created by the ends of the secondary struts <b>30</b> and the small point legions <b>76</b> are created by the anchoring hooks <b>26</b> of the primary struts <b>12</b>. However, it is to be noted that any other suitable procedure may be implemented to remove the filter from the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> The primary and secondary struts can be formed from any suitable material that will result in a self-opening or self-expanding filter, such as shape memory alloys. Shape memory alloys have the desirable property of becoming rigid, that is, returning to a remembered state, when heated above a transition temperature. A shape memory alloy suitable for the present invention is Ni&#x2014;Ti available under the more commonly known name Nitinol. When this material is heated above the transition temperature, the material undergoes a phase transformation from martensite to austenic, such that material returns to its remembered state. The transition temperature is dependent on the relative proportions of the alloying elements Ni and Ti and the optional inclusion of alloying additives. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> In other embodiments, both the primary struts and the secondary struts are made from Nitinol with a transition temperature that is slightly below normal body temperature of humans, which is about 98.6&#xb0; F. Thus, when the filter is deployed in the vena cave and exposed to normal body temperature, the alloy of the struts will transform to austenite, that is, the remembered state, which for the present invention is an expanded configuration when the filter is deployed in the blood vessel. To remove the filter, the filter is cooled to transform the material to martensite which is more ductile than austenite, making the struts more malleable. As such, the filter can be more easily collapsed and pulled into the sheath for removal. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> In certain embodiments, both the primary struts and the secondary struts are made from Nitinol with a transition temperature that is above normal body temperature of humans, which is about 98.6&#xb0; F. Thus, when the filter is deployed in the vena cave and exposed to normal body temperature, the struts are in the martensitic state so that the struts are sufficiently ductile to bend or form into a desired shape, which for the present invention is an expanded configuration. To remove the filter, the filter is heated to transform the alloy to austenite so that the filter becomes rigid and returns to a remembered state, which for the filter is a collapsed configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> Although the embodiments of this device have been disclosed as being constructed from wire having a round cross section, it could also be cut from a tube of suitable material by laser cutting, electrical discharge machining or any other suitable process. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a filter <b>420</b> includes four primary struts <b>438</b> and eight secondary struts <b>440</b> that extend from a hub <b>442</b>. Each primary strut <b>438</b> terminates in an anchoring hook <b>452</b> with a barb <b>454</b>. The primary struts <b>438</b> have sufficient spring strength such that when the filter is deployed in a vena cava <b>436</b>, the anchoring hooks <b>452</b>, in particular, the barbs <b>444</b>, anchor into the vessel wall of the vena cava <b>436</b> to prevent the filter <b>420</b> from migrating from the delivery location. The pressure of the blood flow on the filter <b>420</b> contributes in maintaining the barbs <b>454</b> anchored in the inner lining of the vena cava <b>436</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> A pair of secondary struts <b>440</b> are positioned between adjacent primary struts <b>438</b>. Each secondary strut <b>440</b> extends from the hub <b>442</b> and terminates in a tip <b>462</b> pointing toward the central axis <b>444</b>. The tips <b>462</b> are located longitudinally between the hub <b>442</b> and the anchoring hooks <b>454</b> of the primary struts <b>438</b>. The connected ends of each pair of secondary struts <b>440</b> positioned between adjacent primary struts are twisted together, defining a twisted section <b>464</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> Since the twisted sections <b>464</b> effectively stiffens each pair of secondary struts <b>440</b>, thinner secondary struts may be used to provide the appropriate balancing forces to center the filter in the blood vessel. Moreover, an additional benefit of the twisted section is that they prevent the secondary struts from entangling with the primary struts. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> The secondary struts <b>440</b> can be made from the same type of material as the primary struts <b>438</b> and can be formed by the same process used to form the primary struts. However, the secondary struts may have a smaller diameter than the primary struts. To form the twisted sections <b>464</b>, each pair of secondary struts <b>440</b> positioned between adjacent primary struts <b>438</b> can be twisted about each other after the struts have been attached to the hub <b>442</b>. Each twisted section <b>464</b> includes one or more twists. For example, each twisted section <b>464</b> may include up to about ten twists. In certain implementations, the number of twists in each section <b>464</b> may be between about three to five twists. Increasing the number of twists increases the stiffness of the pair of secondary struts twisted about each other. The hub <b>442</b> is preferably made of the same material as the primary struts and secondary struts to minimize the possibility of galvanic corrosion. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a netting pattern (&#x201c;net&#x201d;) formed by the primary struts <b>438</b>, the secondary struts <b>440</b>, and the hub <b>442</b>. This net functions to catch thrombi carried in the blood stream to prevent the thrombi from reaching the heart and lungs, where the thrombi could cause pulmonary embolism. The net is sized to catch and stop thrombi that are of a size that are undesirable in the vasculature of the patient. As illustrated, the struts <b>438</b> have substantially equal angular spacing between the struts. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> The hub <b>442</b> and a removal hook <b>466</b> attached to the hub are located downstream of the location at which the anchoring hooks <b>452</b> are anchored in the vessel <b>436</b>.
