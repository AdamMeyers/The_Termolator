<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present application relates to plunger assemblies and, more particularly, to telescoping plunger assemblies. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Syringe assemblies have been used to deliver bone filler to patients. Typically, syringe assemblies include a syringe barrel with an opening at one end for delivering the bone filler. A plunger assembly is usually adapted to pass through the syringe barrel and push the bone filler through that opening. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In order to deliver a greater amount of bone filler, from a syringe assembly, typically, a larger syringe barrel is provided (i.e., a barrel that is larger in diameter and/or longer). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present disclosure relates to telescoping plunger assemblies for a material delivery device. The material delivery device typically includes a first compartment to temporarily store the material and a syringe barrel coupled to the first compartment. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically from a compacted state substantially contained within a first compartment of the device through the syringe barrel to dispense material. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In some implementations, the material delivery device is a bone filler mixing and delivery device. Examples of bone cement mixing and delivery devices are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/438,471, 10/637,908 and 11/252,515, which are incorporated by reference. A person of ordinary skill would understand that the techniques and devices disclosed herein could be readily adapted to any type of material delivery device. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In one aspect, a bone filler mixing and delivery device includes a mixing section with a mixing element adapted to mix components to form bone filler. A syringe barrel is coupled to the mixing section and has an opening through which the bone filler can be dispensed. A controllable portal (also referred to as an access portal) is provided that can be manipulated to open a flow path between the mixing section and the syringe barrel. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically in an axial direction through the syringe barrel to dispense the bone filler through the opening. In certain implementations, the plunger assembly is adapted to telescopically retract to a position completely contained within the mixing section. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In some implementations, the telescoping plunger assembly includes a drive shaft that can be rotated about an axis, a lead screw threaded to the drive shaft and a plunger shaft threaded to the lead screw. Typically, in those implementations, the drive shaft is restricted from moving in an axial direction and the plunger shaft is restricted from moving in a rotational direction. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> According to some implementations, rotation of the drive shaft causes relative rotation between the lead screw and at least one of either the plunger shaft or the drive shaft. Typically, in those implementations, the relative rotation causes the plunger shaft to move axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Certain implementations include a support sleeve adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft. In those implementations, the plunger shaft can be coupled to the support sleeve in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in an axial direction, but restricts relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in a rotational direction. In some implementations, a longitudinal slot is formed in the plunger shaft and a pin extends from the support sleeve to engage the longitudinal slot and prevent the plunger shaft from rotating about the axis. The pin may be adapted to move longitudinally through the longitudinal slot as the plunger shaft is moved axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In another aspect, a material delivery device includes a syringe barrel with a portal for loading material into it and an opening through which the material can be dispensed. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically through the syringe barrel to dispense the material through the opening. In some implementations, the plunger assembly is adapted to retract telescopically to a position completely outside of the syringe barrel. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In some implementations, the material delivery device has a drive shaft that can be rotated about an axis, a lead screw that is threaded to the drive shaft and a plunger shaft that is threaded to the lead screw. In some of those implementations, the drive shaft is restricted from moving in an axial direction and the plunger shaft is restricted from moving in a rotational direction. In some of those implementations, rotation of the drive shaft causes relative rotation between the lead screw and at least one of either the plunger shaft or the drive shaft, and the relative rotation causes the plunger shaft to move axially through the material delivery device. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> According to some implementations, a support sleeve is adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft. In those implementations, the plunger shaft is coupled to the support sleeve in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in an axial direction, but restricts relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in a rotational direction. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In certain implementations, a longitudinal slot is formed in the plunger shaft and the material delivery device includes a pin that extends from the support sleeve to engage the longitudinal slot and prevent the plunger shaft from rotating about the axis. In such implementations, the pin is adapted to move longitudinally through the longitudinal slot as the plunger shaft is moved axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Some implementations include a support sleeve that is movable in an axial direction, where the pin is adapted to drag the sleeve in the axial direction with the plunger shaft as the plunger shaft moves beyond an axial position where the pin reaches an end of the longitudinal slot. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Particular implementations include a first section that is coupled to the syringe barrel. In those implementations, the first section is adapted to store the material and the plunger assembly is adapted to extend from the first section through the syringe barrel. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> In some implementations, one or more of the following advantages may be present. By implementing a telescoping plunger assembly, material delivery devices, such as a bone filler mixing and delivery devices, may be made more compact than would be otherwise possible. Additionally, such devices might be made easier to handle, which can be particularly important in tight quarters, such as in an operating room. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The present disclosure relates to a telescoping plunger assembly for a material delivery device. The telescoping plunger assembly includes a syringe barrel with an opening through which material is dispensed and a portal for loading material into the syringe barrel. The plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically from a compacted state substantially outside the syringe barrel going through the syringe barrel to dispense material. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> In some implementations, the material delivery device is a device adapted to mix and deliver bone filler. Typical bone fillers include bone cement based materials (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)), coral based materials (e.g., Hydroxyapatite), calcium sulfates, beta tricalcium phosphates, silica based materials (e.g., ceramics), and human demineralized bone matrices and polymers, such as biocompatible polylatic-co-glycolic acid (i.e., &#x201c;plaga&#x201d;). </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a bone filler mixing and delivery device <b>100</b> that includes a mixing section <b>102</b> adapted to mix one or more components to form bone filler. A syringe barrel <b>104</b> is coupled to the mixing section <b>102</b> and has an opening <b>106</b>, through which the bone filler can be dispensed. A collar <b>108</b> is positioned between the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b> and can be manipulated by a user to actuate a controllable portal that opens a flow path between the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> A plunger assembly (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or <b>1</b>B) is provided inside the mixing and delivery device <b>100</b> and is adapted to extend from a retracted position substantially (or completely) contained within the mixing section <b>102</b> in a telescopic manner through the syringe barrel <b>104</b> to dispense bone filler through the opening <b>106</b> at the end of the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> A cover assembly <b>114</b> is coupled to the mixing section <b>102</b>. The cover assembly <b>114</b> includes a cap assembly <b>116</b> and a crank handle <b>118</b>. According to the illustrated implementation, the cap assembly <b>116</b> is coupled directly to the mixing section housing <b>102</b>. The crank handle <b>118</b> is coupled to the cap assembly <b>116</b> with a hinged connection (at <b>120</b>). The crank handle <b>118</b> can be moved about the hinged connection between a first position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and a second position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In some implementations, when the crank handle <b>118</b> is in the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), it engages mixing paddles inside the mixing chamber, and when the crank handle <b>118</b> is in the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), it engages the telescoping plunger assembly. From either the first position or the second position, the crank handle <b>118</b> can be rotated about an axis of the device <b>100</b> to drive whichever element it is engaged to. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> In a typical use of the device <b>100</b>, bone filler components are introduced into the mixing section <b>102</b>. With the crank handle in the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), a user rotates the crank handle <b>118</b> to mix the bone filler components with the mixing paddles inside the mixing section <b>102</b>. Once the components are mixed sufficiently, the user opens the controllable portal by manipulating collar <b>108</b> to open a flow path between the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. The mixed bone filler can then pass through the flow path into the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. The user may continue to drive the mixing paddles until a desired amount of mixed bone filler has been introduced into the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Once a desired amount of bone filler has been introduced into the syringe barrel <b>104</b>, the user moves the crank handle <b>118</b> about the hinged connection to the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). From the second position, the user rotates the crank handle <b>118</b> to drive the plunger assembly. The plunger assembly extends in an axial direction from a retracted position substantially contained within the mixing section <b>102</b>. The extension occurs in a telescopic manner through the syringe barrel <b>104</b> to dispense the bone filler through opening <b>106</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded view of a bone filler mixing and delivery device <b>100</b> with a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated device <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> for a mixing section (<b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>). A syringe barrel <b>104</b> is adapted to be coupled to mixing section housing <b>102</b>. The syringe barrel <b>104</b> has an opening <b>106</b> at a forward end, through which mixed bone filler can be dispensed. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The illustrated device <b>100</b> includes a controllable portal that includes a collar <b>108</b> that can be manipulated by a user to open a flow path between the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b>, and a sliding tube <b>109</b> that is adapted to be coupled to the collar <b>108</b> so that manipulation of the collar <b>108</b> translates into movement of the sliding tube <b>109</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In some implementations, the sliding tube <b>109</b> includes openings that can be aligned with corresponding openings in the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b> to provide a flow path between those areas. In those implementations, manipulating the controllable portal in a particular manner results in the alignment of the sliding tube's <b>109</b> opening with the corresponding openings in the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. Preferably, the sliding tube <b>109</b> can form a tight seal with both the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe tube <b>104</b> so that when the flow path is not provided, material cannot accidentally flow from the mixing section <b>102</b> to the syringe tube <b>104</b>. Such sealing may be provided, for example, by o-rings <b>222</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> In some implementations, the controllable portal consists of a collar <b>108</b> that is coupled to the sliding tube <b>109</b>. Such implementations may be adapted so that when the collar <b>108</b> is rotated axially, the sliding tube <b>109</b> moves in an axial (or other) direction through the device <b>100</b> to align one or more ports on the sliding tube with ports elsewhere in the device <b>100</b> and thereby open a flow path between the mixing section <b>102</b> and the syringe barrel <b>104</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The illustrated device includes a telescoping plunger assembly. The telescoping plunger assembly includes a drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>, a lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>adapted to be coupled to the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>, a plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>adapted to be coupled to the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b</i>, a plunger seal <b>202</b><i>d </i>and a seal retaining screw <b>202</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> A portion <b>110</b> of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a </i>is adapted to be coupled selectively to a corresponding gripping feature in the crank handle <b>118</b>. The drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a </i>also includes an opening (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but shown as <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) that extends axially from a forward end of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>. That opening has internal threads that can engage a corresponding set of threads at on the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b</i>. The forward end <b>232</b> of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a </i>has an outer diameter that is turned down to facilitate engagement with a support sleeve <b>212</b> for the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. Such engagement may help provide support for the support sleeve <b>212</b> when the telescoping plunger assembly is in a retracted position, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>has a wide portion <b>204</b> and a narrow portion <b>206</b>, both of which have external threads. The threads on the wide portion <b>204</b> of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>are adapted to engage a corresponding set of internal threads on the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>. The threads on the narrow portion <b>206</b> of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>are adapted to engage corresponding internal threads on the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. In some implementations, a multiple lead thread is formed on the narrow portion <b>206</b> of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>to maximize the axial distance that the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>moves with each rotation of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> According to the illustrated implementation, a seal retaining screw <b>202</b><i>e </i>is adapted to hold the plunger seal <b>202</b><i>d </i>in place at a front section <b>208</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. The front section <b>208</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>has an internally threaded opening that extends axially rearward from its front surface. That internally threaded opening is adapted to received and engage the seal retaining screw <b>202</b><i>e</i>. The seal retaining screw <b>202</b><i>e </i>is adapted to pass partially through an axial opening in the plunger seal <b>202</b><i>d </i>and hold the plunger seal <b>202</b><i>d </i>in place at the front section <b>208</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. The seal retaining screw <b>202</b><i>e </i>prevents the seal <b>202</b><i>d </i>from slipping off the front of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> The plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>also includes a rear section <b>210</b> that has a smaller outer diameter than its front section <b>208</b>. The rear section <b>210</b> has an opening that extends forward from a rear surface of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>in an axial direction. That opening is adapted to receive the narrow portion <b>206</b> of the lead shaft <b>202</b><i>b</i>. The opening has internal threads that are adapted to engage a corresponding set of external threads on the narrow portion <b>206</b> of the lead shaft <b>202</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> The rear section <b>210</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>has at least one slot <b>214</b> in its outer surface that extends longitudinally along a portion of the length of the rear section <b>210</b>. In the illustrated implementation, the longitudinal slot <b>214</b> extends from just behind the front section <b>208</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>rearward to a short distance from the opposite end of the rear section <b>210</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> A support sleeve <b>212</b> is provided for the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. In the illustrated implementation, the support sleeve <b>212</b> has an axial opening, through which the rear section <b>210</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>can pass. The rear section <b>210</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>is adapted to pass snugly through the support sleeve <b>212</b>. The support sleeve <b>212</b> also is adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. According to the illustrated implementation, the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>is coupled to the support sleeve <b>212</b> in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>and the support sleeve <b>212</b> in an axial direction, but prevents relative motion between the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>and the support sleeve <b>212</b> in a rotational direction. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> More specifically, pins <b>215</b> are provided that extend through holes in support sleeve <b>212</b> radially inward toward the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>and engage the longitudinal slot <b>214</b> formed in the rear section <b>210</b> of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. The pins <b>215</b> prevent relative motion between the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>and the support sleeve <b>212</b> in a rotational direction. Accordingly, when the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b</i>, to which the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>is threaded, rotates inside the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>, the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>is forced to move in an axial direction. When the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>moves in the axial direction, the pins <b>215</b> move along the length of the longitudinal slot <b>214</b>. When the pins <b>215</b> reach the end of the longitudinal slots, any further motion of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>in the forward direction, causes the pins <b>215</b> to drag the support sleeve <b>212</b> in the forward axial direction along with the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> According to the illustrated implementation, the sliding tube <b>109</b> is adapted to support the support sleeve <b>212</b>. More specifically, the support sleeve is adapted to fit closely within an axially opening through the sliding tube <b>109</b>. The sliding tube <b>109</b> is coupled to the housing <b>102</b> in such a manner as to permit relative motion between the sliding tube <b>109</b> and the housing <b>102</b> in an axial direction, but to prevent relative motion between the sliding tube <b>109</b> and the housing <b>102</b> in a rotational direction. Likewise, support sleeve <b>212</b> is coupled to sliding tube <b>109</b> to permit axial motion but prevent rotation. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The illustrated bone filler mixing and delivery device <b>100</b> also includes a retaining ring <b>216</b> adapted to be coupled to a forward end of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>. When the retaining ring <b>216</b> is coupled to the forward end of the drive shaft, it prevents the wide portion <b>204</b> of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>from inadvertently screwing out of and becoming disengaged from the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, when the rear end <b>204</b> of the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>reaches the forward end of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>, it contacts the retaining ring <b>216</b>, which prevents the lead screw <b>202</b><i>b </i>from moving forward any further. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> The illustrated bone filler mixing and delivery device <b>100</b> also includes a drive shaft retaining ring <b>218</b> that is adapted to be coupled to a rear end of the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a</i>. When the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a </i>is positioned inside the mixing element <b>228</b> so that its rear portion <b>110</b> is exposed through the rear end of the mixing element, the drive shaft retaining ring <b>218</b> prevents the drive shaft <b>202</b><i>a </i>from moving axially with respect to the mixing element <b>228</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> An O-ring <b>220</b> is provided to seal the mixing section <b>102</b> at the interface between the housing <b>102</b> and the cover assembly <b>114</b>. </p>

The support sleeve <b>212</b> provides mechanical support to the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. Two longitudinal slots (not visible) are formed on opposite sides of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. Pins <b>215</b> pass radially inward through the support sleeve <b>212</b> and engage the longitudinal slots formed in the outer surface of the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c</i>. Accordingly, the plunger shaft <b>202</b><i>c </i>is permitted to move in an axial direction relative to the support sleeve <b>212</b>, but is prevented from rotating relative to the support sleeve <b>212</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> The support sleeve <b>212</b> passes through and is supported by the sliding tube <b>109</b> and by the mixing element <b>228</b>. The support sleeve <b>212</b> includes grooves that extend longitudinally along its outer surface. Those grooves are coupled to corresponding fingers that extend radially inward from the sliding tube <b>109</b>. Accordingly, the support sleeve <b>212</b> is prevented from rotating relative to the sliding tube <b>109</b>, but is permitted to move axially relative to the sliding tube <b>109</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> The sliding tube <b>109</b> is supported by the forward end of the mixing element <b>228</b> and by the housing <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Various modifications of the techniques and structures described herein are possible. For example, although the above discussion is directed primarily to a bone filler mixing and delivery device, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the techniques and structures disclosed could be applied beneficially to any device that mixes and delivers fluids other than bone filler. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Additionally, the techniques and structures described above could be readily incorporated into a fluid delivery device that does not include a mixing section. Such a device may simply include a temporary storage compartment (without a mixing element) coupled to a syringe barrel. In those instances, the telescoping plunger assembly may be adapted to retract to a compact state substantially contained within the temporary storage compartment.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Moreover, various different arrangements may be utilized to restrict relative motion between parts in one manner, but to permit relative motion in another manner. For example, in some implementations, mating internal and external hexagonal (or other shaped) surfaces may be provided. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> Additionally, other methods could be implemented to restrict relative motion between the various components discussed above. For example, the plunger shaft could have an outer surface that is shaped like a hexagon and the support sleeve, within which the plunger shaft sits, could have an axial passage that is shaped like a hexagon as well. In such an implementation, when the plunger shaft is positioned inside the passage, the plunger shaft would be allowed to move axially relative to the support sleeve, but its relative rotational freedom would be restricted. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> Also, the controllable portal that is provided to enable a user to open a flow path between the mixing section and the syringe barrel can be any arrangement that is suitable to perform such a function. For example, the controllable portal may be adapted for actuation by rotating an actuator, by sliding an actuator, by squeezing an actuator or by performing any other motion. The controllable portal may include two openings that can be aligned with each other to establish the flow path. Alternatively, the controllable portal may include a frangible seal, where the frangible seal can be ruptured to establish the flow path. The controllable portal can include any type of valve assembly. A person of ordinary skill would recognize a number of different ways of implementing the controllable portal disclosed herein. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Additionally, it is possible to couple the various elements of the plunger assembly to each other using various combinations of internal/external threading. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the particular examples disclosed herein are illustrative only and the scope of the claims should not be restricted merely to the particular arrangements disclosed. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> Moreover, although the plunger assembly disclosed herein is adapted to extend or retract in response to a user rotating the crank handle, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other methods of moving the plunger assembly may be implemented. For example, a ratcheting mechanism could be provided, the manipulation of which causes the telescoping plunger to extend or retract. </p>
