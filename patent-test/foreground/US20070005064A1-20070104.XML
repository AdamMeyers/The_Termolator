<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to an intervertebral prosthetic device for stabilizing the human spine and a method of implanting same. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Spinal discs that extend between adjacent vertebrae in vertebral columns of the human body provide critical support between the adjacent vertebrae. These discs can rupture, degenerate, and/or protrude by injury, degradation, disease, or the like to such a degree that the intervertebral space between adjacent vertebrae collapses as the disc loses at least a part of its support function, which can cause impingement of the nerve roots and severe pain. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> In these cases, intervertebral prosthetic devices have been designed that can be implanted between the adjacent vertebrae, both anterior and posterior of the column, to prevent the collapse of the intervertebral space between the adjacent vertebrae and thus stabilize the spine. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> However, many of these devices are relatively stiff, and, as such, cannot flex to better accommodate the vertebrae and do not provide a sufficient amount of deformability. Also, many of these devices, when implanted, suffer from a relatively high fatigue. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The intervertebral prosthetic device according to the embodiments of the invention overcomes the above deficiencies by providing relatively low fatigue characteristics and relatively high deformability, resulting in a good fit with the anatomy. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Various embodiments of the invention may possess one or more of the above features and advantages, or provide one or more solutions to the above problems existing in the prior art.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the reference numeral <b>10</b> refers, in general, to an human vertebral column <b>10</b>. The lower portion of the vertebral column <b>10</b> is shown and includes the lumbar region <b>12</b>, the sacrum <b>14</b>, and the coccyx <b>16</b>. The flexible, soft portion of the vertebral column <b>10</b>, which includes the thoracic region and the cervical region, is not shown. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The lumbar region <b>12</b> of the vertebral column <b>10</b> includes five vertebrae V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b> separated by intervertebral discs D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b>, and D<b>4</b>, with the disc D<b>1</b> extending between the vertebrae V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b>, the disc D<b>2</b> extending between the vertebrae V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b>, the disc D<b>3</b> extending between the vertebrae V<b>3</b> and V<b>4</b>, and the disc D<b>4</b> extending between the vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The sacrum <b>14</b> includes five fused vertebrae, one of which is a superior vertebrae V<b>6</b> separated from the vertebrae V<b>5</b> by a disc D<b>5</b>. The other four fused vertebrae of the sacrum <b>14</b> are referred to collectively as V<b>7</b>. A disc D<b>6</b> separates the sacrum <b>14</b> from the coccyx <b>16</b> which includes four fused vertebrae (not referenced). </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the vertebrae V<b>4</b> includes two laminae <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>extending to either side (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of a spinous process <b>22</b> that projects posteriorly from the juncture of the two laminae. Two transverse processes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>extend laterally from the laminae <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and two pedicles <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>extend inferiorly from the processes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>to a vertebral body <b>28</b>. Since the other vertebrae V<b>1</b>-V<b>3</b> and V<b>5</b> are similar to the vertebrae V<b>4</b>, they will not be described in detail. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it will be assumed that, for one or more of the reasons set forth above, the vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b> are not being adequately supported by the disc D<b>4</b> and that it is therefore necessary to provide supplemental support and stabilization of these vertebrae. To this end, an intervertebral disc prosthetic device <b>40</b> according to an embodiment of the invention is implanted between the spinous processes <b>22</b> of the vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The device <b>40</b> is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and includes a body member <b>42</b> which is substantially rectangular in shape with the exception that a curved notch <b>42</b><i>a</i>, is formed in one end portion. A body member <b>44</b> is also provided which is substantially rectangular in shape with the exception that a curved notch <b>44</b><i>a</i>, is formed in one end portion. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> A mechanism is provided to connect the body members, and includes a connector <b>46</b> designed to fit over two connection elements <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>extending from the body members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively. To this end, the connector <b>46</b> has a through opening <b>46</b><i>a </i>with a cross section slightly greater than the cross sections of the elements <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>44</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> To connect the body members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, the elements <b>42</b><i>b </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>are inserted into the opening <b>46</b><i>a </i>from opposite ends of the opening until the corresponding shoulders of the body members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> engage the corresponding ends of the connector <b>46</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> Preferably, the body members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are fabricated from a relatively flexible, soft material and the connecter is fabricated from a relatively stiff material. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> When the device <b>40</b> is implanted between the two adjacent vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the spinous process <b>22</b> of one of the vertebrae V<b>4</b> or V<b>5</b> extends in the notch <b>42</b><i>a </i>and the spinous process of the other vertebrae extends in the notch <b>44</b><i>a</i>, respectively, or vice versa. The relatively flexible, soft body members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> provide excellent deformability resulting in an improved fit, and the connector <b>46</b> adds stiffness, compressive strength and durability to the device <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> It is understood that the surgeon could be provided with several connectors <b>46</b> that vary in stiffness. Thus, once the surgeon ascertains the condition of the vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and determines the particular stiffness that is needed, the proper connector <b>46</b> can be selected. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> A prosthetic device <b>50</b> according to another embodiment is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and includes a body member <b>52</b> which is substantially rectangular in shape with the exception that a curved notch <b>52</b><i>a </i>is formed in one end portion. A body member <b>54</b> is also provided and is designed to be connected to the body member <b>52</b>. The body member <b>54</b> is substantially rectangular in shape with the exception that a curved notch <b>54</b><i>a </i>is formed in one end portion. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> A mechanism is provided to connect the body members <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> and includes a connecting element <b>54</b><i>a </i>projecting from the other end of the body member <b>54</b> and a rectangularly-shaped opening <b>52</b><i>b </i>formed in the other end the body member <b>52</b>. The dimensions of the element <b>54</b><i>a </i>are slightly less than the corresponding dimensions of the opening <b>52</b><i>a</i>. The body members <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are connected by inserting the element <b>54</b><i>b </i>into the opening <b>52</b><i>b </i>until the corresponding faces of the body members abut. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> One of the body members <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> is fabricated from a relatively flexible, soft material and the other body member is fabricated from a relatively stiff material. For the purpose of example, it will be assumed that the body member <b>52</b> is fabricated from the relatively, soft flexible material and the body member <b>54</b> is fabricated from the relatively stiff material. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> When the device <b>50</b> is implanted between the two adjacent vertebrae V<b>4</b> and V<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the spinous process <b>22</b> of one of the vertebrae V<b>4</b> or V<b>5</b> extends in the notch <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the body member <b>52</b>, and the spinous process <b>22</b> of the other vertebrae extends in the notch <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the body member <b>54</b>. The relatively flexible, soft, body member <b>52</b> provides excellent deformability resulting in an improved fit, and the body member <b>54</b> adds stiffness, compressive strength and durability to the device <b>50</b>. </p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> A prosthetic device <b>60</b> according to another embodiment is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and includes two body members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> A mechanism <b>66</b> is provided for connecting the body members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> and includes a rectangular base <b>66</b><i>a </i>having a thickness substantially corresponding to the thicknesses of the body members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Two connecting elements <b>66</b><i>b </i>and <b>66</b><i>c </i>project extend from opposite faces, respectively, of the base <b>66</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> A rectangularly-shaped opening <b>62</b><i>b </i>is formed in the other end of the body member <b>62</b> and a rectangularly-shaped opening (not shown) is formed in the other end of the body member <b>64</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The dimensions of the connecting elements <b>66</b><i>b </i>and <b>66</b><i>c </i>are slightly less than the dimensions of the opening <b>62</b><i>b </i>in the body member <b>62</b> and the opening (not shown) in the body member <b>64</b>. </p>
