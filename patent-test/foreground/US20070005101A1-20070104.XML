<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to a filter catheter. In particular this invention relates to a filter catheter suitable for rapid exchange over a guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> During advancement of a retrieval catheter through a potentially narrow and/or tortuous vasculature, there is a risk of damage being caused to the vasculature. In addition, a retrieval catheter may be subject to relatively large compressive forces during retrieval of an object, such as an embolic protection filter with a large embolic load, into the catheter. A risk of buckling or kinking of a retrieval catheter may therefore arise during retrieval. </p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0017"> In one embodiment of the invention the catheter shaft has a reception space into which an object may be retrieved. The reinforcement may be substantially elongate. The catheter may comprise a first reinforcement and a second reinforcement. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018"> In one case the catheter shaft proximally of the guidewire opening is relatively stiff to provide the catheter with sufficient column strength and buckle strength during retrieval of an object, such as an embolic protection filter with a large embolic load, into the reception space, and the catheter shaft distally of the guidewire opening is relatively flexible to facilitate advancement of the catheter through a potentially narrow and/or tortuous vasculature without causing damage to the vasculature. The reinforcement acts to reinforce the column strength and buckle strength of the catheter shaft in the region of the guidewire opening to prevent buckling or kinking of the catheter shaft at the transition between the proximal stiff catheter shaft and the distal flexible catheter shaft during retrieval. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019"> In one embodiment the reinforcement extends distally of the guidewire opening.

By extending the reinforcement within the lumen of the catheter shaft, this arrangement minimises the crossing profile of the retrieval catheter. The catheter shaft lumen may comprise a guidewire lumen through which a guidewire may be passed for rapid exchange of the catheter over the guidewire. The guidewire opening may face in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the catheter shaft. Because the guidewire opening faces parallel to the catheter shaft, the overall crossing profile of the retrieval catheter and the guidewire at the guidewire opening is minimised. The guidewire opening may face in a direction which subtends an acute angle with the longitudinal axis of the catheter shaft. In one case the guidewire opening faces proximally. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021"> In a further embodiment the longitudinal axis of the reinforcement is radially offset from the longitudinal axis of the guidewire opening.

The reinforcement may have a lumen extending therethrough aligned with the guidewire opening. The reinforcement lumen may comprise a guidewire lumen through which a guidewire may be passed for rapid exchange of the catheter over the guidewire. The reinforcement may comprise a guide to guide passage of a guidewire into the reinforcement lumen. The guide may comprise a funnel. In one case the funnel is provided at a distal end of the reinforcement. The reinforcement may comprise a tubular element. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022"> In another embodiment the reinforcement has a small cross sectional area relative to the cross sectional area of the guidewire opening. The reinforcement may comprise a wire element. </p>

The tapering part of the reinforcement may be located adjacent to a distal end of the reinforcement. The tapered part of the reinforcement facilitates ease of attachment of the reinforcement to the catheter shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025"> In one case a distal end of the reinforcement is attached to the catheter shaft. In another case a distal end of the reinforcement is detached from the catheter shaft. A proximal end of the reinforcement may be attached to the catheter shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026"> In one embodiment the stiffness of the reinforcement is greater than the stiffness of the catheter shaft. The second moment of area of the catheter shaft may be greater than the second moment of area of the reinforcement. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041"> Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>) thereof, there is illustrated a filter retrieval catheter according to the invention, which is suitable for retrieving an embolic protection filter <b>50</b> from a vasculature. The catheter is particularly suitable for retrieving the type of embolic protection filters described in International patent applications published under numbers WO 01/80777, and WO 03/055412, the relevant contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042"> The catheter comprises a catheter shaft <b>2</b> having a guidewire opening <b>4</b> in a sidewall of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>. The guidewire opening <b>4</b> is a rapid exchange guidewire opening and is located a substantial distance distally of a proximal end of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> to facilitate rapid exchange of the catheter over a guidewire <b>5</b>. In this case, the guidewire opening <b>4</b> is located approximately 30 cm from a distal end <b>1</b> of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043"> The guidewire opening <b>4</b> faces proximally and is aligned for passage of the guidewire <b>5</b> out through the opening <b>4</b> in a direction which subtends an acute angle with the longitudinal axis of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044"> Distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>, the catheter shaft <b>2</b> has a guidewire lumen extending from the guidewire opening <b>4</b> to the distal end <b>1</b> of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>. The catheter shaft <b>2</b> has an open mouth at the distal end <b>1</b>, and the guidewire lumen is in communication with the open mouth and with the guidewire opening <b>4</b>. In this manner, a guidewire <b>5</b> may be passed through the open mouth into the guidewire lumen, through the guidewire lumen and out through the guidewire opening <b>4</b> for rapid exchange of the catheter over the guidewire <b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045"> The guidewire lumen acts as a reception space to enable an embolic protection filter <b>50</b> to be retrieved from a vasculature into the guidewire lumen through the open mouth. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046"> Proximally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>, the catheter shaft <b>2</b> is of a relatively stiff material to ensure that the catheter has sufficient column strength and buckle strength to enable an embolic protection filter <b>50</b> to be retrieved into the catheter. Retrieval of the embolic protection filter <b>50</b> may involve relatively large forces being exerted on the catheter shaft <b>2</b> as the filter <b>50</b> with a potentially large embolic load is collapsed and retrieved through the open mouth and into the guidewire lumen (FIGS. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)). </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047"> The distal end <b>1</b> of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> preferably has an expansile tip to accommodate retrieval of a potentially large embolic filter into the catheter shaft <b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>(<i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048"> Distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>, the catheter shaft <b>2</b> is of a relatively flexible material to ensure that the catheter is sufficiently trackable and flexible to prevent damage being caused during advancement of the catheter through a potentially narrow and/or tortuous vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049"> To prevent buckling or kinking of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> in the region of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> during retrieval of the embolic protection filter <b>50</b>, the catheter comprises two elongate reinforcement elements <b>6</b>, <b>3</b> extending along the catheter shaft <b>2</b> within the guidewire lumen. The reinforcements <b>6</b>, <b>3</b> have respective stiffnesses greater than the stiffness of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>, and respective second moments of area less than the second moment of area of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>. This arrangement results in the reinforcements <b>6</b>, <b>3</b> acting to reinforce the column strength and buckle strength of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> in the region of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> during retrieval. The reinforcements provide a linear transition in stiffness. The inner tube <b>3</b> is made from a higher stiffness (E) polymer to provide additional compression resistance during retrieval. Even though the inner tube <b>3</b> has a high material modulus (E), its smaller outer and inner diameters means that the 2<sup>nd </sup>moment of Area (I) value for the inner tube <b>3</b> is lower than for the outer tube <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050"> The combined EI value for the outer tube <b>2</b>&#x2014;inner tube <b>3</b> construction is lower than for a single tube made from the same material. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051"> The first reinforcement element <b>6</b> comprises an elongate wire element extending from a proximal end located proximally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> to a distal end located distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>. The wire <b>6</b> extends through a wire lumen in the catheter shaft <b>2</b> proximally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>, exits the wire lumen distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> at a lumen outlet, and extends through the guidewire lumen to the distal end of the wire <b>6</b>. The proximal end of the wire <b>6</b> is fixedly attached to the interior surface of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>, for example by means of welding. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the longitudinal axis of the wire <b>6</b> is radially offset from the longitudinal axis of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>, and the cross sectional area of the wire <b>6</b> is small relative to the cross sectional area of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053"> A polymer jacket <b>7</b>, for example of polyethylene, is provided around the wire <b>6</b> and extending along the wire <b>6</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054"> At a distal region <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the wire <b>6</b> tapers distally radially inwardly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This taper provides a further means of stiffness transition across the guidewire opening <b>4</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055"> The second reinforcement element <b>3</b> comprises an elongate tubular element extending from a proximal end located adjacent to and distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> to a distal end <b>9</b> located further distally of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>.

In this manner, a guidewire <b>5</b> may be passed from the guidewire lumen of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> through the guidewire lumen of the tube <b>3</b>, and out through the guidewire opening <b>4</b> for rapid exchange of the catheter over the guidewire <b>5</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057"> The tube <b>3</b> tapers distally radially outwardly adjacent to the distal end <b>9</b>. This tapered part <b>9</b> of the tube <b>3</b> is fixedly attached to the interior surface of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>, for example by means of a weld joint <b>10</b>, and the proximal end of the tube <b>3</b> is also fixedly attached to the interior surface of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>. The inner tube <b>3</b> is preferably welded to the outer tube <b>2</b> at both the flared section <b>9</b> and at the RX exit port <b>4</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058"> The flare on the distal end <b>9</b> of the inner tube <b>3</b> provides a weld zone to the interior surface of the outer tube <b>2</b> and a guiding face to direct the guidewire <b>5</b> through the RX port <b>4</b> during back loading of the catheter. </p>

The stepping back of the inner tube <b>3</b> from the distal end <b>1</b> of the catheter <b>2</b> means that the distal 100 mm tip retains high trackability from the low modulus outer tube <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062"> The inner tube <b>3</b> acts to reinforce the catheter shaft <b>2</b> to minimise the possibility of buckling or kinking of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> during retrieval.

<p id="p-0058" num="0064"> The use of a different material on the inner tube <b>3</b> allows the use of a material with a lower coefficient of friction to reduce wire movement forces. </p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0072"> The retrieval catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has a catheter shaft <b>2</b> with a hinge region <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0073"> The hinge region <b>13</b> may be of a different material to the remainder of the catheter shaft <b>2</b>, for example of a more compliant material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074"> In the retrieval catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a portion <b>13</b> of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> has a reduced diameter. This reduced diameter portion <b>13</b> is located distally of the distal end <b>9</b> of the inner tube <b>3</b> and proximally of the distal tip <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075"> By providing this reduced diameter portion <b>13</b>, the bending/trackability characteristics of the retrieval catheter are enhanced while retaining sufficient compressive strength/pushability. This aspect of the invention is explored in further detail as follows. Reducing the diameter of a shaft has a greater impact on the bending stiffness of the shaft compared to its impact on compression resistance. This is because the shaft bending stiffness is related to the EI value where I has a quadratic relationship to the inner and outer radius of the shaft. The compression resistance is related to EA where A is the cross sectional area, which is related to the square of the inner and outer radius. Therefore, by reducing the shaft diameter it is possible to reduce bending stiffness, but maintain compression resistance by increasing the modulus of the shaft material to maintain the overall EA product. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076"> The distal tip <b>1</b> retains the larger diameter to facilitate reception of the embolic protection filter <b>50</b> into the tip <b>1</b>. Also the catheter shaft <b>2</b> in the region of the guidewire opening <b>4</b> retains the larger diameter to facilitate passage of the guidewire <b>5</b> through the guidewire opening <b>4</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077"> In the case of the retrieval catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the reduced diameter portion <b>13</b> extends longitudinally along the catheter shaft <b>2</b> for a relatively small distance. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078"> It will be appreciated that the reduced diameter portion <b>13</b> may alternatively extend longitudinally along the catheter shaft <b>2</b> for a relatively large distance.

<p id="p-0074" num="0080"> The retrieval catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> also enjoys enhanced bending/trackability characteristics while retaining sufficient compressive strength/pushability. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081"> In further detail, the catheter shaft <b>2</b> provides reinforcement to the inner tube <b>3</b>, in particular in the region of the guidewire opening <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0083"> A further advantage of having a reduced diameter portion with the retrieval catheter of the invention is illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. The reduced diameter portion <b>13</b>, such as those illustrated in FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>13</b>, assists in keeping the retrieval catheter centred on the guidewire <b>5</b>. In particular because the guidewire <b>5</b> is under tension, this arrangement results in the guidewire <b>5</b> acting as a support to minimise the possibility of buckling or snaking of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> during retrieval of the embolic protection filter <b>50</b>. </p>

The bulking member <b>16</b> has a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the catheter shaft <b>2</b> and the diameter of the distal tip <b>1</b>, which results in the outer diameter of the retrieval catheter being substantially constant from the catheter shaft <b>2</b> across the bulking member <b>16</b> to the distal tip <b>1</b>. In this manner the retrieval catheter may be passed through a sealing device, such as a Tuohy Borst, with relative ease and without undue blood loss.
