<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and method for repairing septal defects includes advancing a catheter to the site of the defect, grasping opposing edges of the defect, passing one or more suture lines through the opposing edges, and tightening the suture lines. The catheter can include one or more vacuum ports, with the vacuum ports being sized and configured to grasp opposing edges of the defect when vacuum is applied thereto. The vacuum ports may be positioned longitudinally distant from each other along the catheter, and may also be on different sides of the catheter. The vacuum ports may have vacuum applied via independent control. The catheter can also include suture deploying structure that prevents the suture line from becoming entangled in the catheter. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to medical devices and methods. In particular, the present invention relates to a system, apparatus, and method for repairing tissue, and particularly for repairing septal defects, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO). </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Septal defects are a relatively common occurrence. While many septal defects are relatively benign and have little or no impact on a person's health, other septal defects can be more serious. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> One type of septal defect is a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is an opening between the right atrium and the left atrium. Because the fetal lungs do not provide air prior to birth, fetal blood is oxygenated by the mother via the umbilical cord and placentia. To provide for such circulation, the fetal blood circulation system includes several vessels and openings that remain open during fetal development but that close soon after birth. One such opening is the foramen ovale, which permits blood to flow from the right atrium into the left atrium in a fetal heart, thereby allowing blood to bypass the fetal lungs and flow directly from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> After birth, the infant's lungs typically provide oxygenation to the blood, and it is generally undesirable to continue having blood flow from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation without first passing through the lungs. Accordingly, it is generally desirable that the foramen ovale be closed after birth. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> At birth, left atrial pressure increases as the pulmonary circulation is established. For most newborn infants, this pressure increase causes the closure of a flap of tissue which occludes the foramen ovale and then heals in the occluded position shortly after birth. In a significant percentage of persons, however, the tissue flap does not heal to permanently occlude the foreman ovale. This condition is known as a patent (i.e., open) foramen ovale (PFO). </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> While a PFO can be a relatively benign condition, PFOs have been associated with migraines. PFOs can also cause strokes by permitting blood containing small thrombi to bypass the lungs (which would otherwise filter out such small thrombi) and flow directly from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation and into the brain. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Treatments for PFOs range from open-heart surgery to percutaneous procedures. Open-heart surgery for PFOs typically involves suturing the PFO closed. Although relatively simple, such open-heart surgical treatment is associated with all the usual risks of cardiac surgery. Percutaneous methods include deploying mesh, clamshell, or other similar implanted devices to close the PFO. Other treatments include using heat, laser, RF, or other energy to treat the tissue of (or adjacent to) the PFO to induce the tissue to permanently close the PFO. The percutaneous methods are often complicated and may involve relatively large implanted devices or uncertain tissue treatments. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In light of the foregoing, there is presently a need for improved systems for treating PFOs. More specifically, there is a present need for an improved method, apparatus, and system for repairing PFOs. The current invention meets this need. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention solves the problem of effectively treating an opening tissue, such as a PFO or other septal defect. Additionally, the present invention provides a device capable of treating a PFO via a catheter from a remote insertion location. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> The invention is an apparatus, system, and method for treating a patent foramen ovale (PFO) to cause closure thereof. More specifically, the invention provides for percutaneous or other minimally-invasive application of suture to PFO to cause closure of the PFO. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a catheter <b>10</b> according to the invention being advanced through a patient's vasculature to a heart <b>12</b> and into a PFO <b>14</b>. A guidewire <b>16</b> has previously been advanced through the vasculature by passing up the inferior vena cava <b>18</b>, through the right atrium <b>20</b>, and through the PFO <b>14</b> and into the left atrium <b>22</b>. Note that other introductory routes, including other percutaneous and minimally invasive routes, are also within the scope of the invention. For example, the guidewire and device could be introduced through heart vessels leading to the left ventricle <b>24</b> or right ventricle <b>26</b>, and then on to access the PFO <b>14</b> through either the right atrium <b>20</b> or left atrium <b>22</b>. Depending on the particular embodiment, the device may also be introduced through the heart wall <b>28</b>, as may be the case in a minimally-invasive surgical procedure conducted through a patient's chest cavity. The particular route selected for introduction of the device to the PFO <b>14</b> depends on various factors, including the condition of the patient. While the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a guidewire <b>16</b> to guide the treatment catheter <b>10</b> into position, the guidewire <b>16</b> does not have to be present in all embodiments, such as where the treatment catheter <b>10</b> is steerable on its own to the PFO <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts another view of the treatment catheter <b>10</b>. The treatment catheter <b>10</b> comprises a generally elongated body <b>30</b> having a distal end <b>32</b> and a proximal end <b>34</b>. A handle <b>36</b> is located at the proximal end <b>34</b>. The treatment catheter <b>10</b> has sufficient length to reach the PFO <b>14</b> from outside the patient's body via the particular route selected. For a percutaneous route, the treatment catheter will generally have a length on the order of 60 to 75 cm. Other access routes may require different lengths. The elongated body <b>30</b> and distal end <b>32</b> have a diameter that is small enough to pass through the particular blood vessels and/or openings of the particular access route selected. While percutaneous approaches through the inferior vena cava, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can accommodate diameters of 12 to 16 Fr, other approaches may accommodate and/or require smaller or larger diameters. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the treatment catheter <b>10</b> in greater detail. A vacuum lumen <b>38</b> passes through the catheter body <b>30</b> from the distal end <b>32</b> to the proximal end <b>34</b>, where it terminates in a vacuum attachment adaptor <b>40</b> positioned on a y-connector <b>42</b>. A guidewire lumen <b>44</b> also passes through the catheter body <b>30</b>, terminating in a proximal guidewire opening <b>46</b> at the proximal end <b>30</b> and in a distal guidewire opening <b>48</b> at the distal end <b>32</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The distal end <b>32</b> has a first vacuum recess <b>50</b> and a second vacuum recess <b>52</b>, each of which leads to the vacuum lumen <b>38</b>. The first and second vacuum recesses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> have first and second needles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, respectively. The first and second needles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are secured to first and second needle drivers <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> respectively, which can longitudinally advance and retract the needles across their respective vacuum recesses. On the needle opposite sides in each vacuum recess are first and second needle catchers <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, which are configured to be speared by their respective needles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and drawn back with the needles when the needles are retracted. The first and second needle catchers <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are secured to first and second suture ends <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the first and second suture ends <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are opposing ends of a common suture thread <b>70</b>. In the particular embodiment depicted, the common suture thread <b>70</b> runs longitudinally in a small sleeve <b>72</b> along the outside of the catheter elongated body <b>30</b>, forming a loop <b>74</b> near the proximal end. The positioning of the common suture thread <b>70</b> in the small sleeve <b>72</b> on the outside of the catheter body <b>30</b> prevents tangling of the suture <b>70</b> when the treatment catheter <b>10</b> is removed toward the end of the procedure. Additionally, by causing the suture thread to pass on the outside of the catheter around a side surface <b>75</b> of the catheter body <b>30</b> which passes between the first and second vacuum recesses, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, the suture can be applied to tissue and the catheter withdrawn without the suture thread <b>70</b> becoming tangled or wrapped around the structures forming the catheter distal end <b>32</b>. </p>

Note that in most persons the septum primum <b>80</b> will have healed permanently to the septum secundum <b>82</b>, thereby permanently closing the foramen ovale. In a patient having a PFO, however, the septum primum <b>80</b> will not have healed in the closed position, and instead acts a flap that only partially occludes blood flow between the right and left atria <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the distal end <b>32</b> is positioned within the PFO <b>14</b> with the first vacuum recess <b>50</b> positioned adjacent the septum primum <b>80</b>, and the second vacuum recess <b>52</b> positioned adjacent the septum secundum <b>82</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, vacuum is applied (via the vacuum attachment adaptor <b>40</b> and vacuum lumen <b>38</b>) to the vacuum recesses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first and second needles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are driven (via actuation by a user advancing the sliding knobs <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) forward and through the tissue of the septum primum <b>80</b> and septum secundum <b>82</b> and into the needle catchers <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, respectively. In the particular embodiment depicted, the first needle <b>54</b> is driven through a suction-created fold or crease <b>84</b> in the septum primum <b>80</b>, thereby creating two needle holes <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> in the septum primum <b>80</b>. Similarly, the second needle <b>56</b> is driven through a suction-created fold or crease <b>90</b> in the septum secundum <b>82</b>, thereby creating two needle holes <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> in the septum secundum <b>82</b>. Note, however, that if the septal tissue is thicker and/or the respective vacuum recess is smaller, the first and/or second needles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> will each form only a single needle hole <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> when driven through the tissue, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. </p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts another embodiment, with the treatment catheter distal end <b>32</b> having first and second vacuum recesses <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> that are generally v-shaped in profile. The distal portion <b>104</b> of the first vacuum recess <b>100</b>, which forms the distal part of the v-shape, is substantially longer than the proximal portion <b>106</b>, with a ratio of about 3:1 proximal length to distal length. The same is true for the second vacuum recess <b>102</b>, where the distal portion <b>108</b> of the second vacuum recess <b>102</b> is substantially longer than the proximal portion <b>110</b>. Note that the respective sizes of the distal portion to the proximal portion of one or both vacuum recesses can vary, depending on the particular application. For example, the distal portion of one or both vacuum recesses could be shorter than the proximal portion, or the distal and proximal portions of one or both ports could be generally of the same size, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> It is further noted that a variety of shapes could be used for the vacuum recesses, including U-shaped, three-sided rectangular, etc. Also, the vacuum recesses do not have to be mirror images of each other. For example, a particular shape may be particularly suited to grasping one tissue piece, such as the septum primum, while another shape may be better suited to grasping another tissue piece, such as the septum secundum. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first and second vacuum recesses <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are longitudinally displaced along the elongate body <b>30</b>, with the second vacuum recess <b>102</b> distal of the first vacuum recess. This longitudinal displacement can allow the vacuum recesses to have greater depth, which can increase the ability of the vacuum recess to hold particular tissue. If the vacuum recesses are longitudinally aligned, the depth of each port is limited by the thickness of the treatment catheter and by the depth of the opposite vacuum recess. For example, for a device having a diameter of 5 mm with vacuum recesses opposite and longitudinally aligned, the maximum combined depth of the two ports must be well under 5 mm (accounting for some structure therebetween to hold the catheter together). For such aligned ports that each have the same depth, their maximum depth in a 5 mm thick treatment catheter would be less than 50% of the catheter diameter, or under 2.5 mm depth each. However, if the ports are longitudinally displaced, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the depths of the vacuum recesses are limited only by the diameter of the catheter. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first vacuum recess <b>100</b> has a depth <b>112</b> that is about 70% of the catheter diameter <b>114</b>. The depth <b>116</b> of the second vacuum recess <b>102</b> is also about 70% of the catheter diameter <b>114</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> Depending on the application, longitudinal displacement of the vacuum recesses can also improve the ability of the device to grasp tissue. For example, where the septum primus <b>80</b> and septum secundum <b>82</b> have little or no overlap, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the use of longitudinally off-set vacuum recesses <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> can improve the ability of the user to capture the respective tissue with the device. </p>

Fastener <b>164</b> may be manufactured from a variety of materials including, for example, Nickel-Titanium alloys, shape-memory alloys, stainless steel, titanium, various plastics, and other biologically-compatible materials. Fastener <b>164</b> has an internal attachment lumen <b>166</b> extending axially therethrough and one or more engagement member(s) <b>168</b> formed on a proximal end thereof. Between the engagement members is defined engagement aperture <b>170</b> which is in communication with attachment lumen <b>166</b>. Attachment lumen <b>166</b> and engagement aperture <b>170</b> are sized to receive a first suture lead <b>70</b>A and a second suture lead <b>70</b>B therein. Prior to deployment, engagement member(s) <b>168</b> are deflected radially away from the axis of the fastener <b>164</b> such that engagement aperture <b>170</b> has a relative large first diameter sufficient to permit suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B to slide therethrough. Upon deployment, i.e. after the suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B have been retracted, engagement members <b>168</b> are deflected or permitted to spring back toward the central axis of the fastener <b>164</b> such that the engagement aperture <b>170</b> assumes a second smaller diameter compressing and securing suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B in place. Depending on the particular embodiment, including the materials from which a particular fastener is made, the engagement member(s) <b>168</b> may tend to spring toward a natural position at the axis of fastener <b>164</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b </i>shows the fastener <b>164</b> in the deployed configuration in which a suture loop <b>70</b> has passed through two tissue portions <b>172</b>A, <b>172</b>B and suture leads <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B are secured in fastener <b>164</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> An operational fastening tip <b>130</b> with fastener <b>164</b> attached thereto and ready for deployment can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>c</i>. Inner body <b>144</b> has been placed inside sleeve <b>146</b> such that suture recess <b>150</b> is in alignment with cutting recess <b>158</b>. Pin <b>152</b> is in slidable communication with slot <b>162</b> thereby permitting relative linear motion, but preventing relative rotational motion, between inner body <b>144</b> and sleeve <b>146</b>. Fastener <b>136</b> has been placed on the end of the fastening tip <b>126</b> by deflecting the engagement members <b>168</b> radially outward until they can be placed around the outer circumference of a distal end <b>145</b> the inner body <b>144</b>. Accordingly, the fastener is secured to the inner body distal end <b>145</b> by means of the frictional engagement between the engagement members <b>168</b> and the outer surface of inner body <b>144</b>. Suture <b>70</b> extends from the fastener <b>164</b>, with suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B extending through the fastener lumen <b>166</b>, through engagement aperture <b>170</b>, exit the side of inner body <b>144</b> through suture recess <b>150</b>, and exit the side of sleeve <b>146</b> through cutting recess <b>158</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Deployment of the fastener is a two step process. Once suture <b>170</b> has been secured through one or more tissue segments, the fastener tip <b>126</b> is coaxed toward the tissue and the suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B are pulled away from the tissue until the suture <b>70</b> is sufficiently cinched around the target tissue. Sleeve <b>146</b> is then held in place adjacent the tissue while the inner body <b>144</b> is pulled axially away. This causes sleeve <b>146</b> to push (i.e. slide) fastener <b>164</b> off the inner body distal end <b>145</b>. When fastener <b>164</b> has been completely removed from inner body distal end <b>145</b>, the fastener engagement members <b>168</b> spring axially inward thereby reducing the diameter of engagement aperture <b>170</b> and securing suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B. The second deployment step, cutting suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B, is accomplished when the inner body <b>144</b> is pulled sufficiently through sleeve <b>146</b> that the suture leads <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B are pinched between the distal edge of suture recess <b>150</b> and cutting member <b>160</b> and ultimately cut by cutting member <b>160</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> Remote deployment of fastener <b>164</b> is accomplished by attaching inner body <b>144</b> to fastener actuator <b>134</b>, and attaching sleeve <b>146</b> to the fastener catheter handle <b>126</b>. Thus, axial movement of the fastener actuator <b>134</b> relative to the handle <b>126</b> causes similar relative movement between inner body <b>144</b> and sleeve <b>146</b>. For example, in the non-actuated position <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>) the distal end <b>145</b> of inner body <b>144</b> will extend from sleeve <b>146</b> a sufficient distance to hold fastener <b>164</b> thereon. In the second position <b>140</b> the inner body distal end <b>145</b> will have been withdrawn into sleeve <b>146</b> a sufficient distance to deploy the fastener <b>164</b>, and in the third position <b>142</b> the inner body <b>144</b> will have been withdrawn a sufficient distance to cut the suture leads <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B. Note that other fastener catheters may also be used without departing from the scope of the invention. Examples of some fastener catheters are set forth in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> Further details on using the fastener catheter <b>120</b> for treating a PFO are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. With the treatment catheter <b>10</b> withdrawn, the user can advance the fastener catheter <b>120</b> into the vicinity of the PFO. The fastener catheter <b>120</b> will advance along the suture <b>70</b> and, if present, along the guidewire. The user can initially tighten the suture <b>70</b> with the fastener catheter <b>120</b>, thereby determining whether the suture <b>70</b> is properly positioned to close the PFO by drawing the septum primum <b>80</b> to the septum secundum <b>82</b>. The advancement of the fastener catheter <b>120</b>, combined with the user holding (and possibly pulling on) the suture portions <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B, cause the suture <b>70</b> to tighten. If the suture <b>70</b> was deployed properly in the desired tissue, the septum primum <b>80</b> will close against the septum secundum and seal the PFO as the suture <b>70</b> is tightened. The user can verify the effectiveness of the closure by monitoring various patient functions. For example, the user may confirm the closure of the PFO by monitoring blood flow using radiopaque dyes combined with fluoroscopy. If the user is dissatisfied with the closure when the suture is initially tightened, the user can remove the suture entirely from the patient and being the procedure again to try to achieve a better positioning of suture to the PFO. If the user is satisfied with the closure, the fastener catheter <b>120</b> can deploy the suture clip <b>164</b> that holds the suture <b>70</b> in its tightened position, thereby permanently closing the foramen ovale. The user can then use the fastener catheter <b>120</b> to cut the suture <b>70</b> in relatively close proximity to the suture clip <b>164</b>. The user then withdraws the fastener catheter <b>120</b> from the patient, leaving the suture <b>70</b> and suture clip <b>164</b> in place to hold the septum primum <b>80</b> and septum secundum <b>82</b> together to close the foramen ovale, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The guidewire, if present, will then be removed. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> Another embodiment for securing the suture <b>70</b> is to tie the suture into a knot <b>176</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The knot <b>176</b> could be tied in the suture within the patient's body, such as may be the case where the knot is tied in the suture adjacent the operational site (i.e., adjacent the septum primum <b>80</b> and septum secundum <b>82</b>). The knot <b>176</b> may also be tied in the extraneous suture material some distance from the operational site, or even outside the patient's body. For example, the knot may be tied loosely and/or as slip knot in the suture some distance from the operational site, and then the knot can be advanced to the operational site. Advancing the knot to the operational site may involve the use of surgical knot pushers and methods such as depicted and described in co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/797,964, filed on Feb. 6, 2001 and entitled &#x201c;Surgical Knot Pushing Device and Method of Use,&#x201d; now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,860,890, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As the knot is advanced, the suture at the operational site is tightened until the septal tissue is held in proximity. Depending on the particular application, one or more knots can be used to secure the suture and close the PFO. Once the final knot has been applied and/or advanced to the operational site, the extraneous suture material is trimmed. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-10</figref>, the vacuum applied to either of the vacuum recesses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> could not be controlled independently of the vacuum applied to the other vacuum recess. Depending on the particular embodiment and application, however, the vacuum recesses may have individually controllable vacuums. For example, in the particular treatment catheter <b>180</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the distal end <b>182</b> has first and second vacuum recesses <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> fed by separate first and second vacuum lumens <b>188</b>, <b>190</b> that run to the proximal end <b>192</b> of the treatment catheter. At the proximal end, a vacuum control valve <b>194</b> independently controls the application of vacuum (via the vacuum attachment adaptor <b>196</b> positioned on the y-connector <b>198</b>) to each vacuum lumen <b>188</b>, <b>190</b>, thereby effectuating independent application of vacuum to each vacuum recess <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>. Although only a single control valve <b>194</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, other arrangements for providing independent control are within the scope of the invention, such as having a separate control valve for each vacuum lumen. Note that the treatment catheter <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may include a guidewire lumen, and will also have the ability to suture the tissue via elements such as slidable needles, needle catchers, suture, etc., although these elements are not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Using a device with independent vacuum control such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a user could simultaneously (or near-simultaneously) grasp the septum primum and septum secundum by simultaneously applying vacuum to both vacuum lumens <b>188</b>, <b>190</b> and both vacuum recesses <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>. The user could then simultaneously pass the needles and suture through the septum primum and septum secundum, or pass the needles and suture sequentially, i.e., first through the septum primum and then through the septum secundum, or first through the septum secundum and then through the septum primum. A user could also grasp the septum primum and septum secundum sequentially by sequentially applying vacuum sequentially to vacuum lumens <b>188</b>, <b>190</b> and vacuum recesses <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>. For example, a user could apply vacuum only to the first vacuum lumen <b>188</b>, and thereby only to the first vacuum recess <b>184</b>, and thereby grasp only the septum primum. The user could then apply the needle and suture to the septum primum, discontinue the vacuum to the first vacuum recess <b>184</b> and thereby release the septum primum, and then apply vacuum to the second vacuum lumen <b>190</b> and second vacuum recess <b>186</b>, and thereby grasp the septum secundum, followed by application of the needle and suture to the septum secundum. The user could also use a device such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> to apply vacuum initially to just the first vacuum recess <b>184</b>, and thereby grasp the septum primum, and then apply vacuum to the second vacuum recess <b>186</b> while maintaining vacuum to the first vacuum recess <b>184</b>, so that the septum secundum is grasped while the septum primum is still held by the vacuum. Such an application may be helpful where the septum primum and septum secundum are positioned apart, and a user can thus use the device to grasp the septum primum and move it toward the septum secundum, or to grasp the septum secundum and move it toward the septum primum. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 11</figref>, and <b>17</b>, the treatment and fastener catheters were advanced and positioned using a guidewire, but without a guide catheter. Depending on the particular application, however, including such factors as the flexibility or steerability of the treatment and/or fastener catheters, a guide catheter may be used, typically in combination with the guide wire. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the guide catheter <b>200</b> can be advanced over the guidewire <b>16</b> to a position adjacent the PFO <b>14</b>. The treatment and fastener catheters can then be advanced and withdrawn through the guide catheter <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> The above designs provide for smooth and predictable deployment of the suture as the treatment catheter is removed from the patient. For example, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, opposing ends <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> of the suture <b>70</b> came out of each vacuum recess <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, passed into the external sleeve <b>72</b>, and terminated in a loop <b>74</b> near the treatment catheter proximal end <b>34</b>. This structure allows the suture <b>70</b> to freely come out of the catheter, and prevents the suture <b>70</b> from becoming wrapped around various parts of the catheter. Other designs can also provide for smooth deployment of the suture. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> While the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be understood that various changes and additional variations may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention or the inventive concept thereof. For example, while the invention is specifically discussed in application with repair of septal defects such as PFOs, it has applicability in other areas where it is desired to repair tissue. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or device to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed herein, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. </p>
