<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates generally to biomedical systems and methods. More specifically, the invention relates to systems and methods for harvesting a vessel section. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Heart disease, specifically coronary artery disease, is a major cause of death, disability, and healthcare expense in the United States and other industrialized countries. A common form of heart disease is atherosclerosis, in which the vessels leading to the heart are damaged or obstructed by plaques containing cholesterol, lipoid material, lipophages, and other materials. When severely damaged or obstructed, one or more of the vessels can be bypassed during a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. CABG surgery is performed about 350,000 times annually in the United States, making it one of the most commonly performed major operations. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> To prevent rejection, the graft material is preferably a blood vessel harvested from elsewhere within a patient's body. The most frequently used bypass vessel is the saphenous vein from the leg. Because the venous system of the leg is redundant, other veins that remain within the patient's leg are able to provide return blood flow following removal of the saphenous vein. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Various methods have been used to harvest the saphenous vein. Until recently, the typical procedure involved making a single long incision that overlies the entire length of the vein, extending from a patient's groin to at least the knee and often to the ankle. This method results in substantial postoperative pain, with patients frequently complaining more of discomfort at the site of the leg vein harvesting than of pain from their CABG surgery wound. In addition, such an extensive incision site is subject to infection and delayed healing, especially in patients with poor circulation, which not infrequently accompanies coronary artery disease. The disfiguring scar from such a large incision is also of concern to some patients. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Less invasive procedures are preferred, and surgical devices and techniques now exist that allow the saphenous vein to be harvested through one or more small, transverse incisions along the length of the vein, generally using an endoscope. Endoscopic procedures yield reduced wound complications and superior cosmetic results compared with traditional methods of vein harvesting. However, this procedure requires considerable manipulation of the vein, has a high conversion rate when visualization is obscured by bleeding or the procedure is taking too long and often requires stitches to repair the vein following harvest. Further, it is generally tedious, time consuming, and relatively complex, requiring extensive accessory equipment and a substantial learning curve for the surgeon. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Therefore, it would be desirable to have a system and a method for harvesting a vessel section that overcome the aforementioned and other disadvantages. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> One aspect of the present invention is a cutting device for harvesting a vessel section. The device comprises a tubular member having at least one cutting element positioned adjacent to its distal end. The tubular member is advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another cutting device for harvesting a vessel section comprises an outer tubular member and an inner tubular member. The outer tubular member has at least one cutting element positioned adjacent to its distal end. The inner tubular member is slidably received within a lumen of the outer tubular member. The outer and inner tubular members are advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Another cutting device for harvesting a vessel section comprises a tubular member having at least one cutting element positioned adjacent to its distal end. The cutting element has an inner routing ridge, which acts to center the vessel section within the cutting element as the cutting element passes over the vessel section. The tubular member has a flexible distal end, which allows the distal end to bend and easily navigate along the vessel section. The tubular member is advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Another cutting device for harvesting a vessel section comprises a tubular member having at least one cutting element positioned adjacent to its distal end and a tensioning element. The tensioning element has a cable, which is operably coupled to the vessel section to be harvested to provide tension on the vessel section during harvesting. The tubular member is advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Another cutting device for harvesting a vessel section comprises a tubular member having at least one cutting element positioned adjacent to its distal end and gear systems. A planetary gear arrangement increases the users rotational input. Ratcheting gears allow for the tubular member to advance during a clockwise rotation and provide a secondary cutting stroke on a counterclockwise rotation. The tubular member is advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Another aspect of the present invention is a system for harvesting a vessel section. One system comprises a catheter, a rod slidably receivable within the catheter, and a tubular cutting device oriented coaxial with the rod. The catheter is positioned within a vessel section, and the rod is positioned within the catheter. The cutting device is advanced over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises a rod, a handle attached to the rod, and a tubular cutting device slidable over the handle. The rod is positioned within a vessel, and the cutting device is advanced over at least a portion of the handle and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises a vessel support member and a tubular cutting device slidable over the vessel support member. The vessel support member is positioned within a vessel, and the cutting device is advanced over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. The vessel support member can be any of an inflatable balloon, a dilator within a flexible sheath, a wire braid which increases in diameter, a tapered dilator, a dilator having a flexible tip, a dilator with irrigation through holes, or a dilator having a lubricious coating. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises an inflatable vessel support member and a tubular cutting device slidable over the inflatable vessel support member. A neck of the inflatable vessel support member is traversed through a vessel and then used to place the vessel support member into position. Once in position, the inflatable vessel support member is inflated. The cutting device is advanced over vessel support member and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises an inflatable vessel support member, a flexible sheath, and a tubular cutting device slidable over the inflatable vessel support member. A neck of the inflatable vessel support member is traversed through a vessel and then used to place the vessel support member into position. Once in position the inflatable vessel support member is inflated the sheath expanding with the support member. The cutting device is advanced over vessel support member and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. The vessel support member can then be deflated, wherein the flexible sheath contracts returning the vessel support member back to its original profile. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises a vessel support member, a tether, a parachute, and a tubular cutting device slidable over the vessel support member. The tether is connected to the parachute at one end and the vessel support member at another. The parachute is inserted into a vessel section to be harvested. Once inserted, a fluid is injected into the vessel section to carry the parachute to the distal end of the vessel section. Once received, the tether is used to pull the vessel support member into position. Once the vessel support member is in position, the cutting device is advanced over vessel support member and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Another system for harvesting a vessel section comprises a vessel support member, a rollable sheath, a tube, and a tubular cutting device slidable over the vessel support member. The rollable sheath is advanced forward into the vessel section with the tube thus rolling out as it travels along the vessel section. The vessel support member can then be advanced into rollable sheath, which protects the endothelial layer of the vessel. The cutting device can then be advanced over vessel support member and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Another aspect of the present invention is a method for harvesting a vessel section. A first incision is made at a point corresponding to a proximal end of the vessel section to be harvested, and a second incision is made at a point corresponding to a distal end of the vessel section. A catheter is introduced into the vessel section, and a proximal portion of the vessel section is attached to the catheter. The proximal end of the vessel section is severed. A rod is inserted into the catheter to stiffen the vessel section. A cutting device is oriented coaxial with the rod and advanced over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. The distal end of the vessel section is severed. The cored-out vessel section and adjoining tissue are removed. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In another method for harvesting a vessel section, a first incision is made at a point corresponding to a proximal end of the vessel section to be harvested, and a second incision is made at a point corresponding to a distal end of the vessel section. A catheter is introduced into the vessel section, and a proximal portion of the vessel section is attached to the catheter. A rod is inserted into the catheter to stiffen the vessel section. A proximal portion of the rod is attached to a handle. The handle carries a tubular cutting device slidably disposed on the handle. The proximal end of the vessel section is severed. The cutting device is advanced over at least a portion of the handle while maintaining a coaxial orientation between the cutting device and the rod. The cutting device is also advanced over the vessel section, coring out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. The distal end of the vessel section is severed. The cored-out vessel section and adjoining tissue are removed. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> In another method for harvesting a vessel section, a first incision is made at a point corresponding to a proximal end of the vessel section to be harvested, and a second incision is made at a point corresponding to a distal end of the vessel section.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Another aspect of the current invention allows the vein to be harvested through small incisions. In one embodiment, an intravascular guide and a cutting tube are used to harvest a vessel section without the use of an endoscopic.

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use embodiments of the invention. Various modifications to the illustrated embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from embodiments of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not intended to be limited to embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein. The following detailed description is to be read with reference to the figures, in which like elements in different figures have like reference numerals. The figures, which are not necessarily to scale, depict selected embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the invention. Skilled artisans will recognize the examples provided herein have many useful alternatives and fall within the scope of embodiments of the invention. The following introductory material is intended to familiarize the reader with the general nature and some of the features of embodiments of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> One aspect of the present invention is a cutting device for harvesting a vessel section. One embodiment of the device, in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at <b>100</b>. Device <b>100</b> includes an outer tubular member <b>110</b>, an inner tubular member <b>120</b>, and cutting element <b>130</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> Outer tubular member <b>110</b> is substantially rigid and is made of an appropriate biocompatible material such as a polymer or stainless steel. A distal portion of outer tubular member <b>110</b> may be flexible. For example, a section of outer tubular member <b>110</b> proximal to the cutting element(s) may include a bellows-like structure to aid in directing the cutting device over the vessel section to be harvested. (As used in this specification, &#x201c;distal&#x201d; and &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; are with reference to the operator when the device is in use.) </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The length of outer tubular member <b>110</b> is based on the length of the vessel section to be harvested. For example, a length of 30 to 60 centimeters may be appropriate for harvesting a section of a typical saphenous vein. Tubular member <b>110</b> must be long enough to core out the entire vessel section desired. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The surfaces of the cutting device <b>100</b> may be coated with a material to decrease friction between the device and the tissue and between the elements of the device. The coating material could be parylene, Teflon, or other slippery, lubricious coatings. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> In the present embodiment, cutting element <b>130</b> comprises an assembly having one or more blades positioned adjacent to the distal end of outer tubular member <b>110</b>. The cutting element(s) may be mounted either inside or outside of outer tubular member <b>110</b>. The diameter of outer tubular member <b>110</b> combined with the positioning of cutting elements <b>130</b> determines the diameter of the cored-out vessel and adjoining tissue section that is harvested. Preferably, the diameter of the core is adequate to avoid slicing the edges of the vessel being harvested as well as to transect branch vessels such that the portions of the branch vessels that remain attached to the vessel section are long enough to tie off or otherwise seal to yield a vessel section appropriate for use as a graft, for example in a CABG procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> Cutting element <b>130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as having one or more straight blades. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the number and shape of cutting elements may be varied. For example, outer tubular member <b>110</b> may carry one or more of the following: a curved blade, a blade having a taper on an outside surface, a blade having a taper on an inside surface, a blade having a blunt edge on a first surface and a sharp edge on a second surface, a ring having a serrated edge, a ring having a sharpened edge, a ring having an angle, a ring having a beveled or tapered edge, a ring having a scalloped edge, two concentric rings with multiple cutting edges that pass scissor-like by each other and the like. Each cutting element would interact with the tissue surrounding the vessel in a particular way. For example, a blade having a blunt edge on the inside and a sharp edge on the outside may provide a small buffer space between the vessel and the cutting edge of the blade. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> In one embodiment, inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be received within the lumen <b>112</b> of outer tubular member <b>110</b>. Lumen <b>112</b> provides a close sliding fit for inner tubular member <b>120</b>, allowing the inner tubular member to slide both longitudinally and rotationally within the outer tubular member. In one embodiment, inner tubular member <b>120</b> is substantially rigid and made of an appropriate biocompatible material such as a polymer or stainless steel. In one embodiment, a distal portion of the inner tubular member <b>120</b> may comprise one or more flexible materials. The flexible section of tubular member <b>120</b> may be, for example, a soft polymer, wire reinforced polymer, perforated section, bellows section or jointed section. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be somewhat longer than outer tubular member <b>110</b> to allow the two members to be manipulated independently. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> The lumen <b>122</b> of inner tubular member <b>120</b> is sized to accommodate the vessel section being harvested and may taper inwardly from the distal end, the inner diameter of a distal portion thus being larger than the inner diameter of a proximal portion. An inward taper would lightly compress the vessel section to provide better centering of inner tubular member <b>120</b> on the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Cutting device <b>100</b> may include a component useful in positioning the device relative to the vessel to provide even better centering of the vessel within the device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2K</figref> show examples of centering means in accordance with the present invention. The centering means may be positioned within the lumen of either the inner or the outer tubular member or within the cutting element. The centering component may also be positioned within the lumen of the cutting element <b>130</b>. Positioning the centering means or component within the inner tubular member may be preferable to allow maximum freedom of movement for the inner tubular member within the outer tubular member lumen. The inner tubular member could be held still with the tissue centered while the outer tubular member is moved. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref> show views from three angles of three different embodiments of a centering member <b>240</b> that includes centering elements <b>242</b> and apertures <b>244</b>. The centering elements and apertures may assume shapes other than those shown. The centering elements <b>242</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> may be flexible and thus capable of bending or being displaced as the cutting device is advanced over the vessel. If the cutting device deviates from a position centered on the vessel, one or more of the centering elements is put under greater tension than the other centering elements and, to reduce the tension, directs the cutting device back into a position centered on the vessel. Centering member <b>240</b> including centering elements <b>242</b> may comprise one or more biocompatible materials that are both flexible and resilient, for example one or more polymers or rubbers. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> In one embodiment, centering elements <b>242</b> may comprise one or more protrusions that extend into the lumen of the inner or outer tubular member. For example, a single ring-like structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D-2F</figref> may extend into the lumen near a proximal end of the tubular member. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2I</figref>, multiple individual protrusions may be interspaced around the inner wall of the tubular member. Both the ring-like structure and the individual protrusions exert a force on the vessel and surrounding tissue, helping to center the vessel within the cutting device. One skilled in the art will recognize that the shape and number of protrusions may be varied to achieve maximum centering. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2J and 2K</figref> show two views of a centering member <b>250</b> that comprises bearings <b>252</b> and rollers <b>254</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of inner tubular member <b>120</b> showing two such mechanisms. The cross-sectional end view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref> illustrates four mechanisms interspaced around inner lumen <b>122</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2L and 2M</figref> show two views of a centering member <b>260</b> that comprises centering element <b>262</b>, springs <b>263</b> and an aperture <b>264</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of centering member <b>260</b>. In one embodiment, centering element <b>262</b> may comprise a rigid plate or disk having an aperture <b>264</b>. One or more pairs of springs <b>263</b> may be attached to centering element <b>262</b> and positioned around aperture <b>264</b>. Springs <b>263</b> may be provided on either side of centering element <b>262</b> or on both sides of centering element <b>262</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>. In one embodiment (not shown), one or more pairs of elastic members, e.g., bands, may be substituted for springs <b>263</b>. Elastic members may be made of one or more rubbers or resilient-materials. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> Yet another centering member (not shown) comprises a system including at least one sensor for tracking the location of the cutting device relative to a rod, a dilator, a catheter or a guidewire, for example, positioned within the vessel to be harvested. In this system, at least one Hall-effect sensor, for example, detects the presence of a metal for example, in the rod, dilator, catheter, or guidewire, placed within the vessel. Software associated with the sensor(s) displays concentric circles (or other geometrical shapes) representing the positions of the cutting device and the rod, dilator, catheter or guidewire. In one embodiment, an operator centers the device over the vessel by maintaining the circle representing the rod, dilator, catheter, or guidewire centered within the circle representing the cutting device. Alternatively, software associated with the sensor(s) may provide an audible indication of the relative locations of the cutting device and rod, dilator, catheter or guidewire. For example, the volume or pitch may change if the cutting device deviates off center with respect to the rod, dilator, catheter, or guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Yet another centering member, e.g., a balloon catheter, comprises one or more inflatable structures or elements that can be alternately inflated and deflated. The inflatable structure or structures would expand into the lumen of the inner or the outer tubular member. The expansion would force the vessel and the tissue surrounding it into the center of the member to thereby center the cutting element on the vessel. The structure or structures could be inflated to center the vessel and then the cutting element used to cut the tissue adjoining the vessel. The structure or structures may then be deflated to advance the cutting device along the vessel. After advancing the cutting device, the structure or structures may again then be inflated to center and the cutting element used to cut the tissue around the vessel. The process of incrementally inflating, cutting, deflating, and advancing may be repeated until the entire section has been excised. In one embodiment, the structure or structures may be inflated the entire time the cutting element is advanced along the vessel. Another centering embodiment comprises two magnetic or electromagnetic fields which repel each other. One intravascular field may be located within a catheter or guidewire inside the vessel and the opposing field may be located on the cutting element and/or the outer tube. The forces would repel each other keeping the cutting element and outer tube away from the inside of the vessel allowing a tissue core to be cut around the vessel without compromising the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> In one embodiment, the outer <b>110</b> and inner <b>120</b> tubular members are advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section along with tissue adjoining the vessel section. The two tubular members can be advanced independently. For example, inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be advanced first to hold the vessel and surrounding tissue while outer tubular member <b>110</b> is advanced second to cut the tissue being held by the inner tubular member. Alternately, outer tubular member <b>110</b> may be advanced first to cut the tissue and inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be advanced second to center and hold the tissue. The process of incrementally advancing the tubular members may be repeated until the entire section of vessel has been excised. Advancing tubular member <b>120</b> ahead of outer tubular member <b>110</b> may protect the walls of the vessel from the cutting element(s) positioned on outer tubular member <b>110</b>. The outer and inner tubular members may also be advanced together with the outer tubular member rotating and the inner tubular member not rotating. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Exemplary methods of advancing the tubular members include pushing and/or pulling, rotating, and twisting first in one direction and then in the other direction. In one embodiment, outer tubular member <b>110</b> and inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be twisted in opposite directions to provide a scissoring action. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> Another embodiment of a cutting device in accordance with the present invention is similar to that described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the exception that the cutting device comprises a single tubular member that is advanced over a vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. The single tubular member has one or more cutting elements positioned adjacent to its distal end. In one embodiment, a distal portion of the tubular member may extend beyond a distal end of the cutting element to protect the vessel section being harvested from being cut by the cutting elements, e.g., blade(s). The blade(s) may assume a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, a ring having a serrated edge, a ring having a sharpened edge, a straight blade, a curved blade, a blade having a taper on an outside surface, a blade having a taper on an inside surface, a blade having a blunt edge on a first surface and a sharp edge on a second surface, a ring having an angle, a ring having a scalloped edge, two concentric rings with multiple cutting edges that pass scissor-like by each other and the like. Centering members such as those described above may be positioned within the lumen of the single tubular member. A distal portion of the tubular member may be flexible to aid in directing the cutting device over the vessel section to be harvested. The flexible portion may comprise at least a portion of the cutting element. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Another aspect of the present invention is a system for harvesting a vessel section. One embodiment of the system, in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at <b>300</b>. System <b>300</b> comprises a catheter <b>310</b>, a rod <b>320</b>, a handle <b>330</b>, and a tubular cutting device <b>340</b>. The system may also include a guidewire and means for providing hemostatic control of severed branch vessels, which are not shown. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Catheter <b>310</b> and the guidewire may be made of any of a variety of biocompatible materials or combinations thereof, for example, a polymer, stainless steel, nitinol, composites, and the like. The lengths of the catheter and guidewire are roughly determined by the length of the vessel section to be harvested. The rod, catheter, and/or guidewire may be coated with a lubricious, slippery material. For example, the catheter may be coated with a slippery material to decrease friction between the catheter and the vessel to ease passage of the catheter into the vessel and decrease the possibility of damaging the vessel interior. The coating may be, for example, a hydrogel coating, polyacrylamide, polyethylene oxide, Teflon, parylene or the like. The coating may also contain one or more biological agents, such as an anticoagulant or an antithrombogenic agent to reduce clotting inside the vessel during the harvest procedure. In one embodiment, the anticoagulant may be heparin. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> In one embodiment, the coating may contain one or more vasoactive agents or drugs, such as vasodilative agents or drugs and/or vasoconstrictive agents or drugs. Examples of a vasodilative drugs include, but are not limited to, a vasodilator, an organic nitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, a mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, a dinitrate, nitroglycerin, a trinitrate, minoxidil, sodium nitroprusside, hydralazine hydrochloride, nitric oxide, nicardipine hydrochloride, fenoldopam mesylate, diazoxide, enalaprilat, epoprostenol sodium, a prostaglandin, milrinone lactate, a bipyridine and a dopamine D<sub>1</sub>-like receptor agonist, stimulant or activator. Examples of vasoconstrictive drugs include, but are not limited to, a vasoconstrictor, a sympathomimetic, methoxamine hydrochloride, epinephrine, midodrine hydrochloride, desglymidodrine, and an alpha-receptor agonist, stimulant or activator. In one embodiment, vasoactive agents or drugs may be administered via one or more bolus injections and/or infusions or combinations thereof. The injections and/or infusions may be continuous or intermittent. The injections and/or infusions may be made directly into the vessel section to be harvested. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In one embodiment, catheter <b>310</b> is strong enough to receive rod <b>320</b> within a lumen of the catheter and has an outer diameter smaller than the narrowest inner diameter of the vessel to be harvested. Catheter <b>310</b> may comprise one or more lumens. In one embodiment, catheter <b>310</b> may comprise one or more fluid openings fluidly connected to one or more lumens for delivering or introducing fluids into one or more portions of the vessel to be harvested. The one or more lumens may be fluidly coupled to one or more fluid sources. For example, one or more fluids may be introduced from one or more fluid sources into the vessel to be harvested through the one or more fluid openings prior to removing the catheter from the harvested the vessel. One or more fluids also may be introduced into the vessel through the one or more fluid openings while introducing the catheter into the vessel to be harvested. In one embodiment, suction or a negative pressure may be introduced into the vessel through the one or more fluid openings. For example, suction may be provided from a suction source coupled to the one or more lumens which, in-turn, are coupled to the one or more fluid openings to draw and hold the vessel to be harvested to the catheter while advancing the cutting device over the vessel and along the catheter. In one embodiment, catheter <b>310</b> may comprise one or more balloons, distensible members and/or inflatable members fluidly coupled to one or more lumens. Following placement of the catheter into the vessel section to be harvested, one or more inflatable members may be inflated via a gas or liquid, thereby securing the vessel to the catheter. The gas or liquid may be, for example, air, carbon dioxide, or saline. The one or more inflatable members may be inflated while advancing the cutting device over the vessel and along the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> Rod <b>320</b> may be any appropriate rigid biocompatible material, for example stainless steel or a rigid polymer. In one embodiment, rod <b>320</b> is long enough to extend beyond at least the proximal end of the vessel section to be harvested and to be attached to handle <b>330</b>. Handle <b>330</b> may be made of stainless steel; however, other appropriate materials such as other metals and/or suitable polymers may be used. A proximal end of catheter <b>310</b> is removably attached to handle <b>330</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a taper fitting <b>312</b> on the proximal end of catheter <b>310</b> that slips over a complementary taper fitting <b>332</b> on the distal end of handle <b>330</b> and secures the catheter to the handle. Other fittings, for example, a screw fitting, may also be used. In an alternative embodiment, a proximal portion of catheter <b>310</b> may instead be attached to a proximal portion of rod <b>320</b> after the rod has been inserted into the catheter. The catheter <b>310</b> may also attach to the proximal or mid-portion of the handle <b>330</b> and the vessel may attach to the distal end of the handle <b>330</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> Handle <b>330</b> may include a cavity <b>334</b> within which a proximal portion of rod <b>320</b> is received. Cavity <b>334</b> may be contained within handle <b>330</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, the cavity may extend through the handle, allowing the length of the portion of rod <b>320</b> that extends from the handle to be variable. A setscrew or other appropriate device may be used to secure rod <b>320</b> within cavity <b>334</b>. Alternatively, a vessel cannula may be secured to the vessel. The catheter may be passed through the cannula into the vessel until a small portion remains within the cannula. The catheter may then inflated or expanded to support the vessel. The expansion in the cannula helps to hold the catheter in place. A tensioning device can then be attached to the cannula to hold the end of the vessel in place while the cutting element is advanced along the outside of the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cutting device <b>340</b> is similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described in detail above, comprising an inner tubular member <b>120</b> and an outer tubular member <b>110</b> having one or more cutting elements <b>130</b> positioned adjacent to the distal end of the outer tubular member. The two tubular members shown may be advanced independently of each other. Cutting device <b>340</b> may include means for centering the vessel within the cutting device. Exemplary centering means or devices are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an alternative embodiment, the cutting device may comprise a single tubular member having one or more cutting elements positioned adjacent to its distal end. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> In the present embodiment, cutting device <b>340</b> slides over handle <b>330</b>. An inner lumen of the cutting device provides a close sliding fit for the handle. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, handle <b>330</b> extends beyond a proximal end of cutting device <b>340</b>, thereby enabling an operator of the system to grasp a proximal portion of handle <b>330</b> while advancing cutting device <b>340</b> over the distal portion of the handle and over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. Only a distal portion of handle <b>330</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> System <b>300</b> includes means (not shown) for providing hemostatic control of branch vessels severed by cutting device <b>340</b> as it is advanced over the vessel section. Various hemostatic control means are possible. For example, the hemostatic control means may comprise a biological sealant or tissue adhesive, for example a platelet gel that is prepared from the patient's blood and injected or otherwise introduced along the track of the cutting device. Alternatively, or in combination with a biological sealant, a biocompatible or biodegradable tube may be enclosed within the cutting device to be delivered as the cutting device is advanced over the vessel or after the cutting device has completed coring out the vessel and adjoining tissue. A hemostatic control tube could exert pressure on the cut branch vessels and could be either removed or, in the case of a biodegradable tube, left in place to dissolve or degrade over a period of a few days, for example. Alternatively, the exterior of the tubular cutting device may be coated with or deliver a procoagulant material such as thrombin, collagen, a thrombotic polymer, or activating agent such as kaolin or celite to promote clotting of the tissues as the device is harvesting the vessel or after harvesting the vessel. The tubular cutting device can provide a means of hemostatic control as it exerts pressure on the cut branch vessels while it remains within the patient's body. A fluid or gas, e.g. saline or carbon dioxide, may be supplied at the tip of the tool to deliver the fluid or gas into the tissue in the region where the vessel is being harvested. The supplied fluid or gas will accumulate and increase the pressure around the vessel being harvested. The increased pressure can exceed the pressure in the severed vessel branches and provide some hemostatic control by collapsing the vessels and preventing blood from exiting the severed end. A drain may be inserted at the end of the harvesting procedure to deal with any bleeding that does occur. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> An alternative embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention comprises a rod, a handle attached to the rod, and a tubular cutting device. This system is similar to system <b>300</b> described above but does not include a catheter. The rod is inserted directly into the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Yet another embodiment of the system comprises a catheter, a rod, and a tubular cutting device. Again, this system is similar to system <b>300</b>, with the exception that no handle is included in this system. Instead of advancing over a handle, the cutting device is oriented coaxial with the rod. The rod, when fully inserted into the catheter within the vessel to be harvested, extends far enough outside of the vessel to allow the cutting device to be aligned over the rod. The catheter may be attached to the rod before advancing the cutting device over the rod, catheter, and vessel assembly to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Another embodiment of the system comprises a rod or guide wire that extends beyond the distal end of the vessel and beyond the proximal end of the handle. The portion of the rod or guide wire that extends beyond the vessel to be excised and the cutting device may be used to anchor the rod or guide wire to a stable object such as a surgical table or a bedrail. An anchor device could be used to hold the rod or guide wire and a support device could be used to raise or lower the rod or guide wire to whatever height is necessary to be level with the vessel being excised. The anchor and support devices could provide a means to hold the rod or guide wire steady, straight, and level for the cutting device to follow. In one embodiment, the vessel may be attached to the catheter, rod and/or guidewire. In one embodiment, the catheter, rod and/or guidewire may be coupled to a tensioning device. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Another aspect of the present invention is a method for harvesting a vessel section. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a flow diagram of one embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, a first incision is made at a point corresponding to a proximal end of the vessel section to be harvested (Block <b>405</b>). A second incision is made at a point corresponding to a distal end of the vessel section (Block <b>410</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> A guidewire is then positioned within the vessel section (Block <b>415</b>). Alternatively, the guidewire may be inserted into the vessel before the second incision is made. Inserting the guidewire prior to making the second incision may aid in determining the optimal location for the second incision. Once the second incision has been made, the guidewire is positioned such that it extends beyond and outside of the vessel section at both the distal and proximal ends of the section. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> A catheter is introduced into the vessel section over the previously placed guidewire (Block <b>420</b>). A proximal portion of the vessel section is secured to the catheter (Block <b>425</b>), for example by suturing the vessel onto a barb positioned adjacent to the proximal end of the catheter. Alternatively, the catheter may be introduced into the vessel without a guidewire being previously placed. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> The guidewire (if present) is withdrawn (Block <b>430</b>), and a rod may be inserted into the catheter to stiffen the vessel section (Block <b>435</b>). Both the catheter and the rod may be attached to a removable handle (Block <b>440</b>). The handle may carry a tubular cutting device, or the cutting device may be introduced over the handle after the handle has been attached to the catheter and rod. An inner lumen of the cutting device provides a close sliding fit for the handle. The tubular cutting device is thus oriented coaxial with the rod and with the vessel section to be harvested (Block <b>445</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> The cutting device is then advanced over the vessel section to core out the vessel section and tissue adjoining the vessel section (Block <b>450</b>). The cutting device may be advanced by either pushing or pulling the device over the vessel section. Where the cutting device comprises two tubular members, one positioned within the other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two tubular members may be advanced separately. For example, inner tubular member <b>120</b> may be advanced first to hold the vessel and surrounding tissue, while outer tubular member <b>110</b> is advanced second to cut the tissue being held by the inner tubular member. The process of incrementally advancing the inner tubular member and then the outer tubular member is repeated until the entire section has been excised. Advancing the inner tubular member ahead of the outer tubular member may protect the walls of the vessel from the cutting element(s) positioned on the outer tubular member. Advancing and rotating the inner and outer tubular members separately may also protect the side branches of the vessel by holding them in place to achieve a clean cut at a sufficient length. The cutting device, for example, may be twisted first in one direction and then in the other direction, or it may be rotated over the vessel. The outer and inner tubular members may be twisted in opposite directions to provide a scissoring action. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> The cored out vessel section and adjoining tissue are removed from the body of the patient (Block <b>455</b>). Either before or after removing the vessel section and adjoining tissue, means for providing hemostatic control of branch vessels severed as a result of coring out the vessel section may be introduced through either the first or the second incision. The hemostatic control means may be, for example, a biological sealant, e.g., platelet gel that may be prepared from the patient's blood and injected or otherwise introduced along the track of the cutting device. The hemostatic control means may also be a thrombogenic substance such as fibrinogen, fibrin and/or thrombin placed in the track left by the cutting device. Alternatively, or in combination with a biological sealant, a biocompatible or biodegradable tube may be enclosed within the cutting device to be delivered as the cutting device is advanced over the vessel or after the cutting device has completed coring out the vessel and adjoining tissue. The tube exerts pressure on the cut branch vessels and may be either removed or, in the case of a biodegradable tube, left to dissolve or degrade over a period of a few days, for example. The space left after the removal of the vessel may also be filled with gauze to provide internal pressure to limit bleeding and absorb blood. The gauze may be removed periodically to check for absorbed blood. Limited blood collected on the gauze indicates the wound bleeding has diminished. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> Hemostatic control means are not required for the present invention as the tubular cutting device itself can exert pressure on the cut branch vessels while it remains within the patient's body. A drain may be inserted at the end of the harvesting procedure to deal with any bleeding that does occur. The site of the vessel harvesting procedure, e.g., the leg of a patient, may also be wrapped with a compression bandage to limit bleeding. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> In an alternative method in accordance with the present invention, a rod is inserted directly into the vessel. Thus, no guidewire and/or catheter is used.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> A cannula is then inserted into the proximal end of the vessel section, which is located near the knee.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an illustration of a distal end of a cutting device for harvesting a vessel section in an embodiment of the present invention is shown. Distal end <b>500</b> of cutting device <b>502</b> is comprised of cutting element <b>504</b>, routing ridge or ring-like structure <b>506</b>, connector section <b>508</b>, and tubular member <b>510</b>. As shown, tubular member <b>510</b> is operably coupled to centering member <b>502</b> via connector section <b>508</b>. Connector section <b>508</b> has rounded surface features <b>512</b>, which fit within grooves <b>514</b> and hold tubular member <b>510</b> to centering member <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The relationship of the grooves <b>514</b> and the surface features <b>512</b> allows the centering member <b>502</b> tip off axis from tubular member <b>510</b> and allows cutting device <b>502</b> to be coupled to tubular member <b>510</b> so that <b>502</b> rotates as <b>510</b> is rotated. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> Regardless of what device is being used to stabilize or support the vessel, routing ridge <b>506</b> is designed to contact the tissue being cut and to meet resistance against the stabilizing or support device inside the vessel. The contact and resistance exerted against routing ridge <b>506</b> pushes on the cutter device to center centering member <b>502</b> around the vessel. Thus, as tubular member <b>510</b> is advanced over the vessel, if the vessel is curved in any way, routing ridge <b>506</b> will contact the vessel first before the cutting element <b>504</b>, thereby centering cutting element <b>504</b> over the vessel prior to cutting element <b>504</b> coming into contact with the vessel and thus avoiding any damage to the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7J</figref>, illustrations of distal ends of a cutting device for harvesting a vessel section in various embodiments of the present invention are shown. In these figures cutting element <b>700</b> and routing ridge <b>702</b> at distal end <b>704</b> are similar in structure to embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. However, the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7J</figref> provide a flexible distal end <b>704</b> to assist cutting device <b>706</b> in navigating over a vessel during harvesting. Each distal end <b>704</b> has a construction, which allows for the distal end to bend or flex and thus more easily navigate around curvatures of the vessel. Distal end <b>704</b> is designed to provide increase tracking response and flexibility. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> utilizes a dual coiled structure having a counter clockwise wound outer coil <b>708</b> and a clockwise wound inner coil <b>710</b>. The dual coil structure provides for a torsionally stable tube strong enough to withstand external compression, yet still remain flexible due to the coil nature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B-7F</figref> show various perforated tube sections. These perforations or slots weaken the tubing wall just enough to allow the tubing to be flexible enough to route cutting device <b>706</b> around the vessel, especially curved vessels. Perforated tubing <b>712</b> can be made from a biocompatible metal, such as stainless steel, or a biocompatible plastic, such as polyurethane, acrylic, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and/or similar material. This perforated geometry proves for good flexibility and high torque. The portions in the perforated sections that run coaxially with the center of the tubular member, i.e., the posts, facilitate providing torque. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, posts <b>750</b>, beams <b>755</b> and perforated slots <b>760</b> increase in size from the distal portion to the proximal portion. This variation in size stimulates a tapered beam, e.g., a fishing pole, to allow for the greatest flexibility at the distal end while distributing the stress along its length. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>, multiple tubes <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>718</b> are used to provide the flexible distal end <b>704</b>. As shown, each tube <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>718</b> terminate at a different proximal distance than the other. Each tube could be made of a biocompatable material, such as ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), silicone, polyvinylchloride and/or similar material, which is a very flexible material that keeps its shape when compressed and extended axially. Tube <b>714</b> extends to cutting element <b>700</b>, tube <b>716</b> terminates a distance proximal of cutting element <b>700</b>, and tube <b>718</b> terminates a further distance proximal to cutting element <b>700</b>. By wrapping tubes <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>718</b> around one another the amount of torque that can be applied to cutting device <b>706</b> can be increased. But as the tube diameter decreases towards distal end <b>704</b>, distal end <b>704</b> becomes more flexible and thus able to navigate over vessels having small to large curvature. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7H</figref>, a flex straw embodiment is utilized. Flex straw portion <b>720</b> may be made from the same material as tubing <b>722</b> providing that the material is biocompatible and has good flexing capabilities. Flex straw portion <b>720</b> provides a good torque quotient in that portion <b>720</b> can be compressed to solid, but yet provides for good flexibility when not compressed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> shows an embodiment where perforations <b>724</b> run lengthwise along tubing member <b>726</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7J</figref> shows cutting device <b>706</b> having multiple universal joints <b>730</b> and <b>732</b> to provide for flexible distal end <b>704</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>, illustrations of a rollout intravascular sheath for harvesting a vessel section in one embodiment of the present invention are shown. Rollout intravascular sheath <b>800</b> can be used to introduce a stabilizing or support device, as discussed above and in more detail below, into a vessel while protecting the endothelial layer of the vessel. Sheath <b>800</b> is designed to provide support to the vessel during a vessel harvesting procedure, e.g., a saphenous vein harvesting procedure. Rollout sheath <b>800</b> is a flexible tube, which is shown not fully extended in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>. A rigid or semi-rigid inner tube <b>802</b> is shown advanced partially through the sliding sleeve <b>803</b>. Prior to advancing tube <b>802</b> through sliding sleeve <b>803</b>, sheath <b>800</b> is everted around the edges of the sliding sleeve <b>803</b> and one end is fixedly attached or bonded to the sliding sleeve <b>803</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. The other end of sheath <b>800</b> is fixedly attached or bonded to one end of a wire <b>801</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. Tube <b>802</b> is advanced over wire <b>801</b>, over a portion of sheath <b>800</b> and through sliding sleeve <b>803</b>. Tube <b>802</b> is advanced forward into rollout sheath <b>800</b> and into the vessel section to be harvested. Advancement of tube <b>802</b> causes flexible rollout sheath <b>800</b> to unroll as it enters the vein. Wire <b>801</b> is free to move with sheath <b>800</b> while tube <b>802</b> is advanced forward thereby allowing sheath <b>800</b> to be unrolled. In the current embodiment, there is little to no relative motion, or sliding between sheath <b>800</b> and the interior wall of the vessel. Unrolling sheath <b>800</b> within the vessel can minimize damage to the endothelial lining of the vessel as compared to sliding a member against the endothelial lining of the vessel as the member is advanced through the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> Sheath <b>800</b> can be made of most any biocompatible material, such as polyurethane or ePTFE, without departing from the spirit of the invention. With the rollout embodiment, as the clinician advances tube <b>802</b> in the vessel, sheath <b>800</b> material is rolled out. While tube <b>802</b> is advanced in the vessel, the sliding sleeve <b>803</b> is held stationary, e.g., just outside the vessel at a point adjacent the site of vessel insertion. Tube <b>802</b> is advanced in the vessel to a length that corresponds to the length of vessel that is intended to be harvested. To remove the sheath <b>800</b> from the vessel, wire <b>801</b> is pulled back, thereby retracting sheath <b>800</b> and tube <b>802</b> from the vessel and, thereby creating no relative motion between sheath <b>800</b> and the vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, an illustration of a one-piece intravascular balloon catheter for harvesting a vessel section in one embodiment of the present invention is shown. This embodiment provides for an intravascular balloon catheter <b>900</b> that is plugged at its proximal end <b>902</b> and has an extended unexpanded balloon material. Balloon catheter <b>900</b> may be approximately 300-500 mm long with a 1.0-2.0 mm diameter when folded and 2.0-6.0 mm diameter when inflated. The balloon catheter <b>900</b> may be made of most any biocompatible material, such as nylon, urethane, polyethylene, or PET, for example, without departing from the spirit of the invention. The elongated distal end or routing end <b>903</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b> is used to navigate balloon catheter <b>900</b> through the vessel and into place. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> A stylet <b>850</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, may be placed within routing neck <b>903</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b> to prevent kinking of routing neck <b>903</b> during insertion and routing of neck <b>903</b> within the vessel. In one embodiment, stylet <b>850</b> includes a flexible tip or cap <b>860</b> at its distal end, a coiled wire <b>870</b>, and a membrane <b>880</b>. Flexible tip <b>860</b> helps to minimize damage to the vessel wall when navigating around curves. Flexible tip <b>860</b> may be tapered to allow easy insertion into vessels of varying size. The proximal end <b>890</b> of stylet <b>850</b> is positioned within routing neck <b>903</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b>. The distal end <b>905</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b> is advanced over coiled wire <b>870</b> and over membrane <b>880</b>, thereby creating a pressure fit between the distal end <b>905</b> of routing neck <b>903</b> and the membrane <b>880</b> of stylet <b>850</b>. The pressure fit couples the stylet and the balloon catheter together. The coupled stylet and balloon catheter together may be navigated and routed through the vessel section to be harvested. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, stylet <b>850</b> includes a flexible tip or cap <b>860</b> at its distal end and a coiled wire <b>870</b>. The proximal end <b>890</b> of stylet <b>850</b> is positioned within routing neck <b>903</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b>. In this embodiment, the distal end <b>905</b> of balloon <b>900</b> is positioned within cavity <b>891</b>, thus coupling or securing the distal end <b>905</b> of routing neck <b>903</b> and to the stylet <b>850</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> In one embodiment, a flexible sheath <b>871</b> may be placed over balloon catheter <b>900</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9D-9E</figref>. The flexible sheath <b>871</b> is made of an elastic or resilient material capable of allowing the balloon to be expanded or inflated and also helping to deflate or collapse the balloon into a low profile configuration similar to the balloon's original configuration so that the balloon can be easily removed from the vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of deflated balloon <b>900</b> within flexible sheath <b>871</b>. In one embodiment, balloon <b>900</b> is in a folded configuration when it is in a deflated or collapsed configuration within flexible sheath <b>871</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In one embodiment, the vessel section to be harvested is isolated at its proximal and distal aspects. In one embodiment, a saphenous vein section is isolated having a proximal end located approximately near the knee while the distal end is located at or near the groin region. The distal tip <b>852</b> of cannula <b>851</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10D</figref>, is inserted into the proximal end of the isolated vessel, e.g., a section of saphenous vein. The vessel is then ligated to the cannula. The proximal end <b>853</b> of cannula <b>851</b> may include a valve <b>854</b> to prevent back flow of fluid, such as blood and/or saline, from the vessel out the cannula <b>851</b> end. In one embodiment, the valve is a bileaflet or duckbill valve, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10D</figref>. In one embodiment, the proximal end <b>853</b> of cannula <b>851</b> may include a tension-coupling member <b>855</b> for coupling a tensioning member to the cannula, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10C-10D</figref>. In one embodiment, a twist lock mechanism may be used to secure a vessel-tensioning device member <b>861</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>, to the cannula <b>851</b>. The distal end <b>862</b> of vessel-tensioning device member <b>861</b> is inserted, twisted and locked into place within tension coupling member <b>855</b> located at the proximal end <b>853</b> of cannula <b>851</b>. In one embodiment, a bayonet fastener mechanism may be used to couple member <b>861</b> to member <b>85</b>. For example, raised bumps <b>864</b> sized to fit within grooves <b>865</b> may be used to couple member <b>861</b> to member <b>855</b>. A vessel tensioning device or system may be coupled to vessel-tensioning device member <b>861</b> at its proximal end <b>863</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> Once the vessel is cannulated balloon catheter <b>900</b> is routed through the vessel by routing proximal neck <b>903</b> and stylet <b>850</b> through cannula <b>851</b> and through the vessel section to be harvested. Once balloon catheter <b>900</b> is positioned in its desired location within the vessel section to be harvested, stylet <b>850</b> may or may not be removed from routing neck <b>903</b>. Following placement of balloon catheter <b>900</b> within the vessel, balloon catheter <b>900</b> may be inflated through the distal end of routing neck <b>903</b>, which has exited out the distal end of the vessel section. In one embodiment, balloon catheter <b>900</b> is inflated to a diameter of approximately 4 mm. Balloon catheter <b>900</b> is semi-rigid when it is inflated, which allows the vessel to still maintain most of its anatomical course. When balloon catheter <b>900</b> is inflated it is rigid enough to interface with routing ridge <b>506</b>, as discussed above. Routing ridge <b>506</b>, in combination with a cutting device having a flexible distal end, as discussed above, allows the cutting device to accurately and precisely navigate the vessel to ensure the harvesting of a viable vessel section, e.g., acceptable for use as a graft in a CABG procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> Balloon catheter <b>900</b> may or may not be made out of non-compliant or semi-compliant materials such as PET (polyethylene terepthalate), nylon, Pebax and/or polyurethane, for example. Most commonly, balloon catheter <b>900</b> is folded and wrapped in a collapsed configuration to create a low profile to assist in its insertion into the vessel. Sheath <b>871</b> may be a section of tubing made of an elastomer such as silicone and/or modified silicone, such as C-flex, which is silicone modified styrenic thermoplastic elastomer. Sheath <b>871</b> may be applied over the top of balloon catheter <b>900</b>. Sheath <b>871</b> expands with balloon <b>900</b> when balloon <b>900</b> is inflated with saline solution, and returns balloon <b>900</b> back to its original low profile when balloon <b>900</b> is deflated. Thus, sheath <b>871</b> assists in an application where balloon <b>900</b> is to be inserted into a vessel with a low profile, inflated, and removed from the vessel with a low profile. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"> By returning the vessel to a low profile after it has been inflated inside a vessel, the amount of damage to the inner vessel walls is greatly reduced during removal of balloon catheter <b>900</b>. Non-compliant and semi-compliant balloons are often folded and wrapped so that they have the lowest possible profile until they reach their destination within the vessel. Then once balloon <b>900</b> reaches its desired area it is inflated. Then in order to remove balloon <b>900</b> from the vessel, balloon <b>900</b> is deflated. However, balloon <b>900</b> may not return to its original low profile shape when deflated. This can be destructive to the inner walls of the vessel as balloon <b>900</b> can have edges created by folds when balloon <b>900</b> is deflated. Therefore, the elasticity of sheath <b>871</b> is used to bring the deflated balloon back to its original profile. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref>, an illustration of a flow delivered tethered balloon for use in harvesting a vessel section in one embodiment of the present invention is shown. This embodiment utilizes a tether <b>906</b> coupled to the routing neck <b>903</b> to introduce a balloon <b>900</b> into a vessel section, e.g., a saphenous vein, during a vessel harvesting procedure. Balloon catheter <b>900</b> is sealed at its proximal end <b>902</b>. In one embodiment, the distal end <b>905</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b> is attached or bonded to the proximal end of tether <b>906</b>. In one embodiment, routing neck <b>903</b> of balloon catheter <b>900</b> may be approximately 200 mm in length. In one embodiment, tether <b>906</b> may be approximately 500 mm in length. Parachute <b>912</b>, approximately 2-5 mm in diameter, is coupled or attached to the proximal end of tether <b>906</b>. It is of note that parachute <b>912</b> may be a cup shaped component, a lightweight ball, or anything that is easily carried by fluid flow without departing from the spirit of the invention. Tether <b>906</b> can be a thin string, such as thread or suture material. It could also be something with more stiffness so that it could be pushed into the vein while injecting fluid. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an illustration of an insertion device for a flow delivered tethered balloon, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref>, for use in harvesting a vessel section in one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Tether <b>906</b> may be introduced into the vessel through a vessel cannula <b>914</b> connected to a y-connector <b>916</b> with a Touhy Borst valve <b>918</b>. Valve <b>918</b> can be tightened as much as possible to prevent backflow of fluid, e.g., blood or saline, but still allow tether <b>906</b> to move. Port <b>920</b> of y-connector <b>916</b> is used to inject fluid, e.g., saline. Cannula <b>914</b> is inserted into the proximal end of a vessel section to be harvested, e.g., a saphenous vein section, and sutured into position. For a saphenous vein the proximal end of the section to be harvested is located near the knee. The distal end of the vessel, near the groin region, is opened to allow parachute <b>912</b> to exit the vessel section to be harvested. Tether <b>906</b> is injected into vessel at a location near the knee using fluid, such as saline, to carry parachute <b>912</b> from the knee to the groin incision. Balloon <b>900</b> is then pulled into position within the vessel at a desired location. After balloon <b>900</b> is inflated, the cutting device is inserted at the knee incision to perform the harvest. The fluid used to advance parachute <b>912</b> may be saline, blood, heparanized saline, or any other biocompatible fluid without departing from the spirit of the invention. In one embodiment, one or more fluids may be injected through port <b>920</b> to flush the vessel before, during and/or after insertion of balloon <b>900</b>. In one embodiment, parachute <b>912</b> allows balloon <b>900</b> to be pulled into the vessel by tether <b>906</b>, rather than pushed into the vessel with a stylet, for example. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12F</figref> illustrations of vessel support devices for use in harvesting a vessel section in one embodiment of the present invention are shown. The following discussion involves alternatives to using the balloon concepts discussed in detail above for vessel support. Specifically ways to provide stabilization or support to a vessel during a harvesting procedure by placing a support member inside the vessel. Theses alternatives include inserting a rod or dilator into a flexible sheath or coiled tube, using a wire braid that increases in diameter when compressed, a tapered rod or dilator, a rod or dilator with a flexible tip, a tube or dilator having irrigation holes, and a rod or dilator with slippery, lubricious coating, e.g., an Advawax coating or a hydrogel coating. Other lubricious coatings, as discussed above, may be used. These varied concepts all provide a support structure that is placed within the vessel section that is to be harvested, thereby providing the harvesting tool a structure to follow, while preserving the endothelial lining of the vessel. Some of the concepts provide for a small diameter during insertion and removal and a larger diameter during the cutting procedure. Some embodiments create a fluid barrier between the support member and the vessel wall. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"> Inserting a rod or dilator into a flexible sheath or coiled tube may be used to expand the flexible sheath or coiled tube. The flexible sheath or coiled tube may be inserted into the vessel with a smaller diameter, then expanded to a larger diameter with the rod or dilator, thereby achieving the desired diameter and stiffness. The rod or dilator may then be removed from the flexible sheath or coiled tube when it is desirable to have a smaller diameter to remove the flexible sheath or coiled tube from the vessel. The flexible sheath may be an elastomeric tube, approximately the length of the vessel section to be harvested. The flexible sheath would be capable of expanding to the desired diameter when a rod or dilator is inserted. Since the rod or dilator would be slid into the flexible sheath or coiled tube, rod or dilator and sheath materials that create minimal friction would be desirable. The coiled tube may be a piece of thin-walled, coiled polymer, such as Teflon, that had a heat set in the coiled configuration. The coil would unwind as the dilator is inserted, thereby expanding to the desired diameter. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows one embodiment of a dilator <b>930</b> that could be placed within the vessel to be harvested. Dilator <b>930</b> has a flexible tip <b>932</b> which is much more narrower than the diameter of dilator <b>930</b>, e.g., approximately 5 mm. Tip <b>932</b> may extend roughly 1 cm from the main body of dilator <b>930</b> and provides a guide for insertion of dilator <b>930</b> into a vessel section to be harvested. Dilator <b>930</b> may be made of a Teflon material so it would slide more easily though the vessel, thereby helping preserve the endothelial lining of the vessel. In one embodiment, dilator <b>930</b> may be inserted through a cannula <b>914</b> having diameter large enough to allow dilator <b>930</b> to pass through. One or more fluids as discussed above may be injected through port <b>920</b> to irrigate the vessel before, during and/or after insertion of dilator <b>930</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows one embodiment of dilator <b>930</b> having one or more holes <b>933</b>. Holes <b>933</b> allow the user to inject one or more fluids, e.g., saline, through the dilator to create pressure in the vessel thus expanding it outward and making the insertion of the dilator easier. The injection of fluid can creates a fluid barrier between the dilator and the vessel wall to minimize endothelial damage. </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> The end of the vessel may be tied off to retain the added fluid(s), such as saline. Fluid may be added to the vessel to achieve an internal vessel pressure of roughly 50-200 mmHg during insertion and removal of dilator <b>930</b>. In one embodiment, fluid(s) containing one or more medical, biological and/or pharmaceutical agents and/or drugs may be delivered to the vessel before, during and/or after a vessel harvesting procedure. One or more fluids may be delivered via one or more fluid delivery devices, e.g., a syringe or a pressurized fluid reservoir. The vessel may be secured by tying the vessel around features protruding from the side of the dilator. In one embodiment, a needle <b>948</b>, for example, may be inserted into the vessel section to be harvested. The needle is then used to fill the vessel section with fluid(s) before, during and/or after insertion of dilator <b>930</b>. In one embodiment, a small pressure relief hole may be created in the vessel section to insure the vessel is not damaged due to a large internal fluid pressure during the harvesting procedure. In one embodiment, a pressure gauge may be used to accurately monitor the internal pressure of the fluid filled vessel section. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> shows a vessel support device <b>954</b> comprising a braided cylindrical structure similar to a vascular stent. In one embodiment, a flexible protective membrane <b>956</b> is placed over device <b>954</b> to protect the endothelial layer by shielding the vessel wall from the wire braid during insertion and removal of device <b>954</b> during a vessel harvesting procedure. After support device <b>954</b> is inserted into the vessel, one end of device <b>954</b> is then fixed to the vessel. An insertion tool <b>958</b> is inserted within device <b>954</b> to cause device <b>954</b> to expand to the diameter of the vessel. </p>

Harvesting is often accomplished with an electrosurgical tool to cut away tissues around the vessel to be harvested so as to free the vessel, e.g., from the leg, the chest wall or other body structure. In some harvesting procedures, the location of the vessel has to be repeatedly assessed and verified by the surgeon to be sure to stay clear of the vessel with the surgical tool to avoid damaging the vessel. To prevent bleeding from the vessel or vessel attachment points, side branches of the vessel may be occluded, for example, via clips, sutures, or electrocautery. Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention discloses illuminating the vessel from the inside out to make the location of the vessel readily visible in order to cut around it. Another embodiment involves a catheter like device within the vessel to act as a guide for an external cutter to harvest the vessel away from the native tissue. A further embodiment, controls bleeding from the vessel side branches by dispensing into the side branches a material that occludes and plugs the side branch allowing the branch to be cut without applying clips, sutures, or electrocautery. </p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows illuminating a vessel <b>1100</b> with an intravenous catheter device emitting light <b>1102</b>, e.g., via fiber optics. This illumination is designed to aid visualization of the vessel, e.g., the internal mammary artery (IMA), radial artery, saphenous vein or similar vasculature during cut down to aid in the vessel harvesting procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an intravenous catheter device <b>1104</b> placed within a vessel <b>1106</b> to serve as a centering guide for advancing a vessel-cutting device <b>1108</b> along the exterior of vessel <b>1106</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"> With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, an illustration of a hemostatic control device <b>1111</b> for use in harvesting vessel sections in one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Hemostatic material <b>1110</b> is shown deployed from the hemostatic control device <b>1111</b> positioned within the vessel section to be harvested. In one embodiment, vessel side branches <b>1112</b> of the vessel section to be harvested may be occluded or plugged prior to the vessel harvesting procedure. Hemostatic material <b>1110</b> can maintain hemostasis without the time consuming process of ligating or cauterizing each branch during a vessel harvesting procedure. Hemostatic material <b>1110</b> may be made of UV curable glue or adhesive, a platelet gel material, an expanding hydrogel material, and/or other biocompatible hemostatic material. </p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an illustration of a vessel location and hemostasis device for use in harvesting vessel sections in one embodiment of the present invention is shown. In operation, a hollow guide <b>1122</b> is inserted through the chest wall, for example. A distal end of hollow guide <b>1116</b> has a ring/oval magnet <b>1118</b> attached. The distal end is placed against vessel exterior <b>1120</b> at a target anastomosis location. Hollow guide <b>1116</b> is then placed into vessel <b>1120</b>, e.g., an IMA vessel. Intravascular guide <b>1116</b> has a ring/oval magnet <b>1124</b> attached at its distal end. Intravascular guide is magnetically attracted to extravascular hollow guide <b>1122</b> trapping the vessel wall between them. Once the vessel wall between the two guides is penetrated, the rings form a hemostatic seal and hollow guides <b>1116</b> and <b>1122</b> now form a continuous channel to pass guidewires, catheters, hemostatic control devices through the vessel wall. </p>
