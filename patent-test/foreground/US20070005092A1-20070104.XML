The catheter may include one or more orifices in the outer tube proximal the first elongate member distal end and distal the balloon proximal waist. The stopper may include two or more lobes that define gaps therebetween to allow fluid passage from the distal end of the first elongate member into the balloon cavity. Alternatively, the stopper may be a basket attached to the second elongate member and flaring proximally to define a cavity sized to receive the distal end of the first elongate member or a cap attached to the second elongate member and flaring proximally to define a cavity sized to receive the distal end of the first elongate member that may have one or more orifices in a side wall thereof. The stopper may be fixed to the outer tube and may have a proximal face sized to abut a distal face of the outer tube and prevent distal passage of the outer tube thereover. Alternatively, the inner tube may have a first outer diameter and a second larger outer diameter distal the first outer diameter, the second outer diameter proximal end disposed in the balloon cavity and sized to prevent passage of the outer tube thereover and there may be a taper or a step-wise transition between the first outer diameter and the second outer diameter. The proximal waist of the catheter may extend distally of the distal end of the outer tube and the stopper may be fixed to the inner and sized to abut a distal face of the outer tube and may have one or more or openings positioned to allow the passage of fluid from a proximal to a distal side thereof. The catheter may include a radiopaque marker having a profile, the radiopaque marker being fixed to the outer tube and disposed in the balloon cavity, wherein the stopper is slidable on the second elongate member and is disposed between a distal face of the outer tube and the radiopaque marker, the stopper having a proximal face sized to abut the distal face of the outer tube and prevent distal passage of the outer tube thereover and a distal face sized to abut the radiopaque marker and sized to prevent distal passage of the stopper over the radiopaque marker. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter having a a wire attached to the outer tube proximate the proximal end thereof and attached to the inner tube in the general area of the balloon. The wire may include a coil disposed around the inner tube proximal the distal attachment point, one or more attachment points between the wire and the inner tube proximal the distal attachment point, or a radiopaque marker attached to the inner tube and disposed in the balloon cavity, wherein the wire is attached to the inner tube at the radiopaque marker. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter having a coil slidably disposed about the inner tube in the balloon cavity, the coil attached proximally to the proximal balloon waist or the distal end of the outer tube and attached distally to the distal balloon waist. The coil may also be attached distally to the inner tube proximate the distal balloon waist. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter wherein the stopper is attached to both the outer and inner tube, and the stopper permits a first relative position between the outer and inner tube where the stopper has a first length and second relative position between the outer and inner tube where the stopper has a second length shorter than the first length, the stopper permitting fluid flow therethrough. The stopper may include a plurality of telescoping wire rings or a plurality of sliding segments connected to each other seriatim. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter where the balloon inner surface has a first texture thereon, the second elongate member outer surface has a second texture thereon, where the first and second textures interact when the balloon is deflated to prevent relative movement of the balloon and the inner tube. The first texture may include a plurality of bumps and the second texture may include a plurality of transverse ribs or zigzag ribs. In an alternative embodiment, the balloon inner surface and the second elongate member outer surface have a tacky adhesive thereon that prevents relative movement of the balloon and the second elongate member in the deflated condition </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter where an interference fit proximate the distal waist of the balloon prevents relative movement between the first and second elongate members. The outer surface of the inner tube may have an irregular profile that provides the inteference fit with the inner surface of the first elongate member, where the first elongate member outer surface and the second elongate member inner surface defining one or more fluid passageways that fluidly connect the balloon cavity to the proximal end of the catheter. For example the inner tube may have a hexagonal profile. The outer tube may have a reduced inner diameter proximate the balloon proximal waist. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In an alternative embodiment, the catheter may include an insert between the first and second elongate members proximate the balloon proximal waist, the insert providing the interference fit and providing fluid passage lumens to fluidly connect the balloon cavity and the catheter proximal end. The insert may have circular inner profile and a non-circular outer profile such as a polygonal or an elliptical outer profile. Alternatively the insert may have a circular outer profile, a proximal face, a distal face and one or more lumens therebetween. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another embodiment pertains to a balloon catheter that includes at least one protrusion extending inward from the inner surface of the outer tube and at least one protrusion separate from the protrusion from the outer tube extending outward from the outer surface of the inner tube, the protrusions cooperatively engaged to prevent relative axial movement between the outer and inner tube. The protrusion from the outer tube may define a ring-shaped groove and wherein the at least one protrusion from the inner tube comprises one or more tabs which fit in the groove, the protrusions providing one or more gaps therebetween for fluid flow. The protrusion from the first elongate member may taper proximally and distally. The protrusion from the second elongate member may be a ring and wherein the at least one protrusions from the outer tube may be tabs between which the ring is confined. The tabs may be axially aligned. The at least one protrusion in the outer tube may be formed by indenting the wall thereof. The at least one protrusion in the inner tube may include a proximal ring and a distal ring. The proximal ring may taper proximally and the distal ring taper may taper distally.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partial diagrammatic side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b> defining a guidewire lumen and an outer tubular member <b>14</b> defining an inflation lumen. A balloon <b>4</b> has a proximal waist <b>10</b> sealingly attached to the outer tubular member <b>14</b> and a distal waist <b>12</b> sealingly attached to the inner tubular member <b>12</b>. The balloon defines an inflation cavity and may include a proximal cone <b>6</b> and a distal cone <b>8</b>. The distal end of the outer tubular member may be spaced apart from the surface of the inner tubular member to permit the flow of inflation fluid therethrough. The opening formed by the outer tubular member distal end and the inner tubular member is annular, although it may have other shapes. For example, a balloon catheter may include a crescent-shaped opening. The distal end of the outer tubular member may extend into the balloon cavity and there may be one or more orifices <b>16</b> in the side wall of the outer tubular member. These orifices <b>16</b> may provide additional pathways for inflation fluid. A stopper <b>20</b> is affixed to the inner tubular member and is disposed in the balloon cavity. The stopper has an outer profile that prevents distal movement of the outer tubular member with respect to the inner tubular member but permits distal movement of the inner tubular member with respect to the outer tubular member. The stopper may be located further from or closer to the distal end of the outer tubular member as desired. For example, the stopper may abut the distal end of the outer tubular member. Stopper <b>20</b> includes several lobes <b>20</b> that define gaps therebetween that permit fluid flow to and from the distal end of the outer tubular member even when the stopper abuts the distal end thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. Attached to the inner tubular member is a basket <b>22</b>. The basket has a proximal end that prevents the outer tubular member from moving distally relative to the inner tubular member but allows elongation of the balloon. The basket may include arms that can be compressed against the inner tubular member and are biased to spring out to the position shown. The basket may be made from metal, polymer resin or other suitable material. The outer tubular member may include orifices <b>16</b> that allow for inflation and deflation of the balloon. </p>

A stopper <b>24</b> is attached to the inner tubular member. The stopper may flare proximally to abut against or envelop the distal end of the outer tubular member and thus prevent the outer tubular member from moving distally relative to the inner tubular member while permitting balloon elongation. Orifices <b>16</b> may be included in the outer tubular member to provide a fluid flow path for inflation fluid. </p>

A stopper <b>25</b> is attached to the inner tubular member. The stopper is sized to abut against the distal end of the outer tubular member and prevent distal movement thereof. The stopper may include lumens extending from the proximal face to the distal face to provide a fluid flow path for the inflation fluid. Alternatively or in addition, orifices <b>16</b> may be provided in the distal end of the outer tubular member. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>26</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. Inner tubular member <b>26</b> has a first outer profile and a second outer profile distal the first outer diameter and of greater size. The second outer profile is sized to prevent the distal passage of the outer tubular member thereon. The two sections of the inner tubular member may be joined by a flare <b>28</b>, a step-wise increase, or other suitable configuration. The outer tubular member may include orifices <b>16</b> to provide an additional fluid flow path. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. The proximal waist of balloon <b>4</b> extends distally of the distal end of outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A stopper <b>30</b> is attached to the inner tubular member and flares proximally to abut the distal end of the outer tubular member within the proximal balloon waist and prevent relative distal motion of the outer tubular member. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the stopper includes slots <b>32</b> to provide a fluid flow path. The stopper may have different configurations. For example, the stopper may be substantially cylindrical and have lumens extending longitudinally therethrough to provide an inflation fluid flow path. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A slidable stopper <b>34</b> is disposed on the inner tubular member. Stopper <b>34</b> is prevented from moving distally beyond radiopaque marker <b>36</b> by the proximal profile of the marker. The distal end of the outer tubular member is prevented from moving distally beyond the stopper by the proximal profile of the stopper. Orifices <b>16</b> may be included to provide additional fluid flow paths. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A wire <b>38</b> disposed in the lumen of the outer tubular member and attached proximally to a proximal part of the outer tubular member and distal to the inner tubular member proximate the proximal waist of the balloon reduces relative movement of the inner and outer tubular members and may provide increased column strength. The term wire is used in this example embodiment and in all places in this application to denote a component having a length that is substantially greater than the transverse dimensions. The term wire does not imply a specific shape, cross-section or material. For example, a metal, a polymer resin or any suitable material may be used for wire <b>38</b>. In an additional example, wire <b>38</b> could have a square, hollow, or variable cross-section. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the wire may have a coil <b>40</b>. The coil is shown at the distal end of the wire but may be located elsewhere, such as further proximally. The coil is proximal the distal connection of the wire to the inner tubular member. The coil can compress along the longitudinal axis of the catheter to prevent relative movement of the inner and outer tubular members while permitting longitudinal expansion of the balloon. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wire <b>38</b> may have multiple distal attachment points <b>42</b> or may extend to a radiopaque marker <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Wire <b>38</b> may extend over only a portion of the catheter. For example, wire <b>38</b> may be attached proximally to a midpoint of the outer tubular member and distally to the inner tubular member at a radiopaque marker. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A closely wound coil <b>44</b> is disposed on the inner tubular member in the balloon cavity. The coil may be attached at a proximal end to the outer tubular member and at a distal end to the distal waist of the balloon. The coil provides columnar support to prevent distal movement of the outer tubular member from compressing the balloon while permitting the balloon to expand. The coil may be a spiral cut tube, a shaped wire coil or other suitable configuration. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the coil is also distally attached to the inner tubular member. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b> in an expanded position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts the balloon catheter in a contracted position. The balloon catheter includes texture <b>46</b> on the inner surface of the balloon and texture <b>48</b> on the outer surface of the inner tubular member. When in the contracted position, textures <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> interact and mesh to prevent relative movement of the inner tubular member and the balloon. Textures <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> may be any compatible textures. For example, texture <b>48</b> may be a plurality of transverse or zigzag ribs and texture <b>46</b> may be small protrusions. Conversely, texture <b>46</b> may be transverse or zigzag ribs and texture <b>48</b> may be protrusions or ribs. Any suitable texture may be used. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b> in an expanded position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> depicts the balloon catheter in a contracted position. On the inner surface of the balloon and the outer surface of the inner tubular member in the balloon cavity, a tacky adhesive <b>50</b> is disposed. Adhesive <b>50</b> is tacky but not so strong as to prevent inflation of the balloon and operates to prevent relative longitudinal motion between the balloon and the inner catheter. Adhesive <b>50</b> may be, for example, an uncured rubber gum. In some embodiments, adhesive <b>50</b> may lose its adhesive qualities once the balloon has been inflated. In some embodiments, adhesive <b>50</b> may be applied only to the balloon wall or only to the outer surface of the inner tubular member. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A stopper <b>52</b> is attached to both the inner tubular member and the outer tubular member. The stopper includes several telescoping rings which collapse as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Alternatively, the stopper includes a plurality of interlocking segments that slide into each other. The stopper permits only a limited range of relative movement between the inner tubular member and the outer tubular member. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>54</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>56</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, inner tubular member <b>54</b> has a non-circular cross sectional profile. In this embodiment the profile is hexagonal, but other suitable profiles include but are not limited to pentagonal, gear-shaped, elliptical, and screw-shaped. The outer surface of the inner tubular member contacts the inner surface of the outer tubular member proximate the proximal end of the balloon. The inner catheter is in an interference fit with the outer catheter, preventing relative movement thereof. In other embodiments, adhesive or welding may be used to join the inner and outer catheters. The non-circular profile of the inner catheter ensures that one or more lumens remain open for the passage of the inflation medium, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. In other embodiments, the outer catheter may have a non-circular inner profile that creates an interference fit with a substantially circular inner catheter. The outer catheter may have a reduced distal profile to engage the inner catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. An insert <b>58</b> is disposed between the outer tubular member and the inner tubular member and prevents relative longitudinal movement between the two. The insert extends distally into the balloon cavity. Insert <b>58</b> may have an interference fit with one or both of the outer and inner tubular members or may be adhesively joined or welded to one or both of the outer and inner tubular members. Insert <b>58</b> has a non-circular outer profile as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The profile of insert <b>58</b> is hexagonal, but many profiles are suitable, some of which have been described above. The profile of the insert provides lumens for the passage of inflation fluid to the balloon. In other embodiments, insert <b>58</b> has a non-circular inner profile. Circular and non-circular are terms used with respect to the balloon catheters depicted herein. A circular profile is a profile that may be coincident with the profile of one of the tubular members, all of which are shown herein as circular. However, non-circular tubular members may be used and in such cases, the profile of the insert may be modified to be used with the non-circular tubular member. In other words, the term circular is not intended to be so limiting. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. An insert <b>60</b> is disposed between the outer tubular member and the inner tubular member and prevents relative longitudinal movement between the two. The insert is positioned proximally of the outer tubular member distal end, although other positions may be suited. For example, the insert may be placed at the outer tubular member distal end. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> are perspective views depicting example tubular members disposed on inner tubular members <b>2</b>. Both insert <b>60</b> and insert <b>62</b> have circular inner and outer profiles and both have lumen patterns therethrough to provide a pathway for inflation fluid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is a perspective view of an insert <b>64</b> having a noncircular hexagonal outer profile. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of a balloon catheter having this insert therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a perspective view of an insert <b>66</b> having a noncircular elliptical outer profile. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of a balloon catheter having this insert therein. As can be readily inferred from these four example inserts, many inserts with varied profiles may be suitable. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a diagrammatic side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member <b>2</b>, a balloon <b>4</b> and an outer tubular member <b>14</b>. A protrusion <b>68</b> is attached to the inner tubular member and is confined by a protrusion <b>70</b> attached to the outer tubular member. The inner catheter can rotate with respect to the outer catheter at this point, but has very limited proximal or distal relative motion. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, protrusion <b>70</b> is a ring defining an annular groove. The ring may have proximal and distal tapers as shown. Protrusion <b>68</b> includes four tabs (though fewer or more tabs may be used) that are trapped in the annular groove. The combination of the protrusions does not fully occlude the inflation lumen, thereby providing the inflation fluid with a path to the balloon. Other embodiments may include variations of this. For example, one embodiment not pictured has a protrusion on the inner tubular member that is a ring defining an annular groove and a protrusion on the outer tubular member that has five tabs confined in the groove. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> depicts an embodiment having a ring <b>68</b> on the inner tubular member confined by pairs of tabs <b>72</b> on the outer tubular members. Tabs <b>72</b> may or may not be axially aligned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> is a perspective view of an example outer tubular member <b>74</b>. Protrusions may be created in outer tubular member <b>74</b> by forming indents <b>76</b> in the outer surface of the member. Such indents may be thermoformed, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> depicts a balloon catheter having rounded protrusions <b>78</b> on the inner tubular member forming a channel for confining protrusions <b>80</b> on the outer tubular member. Protrusions <b>80</b> are one, two or more beads disposed on the inner surface of the outer tubular member. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> depicts a balloon catheter having tapered protrusions <b>82</b> defining a channel for confining protrusions <b>84</b>. Protrusions <b>84</b> may be one, two or more tabs extending from the inner surface of the outer tubular member. </p>
