<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> a. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The instant invention is directed to the field of intravasuclar catheters for ablation of tissue. In particular, the invention relates to forms of ring electrodes positioned at a distal end of a catheter to perform an ablation procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> b. Background Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> A catheter is generally a very small diameter tube for insertion into the body for the performance of medical procedures. Among other uses, catheters can be used to examine, diagnose, and treat disease while positioned at a specific location within the body that is otherwise inaccessible without more invasive procedures. During these procedures a catheter is inserted into the patient's vasculature near the surface of the body and is guided to a specific location within the body for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. For example, one procedure utilizes a catheter to convey an electrical stimulus to a selected location within the human body. Another procedure utilizes a catheter with sensing electrodes to monitor various forms of electrical activity in the human body. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In a normal heart, contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle (myocardium) takes place in an organized fashion as electrochemical signals pass sequentially through the myocardium from the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the right atrium, to the atrialventricular (AV) node in the septum between the right atrium and right ventricle, and then along a well-defined route which includes the His-Purkinje system into the left and right ventricles. Sometimes abnormal rhythms occur in the atria that are referred to as atrial arrhythmia. Three of the most common arrhythmia are ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Arrhythmia can result in significant patient discomfort and even death because of a number of associated problems, including the following: (1) an irregular heart rate, which causes a patient discomfort and anxiety; (2) loss of synchronous atrioventricular contractions, which compromises cardiac hemodynamics resulting in varying levels of congestive heart failure; and (3) stasis of blood flow, which increases the vulnerability to thromboembolism. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> It is sometimes difficult to isolate a specific pathological cause for the arrhythmia, although it is believed that the principal mechanism is one or a multitude of stray circuits within the left and/or right atrium. These circuits or stray electrical signals are believed to interfere with the normal electrochemical signals passing from the SA node to the AV node and into the ventricles. Efforts to alleviate these problems in the past have included significant usage of various drugs. In some circumstances drug therapy is ineffective and frequently is plagued with side effects such as dizziness, nausea, vision problems, and other difficulties. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> An increasingly common medical procedure for the treatment of certain types of atrial arrhythmia and other cardiac arrhythmia involves the ablation of tissue in the heart to cut-off the path for stray or improper electrical signals. The particular area for ablation depends on the type of underlying arrhythmia. Originally, such procedures actually involved making incisions in the myocardium (hence the term &#x201c;ablate,&#x201d; which means to cut) to create scar tissue that blocked the electrical signals. These procedures are now often performed with an ablation catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Ablation catheters do not physically cut the tissue. Instead they are designed to apply electrical energy to areas of the myocardial tissue causing tissue necrosis by coagulating the blood supply in the tissue and thus halt new blood flow to the tissue area. The necrosis lesion produced electrically isolates or renders the tissue non-contractile. The lesion partially or completely blocks the stray electrical signals to lessen or eliminate arrhythmia. Typically, the ablation catheter is inserted into an artery or vein in the leg, neck, or arm of the patient and threaded, sometimes with the aid of a guide wire or introducer, through the vessels until a distal tip of the ablation catheter reaches the desired location for the ablation procedure in the heart. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> It is well known that benefits may be gained by forming lesions in tissue if the depth and location of the lesions being formed can be controlled. In particular, it can be desirable to elevate tissue temperature to around 50&#xb0; C. until lesions are formed via coagulation necrosis, which changes the electrical properties of the tissue. For example, when sufficiently deep lesions are formed at specific locations in cardiac tissue via coagulation necrosis, undesirable ventricular tachycardias and atrial flutter may be lessened or eliminated. &#x201c;Sufficiently deep&#x201d; lesions means transmural lesions in some cardiac applications. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> It has been discovered that more effective results may be achieved if a linear lesion of cardiac tissue is formed. The term &#x201c;linear lesion&#x201d; as used herein means an elongate, continuous lesion, whether straight or curved, that blocks electrical conduction. The ablation catheters commonly used to perform these procedures produce electrically inactive or noncontractile tissue at a selected location by physical contact of the cardiac tissue with an electrode of the ablation catheter. Current techniques for creating continuous linear lesions in endocardial applications include, for example, dragging a conventional catheter on the tissue, using an array electrode, or using pre-formed curved electrodes. Curved electrodes have also been formed by guiding a catheter with an array electrode over a wire rail The wire rail is formed as a loop, thus guiding the distal end of the catheter into a loop form as well. The array electrodes and curved electrodes are generally placed along the length of tissue to be treated and energized to create a lesion in the tissue contiguous with the span of electrodes along the curved or looped surface. Alternately, some catheter designs incorporate steering mechanisms to direct an electrode at the distal tip of the catheter. The clinician places the distal tip electrode of the catheter on a targeted area of tissue by sensitive steering mechanisms and then relocates the electrode tip to an adjacent tissue location in order to form a continuous lesion. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> During conventional ablation procedures, the ablating energy is delivered directly to the cardiac tissue by an electrode on the catheter placed against the surface of the tissue to raise the temperature of the tissue to be ablated. Care must be taken to prevent the excessive application of energy, which can result in tissue damage beyond mere necrosis and instead actually decompose, i.e., char, the tissue. Such excessive tissue damage can ultimately weaken and compromise the myocardium. The rise in tissue temperature also causes a rise in the temperature of blood surrounding the electrode. This often results in the formation of coagulum on the electrode, which reduces the efficiency of the ablation electrode. With direct contact between the electrode and the blood, some of the energy targeted for the tissue ablation is dissipated into the blood. This coagulation problem can be especially significant when linear ablation lesions or tracks are produced because such linear ablation procedures conventionally take more time than ablation procedures ablating only a single location. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The present invention is directed to an improved design for ring or wire electrode ablation catheters used, for example, in cardiac ablation procedures to produce lesions in cardiac tissue. The ring or wire electrodes are mounted on the outside surface of the distal end of the ablation catheter in order to be placed into contact with the target tissue. In the present invention, substantially all of the outer surface of each ring or the wire electrode is covered by an electrically insulating coating. The insulating surface coating on each ring electrode or the wire electrode defines a contoured opening in the insulating surface coating that exposes the conductive electrode beneath. In a series of ring electrodes or along a single helical wire electrode, each of the contoured openings is positioned in a linear array parallel to the longitudinal direction of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In one form of the invention, a catheter comprises an elongate shaft defining a lumen extending distally from a proximal section. At least one electrode is positioned about a distal end of the elongate shaft. The at least one electrode further comprises a conductive material and an insulating coating substantially covering the conductive material. The insulating coating defines a contoured opening that exposes an area of the conductive material. At least one electrode lead is housed within the lumen, extends from the proximal section, and is coupled at a distal end with the at least one electrode. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In another form of the invention, a catheter comprises an elongate shaft defining a lumen extending distally from a proximal section. A plurality of electrode rings is positioned about a distal end of the elongate shaft. Each of the plurality of electrode rings encircles a respective portion of the elongate shaft and is spaced apart from each adjacent electrode ring by a uniform distance. Each of the plurality of electrode rings further comprises a conductive material and an insulating coating substantially covering the conductive material. The insulating coating defines a contoured opening that exposes an area of the conductive material. The contoured openings of each of the plurality of electrode rings are arranged longitudinally along the distal end of the elongate shaft to form a linear array. At least one electrode lead is housed within the lumen, extends from the proximal section, and is coupled at a distal end with the plurality of electrode rings. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In a further form of the invention, a catheter comprises an elongate shaft defining a lumen extending from a proximal section. A helical wire electrode is wrapped about a distal end of the elongate shaft. The helical wire electrode further comprises a conductive material and an insulating coating substantially covering the conductive material. The insulating coating defines a plurality of contoured openings that each expose an area of the conductive material. Each of the plurality of contoured openings is positioned circumferentially about the elongate shaft in-line with each adjacent contoured opening to form a linear array parallel to the longitude of the elongate shaft. Each turn of the helical electrode wire is spaced sufficiently close to each adjacent turn at a regular, narrow interval to provide sufficient energy overlap to produce a linear lesion correlative to a length of the helical wire electrode. At least one electrode lead is housed within the lumen, extends from the proximal section, and is coupled at a distal end with the helical electrode wire. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> An alternative form of the invention is directed to an electrode for use in conjunction with a cardiac ablation catheter. The electrode comprises a conductive band sized to encircle an outer surface of the catheter. An insulating coating substantially covers an outer surface of the conductive band. The insulating coating defines a contoured aperture exposing a portion of the conductive band. A lead wire is electrically coupled with the conductive band. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> An additional form of the invention concerns a method for minimizing variations in power density in a surface electrode positioned on a catheter. A conductive material portion of the surface electrode is coated with a biocompatible, electrically insulating coating. Then a contoured aperture is formed within the electrically insulating coating to expose an area of the conductive material portion. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Other features, details, utilities, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more particular written description of various forms of the invention as further illustrated in the accompanying drawings and defined in the appended claims.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The present invention concerns an improved design for ring or wire electrode ablation catheters used, for example, in cardiac ablation procedures to produce lesions in cardiac tissue. The ring or wire electrodes are mounted on the outside surface of the distal end of the ablation catheter in order to be placed into contact with the target tissue. In the present invention, substantially all of the outer surface of each ring or wire electrode is covered by an electrically insulating coating. The insulating coating on each ring or wire electrode defines a contoured opening in the insulating coating that exposes the conductive electrode beneath. In a series of ring electrodes or along a single helical wire electrode, each of the contoured openings is positioned in a linear array parallel to the length of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of a catheter/introducer assembly <b>2</b> for use in conjunction with the present invention. According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a catheter <b>22</b> in the form of an elongate shaft has an electrical connector <b>4</b> at a proximal end <b>14</b> and an ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, at a distal end <b>12</b>. The catheter <b>22</b> is used in combination with an inner guiding introducer <b>28</b> and an outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> to facilitate formation of lesions on tissue, for example, cardiovascular tissue. The inner guiding introducer <b>28</b> is longer than and is inserted within the lumen of the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b>. Alternatively, a single guiding introducer or a precurved transeptal sheath may be used instead of both the inner guiding introducer <b>28</b> and the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b>. In general, introducers or precurved sheaths are shaped to facilitate placement of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> at the tissue surface to be ablated. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> may be formed with a curve at the distal end <b>12</b>. Similarly, the inner guiding introducer <b>28</b> may be formed with a curve at the distal end <b>12</b>. Together, the curves in the guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> help orient the catheter <b>22</b> as it emerges from the inner guiding introducer <b>26</b> in a cardiac cavity. Thus, the inner guiding introducer <b>28</b> and the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> are used navigate a patient's vasculature to the heart and through its complex physiology to reach specific tissue to be ablated. The guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> need not be curved or curved in the manner depicted depending upon the desired application. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is connected with a hemostatic valve <b>6</b> at its proximal end to prevent blood or other fluid that fills the guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> from leaking before the insertion of the catheter <b>22</b>. The hemostatic valves <b>6</b> form tight seals around the shafts of the guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> or the catheter <b>22</b> when inserted therein. Each hemostatic valve <b>6</b> may be have a port connected with a length of tubing <b>16</b> to a fluid introduction valve <b>8</b>. The fluid introduction valves <b>8</b> may be connected with a fluid source, for example, saline or a drug, to easily introduce the fluid into the introducers, for example, to flush the introducer or to inject a drug in to the patient. Each of the fluid introduction valves <b>8</b> may control the flow of fluid into the hemostatic valves <b>16</b> and thereby the guiding introducers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The proximal end <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> may include a catheter boot <b>10</b> that seals around several components to allow the introduction of fluids and control mechanisms into the catheter <b>22</b>. For example, at least one fluid introduction valve <b>8</b> with an attached length of tubing <b>16</b> may be coupled with the catheter boot <b>10</b>. An optional fluid introduction valve <b>8</b>&#x2032; and correlative tube <b>16</b>&#x2032; (shown in phantom) may also be coupled with the catheter boot <b>10</b>, for example, for the introduction of fluid into a catheter with multiple fluid lumens if separate control of the pressure and flow of fluid in the separate lumens is desired. The electrical connector <b>4</b> for connection with a control handle, an energy generator, and/or sensing equipment (none shown) may be coupled with the catheter boot <b>10</b> via a control shaft <b>24</b>. The control shaft <b>24</b> may enclose, for example, control wires for manipulating the catheter <b>22</b> or ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, conductors for energizing an electrode in the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, and/or lead wires for connecting with sensors in the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. The catheter boot <b>10</b> provides a sealed interface to shield the connections between such wires and fluid sources and one or more lumen in the catheter <b>22</b> through which they extend. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The catheter may be constructed from a number of different polymers, for example, polypropylene, oriented polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, crystallized polyethylene terephthalate, polyester, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetraflouroethylene (ePTFE), and Pellethane&#xae;. Alternatively, the catheter <b>22</b> may be composed, for example, of any of several formulations of Pebax&#xae; resins (AUTOFINA Chemicals, Inc., Philadelphia, Pa.), or other polyether-block co-polyamide polymers. By using different formulations of the Pebax&#xae; resins for different sections of the catheter, different material and mechanical properties, for example, flexibility or stiffness, can be chosen for different sections along the length of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The catheter may also be a braided catheter wherein the catheter wall includes a cylindrical and/or flat braid of metal fibers (not shown), for example, stainless steel fibers. Such a metallic braid may be included in the catheter to add stability to the catheter and also to resist radial forces that might crush the catheter. Metallic braid also provides a framework to translate torsional forces imparted by the clinician on the proximal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> to the distal end <b>12</b> to rotate the catheter <b>22</b> for appropriate orientation of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The distal end of the catheter may be straight or take on a myriad of shapes depending upon the desired application. The distal end <b>12</b> of one embodiment of a catheter <b>22</b> according to the present invention is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the catheter <b>22</b> consists mainly of a &#x201c;straight&#x201d; section <b>30</b> extending from the catheter boot <b>10</b> at the proximal end <b>14</b> to a point adjacent to the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter/introducer assembly <b>2</b> (see the exemplary catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The straight section <b>30</b> is generally the portion of the catheter <b>22</b> that remains within the vasculature of the patient while a sensing or ablation procedure is performed by a clinician. At the distal end <b>12</b>, the catheter <b>22</b> is composed of a first curved section <b>32</b> and a second curved section <b>34</b> before transitioning into a third curved section <b>36</b> that forms the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. The first curved section <b>32</b> is adjacent and distal to the straight section <b>30</b> and proximal and adjacent to the second curved section <b>34</b>. The second curved section <b>34</b> is itself proximal and adjacent to the third curved section <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> The straight section <b>30</b>, first curved section <b>32</b>, second curved section <b>34</b>, and third curved section <b>36</b> may together form a single, unitary structure of the catheter <b>22</b>, but may originally be separate pieces joined together to form the catheter <b>22</b>. For example, as indicated above, each of the different sections of the catheter may be composed of different formulations of Pebax&#xae; resins, or other polyether-block co-polyamide polymers, which can be used to create desired material stiffness within the different sections of the catheter. By joining separate curved sections or unitarily molding the distal end of the catheter shaft <b>22</b> proximal to the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> using a relatively stiff resin, a desired shape can be imparted to that section of the catheter shaft <b>22</b> to effect the ultimate orientation of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the first curved section <b>32</b> and second curved section <b>34</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> align the third curved section <b>36</b> such that it is transverse to the orientation of the straight section <b>30</b> of the catheter <b>22</b>. The ablation electrode section <b>20</b> assumes the shape of the third curved section <b>36</b> and forms a generally C-shaped or lasso-like configuration when deployed from the inner guiding introducer <b>28</b>. In addition, the distal end of the straight section <b>30</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> is oriented in a position where a longitudinal axis extending through the distal end of the straight section <b>30</b> passes orthogonally through the center of a circle defined by the C-shaped third curved section <b>36</b>. In this manner the straight section <b>30</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> is spatially displaced from the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> so that the straight section <b>30</b> is unlikely to interfere with the interface between the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> extending along the third curved section <b>36</b> and the cardiac tissue as further described below. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The catheter <b>22</b> may further house a shape-retention or shape-memory wire <b>50</b> in order to impart a desired shape to the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> in the area of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>. A shape-retention or shape-memory wire <b>50</b> is flexible while a clinician negotiates the catheter <b>22</b> through the vasculature to reach the heart and enter an atrial chamber. Once the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> reaches the desired cardiac cavity with the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, the shape-retention/shape-memory wire <b>50</b> can be caused to assume a pre-formed shape form, e.g., the C-shaped configuration of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, to accurately orient the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> within the cardiac cavity for the procedure to be performed. The C-shaped configuration of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> may be imparted to the catheter through the use of such shape-retention or shape-memory wires, in addition to or in lieu of pre-molding of the catheter material, to appropriately conform to tissue or to the shape of a cavity in order to create the desired lesion at a desired location. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> In one embodiment, the shape-retention/shape-memory wire <b>50</b> may be NiTinol wire, a nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy, chosen for its exceptional shape-retention/shape-memory properties. When used for shape-memory applications, metals such as NiTinol are materials that have been plastically deformed to a desired shape before use. Then upon heat application, either from the body as the catheter is inserted into the vasculature or from external sources, the shape-memory material is caused to assume its original shape before being plastically deformed. A shape-memory wire generally exhibits increased tensile strength once the transformation to the pre-formed shape is completed. NiTinol and other shape-memory alloys are able to undergo a &#x201c;martenistic&#x201d; phase transformation that enables them to change from a &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; shape to a &#x201c;parent&#x201d; shape at temperatures above a transition temperature. Below the transition temperature, the alloy can be bent into various shapes. Holding a sample in position in a particular parent shape while heating it to a high temperature programs the alloy to remember the parent shape. Upon cooling, the alloy adopts any temporary shape imparted to it, but when heated again above the transition temperature, the alloy automatically reverts to its parent shape </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> Common formulas of NiTinol have transformation temperatures ranging between &#x2212;100 and +110&#xb0; C., have great shape-memory strain, are thermally stable, and have excellent corrosion resistance, which make NiTinol exemplary for use in medical devices for insertion into a patient. For example, the shape-memory wire may be designed using NiTinol with a transition temperature around or below room temperature. Before use the catheter is stored in a low-temperature state. By flushing the fluid lumen with chilled saline solution, the NiTinol shape-memory wire can be kept in the deformed state while positioning the catheter at the desired site. When appropriately positioned, the flow of chilled saline solution can be stopped and the catheter, either warmed by body heat or by the introduction of warm saline, promotes recovery by the shape-memory wire to assume its &#x201c;preprogrammed&#x201d; shape, forming, for example, the C-shaped curve of the ablation electrode section. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> Alternately, or in addition, shape-memory materials such as NiTinol may also be super elastic&#x2014;able to sustain a large deformation at a constant temperature&#x2014;and when the deforming force is released they return to their original, undeformed shape. Thus the catheter <b>22</b> incorporating NiTinol shape-retention wire <b>50</b> may be inserted into the generally straight lengths of introducer sheaths to reach a desired location and upon emerging from the introducer, the shape-retention wire <b>50</b> will assume its &#x201c;preformed&#x201d; shape. The shape-retention wire <b>50</b> is flexible while a clinician negotiates the catheter <b>22</b> through the vasculature to reach the heart and enter an atrial chamber. Once the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> reaches the desired cardiac cavity with the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, the shape-retention wire <b>50</b> assumes a pre-formed shape form, e.g., the C-shaped configuration of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>, to accurately orient the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> within the cardiac cavity for the procedure to be performed. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an array of electrode rings <b>38</b> is also provided along the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> at the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b>. Each of the electrode rings <b>38</b> is spaced apart equidistant from each adjacent electrode ring <b>38</b>. However, the electrode rings <b>38</b> may be spaced apart at differing regular or irregular intervals depending upon the desired effect of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. Further, the greater or fewer electrode rings <b>38</b> may be mounted on the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> than the number depicted, again depending upon the desired effect of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>. Each of the electrode rings <b>38</b> defines a contoured opening <b>40</b>, the structure and function of which are further described below. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the catheter <b>22</b> may house a wire lumen <b>46</b> and a shape-retention wire <b>50</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> depict a portion of the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> at the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> in greater detail. The catheter <b>22</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is presented in a straight, linear form as opposed to the curved form of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> for ease of depiction of the structures therein. As previously noted, the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> may be caused to take on any of a number of desired shapes depending upon the intended application of the catheter <b>22</b> as further described herein below. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> As indicated above, the catheter <b>22</b> defines a wire lumen <b>46</b> as shown to good advantage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The wire lumen <b>46</b> houses a plurality of electrode lead wires <b>48</b>, which travel from the electrical connector <b>4</b> at the proximal end <b>14</b> of the catheter assembly <b>2</b> to the distal end <b>12</b> of the catheter <b>22</b>. Each of the electrode lead wires <b>48</b> may be coupled with a respective electrode ring <b>38</b>, thereby allowing each electrode ring <b>38</b> to be individually addressable. The electrode lead wires <b>48</b> transmit radio frequency (RF) energy from an energy generator (not shown) to energize the electrode rings <b>38</b>. Because each electrode ring <b>38</b> is individually addressable, RF energy can be transmitted to only one, several, or all of the electrode rings <b>38</b> at a single instant. The electrode rings <b>38</b> may be evenly spaced along the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> of the catheter <b>22</b> in order to create a continuous, linear lesion in the target tissue. Further, RF energy at different power levels can be transmitted to different electrode rings <b>38</b>. It should be noted that one of the electrode lead wires could also be coupled with several electrode rings to provide for an addressable subset of the electrode rings. Also, a single electrode lead could be coupled with all of the electrode rings as further described below. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Each of the ring electrodes <b>38</b> is formed of a conductive band <b>42</b> attached circumferentially about the outer surface of the catheter <b>22</b>. The conductive bands <b>42</b> may be composed of platinum, gold, stainless steel, iridium, or alloys of these metals, or other biocompatible, conductive material. The conductive bands <b>42</b> of each electrode ring <b>38</b> have an electrically insulating, polymer surface coating <b>44</b>. The surface coating <b>44</b> is preferably formed of a material with high dielectric properties that can be applied in a very thin layer. Exemplary surface coatings may include thin coatings of polyester, polyamides, polyimides, and blends of polyurethane and polyimides. An aperture is formed in the surface coating <b>44</b> to create a contoured opening <b>40</b> that exposes a small area of the conductive band <b>42</b>. Each contoured opening <b>40</b> is preferably positioned circumferentially about the catheter <b>22</b> inline with each adjacent contoured opening <b>40</b>. The contoured openings <b>40</b> may extend between about 1/10 and &#x2153; the circumference of the ring electrodes <b>38</b>. Longer countered openings <b>40</b> make it easier to position the ablation electrode section <b>20</b> adjacent the target tissue. However, longer contoured openings <b>40</b> can also lead to greater heat generation and the potential for hot spots as further discussed below. A balance in the length of the contoured openings <b>440</b> should thus be struck depending upon the particular application. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> A corresponding electrode lead wire <b>48</b> is coupled to the conductive band <b>42</b> of a respective electrode ring <b>38</b>, for example, as shown to good advantage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Each electrode lead wire <b>48</b> exits the wire lumen <b>46</b>, protrudes through the exterior catheter wall <b>52</b>, and is electrically connected to the conductive band <b>42</b> of the ring electrode <b>38</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each electrode lead wire <b>48</b> may be coupled to a respective conductive band <b>42</b> directly adjacent the contoured opening in the surface coating <b>44</b>. However, the electrode lead wires <b>48</b> may alternately be coupled to the conductive bands <b>42</b> at any location along the circumference of the conductive bands <b>42</b> as long as the conductive bands <b>42</b> are good electrical conductors and good electrical connections are created. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> Alternatively, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a single electrode lead wire <b>48</b>&#x2032; is coupled with each of the conductive bands <b>42</b>&#x2032; of the ring electrodes <b>38</b>&#x2032;. The distal end <b>12</b>&#x2032; of the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2032; of this embodiment forms an ablation electrode section <b>20</b>&#x2032; generally identical to the ablation electrode section of the previous embodiment. Each of the ring electrodes <b>38</b>&#x2032; is covered with an insulating surface coating <b>44</b>&#x2032; that defines a contoured opening <b>40</b>&#x2032; exposing a conductive band <b>42</b>&#x2032; underneath. The catheter <b>22</b>&#x2032; may further include a shape memory wire <b>50</b>&#x2032; and a wire lumen <b>46</b>&#x2032; as in the previous embodiment. Only a single electrode lead wire <b>48</b>&#x2032; is housed in the wire lumen <b>46</b>&#x2032; that may have a plurality of branches that attach the electrode lead wire <b>48</b>&#x2032; to each of the electrode rings <b>38</b>&#x2032;. As is evident from the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the ring electrodes <b>38</b>&#x2032; in this embodiment are not individually addressable and each ring electrode <b>38</b>&#x2032; will be simultaneously and generally equally powered upon application of energy through the electrode lead wire <b>48</b>&#x2032; from an energy source. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a further alternative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033; is formed of a conductive wire <b>42</b>&#x2033; and covered with an insulating, polymer surface coating <b>44</b>&#x2033; The helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033; is attached circumferentially about the outer surface of the distal end <b>12</b>&#x2033; of the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2033; along the ablation electrode section <b>20</b>&#x2033;. The helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033; may be the same wire as an electrode lead wire housed within a wire lumen (not shown) in the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2033;. In such a design, the electrode lead wire may exit the exterior wall of the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2033;, begin wrapping around the exterior surface of the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2033; distally to form the helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033;, and terminate adjacent the distal tip <b>18</b>&#x2033;. The conductive wire <b>42</b>&#x2033; may be composed of platinum, gold, stainless steel, iridium, or alloys of these metals, or other biocompatible, conductive material. The polymer surface coating <b>44</b>&#x2033; may be composed of a thin coating of any suitable insulating material, for example, polyester, polyamides, polyimides, and blends of polyurethane and polyimides. The helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033; may be formed of a standard insulated wire having a metal wire enveloped by an insulating sheathing, rather than specially creating an electrode wire. A plurality of apertures is formed in the surface coating <b>44</b>&#x2033; to create a series of contoured openings <b>40</b>&#x2033; that each expose a small area of the conductive wire <b>42</b>&#x2033;. Each contoured opening <b>40</b>&#x2033; is preferably positioned circumferentially about the catheter <b>22</b> inline with each adjacent contoured opening <b>40</b>&#x2033;, thus forming a linear array parallel to the longitudinal direction of the catheter <b>22</b>&#x2033;. By alignment of the contoured openings <b>40</b>&#x2033; and by spacing each turn of the helical electrode wire <b>38</b>&#x2033; sufficiently close to adjacent turns at regular, narrow intervals, sufficient energy overlap should result to produce a linear lesion a in the target tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The purpose of the surface coating on the ring electrodes or along the helical electrode wire is primarily two-fold. First, uninsulated conductive bands or wire electrodes have been demonstrably shown to overheat cardiac tissue along certain points of the ablation electrode section. Such excessive heat can transform the tissue beyond mere necrosis and actually cause undesirable tissue destruction (e.g., charring and endothelial damage) that can compromise the integrity of the myocardium, e.g., through perforation or tamponade, or can lead to embolic events. Some theories suggest that an energized ring electrode or wire electrode exhibits a non-uniform power density that results in such &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; in certain areas on the ring electrode or along the length of the wire electrode. Another, more likely, rationale for formation of hot spots is related to thermodynamic effects exhibited at the interface of the electrodes and the catheter. While the power density in the electrodes remains uniform, heat dissipation in the active ablation area is not because the plastic catheter shaft material is a poor heat conductor and is unable to adequately dissipate the heat from the metal electrode. Thus, localized temperature variations may develop. By coating the metal electrode with an insulator, rather than transferring energy to the surrounding blood or adjacent tissue and thereby creating additional heat, the insulated electrode will act as a heat sink and counter the potential for the formation of hot spots at the edge of the exposed active ablation area. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> In order to increase the ability of the electrodes to act as a heat sink, the high dielectric surface coating may be applied in a very thin layer. For example, very thin coatings of polyester, polyamides, polyimides, and blends of polyurethane and polyimides, on the order of 2.5/10,000 inch to 1/1000 inch may be applied to the electrodes. By minimizing the thickness of the polymer surface coating, the thermal insulating effects of the dielectric polymer material is minimized. Thus, increased thermal transfer between the tissue and the insulated portion of the electrode can be achieved to mitigate the formation of hot spots along the edge areas interfacing with the catheter wall. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Second, the electrically insulating surface coating on each of the electrode rings is important to minimize the coagulation of blood in the surrounding cardiac cavity. Uninsulated electrodes create coagulum that often cakes about the conductive band or electrode wire, potentially impacting the efficacy of the ablation electrode section. Of even more concern is the possibility that a large body of coagulum could form on the catheter, break free in the bloodstream, and potentially cause an embolism or stroke. Because the contoured openings only expose a small area of the conductive bands or the electrode wire, the possibility of coagulum formation is minimized. Further, because the contoured openings are positioned and arranged to be in direct contact with the target tissue during the application of RF energy, the likelihood of coagulum formation is again decreased. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> The contoured openings may be formed by laser, chemical, or other common etching processes to remove a portion of the surface coating to expose the conductive material underneath. The edges or corners of any of the shapes of the contoured openings may be curved, rounded, or otherwise contoured in order to additionally minimize any edge effects that could arise due to the imposition of a sharp edge or point. The ring electrodes and the helical electrode wire may be between approximately 0.5 mm and 4 mm wide. The contoured openings may correspondingly have dimensions on the order of 25-80% of the width of the conductive bands and extend up to one-third the circumference of the conductive bands. </p>

The outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> with at least one hemostatic valve is seated within the dilated puncture wound while maintaining relative hemostasis. From there, the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> is advanced along the peripheral vein, into the inferior vena cava <b>76</b>, and into the right atrium <b>74</b>. A transeptal sheath may be further advanced through the outer guiding introducer <b>26</b> to create a hole in the interatrial septum between the right atrium <b>74</b> and the left atrium <b>84</b>. </p>

Thus, a lesion is formed in the tissue by the RF energy. In order to form a sufficient lesion, it is desirable to raise the temperature of the tissue to at least 50&#xb0; C. for an appropriate length of time (e.g., one minute). Thus, sufficient RF energy must be supplied to the electrode to produce this lesion-forming temperature in the adjacent tissue for the desired duration. </p>
