<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A specially shaped hole in an aiming device which enables the surgeon to perform an incision through the aiming device transverse hole in a plane that contains nail hole axis. Incision is therefore important to prevent undesirable side pull stress over the drill guide inserted through the aiming device transverse hole, which causes apparent problems in order to fit the drill through the hole in the nail. Thus, at least one screw for interlocking the nail with surrounding bone can accurately be installed. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The present invention relates to a specially shaped hole in an aiming device so that a cutting instrument can be inserted through it in order to perform an incision. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> To better understand the problem faced by the inventor and resolved by the invention, reference will first be made to the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</figref>, <b>1</b>C, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Locking nails <b>10</b> insertable into long bones are usually provided with transverse holes <b>11</b>. Screws can be inserted through the holes <b>11</b> for interlocking the nail <b>10</b> with the surrounding bone B. A special problem with locking nails <b>10</b> is one of assuring correct alignment of drill with the transverse hole <b>11</b> of the implanted nail <b>10</b>. Aiming devices <b>20</b> are often used for this purpose. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Currently available aiming devices transverse holes <b>26</b> do not enable the surgeon to insert a cutting instrument C through them in order to perform an incision I. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> As shown in the cross-sectional diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> since the cutting instrument C can not go through aiming device transverse hole <b>26</b> the surgeon must perform the incision I by the side of the aiming device <b>0</b> in a plane that does not contain aiming device transverse hole <b>26</b> axis. Thus, once the guiding sleeve <b>30</b> is inserted through the transverse hole <b>26</b> of the aiming device <b>20</b> and slides through soft tissues until the external surface of the bone B is reached, an undesirable side pulling stress <b>18</b> appears over such sleeves <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Since this pull <b>18</b> may move the guiding sleeve <b>30</b> from the correct position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), the hole drilled through the bone B through which the screw is inserted, may not be aligned co-axially with the nail hole <b>11</b>. If the guide hole <b>31</b> is not co-axial with the nail hole <b>11</b> axis, the anchoring screw will not perfectly fit through the hole <b>11</b> in the nail <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> The invention aims to overcome the problems discussed above. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The present invention has as one objective to enable the insertion of a scalpel through at least one of the transverse holes located in the aiming device while keeping the possibility to guide the drilling sleeve. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In one embodiment, a slot is combined with the existing aiming device transverse hole. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> According to another embodiment, at least one additional hole is combined with the existing aiming device transverse hole. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> According to a further embodiment of the present invention, an insert with a transverse hole is provided so that when fixed in the aiming device allows the drill guide to go through it. The insert when removed, enables the insertion of the scalpel through the aiming device. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The present invention also provides a method for performing an incision through the aiming device. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> there is shown an aiming device <b>20</b>, which is provided with two transverse holes <b>42</b>. A locking nail <b>10</b> is fixed to the aiming device <b>20</b> by means of a screw <b>22</b>. Locking nail <b>10</b> is provided with two transverse holes <b>11</b> for receiving appropriate fixation screws (not shown) for anchoring the locking nail <b>10</b> in place. This type of fixation operates to prevent the portions of the bone B on either side of the fracture site from moving relative to each other. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> the aiming device <b>20</b> is correctly positioned so that the aiming device transverse hole <b>42</b> is aligned with the nail hole <b>11</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> the aiming device <b>20</b> transverse hole <b>42</b> designed enables the surgeon to insert a cutting element C through the aiming device <b>20</b> in order to perform an incision I in a plane that contains nail hole <b>11</b> axis. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the drill guide <b>30</b> is inserted through the aiming device transverse hole <b>42</b> in precise alignment with the nail hole <b>11</b> axis. After the drill guide <b>30</b> is positioned, a drill (not shown) is inserted through the guide hole <b>31</b> so that a hole can be drilled in the bone B. Since the drill guide <b>30</b> is aligned with the nail hole <b>11</b> and there is no asymmetrical pull stress <b>18</b>, the drill (not shown) will fit through the hole <b>11</b> in the nail <b>10</b> and at least one screw (not shown) for anchoring the nail <b>10</b> with surrounding bone B can accurately be installed. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> As can be recognized from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> in the preferred embodiment, aiming device transverse hole <b>42</b> comprises a round hole <b>52</b> combined with a slot <b>54</b>. As it can be seen this hole shape allows a cutting instrument C to be inserted through the hole <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B and 4C</figref>) in order to perform an incision I. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> An alternate embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> in which adjacent additional round holes <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are included. In the aiming device, bores <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are located so closely to the central round bore <b>52</b>, that the wall of bores <b>62</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>64</b>, <b>52</b> intersect and are open in the adjoining region (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). Thus, a cutting instrument C can be inserted through the aiming device <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> According to a further embodiment of the invention (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), aiming device transverse hole <b>56</b> is placed in a removable insert <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). Once the insert <b>72</b> is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>), a larger hole <b>74</b> is left and allows a cutting instrument C to be inserted through the aiming device <b>20</b> so that an incision I can be made. </p>
