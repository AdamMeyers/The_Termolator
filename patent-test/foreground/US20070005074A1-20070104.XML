<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates to methods, instrumentation, and implants for orthopaedic surgery and, more specifically, to rotator cuff sparing procedures and associated devices for shoulder replacement surgery. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Discussion of Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Orthopaedic surgeons perform joint replacement surgery for patients who suffer pain and physical limitations caused by joint surfaces that have been damaged by degenerative, traumatic, or other pathologic processes. The functional outcome from these joint replacement surgeries is directly related to the degree of morbidity associated with the surgical method and the ability of the method to best restore the natural anatomy and biomechanics of the joint. Orthopaedic surgeons are continually searching for ways to improve outcomes for joint replacement surgery by developing methods of less invasive surgery to limit surgical morbidity and by developing novel methods and implants to better restore the native joint anatomy. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Conventional shoulder replacement surgery has several limitations. It requires an extensive exposure that irreversibly damages the rotator cuff and still fails to gain sufficient joint access to properly restore the native anatomic relationships of both the humeral head and glenoid surfaces. Also, there remain issues with glenoid implant fixation and early loosening. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Conventional methods utilize a large anterior deltopectoral exposure. The anterior humeral circumflex blood vessels are typically ligated and the anterior (subscapularis) musculotendinous unit is transected. The shoulder must then completely dislocated both anteriorly and posteriorly to prepare the humeral and glenoid joint surfaces. This can cause excessive traction on the arm which has resulted in injury to the nerves of the brachial plexus (Lynch N M, Cofield R H, Silbert P L, et al.. Neurologic complications after total shoulder arthroplasty. J Shoulder Elbow Surg 1996;5(1):53-61). </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> With regards to shoulder replacement surgery, all conventional methods require surgical transection of a rotator cuff tendon to gain sufficient exposure of the joint surfaces of the shoulder (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,450, entitled, &#x201c;Total Shoulder Prosthesis System&#x201d;, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). After the joint surfaces are replaced, the rotator cuff tendon must be surgically repaired with suture material. This tenuous repair necessitates an obligatory period of approximately six weeks for the rotator cuff tendon to heal before advanced shoulder rehabilitation can be performed. This surgical transection and subsequent repair, as well as the delay in rehabilitation, hold significant consequences for the functional outcome of the shoulder replacement including permanent weakness and decreased range of motion (Miller S L et al., &#x201c;Loss of subscapularis function after total shoulder replacement: A seldom recognized problem&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2003 January-February;12(1):29-34). </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Additionally, despite the extensive exposure, conventional methods for shoulder replacement surgery still fail to properly restore the native anatomic relationships of the joint surfaces of the shoulder. Conventional methods prepare the humeral surfaces of the shoulder joint by referencing off the intramedullary axis of the humeral shaft. This poses great difficulty for the surgeon since the intramedullary axis has an inconsistent relationship to the humeral surface. The humeral joint surface also possesses a complex anatomy with significant variability which cannot be entirely restored with conventional methods and implants. There exists much variability in the humeral head neck-shaft angle, posterior and medial offset, version (rotation), height, thickness, and radius of curvature. (Boileau P, Walch G, &#x201c;The Three-Dimensional Geometry of the Proximal humerus&#x201d;, J Bone Joint Surg Br 1997; 79B: 857-865; Iannotti J P, et al. &#x201c;The Normal Glenohumeral Relationships. An Anatomic Study of One Hundred and Forty Shoulders&#x201d;, J Bone Joint Surg 1992; 74A(4):491-500; McPherson E J, et al. &#x201c;Anthropometric Study of Normal Glenohumeral Relationships&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg 1997;6:105-112; Soslowsky L J, et al. &#x201c;Articular geometry of the glenohumeral joint&#x201d;, Clin Orthop 1992;285:181-190). The failure to restore the native anatomic relationships and biomechanics to the shoulder joint has proven to result in a significantly lesser functional and durable outcome (Williams G R, et al. &#x201c;The effect of articular malposition and shoulder arthroplasty on glenohumeral translations, range of motion, and subacromial impingement&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2001; 10(5):399-409). </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Conventional methods of shoulder replacement surgery also have difficulty gaining access to the glenoid joint surface. The glenoid surface of the shoulder joint is best prepared by working along an axis perpendicular to its surface. Because the humeral head sits in the way, this is a nearly impossible task with conventional methods. The humeral head has to be partially removed, the subscapularis (anterior shoulder rotator cuff muscle) transected, and the proximal humerus dislocated to even get close to working along this axis. Because of this difficulty, a majority of orthopaedic surgeons still choose not to replace the glenoid surface despite clinically proven results of improved pain relief and function for shoulder replacement surgery when both the humeral and glenoid surfaces are replaced. (Boyd A D, Thomas W H, Scott R D, et al. &#x201c;Total shoulder arthoplasty versus hemiarthroplasty&#x2014;indications for glenoid resurfacing&#x201d;, J of Arthroplasty 1990;5(4):329-336; Gartsman G M, Roddey T S, Hammerman S M. J Bone Joint Surg 2000;82A(1):26-34; Edwards T B, Kadakia N R, Boulahia A, et al., &#x201c;A comparison of hemiarthoplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty in the treatment of primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis: Results of a multicenter study&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2003; 12(3):207-13; Orfaly R M, Rockwood C A, Esenyel C Z, et al., &#x201c;A prospective functional outcome study of shoulder arthoplasty for osteoarthritis with an intact rotator cuff&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2003;12(3):214-21) </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Despite improved results of conventional methods when both the humerus and glenoid surfaces are replaced, there still remains limitations with regard to glenoid fixation and early glenoid implant loosening (Boileau P, Avidor C, Krishnan S G, et al., &#x201c;Cemented polyethylene versus uncemented metal-backed glenoid components in total shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective, double-blind, randomized study&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2002;11(4):351-9). Both, cemented polyethylene and metal backed glenoid components are used in conventional methods. The cemented implant never incorporates with the glenoid bone and with time, the cement-bone interface eventually fails and the implant comes loose. Conversely, the metal-backed glenoid prosthesis has an unacceptable rate of early loosening, at least 20% in one study. However, if the metal-backed implant can remain rigidly fixed to the bone for a sufficient period of time, the bone of the glenoid will eventually adhere to the metal-backed surface and long-term studies have revealed little evidence for late clinical loosening in these cases. Failure of the metal-backed glenoid implant appears to be related to the limitations in achieving sufficiently rigid and durable initial fixation </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> While performing shoulder replacement surgery for arthritis, associated rotator cuff tears are sometimes discovered and should be repaired when possible. If a less invasive surgical approach is employed to perform the shoulder replacement surgery, a less invasive method of rotator cuff repair that is compatible with the method shoulder replacement surgery must be to be available to simultaneously address these associated rotator cuff tears. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> One aspect of the present invention regards a method for shoulder replacement surgery. Utilizing the method of the present invention, a portal is created along a central axis of a neck of a proximal humerus that is associated with a shoulder of a patient. An implant is subsequently implanted into the shoulder of the patient, however a component of that implant is not passed through the portal. The rotator cuff is spared in the process. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> One advantage provided by the above mentioned aspect of the present invention is that it allows determination of a central axis in the proximal humerus which allows simple and less invasive perpendicular access to the humeral and glenoid joint surfaces. An additional advantage is it offers a simple and reliable means of restoring the native anatomy and biomechanical relationships, allowing for an improved functional and durable outcome. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> A further advantage is that it spares the rotator cuff tendons and allows for a quicker and more functional recovery </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Another aspect of the present invention regards a humeral implant with one component that is removably attached to a second component. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Another aspect of the present invention provides a glenoid implant. The glenoid implant includes an ingrowth shell, a wear-resistant surface that is removably attached to the ingrowth shell. An advantage is that the ingrowth shell provides novel geometry and superior fixation to the glenoid. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> An additional aspect of the invention regards a transhumeral portal sleeve with a bullet shaped guide that has a central and a peripheral longitudinal cannulation. An advantage is that it safely creates a working portal along the central axis of the proximal humerus. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transhumeral humeral reamer that has a working head and a removably attached transhumeral shaft with a diameter of from 0.1 to 5 cm. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Another aspect of the present invention regards a transhumeral glenoid reamer with a working head and a removably attached transhumeral shaft that has a diameter of from 0.1 to 5 cm. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In another aspect, a transhumeral protective sheath is provided that is a tube of material with a diameter of from 0.1 to 5 cm. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> The present invention relates to methods, instrumentation, and implants for performing rotator cuff sparing shoulder replacement surgery. Both, total shoulder arthroplasty, where both the humeral and glenoid joint surfaces are replaced, and shoulder hemiarthroplasty, where only the humeral joint surface is replaced, can be performed as indicated. The present invention utilizes among other things: a novel surgical exposure including an optional method of arthroscopic anterior contracture release, posterior capsular tightening, osteophyte resection, and glenoid soft-tissue clearance; two limited incisions, a transhumeral portal and a deep rotator cuff sparing exposure; novel transhumeral instrumentation with modular working components, protective guides, sleeves, sheaths, and retractors; conventional or novel implants, and an associated method of rotator cuff repair. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> Utilizing the method of the present invention, a portal is created along a central axis of a neck of a proximal humerus that is associated with a shoulder of a patient. This portal provides superior perpendicular access to both the humeral and glenoid joint surfaces in a less invasive manner to allow more anatomic replacement surgery to occur. The axis of the humeral head and the axis of the glenoid have a sufficiently consistent natural relationship such that simple positioning of the arm can allow a surgeon to easily align the central axis perpendicular to the humeral head with the axis perpendicular to the glenoid. Research has shown that there exists a natural relationship between the orientation of the humeral and glenoid surfaces (De Wilde, L F, et al., &#x201c;Glenohumeral Relationship in the Transverse Plane of the Body&#x201d;, J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2003;12(3):260-267). Therefore, I have determined that with consistent positioning of the arm, these axes will be co-linear. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> Accordingly, the present invention provides a reliable way of reestablishing the proper orientation of the humeral and glenoid joint surfaces without the associated surgical morbidity of conventional methods, i.e., a large exposure, dislocation of the humerus, or transection of the rotator cuff, as will be described below. Note that in the description to follow there will be mention made of transhumeral instruments. Such transhumeral instruments include transhumeral proximal humerus and glenoid reamers, drills, burrs, guides, protective guards, sheaths, sleeves, cementation tools, glenoid peg and keel punches, and glenoid implant insertor and impactor. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"> Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>9</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>b, </i><b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>b, </i><b>13</b><i>a, </i><b>13</b><i>e, </i><b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>b, </i><b>16</b>, <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>a</i>, and <b>26</b><i>a, </i>is a possible medical procedure according to the present invention. Preoperatively, two orthogonal radiographic images should be taken including a Grashey anteroposterior view with the patient's shoulder held in neutral rotation to slight external rotation and an axiliary lateral view. Next, two-dimensional transparencies with representations of different sizes of the humeral and glenoid implants/templates are placed over the x-rays to evaluate the patients bony anatomy and estimate the size of the implants to be used. From these radiographic images, preoperative measurements can be taken of the humeral head diameter and depth, the humeral neck angle, glenoid size and version, and the amount of scapular bone available to fix the implants to be used in the surgical procedure. A preoperative CT scan of the shoulder can also be useful when plain radiographs do not offer sufficient detail. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"> After interscalene regional block and general anesthesia are administered by the anesthesiologist, the patient <b>1</b> is positioned in a sitting position with a beach chair postioner <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Prior to prepping and draping the patient <b>1</b>, a fluoroscopic C-arm machine <b>7</b> is positioned accordingly to the patient <b>1</b> to obtain a Grashey anteroposterior radiographic view and a modified axiliary lateral view using rotation of the shoulder and slight repositioning of the fluoroscopic machine <b>7</b>. After the fluoroscopic views are confirmed, the fluoroscopic machine <b>7</b> is backed away from the patient <b>1</b> and the shoulder and upper extremity are prepped and draped in sterile fashion. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> Initially, an optional arthroscopic procedure may be performed using conventional arthroscopic tools to release the anterior capsular contractures, tighten the posterior capsule, resect osteophytes, and clear the glenoid soft-tissue for exposure. The procedure is begun by placing an arthroscope in the shoulder joint through a standard posterior portal and making an anterior rotator interval passage under needle localization. Standard diagnostic arthroscopy is performed and the posterosuperior, superior, and anterior labrum are excised or ablated; the biceps tendon may be released from the superior glenoid; and the anterior and anteroinferior ligamentous and capsular attachments are released from the glenoid. Then an accessory posterior passage is made under needle localization and an arthroscopic burr is inserted to remove the inferior humeral neck osteophytes. From the same accessory posterior passage, the posterior, posteroinferior and inferior labrum are excised or ablated and the posteroinferior and inferior ligamentous and capsular attachments to the glenoid are released from 7 O'clock anteriorly on a right shoulder or 5 O'clock anteriorly on a left shoulder. Gentle manipulation of the shoulder can also be performed if necessary to complete the soft-tissue release. Any posterior capsular redundancy can be addressed by techniques of capsular plication (tightening with arthroscopic sutures). </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> After the optional arthroscopic procedure is performed, an anterosuperior passage is formed to expose the glenohumeral joint. In particular, an anterosuperior incision is made either obliquely running over the anterolateral border of the acromion over the tip of the coracoid or longitudinally from just inferior to the clavicle running between the coracoid and the AC joint distally. Deep dissection is continued through the deltopectoral interval or a limited muscular split running in line with the deltoid muscle fibers. The clavipectoral fascia is incised, the coracoacromial ligament is released from the coracoid, and the subdeltoid and subacromial adhesions are released. Bony and soft-tissue subacromial decompression and distal clavicle excision should be performed if secondary conditions of impingement, rotator cuff tears, or acromioclavicular joint arthritis are present. The anterior circumflex blood vessels are ligated only as needed. The rotator interval is opened completely around both sides of the coracoid and distally into the biceps sheath. The supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles are bluntly released from the glenoid superior and anterior surfaces, respectively. A biceps tenodesis may be performed by simply sewing it to the tissue of the biceps sheath and excising the intraarticular portion of the tendon. At this point, a novel rotator interval retractor <b>5</b> with specialized supraspinatus <b>2</b> and subscapularis <b>4</b> blades is inserted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The blades connect to separate arms of a self-retaining device which allow it to hold open the interval between the supraspinatus and the subscapularis rotator cuff musculotendinous units. </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"> If necessary, a secondary rotator interval can be made by splitting the subscapularis in line with its fibers. </p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"> Note, that the anterosuperior passage described above and below can be performed without the aid of the previously described arthroscopic procedure. If the arthroscopic procedure is not performed, joint capsular contractures are released, posterior capsule is tightened (if needed), osteophytes are resected, and the soft-tissue surrounding the glenoid is excised as described above using open rather than arthroscopic instruments. </p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"> The surgical method next involves creating a transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The transhumeral portal <b>30</b> is a cylindrical-like tunnel that is parallel to the neck of the humerus from the anterolateral bony cortex of the proximal humerus through the center of the humeral head. Creation of the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> first involves obtaining an anteroposterior view of the proximal humerus via the fluoroscopic C-arm machine <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The shoulder is externally rotated between 20 and 40 degrees relative to the plane of the fluoroscope <b>7</b> to achieve a view perpendicular to the neck of the humerus. A free radioopaque guide pin is placed over the anterior shoulder along the axis of the humerus neck. By using fluoroscopy, a guide pin in that position defines a line to be used as a guideline that is marked/drawn along the anterior skin. A second small anterosuperior incision is made longitudinally, 1 centimeter lateral to the biceps tendon centered on the point of intersection with the drawn guideline marking the humeral neck axis. This second incision lies just inferolateral to the first. Via the second anterosuperior path, the deep deltoid muscle is split bluntly along its fibers to protect the motor branch of the axillary nerve and the transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> and protective sleeve <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) are inserted down to the anterolateral cortex of the humerus, approximately 1 cm lateral to the biceps groove. Using intraoperative fluoroscopy, a small guide pin <b>16</b> is inserted through the transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> and sleeve <b>15</b> from the anterolateral humeral cortex along the central axis of the humeral neck into the center of the articular surface of the humeral head (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). Anteroposterior and modified axillary lateral fluoroscopic images are taken to confirm proper positioning of the guide pin <b>16</b>. The guide pin <b>16</b> is repositioned as necessary until the pin runs centrally through the humeral neck and head on all fluoroscopic views. </p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"> Note, a specialized transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> may be used to help direct the guide pin <b>16</b> into the center of the humeral head <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). The transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> is a bullet shaped object with multiple longitudinal cannulations to direct guide <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. It fits into a protective sleeve <b>15</b> which has a handle <b>6</b> that is inserted into the second anterosuperior passage to the anterolateral cortex of the proximal humerus <b>20</b>. This sleeve <b>15</b> and guide <b>14</b> protect the surrounding soft-tissue and axillary nerve from harm. There is a radiolucent guide attachment <b>21</b> which rigidly connects to the handle <b>6</b> of the protective sleeve <b>15</b> of the transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b>. The radiolucent guide attachment <b>21</b> has a radiolucent arm <b>23</b> which runs parallel with the cannulations <b>10</b>,<b>12</b> in the transhumeral portal guide <b>14</b> and connects to a radiolucent tip <b>25</b> which can be any suitable shape, for example, hemispheric (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). Once the guide is assembled, the central cannulation <b>12</b> of the transhumeral portal guide <b>14</b> will direct a guide pin <b>16</b> to the center of the hemispheric tip <b>25</b>. The arm <b>23</b> of the guide attachment <b>21</b> is sufficiently long to allow significant adjustments in length to accommodate variations in size of the proximal humerus. After the tip <b>25</b> of the transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> is placed on the humeral surface through the first anterosuperior passage, the radiolucent arm <b>23</b> containing a radiopaque reference line can also be aligned with the central axis of the neck of the proximal humerus <b>20</b> under fluoroscopy to assist in directing the guide pin <b>16</b> to the center of the humeral <b>20</b> surface. </p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"> The guide pin <b>16</b> is advanced through the transhumeral drill guide <b>14</b> and protective sleeve <b>15</b> such that it travels toward the glenohumeral joint <b>9</b>, along the central axis of the neck of the humerus and perpendicular to the humeral <b>20</b> joint surface. The guide pin <b>16</b> is advanced such that the tip of the pin stops right at the humeral <b>20</b> joint surface. A second pin <b>18</b> of equal length is inserted through one of the peripheral holes <b>10</b> in the transhumeral portal drill guide <b>14</b> and sleeve <b>15</b> until it stops at the lateral humeral cortex. Measuring the difference in exposed length between the pins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> closely estimates the length of the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. This measurement assists the surgeon in creating and using the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> more safely as well as providing the size of the modular stem <b>98</b> used for the proximal humeral implant <b>94</b>. Then, the second guide pin <b>18</b> is advanced into the bone until it reaches the level of the anatomic neck <b>13</b> of the humerus. Measuring the difference in exposed length between the pins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> provides an accurate measurement of humeral head <b>20</b> depth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). Using the actual humeral depth measured by the difference between the pins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and that measured on the fluoroscopic screen, the actual humeral head diameter can be determined from measurements on the fluoroscopic screen. These measurements help in selecting the proper size transhumeral humeral reamers and final humeral implant later in the procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"> Based on the actual measured transhumeral portal <b>30</b> length, the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> is created by drilling with an approximately 1 centimeter diameter or less cannulated drill bit <b>26</b> through the transhumeral portal protective sleeve <b>15</b> over the first guide pin <b>16</b> from the anterolateral humeral cortex and into the joint (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The transhumeral portal <b>30</b> defines an opening of any suitable shape (such as circular, square, triangular, etc), having a diameter with a range of 0.1 to 5 cm, more preferably, a range of 0.1 to 1 cm, and most preferably, a range of 0.5 to 1.0 cm. The first guide pin <b>16</b> is removed along with the cannulated drill bit <b>26</b> and the second guide pin <b>18</b> may remain as a guide for later humeral head resection. </p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"> With the formation of the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, the humeral <b>20</b> and glenoid <b>22</b> surfaces can be prepared as explained hereafter. Note that the order of preparing either the humeral <b>20</b> or glenoid <b>22</b> surfaces may be altered depending on the proximal humeral <b>20</b> bone quality. If there are concerns about the quality of the proximal humeral <b>20</b> bone, the humeral <b>20</b> surface can be prepared last, after the glenoid <b>22</b>, to avoid weakening the proximal humeral bone <b>20</b> and jeopardizing the integrity of the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. Also, if hemiarthroplasty is indicated, the humeral <b>20</b> surface may solely be prepared and replaced. </p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"> Assuming that it is determined to prepare the humeral <b>20</b> surface first, the articular surface of the humeral head <b>20</b> may either be resected and replaced to the level of the-anatomic neck <b>13</b> for the insertion of a conventional proximal humeral implant, or merely resected and replaced to the level of the subchondral bone for the insertion of a novel proximal humeral implant <b>94</b>. To insert a conventional humeral implant in accordance with the present invention, a preliminary humeral head <b>20</b> cut can be made to improve visualization and expedite resection. From the anterosuperior passage previously formed, a long oscillating saw <b>28</b> is used to safely resect a limited portion of the humeral head <b>20</b> joint surface perpendicular to the portal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"> A transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> used during the procedure of the present invention is then threaded or press-fit into the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> through the second anterosuperior passage using the transhumeral portal drill guide protective sleeve <b>15</b> to safely direct it. It is inserted to the level of the anatomic neck <b>13</b> of the proximal humerus <b>20</b> in preparation for a conventional humeral implant or to the level of the humeral <b>20</b> joint surface for a novel humeral implant <b>94</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>). An embodiment of the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> of the present invention provides protection for the bone within which the transhumeral portal sits. The transhumeral sheath <b>38</b> is a tube of such shape, inner and outer diameter, and thickness such that it interfits securely within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> along the central axis of the neck of the humerus <b>20</b>, allows easy passage and use of all transhumeral instruments and sleeves while protecting the remaining bone of the proximal humerus <b>20</b> from harm. The transhumeral sheath <b>38</b> may be metal, plastic, or other semi-rigid, wear-resistant material and may be slid or threaded into the transhumeral portal. </p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"> Next, a transhumeral reamer shaft <b>34</b> is placed through the protective sheath <b>38</b> and assembled in the joint with the appropriately sized modular humeral reamer head <b>36</b> inserted through the anterosuperior passage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>). A novel transhumeral humeral reamer <b>32</b>, in one embodiment of the present invention, includes a reaming surface <b>36</b> and a transhumeral shaft <b>34</b>. The transhumeral reamer <b>32</b> is designed so that the shaft <b>34</b> interfits securely within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, and more specifically, within the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, such that there is no shaking or toggling while the reamer is being used. Therefore the diameter of the shaft <b>34</b> is from 0.1 to 5 cm and slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> through which it traverses. For a conventional humeral prosthesis, a flat reaming head surface <b>36</b> with sizes similar to the diameter of the humerus and surgical neck are used. The flat reamer removes bone of the humeral head down to the level of the anatomic neck <b>13</b> of the humerus. For a novel humeral implant <b>94</b>, a hemispherically shaped reaming surface <b>37</b>, sized similarly to a novel humeral surface <b>96</b> implant component is used, having similar depth and radius of curvature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>). The hemispherically shaped reaming surface <b>37</b> removes a minimal amount of bone. The amount of bone removed is roughly equivalent to the thickness of the humeral surface <b>96</b> component of the implant <b>94</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"> A protective guard <b>40</b> may be placed over the glenoid through the anterosuperior passage during reaming (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d</i>). The protective guard <b>40</b> is introduced through the first anterosuperior passage by a handle <b>44</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the guard <b>40</b> is shaped like the glenoid and is available in small, medium and large sizes. The guard is made of a solid metal surface with an elevated peripheral edge that fits over the glenoid surface. The guard has a thickness of about 0.1 to 2 mm. The handle <b>44</b> is removable and can be attached to the guard at different positions to allow it to be inserted from variable angles through the anterosuperior passage. </p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"> After the guard <b>40</b> is in place, the orthopaedic surgeon grasps the protective sheath <b>38</b> and pulls the running reamer <b>32</b> back onto the humeral head until it cuts to the level of the anatomic neck <b>13</b> for a conventional humeral implant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>). Live fluoroscopy may be used to assist with making the cut and insuring that the reamer stays parallel to the second guide pin <b>18</b> and stops before its tip. The bone debris from the cutting is removed with thorough irrigation from the anterosuperior passage. Any remaining humeral osteophytes may be removed with a small rongeur from the anterosuperior passage. </p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"> To insert a novel proximal humeral implant <b>94</b>, the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> and reamer shaft <b>34</b> are inserted as described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>). Alternatively, the appropriate size novel modular humeral reamer head <b>37</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage into the joint and assembled with the transhumeral shaft <b>34</b>. A protective guard <b>40</b> may be placed over the glenoid <b>22</b> through the anterosuperior passage during reaming. Again, the orthopaedic surgeon grasps the protective sheath <b>38</b> and pulls the running reamer <b>32</b> back onto the humeral head until the novel humeral reamer has removed just enough bone to restore the proper humeral head dimensions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>). Openings <b>39</b> in the reamer head can help the surgeon determine the proper amount reaming. Also, live fluoroscopy may be used to assist with making the cut and insuring that the reamer <b>32</b> stays parallel to the second guide pin <b>18</b> and stops at the appropriate level. The bone debris from the cutting is removed with thorough irrigation and suction from the anterosuperior passage. Any remaining humeral osteophytes may be removed with a small rongeur from the anterosuperior passage. </p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"> After the reamer <b>32</b> has prepared the humeral head, either for a conventional or a novel proximal humeral implant <b>94</b>, the glenoid <b>22</b> of the shoulder joint can then prepared for the placement of a conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>). Any remaining soft-tissue obstructing the glenoid surface <b>22</b> should be excised. The humerus is abducted, rotated, and laterally distracted to direct the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> such that its path lies perpendicular to and centered on the glenoid surface <b>22</b>. A glenoid sizing and centering hole guide <b>46</b> is placed from the anterosuperior passage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). In another embodiment of the present invention, a glenoid sizer and centering hole guide <b>46</b> includes a working surface <b>52</b> and a handle <b>53</b>. The guide <b>46</b> is shaped and sized according to the shape and size of the glenoid <b>22</b> to be prepared. The working surface <b>52</b> is inserted through the first anterosuperior passage by its handle <b>53</b>. The handle <b>53</b> is removable and can be attached to the working surface <b>52</b> at different positions <b>56</b> to allow it to be inserted from variable angles through the anterosuperior passage. The working surface <b>52</b> is approximately 0.1 to 10 mm thick and flat and has a central hole <b>54</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"> Utilizing the appropriately sized glenoid sizing and centering guide <b>46</b>, a transhumeral guide wire <b>50</b> is inserted into the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> through the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> to to drill a centering hole in the glenoid surface <b>22</b> regardless of whether a conventional or novel humeral implant is being inserted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). After the centering hole has been started, the guide wire <b>50</b> is backed up to allow the removal of the glenoid sizing and centering guide <b>46</b>. A cannulated flat or hemispherical humeral head guard <b>64</b>, followed by a cannulated glenoid surface cutting reamer head <b>60</b>, is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and the guidewire <b>50</b> is advanced through cannulations in both instruments back into the centering hole in the glenoid. </p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"> In another embodiment of the present invention, a humeral head surface protective guard <b>64</b> may be used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). This protective guard <b>64</b> includes a protective metal surface which is flat or hemispheric in shape corresponding to the prepared end of the proximal humerus for a conventional or novel humeral implant, respectively. The protective guard <b>64</b> is inserted via the first anterosuperior passage and fits over the humeral surface <b>20</b> and the shaft <b>62</b> of the transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>58</b>. The shaft <b>62</b> of the transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>58</b>, described below, passes through a central cannulation of the guard <b>64</b> to prepare the glenoid <b>22</b>. The humeral head surface protective guard <b>64</b> is sized according to need, such as small, medium, and large. The guard <b>64</b> is approximately 0.1 to 2.0 mm thick. Optionally, the guard <b>64</b> may be used with a handle. </p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"> The present invention also provides a transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The glenoid reamer <b>58</b> has a shaft <b>62</b> and a working head <b>60</b>. The shaft <b>62</b> is designed to interfit securely within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, and more specifically, within the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, such that there is no shaking or toggling of the shaft <b>62</b> within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> while the transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>58</b> is in use. Therefore, the outer diameter of the shaft <b>62</b> is approximately 0.1 to 5 cm, and slightly less than the inner diameter of the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> within which the shaft <b>62</b> is used. The working glenoid reamer heads <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> and shaft <b>62</b> are cannulated to fit over a central glenoid guide wire <b>50</b>. There is also a non-cannulated reamer head with a leading central peg which can fit into a central glenoid hole and allow some redirection of the reamer as necessary. </p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"> For a conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>), a nearly flat, slightly convex, reaming head surface <b>60</b> is used with sizes being similar to that of a glenoid. The radius of curvature of the reamer surface matches that of the non-articular side of the conventional glenoid implant. The flat reaming head <b>60</b> removes a minimal thickness of bone. The same flat reaming head <b>60</b> as used for a conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b> may also be used before inserting the multiple pegged glenoid implant <b>117</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"> For a novel glenoid implant <b>118</b>, the glenoid reamer head <b>61</b> includes a peripherally flat, less aggressive surface <b>116</b> and a centrally raised surface <b>114</b> which has a more aggressive reaming surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The centrally raised surface <b>114</b> may be a convex dome, a square, triangle, pyramid, or any other shape that matches the protruding surface of the novel glenoid implant <b>118</b> to be implanted within the glenoid, as described below. The peripheral glenoid reaming surface <b>116</b> removes a minimal amount of bone from the peripheral surface of the glenoid to just correct the version (orientation) of the glenoid surface. In one embodiment, the central reaming surface <b>114</b> removes a spherically shaped area of bone such that a central concave glenoid surface is created which fits an ingrowth shell component <b>120</b> of a novel glenoid implant <b>118</b> in accordance with the present invention. The concavity is slightly undersized to allow a pressfit of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"> To prepare the glenoid <b>22</b> for a conventional prosthesis <b>115</b>, the cannulated transhumeral glenoid reamer shaft <b>62</b> is positioned over the guidewire <b>50</b> and through the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> from the second anterosuperior passage. The transhumeral reamer shaft <b>62</b> is assembled in the shoulder joint with its glenoid surface cutting reamer head <b>60</b> and the reamer <b>58</b> is advanced along the guide wire <b>50</b> removing as little bone as possible to correct the profile of the worn glenoid <b>22</b> and create the proper radius of curvature on the surface to match that of the non-articular surface of the conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b>. The guide wire <b>50</b> must be inserted initially in the proper orientation to direct the cut appropriately. There is also an optional glenoid cutting surface head with a central peg that can be used without the guidewire <b>50</b> and can be inserted directly into the glenoid centering hole while the surgeon runs the transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a, b</i>). The bone debris from the cutting is removed with thorough irrigation from the anterosuperior passage. Any remaining glenoid osteophytes may be removed with a small rongeur from the anterosuperior passage. </p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"> The glenoid <b>22</b> can be prepared for implantation of either a conventional pegged or keeled glenoid implant <b>115</b>, a multiple peg glenoid implant <b>117</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>b</i>), or a novel glenoid implant <b>118</b>. In the case of implanting a conventional peg or keel glenoid implant <b>115</b>, the appropriately sized (according to the previously used glenoid sizer and centering hole guide), peg glenoid or keel guide <b>68</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and centered by placing its peg <b>72</b> into the previously created glenoid centering hole (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>). The transhumeral glenoid drill <b>66</b> is placed through the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> from the second anterosuperior passage. In one embodiment of the present invention, a glenoid keel drill guide <b>68</b> has a working surface <b>69</b> and a handle <b>70</b>. The working surface <b>69</b> is introduced via the first anterosuperior passage by its handle <b>70</b>. The handle <b>70</b> is removable and can be attached to the guide <b>68</b> at different positions to allow it to be inserted from variable angles through the anterosuperior passage.

The working surface <b>69</b> of the guide <b>68</b> has a central peg <b>72</b> that fits into a centering hole in the glenoid bone. The drill guide <b>68</b> for the conventional keel glenoid implant has two converging holes, one superior and one inferior, directed toward each other to direct a transhumeral glenoid drill <b>66</b> to cut a keel shape into the glenoid bone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"> The previously mentioned glenoid peg drill guide <b>68</b> has a working surface <b>69</b> and a handle <b>70</b>.

The working surface <b>69</b> of the guide <b>68</b> has a central peg <b>72</b> that fits into a centering hole in the glenoid bone. The working surface is approximately 0.1 to 5 mm thick and has peripheral holes in parallel configuration to drill holes with a transhumeral glenoid drill <b>66</b> for pegs in a glenoid. </p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"> In one embodiment, the above-mentioned transhumeral keel/peg glenoid drill <b>66</b> has a working surface <b>67</b> and a removably attached transhumeral shaft <b>65</b>. The working surface <b>67</b> is a drill bit (or tip) for drilling holes in the glenoid for keels or pegs of the conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b>. The drill bit <b>67</b> (or tip) is larger for drilling holes for a keel or a peg than a bit used for drilling holes for screws. </p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"> To further prepare the glenoid surface for a conventional glenoid implant, the humerus is positioned and translated such that the transhumeral keel/glenoid glenoid drill <b>66</b> is maintained perpendicular to the glenoid peg/keel guide surface <b>69</b>. With the gleonid drill introduced through the the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> of the transumeral portal <b>30</b> and the glenoid drill guide <b>68</b> postioned from the first anterosuperior passage, holes are drilled into the glenoid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). To prepare the glenoid to accept a keel glenoid implant, the transhumeral burr <b>74</b> is inserted into the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> through the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> and used to connect the drilled holes in the glenoid <b>22</b> surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). </p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134"> The humeral head and glenoid trial implants are inserted through the anterosuperior passage and the rotator interval retractor <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is temporarily removed. There are different humeral trial implants that can be used, one for the conventional implant and one for a novel implant. In either case, both can mate with trial modular stems through the transhumeral portal. If there is not sufficient bone available to stabilize the conventional humeral trial with a transhumeral trial stem or the humeral surface is too far offset from the intramedullary axis of the humeral shaft to accurately trial, the intramedullary canal of the humerus can be prepared and fitted with a conventional intramedullary stem trial using conventional techniques and instruments from the anterosuperior passage. Because the rotator cuff has not been transected, it is much simpler to determine the proper size implant required to restore the normal musculotendinous length and tension in the rotator cuff and thus, more accurately restore the native anatomical dimensions of the joint. Fluoroscopy can also be used to judge proper implant size. </p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"> Next, the glenoid <b>22</b> is prepared to affix its conventional implant <b>115</b> using transhumeral cementation tools <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>). A transhumeral irrigation and suction catheter is inserted into the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> through the novel transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> and used to irrigate and suck the prepared glenoid <b>22</b> holes dry. A transhumeral irrigation and suction catheter is used in yet another embodiment of the present invention. The irrigation and suction catheter includes semi-rigid tubing that is inserted through the second anterosuperior passage and the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> in the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> in order to irrigate or suction the prepared glenoid surface. The catheter attaches to both, a fluid pump and suction tubing, and may be easily switched between the two with a stopcock-like device. </p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"> The peg or keel holes are temporarily packed with thrombin soaked gel pads or epinephrine soaked gauze using a novel transhumeral forceps device. The transhumeral irrigation and suction catheter is used again to clean and dry the holes and a transhumeral cementation catheter <b>84</b> is inserted through the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> and protective sheath <b>38</b> to place the cement. </p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"> Note that the above-described transhumeral cementation tool <b>80</b> includes a keel glenoid or peg glenoid cement pressurizer head <b>86</b> and a cementation catheter <b>84</b>. The transhumeral cementation catheter <b>84</b> includes semi-rigid tubing which connects to a conventional cement gun <b>104</b> to deliver cement to the site of implant fixation to bone. The head <b>86</b> includes a keel glenoid or peg glenoid cement pressurizer tip <b>82</b> that is cannulated and fits into a respective keel or peg-shaped prepared hole in the glenoid surface to dispense cementation material under pressure into that hole in the glenoid surface <b>22</b>. The pressurizer heads <b>86</b> are shaped similar to a glenoid implant with a smaller keel or single peg. The radius of curvature of the periphery of the tip <b>82</b> matches that of the reamed bony glenoid surface <b>22</b> to help seal the hole during cement insertion. These heads <b>86</b> are inserted through the first anterosuperior passage by their handles <b>88</b> and are attached to the transhumeral cementation catheter <b>84</b> within the glenohumeral joint <b>9</b> to pressurize the cement in the glenoid <b>22</b> holes. The handle <b>88</b> is removable and can be attached to the head <b>86</b> at different positions to allow it to be inserted from variable angles through the anterosuperior passage. The cementation head <b>86</b> limits the escape of cementation material from the hole and allows pressure to build up which forces the cement deep into the interstices of the trabecular bone to allow improved fixation. A cement pressurizer tip <b>82</b> may be inserted into the joint through the anterosuperior passage and assembled with the transhumeral cementation catheter <b>84</b>. There are different pressurizer tips <b>82</b> to match either the pegged or keeled glenoid. The conventional glenoid implant <b>115</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage, is seated and held in place until the cement dries with a modular transhumeral glenoid impactor <b>90</b>. Excess cement is removed and the joint is irrigated </p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"> The transhumeral glenoid impactor <b>90</b> includes a transhumeral shaft <b>92</b> which removably attaches to a working head <b>91</b>. The working head <b>91</b> has a convex surface that approximates the radius of curvature of the articular surface of the glenoid implant. The shaft <b>92</b> is introduced through transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The working head <b>91</b> is introduced through the first anterosuperior passage and mated with the transhumeral shaft <b>92</b>. Force can then be applied to the handle <b>89</b> of the impactor <b>90</b> to seat the glenoid implant <b>115</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a multiple peg glenoid implant <b>117</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) or a novel modular ingrowth glenoid implant <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) can also be inserted. </p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"> After the glenoid surface <b>22</b> has been reamed by a glenoid reamer <b>58</b> as described previously, the multiple glenoid pegs <b>117</b> can be introduced with a novel multiple peg guide <b>72</b> through the anterosuperior passage and inserted into the prepared surface of the glenoid <b>22</b> using a transhumeral insertor device <b>79</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>a</i>). In another embodiment, a multiple peg glenoid insertor <b>79</b> and insertor guide <b>72</b> are used. The multiple peg glenoid insertor guide <b>72</b> includes a handle <b>73</b> and a guiding surface <b>71</b>. The guiding surface <b>71</b> is sized and shaped as the glenoid peg drill guide surface <b>69</b> discussed above. The guide <b>72</b> is introduced via the first anterosuperior passage and holds multiple pegs <b>117</b> to be inserted into the glenoid <b>22</b>. The guiding surface <b>71</b> of the guide <b>72</b> controls the depth and location of insertion of the multiple pegs <b>117</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"> The multiple peg glenoid insertor <b>79</b> is inserted via the second anterosuperior passage and through the transhumeral protective sheath <b>38</b> in the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. It is used to engage the pegs <b>117</b> located within the multiple peg insertor guide working surface <b>71</b> and then drives them into the glenoid <b>22</b> one at a time. The insertor <b>79</b> stops when it hits the guide surface <b>71</b> to control the depth of peg <b>117</b> insertion. Drilling pilot holes through a separate guide with a special transhumeral drill can precede this step. The guide surface <b>71</b>, preloaded with the implant pegs <b>117</b> controls the position, direction and depth of peg <b>117</b> insertion. The guide surface <b>71</b> has a protruding centering peg which fits into the centering hole of the glenoid to help center and position the guide surface <b>71</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"> After the multiple peg prosthesis is implanted, trialing of a conventional or novel humeral implant can be performed as described previously. </p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"> Alternatively, a novel ingrowth glenoid implant <b>118</b> can be implanted after reaming the glenoid with a novel transhumeral glenoid reamer <b>57</b> as described previously. The novel modular ingrowth glenoid implant <b>118</b> has an ingrowth shell <b>120</b> and modular wear-resistant articulating surface <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) </p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"> The ingrowth shell <b>120</b> of the glenoid implant <b>118</b> is a cannulated shallow shell with a protruding surface <b>119</b> that sits within the concavity of the reamed glenoid surface. The protruding surface is surrounded by a flat outer surface <b>121</b> (or brim). The protruding surface <b>119</b> may be any shape such as a square, pyramidal, hemispheric, triangular or any other suitable shape. The protruding surface <b>119</b> protrudes into the glenoid <b>22</b> to a specified depth. The depth is such that it is enough for the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> to be securely seated within the glenoid <b>22</b> and for the wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> to fit therein (as described below) and yet not so deep that a large amount of subchondral bone must be reamed from the glenoid <b>22</b>. Preferably, the shape of the previously described novel glenoid reamer <b>57</b> is the same as the shape of the protruding surface <b>119</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> such that there will be a secure fit when the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is seated within the glenoid <b>22</b>. As the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is pressed into the glenoid, the flat surface (or annular brim) <b>121</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> also makes contact with the peripheral glenoid surface <b>22</b>, and in fact, provides a stopping point of insertion. The ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is made of suitable material, examples of which include, but are not limited to metal, tantalum, porous metal, trabecular metal, ceramic materials, and titanium. The protruding surface <b>119</b> and the annular brim <b>121</b> of the shell <b>120</b> may also maintain a surface of a bony ingrowth material, as described in connection with the humeral implant below. This ingrowth material promotes bone growth and adhesion of the shell to the glenoid surface. The ingrowth shell <b>120</b> has a thickness of 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 2 mm. The ingrowth shell <b>120</b> has holes for fixation. These holes may be central <b>124</b> and peripheral <b>126</b> and may further be smooth, threaded or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, a shell has a central hole <b>124</b> and multiple peripheral holes <b>126</b>, for example three peripheral holes <b>126</b>. The central hole <b>124</b> is preferably smooth and the peripheral holes <b>126</b> are preferably threaded. </p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"> After reaming, the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and impacted into the concavity (which matches the shape of the reamer head <b>61</b> and that of the protruding surface <b>119</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> to be implanted) of the reamed glenoid with a transhumeral impacting device <b>90</b>. The concavity is slightly undersized to attain a tight fit upon impaction. The ingrowth glenoid shell <b>120</b> is then fixed to the glenoid <b>22</b> using screws <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>. In one embodiment, a central compression screw <b>133</b> is first used to compress the ingrowth shell into the concavity created in the glenoid and affix the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> to the glenoid and then fixed angle peripheral screws <b>135</b> are used to lock the ingrowth shell into place (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). </p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"> The transhumeral glenoid drill <b>49</b> is used along with a transhumeral glenoid drill sleeve <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>) to make the holes for the glenoid screws <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>. The transhumeral glenoid drill sleeve <b>48</b> fits into a transhumeral glenoid screw sleeve <b>128</b> which fits into the protective transhumeral sheath <b>38</b> in the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The drill sleeve <b>48</b> mates with the holes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> in the ingrowth shell component <b>120</b> of the novel glenoid implant <b>118</b> to direct the drill <b>49</b> in the proper orientation. The shaft of the transhumeral glenoid drill <b>49</b> just fits within the inner diameter of the transhumeral glenoid drill sleeve <b>48</b> and has visible markings on it that allow one to measure the depth of the hole off the distant edge of the transhumeral drill sleeve <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The drill <b>49</b> is advanced until the far cortex of the glenoid and scapula is reached. At which point, the surgeon reads the mark on the drill at the level of the glenoid drill guide sleeve <b>48</b>. Approximately 5 mm is added to the screw length to determine the length of screw used. The drill <b>49</b> is then advanced through the far cortex to complete the screw hole in the glenoid <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"> In one embodiment of the present invention, a novel transhumeral screw driver <b>130</b> and transhumeral glenoid screw guide sleeve <b>128</b> are used to place the above described screws <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>. After drilling, the surgeon removes the inner transhumeral glenoid drill guide sleeve <b>48</b> and the transhumeral screwdriver <b>130</b> is inserted through the previously positioned transhumeral glenoid screw guide sleeve <b>48</b>. The screw driver shaft <b>130</b> fits snuggly within a transhumeral glenoid screwdriver guide sleeve <b>128</b>. The screwdriver <b>130</b> is then advanced to place a screw <b>133</b>, <b>135</b> through a hole <b>124</b> or <b>126</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> of a novel glenoid implant <b>118</b> into the drilled glenoid bone <b>22</b>. As briefly described above, a central screw <b>133</b> is first inserted through a central smooth hole <b>124</b> in the glenoid shell <b>120</b> to initially compress the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> firmly into the glenoid surface <b>22</b>. The glenoid ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is then locked into place by at least one peripheral screw <b>135</b>, preferably three (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). For example, if three peripheral screws <b>135</b> are utilized, one is placed anterosuperiorly, one is placed posterosuperiorly, and one is placed inferiorly. The threads of the screws <b>135</b> engage the threading of the peripheral holes <b>126</b> in the glenoid ingrowth shell <b>120</b> as well as the drilled outer cortical surface of the glenoid <b>22</b> and scapula. The peripheral holes <b>126</b> of the shell <b>120</b> direct the screws <b>135</b> into a fixed divergent pattern. </p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"> After the glenoid ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is well fixed, the modular wear-resistant glenoid surface <b>122</b> is inserted though the anterosuperior passage and impacted into the shell <b>120</b> with a transhumeral glenoid impactor <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>) as described previously. </p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"> The wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> of the glenoid implant <b>118</b> has a convex surface which mates with the concave side of the protruding surface <b>119</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> and forms the articulating surface of the glenoid implant <b>118</b>. The protruding surface <b>119</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b> is of thin dimension such that it simultaneously provides 1) fixation to the glenoid bone; 2) an ingrowth surface; 3) provides a support surface for the wear-resistant surface <b>122</b>; and 4) a recessed coupling device which maximizes the thickness of the wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> for durability and while still maintaining proper anatomic glenohumeral surface relationships. The wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> may include, but is not limited to polyethylene, plastic, ceramic material, metals, and magnetic materials. At a-minimum, the wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> has a thickness of 0.1 to 15 mm, preferably 4 to 7 mm, if composed of currently available forms of polyethylene, protruding above the glenoid bony surface and flat outer surface (or annular brim) <b>121</b> of the ingrowth shell <b>120</b>. It may have variable thickness along its dimension to correct version of glenoid. The wear-resistant surface <b>122</b> of the glenoid implant <b>118</b>, which is approximately pear shaped, has both a superior-inferior dimension and an anterior-posterior dimension. The superior-inferior axis has a suitable range of from about 20 to 60 mm, preferably from about 30 to 48 mm. The anterior-posterior axis defines an upper half and a lower half. The lower half anterior-posterior axis has a range of about 15 to 50 mm, preferably from about 21 to 35 mm. The upper half has a range of from about 10 to 50, preferably 18 to 33 mm. The ratio of the upper half to the lower half is approximately 0.8 to 1.0. The ratio of the lower half of the anterior-posterior axis to the superior-inferior axis is approximately 0.7 to 1.0, whereas the ratio of the upper half of the anterior-posterior axis to the superior-inferior axis is approximately 0.6 to 1.0. In addition, the radius of curvature of the superior-inferior axis of the glenoid surface is greater than the coronal radius of curvature of the humeral surface of the humeral implant with which the glenoid implant articulates. The anterior-posterior radius of curvature of the glenoid surface is larger than the axial radius of curvature of the humeral surface. It may have variable thickness along its dimension to correct version of glenoid. </p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"> To prepare the humerus for a conventional humeral implant, the humerus is adducted and extended to line up the axis of the intramedullary canal with the first anterosuperior passage. With the self-retaining rotator interval retractor <b>5</b> in place, the humeral canal is prepared using conventional instruments, trials are used to determine the proper fit and size of the implants, and the proper conventional humeral implant with an intramedullary stem is either cemented or press-fit into the proximal humerus <b>20</b> in accordance with the present. </p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151"> For the novel humeral implant <b>94</b>, the humerus does not require special positioning. After humeral trialing, the novel humeral stem <b>98</b> is placed in the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> from either the first or second anterosuperior passages and the novel modular head <b>96</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage. The two components <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are then mated together. </p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"> The novel humeral implant <b>94</b> in accordance with the present invention is modular and includes a humeral surface <b>96</b> component, a roughly hemispheric shaped surface with a short central mating device <b>100</b>, and a transhumeral stem <b>98</b> which fills the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). Alternatively, a novel humeral surface implant that includes only a humeral surface <b>96</b>, with no stem <b>98</b> may be used when warranted. Preferably, however, a novel humeral implant <b>94</b> with two components <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> is used. The two components, the humeral surface <b>96</b> and stem <b>98</b>, are removably attached to one another. The humeral surface <b>96</b> has a coronal radius of curvature and an axial radius of curvature. The humeral surface can be spherical in shape. Preferably the humeral surface can be more anatomic being spherical, with equal coronal and axial radii of curvature, in the center and elliptical, with larger coronal than axial radii of curvature, at the periphery. A suitable range for the coronal radius of curvature is from 10 to 50 mm, preferably from 19 to 28 mm, with approximately 81% of all men having a coronal radius of curvature ranging from 23-28 mm, and 79% of all women having coronal radius of curvature ranging from 19-22 mm. A suitable range for the axial radius of curvature of the humeral surface of the implant is from 10 to 50 mm, preferably from 18 to 26 mm. The humeral surface <b>96</b> of the implant <b>94</b> also has a depth and thickness. A suitable range for the depth of the humeral implant <b>94</b> is from 5 to 40 mm, preferably from 15 to 24 mm, and the depth is the same in both the coronal and axial planes. The humeral surface <b>96</b> thickness has a range of from 0.1 to 5 mm, preferably from 1 to 3 mm. The ratio of the depth to the coronal radius of curvature is approximately 0.7 to 0.9.

<p id="p-0154" num="0153"> The humeral surface <b>96</b> of the humeral implant <b>94</b> may be spherically shaped or more of an elliptical shape which better approximates the anatomy of a natural humeral head. The humeral surface <b>96</b> may be made of a variety of materials including, but not limited to cobalt-chrome alloys, ceramic materials, metals, and magnetic materials. It is contemplated that the humeral surface may also have fins, spikes, or other protuberances on its concave, non-articular surface to enhance rotational stability. Additionally, the concave, non-articular surface may also contain a bony ingrowth material. A bony ingrowth material allows the bone to which the implant is attached to grow into the implant and aids in attaining long-lasting fixation of the implant. These ingrowth materials, include, but are not limited to autologous and allograft osteoprogenitor cells and tissues, bone-morphogenic proteins, hydroxyapaptite coating, trabecular metal, porous metal, porous metal coating, and tantalum. It is contemplated that the surface of the humeral surface component <b>96</b> of the implant <b>94</b> that articulates with the glenoid or the glenoid implant, is smooth with a low coefficient of friction. </p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"> The stem <b>98</b> of the modular humeral implant <b>94</b> is sized to fit within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> located along the central axis of the neck of the humerus. By fitting, it is meant that the stem <b>98</b> fits in a tight manner and is stable in that location. As it is contemplated that the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> has a diameter of from 0.1 to 5 cm, the diameter of the stem <b>98</b> is also from 0.1 to 5 cm, and is dimensioned to fit within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The stem <b>98</b> may be composed of any suitable materials including, but not limited to titanium, stainless steel, cobalt-chrome alloy. The stem <b>98</b> may be smooth, textured, or threaded. Smooth glass bead blast finishes are another possibility. Threads may be uniform or may vary in width along the length of the stem. Further, the shape of the stem <b>98</b> is intended to accommodate the shape of the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, therefore it may be round, square, triangular, or any other geometric shape that may comprise the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The main body of the stem <b>98</b> has a consistent cross-sectional shape and size along its straight longitudinal axis. Therefore, unlike conventional humeral implant stems, which are tapered and bowed to fit within the dimensions of the metaphysis and diaphysis of the humerus, the stem <b>98</b> of the present invention maintains a uniform diameter and is linear from end to end. As such, the stem is dimensioned to sit within the epiphyseal and metaphyseal portions of the humerus. As described for the humeral surface <b>96</b>, the stem <b>98</b> may also contain fins or spikes to aid rotational stability, and it may also possess a bony ingrowth material surface, as describe above. </p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"> The stem <b>98</b> may be of varying lengths, a suitable range of which is from about 4 to 7 cm. The preferred length is dimensioned to extend from the lateral cortex of the humerus to the center of a humeral head. It is intended that this stem <b>98</b> be introduced into the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> via the second anterosuperior incision and advanced through the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> to a position that is suitable for mating with the humeral surface <b>96</b> which is inserted via the anterosuperior incision, described above. If appropriate, the stem <b>98</b> may also be inserted from the articular surface of the proximal humerus through the first anterosuperior passage. </p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"> The humeral surface <b>96</b> and stem <b>98</b> of the humeral implant <b>94</b> connect to one another via a mating site <b>100</b>. The humeral surface <b>96</b> and stem <b>98</b> are joined within the glenohumeral joint space. They may be press fit, screwed together, or joined by morse taper, as well as any other suitable locking mechanism. It is possible for the male or female counterpart to be on either the stem <b>98</b> or the humeral surface <b>96</b>, so long as one male counterpart and one female counterpart are present in the humeral implant <b>94</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"> The humeral surface <b>96</b> component is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and mated with its stem <b>98</b> placed through the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>. The humeral surface <b>96</b> and modular stem <b>98</b> implant can be cemented or press-fit to the prepared humeral surface and there are many possible variations of the implant <b>94</b>. Examples A, B, and C are various embodiments of a humeral implant <b>94</b> in accordance with the present invention. Example A includes a hemisphere shaped humeral surface <b>96</b> and a threaded transhumeral stem <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). The humeral surface <b>96</b> component is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and is either cemented or press-fit onto the humeral surface <b>20</b> and then impacted on the prepared humeral surface against the glenoid <b>22</b>. The hemisphere shaped surface <b>96</b> is rotationally stabilized with a rod inserted into a hole at a peripheral edge of the hemisphere shaped surface <b>96</b> while the threaded humeral stem <b>98</b> is advanced through the protective sleeve <b>15</b> from the transhumeral portal guide <b>14</b> and up the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> to engage with the non-articular side of the hemisphere shaped humeral surface <b>96</b>. The threaded stem <b>98</b> has a double pitch with finer pitched but deeper cancellous threads that engage and fill the transhumeral portal <b>30</b> and slightly wider pitched more shallow threads on the narrower diameter tip which engages the humeral surface <b>96</b> component so as to secure the humeral surface <b>96</b> component. Should it be necessary, removal of the example A implant <b>94</b> is conducted by recreating both anterosuperior passages, inserting a driver for the threaded stem <b>98</b> through the second anterosuperior passage, inserting a stabilizing rod into a peripheral edge of the humeral surface <b>96</b> component from the first anterosuperior passage and backing out the stem through the protective sleeve <b>15</b> from the transhumeral portal guide <b>14</b>. The humeral surface <b>96</b> component is then removed by sawing across the base of the humeral surface <b>96</b> component at the anatomic neck of the humerus with a power or Gigli saw. </p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"> Example B includes a similar humeral surface <b>96</b> component and a cemented transhumeral stem <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). Again, the humeral surface component <b>96</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage, is either cemented or press-fit onto the prepared humeral surface <b>20</b> and impacted on the prepared humeral surface <b>20</b> against the glenoid <b>22</b>. Another transhumeral stem <b>98</b> which possesses the male end of a morse taper is inserted into the female end on the non-articular side of the humeral surface component <b>96</b> and impacted against the glenoid. This stem <b>98</b> may be press-fit or cemented to the bony transhumeral portal. An endcap <b>106</b> is threaded into the non-articular side of the stem <b>98</b> to assist with later removal of the humeral surface implant <b>94</b>. To fix with cement, a cementation catheter <b>84</b> is assembled to an opening in the endcap <b>106</b> and cement is injected through the cannulated transhumeral stem <b>98</b> exiting holes <b>99</b> at its articular end. The cement is injected until it becomes visible around the non-articular end of the stem <b>98</b>. Should it be necessary, removal of the example B implant is conducted by recreating the anterosuperior passages, removing the endcap with a T-handled wrench, threading the removal shaft <b>111</b> into the stem <b>98</b>, drilling out the cement-implant interface with a coring reamer <b>110</b> over the stem <b>98</b>, and disimpacting the stem <b>98</b> from the humeral surface component <b>96</b> with a disimpaction sleeve <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The humeral surface component <b>96</b> is removed by sawing across the base of the humeral surface component <b>96</b> at the anatomic neck of the humerus with a power or Gigli saw. </p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"> Example C includes a similar humeral surface <b>96</b> component and an inflatable transhumeral stem <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>) similar to technology used in the FIXION&#x2122; IM Nail (See &#x201c;A New Expandable Implant for the Repair of Long Bone Fractures&#x201d;, Sinha, Anjoy M. D. et al, published in www.Healthfocus.com). Again, the humeral surface component <b>96</b> is inserted through the anterosuperior passage and either cemented or press-fit, and further impacted on the prepared humeral surface <b>20</b> against the glenoid <b>22</b>. Another transhumeral stem <b>98</b> which possesses the male end of a morse taper is inserted into the female end on the non-articular side of the humeral surface <b>96</b> component and impacted against the glenoid <b>22</b>. The inflatable stem <b>98</b> is an expandable tube that is reinforced with longitudinal bars and has a one-way valve system on the end that doesn't mate with the humeral surface component. Once positioned, the stem <b>98</b> is inflated or expanded from its collapsed position with a specialized saline pump to fill the stem <b>98</b>, within the transhumeral portal <b>30</b>, and gain purchase. The stem <b>98</b> can be removed by deflating it with the same pump and disimpacting the stem <b>98</b> from the humeral surface <b>96</b> component with a disimpaction sleeve <b>112</b>. The humeral surface component <b>96</b> is removed by sawing across the base of the humeral surface <b>96</b> component at the anatomic neck of the humerus with a power or Gigli saw. </p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"> After the prosthetic implants, either humeral or glenoid, novel or conventional, are inserted as described above, the soft-tissue tension is evaluated, and the wounds are copiously irrigated, the deep passages, subcutaneous tissue, and skin are closed with sutures. </p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"> In yet another embodiment, the present invention is a glenohumeral joint with a transhumeral portal <b>30</b> along the central axis of the neck of the humerus and at least one implant. The implant may be a humeral implant <b>94</b>, a glenoid implant <b>118</b> or both. The implants may be conventional implant or novel <b>94</b>, <b>118</b> described herein. </p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"> In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of repairing a rotator cuff, tear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-33</figref>. This procedure may be utilized in conjunction with the above described method of shoulder replacement or it may be used as a stand-alone procedure. In this method standard positioning-and techniques for arthroscopic or open rotator cuff exposure are employed. If performed in conjunction with the previously described methods of shoulder replacement surgery, the anterosuperior passages may be used. If performed in isolation, an open deltoid split or arthroscopic subacromial exposure used for rotator cuff repair is performed in standard fashion. A small longitudinal stab is made through the skin and superficial deltoid fascia approximately 5-12 cm below the level of the anterolateral edge of the acromion. </p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"> In one embodiment of the rotator cuff repair method, an insertional guide <b>134</b> is inserted with a protective inner sheath <b>137</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The insertional guide <b>134</b> includes a cannulated handle <b>141</b> and a cannulated tip <b>148</b>. The cannulated tip <b>148</b> is an elongated rigid tube with a sharp trocar tip <b>150</b>. The diameter of the rigid tube and trocar tip <b>150</b> is slightly larger than that of the suture pin, <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) described below, and is approximately 1.0 to 5.0 mm. An inner protective sheath <b>137</b> may be used with the insertional guide <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref><i>b</i>). The inner protective sheath <b>137</b> screws into the handle <b>141</b> of the insertional guide <b>134</b>. The inner protective sheath <b>137</b> has a handle <b>138</b> that acts as a stop and prevents the inner protective sheath <b>137</b> from extending further into the insertional guide <b>134</b> than the level of the protective sheath handle <b>138</b>. The inner sheath <b>137</b> has a blunt end <b>139</b> that extends beyond the level of the sharp trocar <b>150</b> of the insertional guide <b>134</b>, providing a non-sharp surface with which to enter the tissue. When the surgeon is prepared to use the sharp trocar tip <b>150</b> of the insertional guide <b>134</b>, the inner protective sheath <b>137</b> is removed by unscrewing the handle <b>138</b> and sliding it out of the insertional guide <b>134</b>. Optionally, an outer protective sheath may be used that extends over the tip of the insertional guide <b>134</b> and provides a blunt end as well. In this embodiment, the outer protective sheath has a longitudinal split so that it may be peeled off of the insertional guide when the surgeon is ready to use the sharp trocar tip <b>150</b> of the insertional guide <b>134</b>. The bore tip <b>150</b> is extended into the lateral humeral <b>20</b> cortex under direct or arthroscopic visualization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>). An arthroscopic retractor <b>136</b> may assist the process. Directed by an insertional guide <b>134</b>, a suture-pin <b>140</b> is advanced by a drill through the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus to exit into an anteromedial supraspinatus rotator cuff footprint. The next step is to reduce the torn edge of the supraspinatus tendon with a soft tissue grasper <b>138</b>. The suture-pin <b>140</b> is advanced through the cuff (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) and out through the superior soft-tissue and skin using a pin director <b>142</b> as needed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). The suture-pins <b>141</b> may pass through the acromion or deltoid as necessary. The drill is switched to a suture-pin leading tip and the pin component <b>140</b> is removed from the body. The pin <b>140</b> is cut from the suture <b>144</b>. The above steps may be repeated as often as necessary to provide sufficient sutures <b>144</b> to secure the torn rotator cuff. For the arthroscopic technique, a tying cannula <b>146</b> is then inserted. The sutures <b>144</b> are retrieved and passed in modified Mason-Allen fashion if desired, using free needles (open technique) or an arthroscopic suture passing device. The sutures <b>144</b> are tied and the tying steps are repeated. The repair may be reinforced with lateral suture anchors as needed before or after tying the transosseous sutures <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"> The suture-pin device <b>141</b> comprises two components, a leading flexible pin <b>140</b> and a swedged on suture <b>144</b>. The suture <b>144</b> is preferably a durable size #2 suture <b>144</b>. The pin <b>140</b> has a sharp slightly larger diameter trocar tip <b>154</b> on its leading end. The remaining pin <b>140</b> has a diameter closer to that of the suture <b>144</b>. The pin <b>140</b> is sufficiently long to enter the anterolateral surface of the shoulder, pass through the proximal humerus, rotator cuff, and exit the superior surface of the shoulder with both its leading and trailing ends are exposed. The suture <b>144</b> is of similar length. </p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"> It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of this invention. </p>
