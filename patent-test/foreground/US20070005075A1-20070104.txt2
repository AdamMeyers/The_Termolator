CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION 
 This disclosure claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/691,859, filed Jun. 17, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.


TECHNICAL FIELD 
 The present application relates to plunger assemblies and, more particularly, to telescoping plunger assemblies. 
BACKGROUND 
 Syringe assemblies have been used to deliver bone filler to patients. Typically, syringe assemblies include a syringe barrel with an opening at one end for delivering the bone filler. A plunger assembly is usually adapted to pass through the syringe barrel and push the bone filler through that opening. 
 In order to deliver a greater amount of bone filler, from a syringe assembly, typically, a larger syringe barrel is provided (i.e., a barrel that is larger in diameter and/or longer). 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present disclosure relates to telescoping plunger assemblies for a material delivery device. The material delivery device typically includes a first compartment to temporarily store the material and a syringe barrel coupled to the first compartment. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically from a compacted state substantially contained within a first compartment of the device through the syringe barrel to dispense material. 
 In some implementations, the material delivery device is a bone filler mixing and delivery device. Examples of bone cement mixing and delivery devices are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/438,471, 10/637,908 and 11/252,515, which are incorporated by reference. A person of ordinary skill would understand that the techniques and devices disclosed herein could be readily adapted to any type of material delivery device. 
 In one aspect, a bone filler mixing and delivery device includes a mixing section with a mixing element adapted to mix components to form bone filler. A syringe barrel is coupled to the mixing section and has an opening through which the bone filler can be dispensed. A controllable portal (also referred to as an access portal) is provided that can be manipulated to open a flow path between the mixing section and the syringe barrel. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically in an axial direction through the syringe barrel to dispense the bone filler through the opening. In certain implementations, the plunger assembly is adapted to telescopically retract to a position completely contained within the mixing section. 
 In some implementations, the telescoping plunger assembly includes a drive shaft that can be rotated about an axis, a lead screw threaded to the drive shaft and a plunger shaft threaded to the lead screw. Typically, in those implementations, the drive shaft is restricted from moving in an axial direction and the plunger shaft is restricted from moving in a rotational direction. 
 According to some implementations, rotation of the drive shaft causes relative rotation between the lead screw and at least one of either the plunger shaft or the drive shaft. Typically, in those implementations, the relative rotation causes the plunger shaft to move axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. 
 Certain implementations include a support sleeve adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft. In those implementations, the plunger shaft can be coupled to the support sleeve in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in an axial direction, but restricts relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in a rotational direction. In some implementations, a longitudinal slot is formed in the plunger shaft and a pin extends from the support sleeve to engage the longitudinal slot and prevent the plunger shaft from rotating about the axis. The pin may be adapted to move longitudinally through the longitudinal slot as the plunger shaft is moved axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. 
 In another aspect, a material delivery device includes a syringe barrel with a portal for loading material into it and an opening through which the material can be dispensed. A plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically through the syringe barrel to dispense the material through the opening. In some implementations, the plunger assembly is adapted to retract telescopically to a position completely outside of the syringe barrel. 
 In some implementations, the material delivery device has a drive shaft that can be rotated about an axis, a lead screw that is threaded to the drive shaft and a plunger shaft that is threaded to the lead screw. In some of those implementations, the drive shaft is restricted from moving in an axial direction and the plunger shaft is restricted from moving in a rotational direction. In some of those implementations, rotation of the drive shaft causes relative rotation between the lead screw and at least one of either the plunger shaft or the drive shaft, and the relative rotation causes the plunger shaft to move axially through the material delivery device. 
 According to some implementations, a support sleeve is adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft. In those implementations, the plunger shaft is coupled to the support sleeve in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in an axial direction, but restricts relative motion between the plunger shaft and the support sleeve in a rotational direction. 
 In certain implementations, a longitudinal slot is formed in the plunger shaft and the material delivery device includes a pin that extends from the support sleeve to engage the longitudinal slot and prevent the plunger shaft from rotating about the axis. In such implementations, the pin is adapted to move longitudinally through the longitudinal slot as the plunger shaft is moved axially through the bone filler mixing and delivery device. 
 Some implementations include a support sleeve that is movable in an axial direction, where the pin is adapted to drag the sleeve in the axial direction with the plunger shaft as the plunger shaft moves beyond an axial position where the pin reaches an end of the longitudinal slot. 
 Particular implementations include a first section that is coupled to the syringe barrel. In those implementations, the first section is adapted to store the material and the plunger assembly is adapted to extend from the first section through the syringe barrel. 
 In some implementations, one or more of the following advantages may be present. By implementing a telescoping plunger assembly, material delivery devices, such as a bone filler mixing and delivery devices, may be made more compact than would be otherwise possible. Additionally, such devices might be made easier to handle, which can be particularly important in tight quarters, such as in an operating room. 
 Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description, drawings and claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
 The present disclosure relates to a telescoping plunger assembly for a material delivery device. The telescoping plunger assembly includes a syringe barrel with an opening through which material is dispensed and a portal for loading material into the syringe barrel. The plunger assembly is adapted to extend telescopically from a compacted state substantially outside the syringe barrel going through the syringe barrel to dispense material. 
 In some implementations, the material delivery device is a device adapted to mix and deliver bone filler. Typical bone fillers include bone cement based materials (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)), coral based materials (e.g., Hydroxyapatite), calcium sulfates, beta tricalcium phosphates, silica based materials (e.g., ceramics), and human demineralized bone matrices and polymers, such as biocompatible polylatic-co-glycolic acid (i.e.,         plaga        ). 
 FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate a bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 that includes a mixing section 102 adapted to mix one or more components to form bone filler. A syringe barrel 104 is coupled to the mixing section 102 and has an opening 106, through which the bone filler can be dispensed. A collar 108 is positioned between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104 and can be manipulated by a user to actuate a controllable portal that opens a flow path between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104. 
 A plunger assembly (not visible in FIG. 1A or 1B) is provided inside the mixing and delivery device 100 and is adapted to extend from a retracted position substantially (or completely) contained within the mixing section 102 in a telescopic manner through the syringe barrel 104 to dispense bone filler through the opening 106 at the end of the syringe barrel 104. 
 A cover assembly 114 is coupled to the mixing section 102. The cover assembly 114 includes a cap assembly 116 and a crank handle 118. According to the illustrated implementation, the cap assembly 116 is coupled directly to the mixing section housing 102. The crank handle 118 is coupled to the cap assembly 116 with a hinged connection (at 120). The crank handle 118 can be moved about the hinged connection between a first position (shown in FIG. 1A) and a second position (shown in FIG. 1B). 
 In some implementations, when the crank handle 118 is in the first position (FIG. 1A), it engages mixing paddles inside the mixing chamber, and when the crank handle 118 is in the second position (FIG. 1B), it engages the telescoping plunger assembly. From either the first position or the second position, the crank handle 118 can be rotated about an axis of the device 100 to drive whichever element it is engaged to. 
 In a typical use of the device 100, bone filler components are introduced into the mixing section 102. With the crank handle in the first position (FIG. 1A), a user rotates the crank handle 118 to mix the bone filler components with the mixing paddles inside the mixing section 102. Once the components are mixed sufficiently, the user opens the controllable portal by manipulating collar 108 to open a flow path between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104. The mixed bone filler can then pass through the flow path into the syringe barrel 104. The user may continue to drive the mixing paddles until a desired amount of mixed bone filler has been introduced into the syringe barrel 104. 
 Once a desired amount of bone filler has been introduced into the syringe barrel 104, the user moves the crank handle 118 about the hinged connection to the second position (FIG. 1B). From the second position, the user rotates the crank handle 118 to drive the plunger assembly. The plunger assembly extends in an axial direction from a retracted position substantially contained within the mixing section 102. The extension occurs in a telescopic manner through the syringe barrel 104 to dispense the bone filler through opening 106. 
 FIG. 2 is an exploded view of a bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 with a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated device 100 includes a housing 102 for a mixing section (102 in FIGS. 1A-1B). A syringe barrel 104 is adapted to be coupled to mixing section housing 102. The syringe barrel 104 has an opening 106 at a forward end, through which mixed bone filler can be dispensed. 
 The illustrated device 100 includes a controllable portal that includes a collar 108 that can be manipulated by a user to open a flow path between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104, and a sliding tube 109 that is adapted to be coupled to the collar 108 so that manipulation of the collar 108 translates into movement of the sliding tube 109. 
 In some implementations, the sliding tube 109 includes openings that can be aligned with corresponding openings in the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104 to provide a flow path between those areas. In those implementations, manipulating the controllable portal in a particular manner results in the alignment of the sliding tube's 109 opening with the corresponding openings in the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104. Preferably, the sliding tube 109 can form a tight seal with both the mixing section 102 and the syringe tube 104 so that when the flow path is not provided, material cannot accidentally flow from the mixing section 102 to the syringe tube 104. Such sealing may be provided, for example, by o-rings 222. 
 In some implementations, the controllable portal consists of a collar 108 that is coupled to the sliding tube 109. Such implementations may be adapted so that when the collar 108 is rotated axially, the sliding tube 109 moves in an axial (or other) direction through the device 100 to align one or more ports on the sliding tube with ports elsewhere in the device 100 and thereby open a flow path between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104. 
 The illustrated device includes a telescoping plunger assembly. The telescoping plunger assembly includes a drive shaft 202a, a lead screw 202b adapted to be coupled to the drive shaft 202a, a plunger shaft 202c adapted to be coupled to the lead screw 202b, a plunger seal 202d and a seal retaining screw 202e. 
 A portion 110 of the drive shaft 202a is adapted to be coupled selectively to a corresponding gripping feature in the crank handle 118. The drive shaft 202a also includes an opening (not visible in FIG. 2, but shown as 502 in FIG. 5B) that extends axially from a forward end of the drive shaft 202a. That opening has internal threads that can engage a corresponding set of threads at on the lead screw 202b. The forward end 232 of the drive shaft 202a has an outer diameter that is turned down to facilitate engagement with a support sleeve 212 for the plunger shaft 202c. Such engagement may help provide support for the support sleeve 212 when the telescoping plunger assembly is in a retracted position, such as shown in FIGS. 3A-3C. 
 The lead screw 202b has a wide portion 204 and a narrow portion 206, both of which have external threads. The threads on the wide portion 204 of the lead screw 202b are adapted to engage a corresponding set of internal threads on the drive shaft 202a. The threads on the narrow portion 206 of the lead screw 202b are adapted to engage corresponding internal threads on the plunger shaft 202c. In some implementations, a multiple lead thread is formed on the narrow portion 206 of the lead screw 202b to maximize the axial distance that the plunger shaft 202c moves with each rotation of the lead screw 202b. 
 According to the illustrated implementation, a seal retaining screw 202e is adapted to hold the plunger seal 202d in place at a front section 208 of the plunger shaft 202c. The front section 208 of the plunger shaft 202c has an internally threaded opening that extends axially rearward from its front surface. That internally threaded opening is adapted to received and engage the seal retaining screw 202e. The seal retaining screw 202e is adapted to pass partially through an axial opening in the plunger seal 202d and hold the plunger seal 202d in place at the front section 208 of the plunger shaft 202c. The seal retaining screw 202e prevents the seal 202d from slipping off the front of the plunger shaft 202c. 
 The plunger shaft 202c also includes a rear section 210 that has a smaller outer diameter than its front section 208. The rear section 210 has an opening that extends forward from a rear surface of the plunger shaft 202c in an axial direction. That opening is adapted to receive the narrow portion 206 of the lead shaft 202b. The opening has internal threads that are adapted to engage a corresponding set of external threads on the narrow portion 206 of the lead shaft 202b. 
 The rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c has at least one slot 214 in its outer surface that extends longitudinally along a portion of the length of the rear section 210. In the illustrated implementation, the longitudinal slot 214 extends from just behind the front section 208 of the plunger shaft 202c rearward to a short distance from the opposite end of the rear section 210. 
 A support sleeve 212 is provided for the plunger shaft 202c. In the illustrated implementation, the support sleeve 212 has an axial opening, through which the rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c can pass. The rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c is adapted to pass snugly through the support sleeve 212. The support sleeve 212 also is adapted to provide mechanical support to the plunger shaft 202c. According to the illustrated implementation, the plunger shaft 202c is coupled to the support sleeve 212 in a manner that allows relative motion between the plunger shaft 202c and the support sleeve 212 in an axial direction, but prevents relative motion between the plunger shaft 202c and the support sleeve 212 in a rotational direction. 
 More specifically, pins 215 are provided that extend through holes in support sleeve 212 radially inward toward the plunger shaft 202c and engage the longitudinal slot 214 formed in the rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c. The pins 215 prevent relative motion between the plunger shaft 202c and the support sleeve 212 in a rotational direction. Accordingly, when the lead screw 202b, to which the plunger shaft 202c is threaded, rotates inside the plunger shaft 202c, the plunger shaft 202c is forced to move in an axial direction. When the plunger shaft 202c moves in the axial direction, the pins 215 move along the length of the longitudinal slot 214. When the pins 215 reach the end of the longitudinal slots, any further motion of the plunger shaft 202c in the forward direction, causes the pins 215 to drag the support sleeve 212 in the forward axial direction along with the plunger shaft 202c. 
 According to the illustrated implementation, the sliding tube 109 is adapted to support the support sleeve 212. More specifically, the support sleeve is adapted to fit closely within an axially opening through the sliding tube 109. The sliding tube 109 is coupled to the housing 102 in such a manner as to permit relative motion between the sliding tube 109 and the housing 102 in an axial direction, but to prevent relative motion between the sliding tube 109 and the housing 102 in a rotational direction. Likewise, support sleeve 212 is coupled to sliding tube 109 to permit axial motion but prevent rotation. 
 The illustrated bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 also includes a retaining ring 216 adapted to be coupled to a forward end of the drive shaft 202a. When the retaining ring 216 is coupled to the forward end of the drive shaft, it prevents the wide portion 204 of the lead screw 202b from inadvertently screwing out of and becoming disengaged from the drive shaft 202a. More specifically, when the rear end 204 of the lead screw 202b reaches the forward end of the drive shaft 202a, it contacts the retaining ring 216, which prevents the lead screw 202b from moving forward any further. 
 The illustrated bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 also includes a drive shaft retaining ring 218 that is adapted to be coupled to a rear end of the drive shaft 202a. When the drive shaft 202a is positioned inside the mixing element 228 so that its rear portion 110 is exposed through the rear end of the mixing element, the drive shaft retaining ring 218 prevents the drive shaft 202a from moving axially with respect to the mixing element 228. 
 An O-ring 220 is provided to seal the mixing section 102 at the interface between the housing 102 and the cover assembly 114. 
 A flange 224 is provided at one end of the device 100 and can be coupled to the housing 102 with screws 226. In certain implementations, the screws 226 are self-threading screws. 
 The mixing element 228 is adapted to be positioned substantially inside the housing 102. The mixing element 228 includes mixing paddles 230 and a drive 112 for the mixing paddles 230. The mixing paddles 230 are adapted to mix components in the mixing section 102 to form bone filler. An opening extends axially through the mixing element 228 and has a diameter that is large enough to receive the drive shaft 202a. When assembled, the drive shaft 202a is positioned substantially within the opening in the mixing element 228. 
 FIGS. 3A-3C are cross sectional views of a bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 that includes a telescoping plunger assembly shown in a retracted position. In the retracted position, the illustrated plunger assembly is substantially contained within the mixing section 102 of the device. 
 As illustrated, the drive shaft 202a of the plunger assembly includes an internally threaded opening that extends axially rearward from a forward end of the drive shaft 202a. The lead screw 202b has a wide portion 204 and a narrow portion 206. The wide portion 204 of the lead screw 202b is coupled to the internal threads of the axial opening that passes through part of the drive shaft 202a. As illustrated, the lead screw 202b is screwed completely into the drive shaft 202a. 
 The rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c has an opening that extends forward from a rear surface of the plunger shaft 202c in an axial direction. The narrow portion 206 of the lead screw 202b is coupled to the internal threads on the axial opening in the rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c. As illustrated, the plunger shaft 202c is completely screwed onto the lead screw 202b. 
 The rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c passes through the support sleeve 212. The support sleeve 212 provides mechanical support to the plunger shaft 202c. Two longitudinal slots (not visible) are formed on opposite sides of the plunger shaft 202c. Pins 215 pass radially inward through the support sleeve 212 and engage the longitudinal slots formed in the outer surface of the plunger shaft 202c. Accordingly, the plunger shaft 202c is permitted to move in an axial direction relative to the support sleeve 212, but is prevented from rotating relative to the support sleeve 212. 
 The support sleeve 212 passes through and is supported by the sliding tube 109 and by the mixing element 228. The support sleeve 212 includes grooves that extend longitudinally along its outer surface. Those grooves are coupled to corresponding fingers that extend radially inward from the sliding tube 109. Accordingly, the support sleeve 212 is prevented from rotating relative to the sliding tube 109, but is permitted to move axially relative to the sliding tube 109. 
 The sliding tube 109 is supported by the forward end of the mixing element 228 and by the housing 102. As discussed above, the sliding tube 109 includes at least one opening 302 that can align with corresponding opening(s) 304 in the mixing section 102 of the device 100 to provide a flow path between the mixing section 102 and the syringe barrel 104. As illustrated, those openings are not aligned with each other. However, if the sliding tube 109 were moved forward inside the device 100, the openings would be aligned with each other. The sliding tube is coupled to the housing in a manner that prevents relative rotational motion therebetween. The mixing section 102 of the device 100 is sealed at the sliding tube 109 by o-rings 222. 
 The support sleeve 212 includes a counterbore that is engaged to the turned down outer diameter on the forward end of the drive shaft 202a. That arrangement may, in some implementations, help provide support to the support sleeve 212 when the telescoping plunger assembly is in a retracted position. 
 FIGS. 4A-4C are cross sectional views of a bone filler mixing and delivery device 100 that includes a telescoping plunger assembly shown in a fully extended position. In the fully extended position, the illustrated plunger shaft is extended to the forward end of the syringe barrel 104. 
 As illustrated, the pins 215 are in contact with the rear end of the longitudinal slots 214 formed in the outer surface of the plunger shaft 202c. The sliding tube 212 is shown at a position more forward than its position in FIGS. 3A-3C. The sliding tube 212 in FIGS. 4A-4C has been dragged forward by the pins 215 moving with the plunger shaft 202c beyond the point where the pins 215 came into contact with the rear end of the longitudinal slots 214. 
 The lead screw 202b is shown as forward as it can be. The wide portion 204 of the lead screw 202b is in contact with and prevented from moving forward any further by the retaining ring 216 coupled to the forward end of the drive shaft 202a. 
 Also, it can be seen that the sliding tube 109 is at a position more forward than it was in FIGS. 3A-3C. In particular, the openings 302 in the sliding tube 109 are aligned with corresponding openings 304 from the mixing section 102. 
 FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate a drive shaft 202a for a bone filler mixing and delivery device that includes a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated drive shaft 202a has a portion that is adapted to be gripped by a corresponding gripping feature in the crank handle of the device. 
 The illustrated drive shaft has a wide portion 504 and a narrow portion 506. An opening 502 that extends axially rearward from a forward end of the drive shaft 202a substantially the entire length of the wide portion 504. That opening 502 has internal threads that can engage a corresponding set of threads on a lead screw of the plunger assembly. The end of the narrow portion 506 includes a star configuration that facilitates gripping the drive shaft and rotating it. The narrow portion 506 also includes a radial groove 508 for receiving the retaining ring 218. The forward tip 232 of the drive shaft 202a has an outer diameter that is turned down to facilitate engagement with a support sleeve 212 for the plunger shaft 202c. 
 FIG. 6 is a lead screw 202b for a bone filler mixing and delivery device that includes a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated lead screw 202b has a wide portion 204 and a narrow portion 206, both of which have external threads. The threads on the wide portion 204 of the lead screw 202b are adapted to engage a corresponding set of internal threads on a drive shaft for the plunger assembly. The threads on the narrow portion 206 of the lead screw 202b are adapted to engage corresponding internal threads on a plunger shaft of the plunger assembly. 
 FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate a plunger shaft 202c for a bone filler mixing and delivery device that includes a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated plunger shaft 202c has a rear section 210 that has a smaller outer diameter than its front section 208. The rear section 210 has an opening 704 that extends forward from a rear surface of the plunger shaft 202c in an axial direction. That opening 704 is adapted to receive a lead shaft of the telescoping plunger assembly. That opening 704 has internal threads 706 that are adapted to engage a corresponding set of external threads on a lead shaft of the telescoping plunger assembly. 
 The rear section 210 of the plunger shaft 202c has a slot 214 in its outer surface that extends longitudinally along a portion of the length of the rear section 210. In the illustrated implementation, the longitudinal slot 214 extends from just behind the front section 208 of the plunger shaft 202c rearward to a short distance from the opposite end of the rear section 210. 
 The illustrated plunger shaft also has an opening 702 for receiving a seal retaining screw. The opening 702 includes internal threads adapted to engage the threads of the seal retaining screw. 
 FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate a support sleeve 212 that can be used to support a plunger shaft in a bone filler mixing and delivery device with a telescoping plunger assembly. The illustrated support sleeve 212 has an axial opening 804 adapted to engage the turned down portion 232 of the drive shaft 202a of the telescoping plunger assembly. 
 The illustrated support sleeve 212 includes grooves 802 that extend lengthwise down its outer surface. Those grooves 802 are adapted to engage corresponding fingers or pins of the sliding tube which prevent the support sleeve from rotating. The illustrated support sleeve also includes holes that are adapted to receive pins with which to engage corresponding slots formed in the outer surface of a plunger shaft inside the support sleeve 212. 
 Various modifications of the techniques and structures described herein are possible. For example, although the above discussion is directed primarily to a bone filler mixing and delivery device, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the techniques and structures disclosed could be applied beneficially to any device that mixes and delivers fluids other than bone filler. 
 Additionally, the techniques and structures described above could be readily incorporated into a fluid delivery device that does not include a mixing section. Such a device may simply include a temporary storage compartment (without a mixing element) coupled to a syringe barrel. In those instances, the telescoping plunger assembly may be adapted to retract to a compact state substantially contained within the temporary storage compartment. When a user is ready to deliver the fluid, the user might transfer a desired amount of fluid into the syringe barrel and then deploy the telescoping plunger to extend from the temporary storage compartment through the syringe barrel. 
 Moreover, various different arrangements may be utilized to restrict relative motion between parts in one manner, but to permit relative motion in another manner. For example, in some implementations, mating internal and external hexagonal (or other shaped) surfaces may be provided. 
 Additionally, other methods could be implemented to restrict relative motion between the various components discussed above. For example, the plunger shaft could have an outer surface that is shaped like a hexagon and the support sleeve, within which the plunger shaft sits, could have an axial passage that is shaped like a hexagon as well. In such an implementation, when the plunger shaft is positioned inside the passage, the plunger shaft would be allowed to move axially relative to the support sleeve, but its relative rotational freedom would be restricted. 
 Also, the controllable portal that is provided to enable a user to open a flow path between the mixing section and the syringe barrel can be any arrangement that is suitable to perform such a function. For example, the controllable portal may be adapted for actuation by rotating an actuator, by sliding an actuator, by squeezing an actuator or by performing any other motion. The controllable portal may include two openings that can be aligned with each other to establish the flow path. Alternatively, the controllable portal may include a frangible seal, where the frangible seal can be ruptured to establish the flow path. The controllable portal can include any type of valve assembly. A person of ordinary skill would recognize a number of different ways of implementing the controllable portal disclosed herein. 
 Additionally, it is possible to couple the various elements of the plunger assembly to each other using various combinations of internal/external threading. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the particular examples disclosed herein are illustrative only and the scope of the claims should not be restricted merely to the particular arrangements disclosed.
