<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates generally to the field of surgical instrumentation, and more particularly relates to a surgical instrument for driving a threaded member into a substrate. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Various types of fasteners are used to engage implants and other devices to bone. In the spinal field, bone screws are commonly used to attach plates, rods and other types of implants and devices to one or more vertebrae. In some instances, a relatively high degree of precision is required to engage the bone screws in the proper position and orientation relative to the spinal column. Additionally, in the past, the surgeon had to manipulate tissue and/or other anatomical structures while holding the bone screw in position with one hand, while at the same time grasping and rotating a screwdriver with the other hand to drive the screw into engagement with vertebral bone. In some instances, the bone screw may be held in position via the use of a holding instrument that is manipulated in one hand while grasping and manipulating a screwdriver with the other hand. The non-positive engagement between the holding instrument, the screwdriver and the bone screw may lead to instability, thereby making the process of driving the bone screw into bone more difficult, awkward and time consuming. Furthermore, there is also a risk of applying excess torque to the bone screw and potentially breaking the screw and/or stripping out the threads formed in the bone. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Thus, there remains a need for an improved surgical instrument for driving a threaded member into a substrate. The present invention satisfies this need and provides other benefits and advantages in a novel and unobvious manner. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The present invention relates generally to a surgical instrument for driving a threaded member into a substrate. While the actual nature of the invention covered herein can only be determined with reference to the claims appended hereto, certain forms of the invention that are characteristic of the preferred embodiments disclosed herein are described briefly as follows. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In one form of the present invention, a surgical instrument is provided which generally includes a drive shaft, a support member and a biasing member. The drive shaft extends generally along a longitudinal axis and includes a distal end portion configured for releasable engagement with a threaded member. The drive shaft is axially coupled with the support member in a manner allowing relative axial displacement therebetween, and is rotatably coupled with the support member such that rotation of the support member correspondingly rotates the drive shaft. The biasing member is configured to transmit an axial force from the support member to the drive shaft as the threaded member is driven into the substrate, with the axial force being limited as a distal end of the support member is engaged against a surface adjacent the substrate to correspondingly limit an axial force exerted onto the threaded member by the drive shaft to facilitate rotational disengagement of the drive shaft from the threaded member. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In another form of the present invention, a surgical instrument is provided which generally includes a drive shaft, an outer sleeve and a biasing member. The drive shaft extends generally along a longitudinal axis and includes a distal end portion having a distal end and defining a first axial passage extending from the distal end, with the first axial passage being sized and shaped to receive a head portion of a threaded member therein to releasably engage the drive shaft with the threaded member. The outer sleeve defines a second axial passage sized to receive the drive shaft therein and includes a distal end positioned adjacent the distal end portion of the drive shaft. The drive shaft is axially coupled with the outer sleeve in a manner allowing axial displacement of the drive shaft along the second axial passage, and the drive shaft is rotatably coupled with the outer sleeve such that rotation of the outer sleeve correspondingly rotates the drive shaft. The biasing member is coupled between the outer sleeve and the drive shaft and is configured to transmit an axial force from the outer sleeve to the drive shaft as the threaded member is driven into the substrate, with the axial force being limited as a distal end of the outer sleeve is engaged against a surface adjacent the substrate to correspondingly limit an axial force exerted onto the threaded member by the drive shaft to facilitate rotational disengagement of the drive shaft from the head portion of the threaded member. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In another form of the present invention, a surgical instrument is provided which generally includes a drive shaft extending along a longitudinal axis and having a distal end portion configured for releasable engagement with a threaded member. The distal end portion has a distal end and defines a passage extending from the distal end generally along the longitudinal axis. The passage is sized and shaped to receive a head portion of the threaded member therein and defines a tapered portion tapering outwardly toward the distal end to facilitate rotational disengagement of the drive shaft from the head portion of the threaded member. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> It is one object of the present invention to provide an improved surgical instrument for driving a threaded member into a substrate. Further objects, features, advantages, benefits, and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the drawings and description contained herein. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is hereby intended, and that alterations and further modifications to the illustrated devices and/or further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, shown therein is a driver instrument <b>20</b> according to one form of the present invention. In one embodiment, the driver instrument <b>20</b> extends generally along a longitudinal axis L and is comprised of a drive shaft <b>22</b> including a distal end portion <b>24</b> configured for selective and releasable engagement with a threaded member, a support member <b>26</b> extending along the drive shaft <b>22</b>, and a handle <b>28</b> extending from the support member <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the support member <b>26</b> comprises a sleeve, with the drive shaft <b>22</b> positioned within the sleeve <b>26</b> and with the handle <b>28</b> attached to a proximal end portion of the sleeve <b>26</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is configured such that the inner drive shaft <b>22</b> is axially displaceable within the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, but is rotatably engaged with the outer sleeve <b>26</b> such that rotation of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> generally about the longitudinal axis L correspondingly rotates the inner drive shaft <b>22</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the components of the driver instrument <b>20</b> are formed of stainless steel or titanium materials. However, it should be understood that other materials are also contemplated including, for example, metallic alloy materials, polymeric materials, reinforced composite materials, or any other suitable material that would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In one embodiment of the invention, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is used in association with a threaded member <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>) to drive the threaded member <b>100</b> into engagement with a substrate, such as, for example, bone. In one aspect of the invention, the driver instrument <b>20</b> includes one or more elements or features that limit or regulate the amount of rotational torque and/or axial force that can be applied to the threaded member <b>100</b>, the details of which will be discussed in greater detail below. In the illustrated embodiment, the threaded member <b>100</b> comprises fastener. In a specific embodiment, the threaded fastener comprises a bone screw configured for engagement with vertebral bone. However, it should be understood that other type and configurations of threaded members are also contemplated for use in association with the present invention such as, for example, other types of fasteners including bolts or pins, or a tapping device having external threads configured to cut internal threads along a passage in bone. Additionally, it should also be understood that the driver instrument <b>20</b> may be used to drive the bone screw <b>100</b> into substrates other than bone including, for example, spinal implants or other surgical implants or devices. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the bone screw <b>100</b> is formed of a polymeric material. However, other materials are also contemplated including, for example, titanium and stainless steel materials, or any other biocompatible material that would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the bone screw <b>100</b> includes a threaded shank portion <b>102</b> and a head portion <b>104</b> extending therefrom. In the illustrated embodiment, the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> includes external threads <b>110</b> adapted for engagement with cancellous bone, with the distal end of the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> defining a hollowed out area <b>112</b>. However, other types and configurations of the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> are also contemplated. In one aspect of the invention, the head portion <b>104</b> is shaped for selective and releasable engagement within a correspondingly shaped recess formed in the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the head portion <b>104</b> has a non-circular shape. In the illustrated embodiment, the head portion <b>104</b> has a splined configuration defining a Torx&#x2122; style shape having six rounded projections <b>120</b> extending radially outward relative to the longitudinal axis L. However, it should be understood that the head portion <b>104</b> may define any number of projections <b>120</b>, including a single projection, two to five projections, or seven or more projections. It should also be understood that other shapes and configurations of the head portion <b>104</b> are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention including, for example, a star shape, a cross shape, a rectangular shape, a hexagonal shape, a triangular shape, other polygonal shapes, or any other suitable shape or configuration that would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In one embodiment of the invention, the head portion <b>104</b> also defines a tool-receiving recess (not shown) that opens onto an upper surface of the head portion <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the tool-receiving recess has a hexagonal shape that is sized and configured to receive a correspondingly shaped distal end portion of an instrument therein to facilitate unthreading of the bone screw <b>100</b> from the substrate. However, it should be understood that other suitable shapes and configuration of the tool-receiving recess are also contemplated. Additionally, in the illustrated embodiment, the screw head portion <b>104</b> defines a tapered or conical-shaped lower surface <b>126</b>, the purpose of which will be discussed below. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outer sleeve <b>26</b> includes a proximal end portion <b>26</b><i>a</i>, a distal end portion <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and an outer wall <b>30</b> defining an axial passage <b>32</b> extending generally along the longitudinal axis L and opening onto a distal end <b>34</b> of the outer wall <b>30</b>. The axial passage <b>32</b> includes a proximal portion <b>40</b>, a central portion <b>42</b> and a distal portion <b>44</b>. The proximal passage portion <b>40</b> is sized and shaped to receive a proximal end portion of the drive shaft <b>22</b> therein, the details of which will be discussed below. The proximal passage portion <b>40</b> also has a somewhat smaller cross section than the central passage portion <b>42</b> so as to define a distally-facing shoulder <b>46</b>. Similarly, the distal passage portion <b>44</b> has a somewhat smaller cross section than the central passage portion <b>42</b> so as to define a proximally-facing shoulder <b>48</b>. Additionally, the outer wall <b>30</b> of the sleeve <b>26</b> near the distal end <b>34</b> defines an outer chamfer <b>35</b> to minimize trauma or injury to adjacent tissue. Alternatively, the distal end <b>34</b> may be rounded to minimize trauma or injury to adjacent tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment of the invention, the outer sleeve <b>26</b> defines a number of openings <b>27</b> extending through the outer wall <b>30</b> and communicating with the axial passage <b>32</b>. One purpose of the openings <b>27</b> is to provide for adequate sterilization of the components positioned internal to the sleeve <b>26</b> (e.g., the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the biasing member <b>68</b>). Although the openings <b>27</b> are illustrated as having an elongated slot configuration extending generally along the longitudinal axis L, it should be understood that other types and configuration of openings are also contemplated. It should also be understood that the openings <b>27</b> can be provided in various sizes and at different positions along the outer sleeve <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the handle <b>28</b> is formed integral with the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. However, other embodiments are also contemplated where the handle <b>28</b> and the outer sleeve <b>26</b> are formed separately and assembled together to form an integrated structure. In the illustrated embodiment, the handle <b>28</b> is configured as a conventional screwdriver handle. However, other types and configurations of handles are also contemplated as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the inner drive shaft <b>22</b> includes a distal end portion <b>24</b> configured for selective and releasable engagement with a bone screw <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive shaft <b>22</b> further includes a proximal end portion <b>50</b> that is sized and configured for receipt within the proximal portion <b>40</b> of the passage <b>32</b> in the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, and a central body portion <b>52</b> extending between the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> and the distal end portion <b>24</b>. In a further aspect of the invention, the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> and the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> are configured in a manner which permits the drive shaft <b>22</b> to be axially displaced relative to the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, but which substantially prohibits or prevents rotational displacement of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> relative to drive shaft <b>22</b>. Accordingly, a torsional force may be transmitted from the handle <b>28</b> to the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> (via the outer sleeve <b>26</b>) and onto the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>, the details of which will be discussed below. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> has a non-circular shape that is sized and shaped for positioning within the proximal passage portion <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> defines a number of truncated or flatted areas <b>56</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive shaft <b>22</b> defines three truncated or flatted areas <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c </i>that provide the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> with a generally triangular-shaped configuration, with the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> having a correspondingly shaped configuration to slidably receive the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> therein. As should be appreciated, the truncated or flatted areas <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c </i>of the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> are allowed to be axially displaced along corresponding flat or planar surfaces (not shown) defined within the proximal passage portion <b>40</b>, but which engage one another to substantially prevent relative rotation between the outer sleeve <b>26</b> and the drive shaft <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Although a specific shape and configuration of the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> and the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> have been illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that other shapes and configurations of the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> that are sized and configured for receipt within the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> in a manner which permits relative axial displacement between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, but which substantially prohibits or prevents relative rotational displacement therebetween, are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention. For example, either the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> and/or the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> may be provided with other shapes and configurations such as, for example, a hexagonal shape, a Torx&#x2122; shape, a star shape, a cross shape, a rectangular shape, other polygonal shapes, or any other suitable shape or configuration that would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> In another embodiment of the invention, either the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> or the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> may be provided with one or more axially-extending splines that are slidably received within corresponding axially-extending grooves formed along the other of the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> and the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b>. It should also be understood that other portions or elements associated with the drive shaft <b>22</b> may be engaged with the outer sleeve <b>26</b> in a manner which permits relative axial displacement between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the outer sleeve <b>26</b> while substantially prohibiting or preventing relative rotational displacement therebetween. For example, the drive shaft <b>22</b> may be provided with one or more projections extending transversely from a portion of the drive shaft and which are correspondingly positioned within axially-extending grooves formed along an inner surface of the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the outer sleeve <b>26</b> may be provided with one or more projections extending transversely from an inner surface of the wall <b>30</b> and which are correspondingly positioned within axially-extending grooves formed along an outer surface of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> In order to stabilize and support the drive shaft <b>22</b> within the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is provided with one or more support elements or guide structures <b>60</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is provided with a pair of bearing elements <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>positioned adjacent opposite end portions of the central shaft portion <b>52</b>. However, it should be understood that any number of bearing elements may be utilized, including a single bearing element or three or more bearing elements. In one embodiment, the bearing elements <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>include outwardly facing bearing surfaces <b>62</b> that are engaged along an inner surface of the sleeve wall <b>30</b> to provide lateral support to the drive shaft <b>22</b>, which in turn substantially prevents side-to-side movement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> within the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, while still allowing rotational displacement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> within the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. The bearing elements <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>also function to guide the drive shaft <b>22</b> generally along the longitudinal axis L as the drive shaft <b>22</b> is axially displaced relative to the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. As should be appreciated, the lower bearing element <b>60</b><i>b </i>is engageable against the proximally-facing shoulder <b>48</b> defined by the outer sleeve <b>26</b> to retain the drive shaft <b>22</b> within the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. Although a specific type and configuration of the bearing elements <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>have been illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that other types and configurations of support elements or guide structures are also contemplated for use in association with the driver instrument <b>20</b> as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In a further aspect of the invention, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is provided with a biasing member <b>68</b> engaged between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the biasing member <b>68</b> comprises a coil spring extending about the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> and positioned between the upper bearing element <b>60</b><i>a </i>associated with the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the distally-facing shoulder <b>46</b> defined by the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. The drive shaft <b>22</b> defines an annular groove <b>58</b> positioned adjacent the distal-most coil <b>68</b><sub>d </sub>of the coil spring <b>68</b>. Although a specific type of spring member has been illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that other configurations of springs and other types of biasing members are also contemplated for use in association with the present invention. As will be discussed in further detail below, the coil spring <b>68</b> is compressed between the upper bearing element <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the distally-facing shoulder <b>46</b> as the outer sleeve <b>26</b> is axially displaced relative to the drive shaft <b>22</b> in the direction of arrow A. As should be appreciated, the amount of axial force y generated by the compressed coil spring <b>68</b> is equal to the spring constant k multiplied by the distance x that the spring is compressed (i.e., y<sub>lbs</sub>=k<sup>* </sup>x<sub>in</sub>). As will also be discussed in further detail below, the spring-loaded drive shaft <b>22</b> limits the amount of axial force F<sub>2 </sub>that is transmitted through the drive shaft <b>22</b> and onto the threaded fastener <b>100</b>, regardless of the amount of axial force F<sub>1 </sub>that is applied by the surgeon onto the handle <b>28</b> and transmitted through the outer sleeve <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, shown therein are further details regarding the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> which is selectively and releasably engageable with the bone screw <b>100</b>. The distal end potion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> defines an axial passage <b>70</b> extending generally along the longitudinal axis L and opening onto a distal end <b>72</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. In another aspect of the present invention, the distal end portion <b>24</b> is configured to be flexibly and resiliently deformed in a manner that facilitates selective engagement and disengagement of the distal end portion <b>24</b> from the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the distal end portion <b>24</b> defines a number of slots or slits <b>74</b> extending generally along the longitudinal axis L and communicating between the external surface <b>76</b> of the distal end portion <b>24</b> and the axial passage <b>70</b>. The axially-extending slots <b>74</b> divide the distal end portion <b>24</b> into a number of axially-extending fingers or arms <b>80</b> that are configured to be flexibly and resiliently deflected in directions substantially normal to the longitudinal axis L (e.g., displaced away from and toward the longitudinal axis L in a generally radial direction). As will be discussed below, the axially-extending slots <b>74</b> facilitate outward deflection of the arms <b>80</b> to accept the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> and to facilitate resilient inward deflection of the arms <b>80</b> to grip the head portion <b>104</b> to maintain engagement between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the bone screw <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the distal end portion <b>24</b> defines six axially-extending slots <b>74</b> that correspondingly divide the distal end portion <b>24</b> into a six individual fingers or arms <b>80</b>, with the fingers <b>80</b> being inwardly and outwardly deflected substantially independent of one another. However, it should be understood that the distal end portion <b>24</b> may define any number axially extending slots <b>74</b> that divide the distal end portion into a corresponding number of individual arms <b>80</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> The axial passage <b>70</b> includes a recessed receiver portion <b>82</b> adjacent the distal end <b>72</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> that is sized and configured to receive the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> therein to selectively and releasably engage the bone screw <b>100</b> to the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the receiver portion <b>82</b> has a size and shape corresponding to that of the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>. Specifically, the receiver portion <b>82</b> is sized and shaped to receive a splined head or stem therein, such as, for example, the Torx&#x2122; style head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>. As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the receiver portion <b>82</b> includes a number of transverse recessed areas <b>84</b> which are sized and configured to receive the projections <b>120</b> extending radially outward from the screw head portion <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the recessed areas <b>84</b> are generally aligned with the axial slots <b>74</b>. However, it should be understood that in other embodiments, the recessed areas <b>84</b> may be positioned intermediate or offset from the axial slots <b>74</b>. The recessed areas <b>84</b> preferably have an axial depth d (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that is substantially equal to the depth of the screw head portion <b>104</b> such that the screw head portion <b>104</b> is entirely received within the receiver portion <b>82</b> of the axial passage <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The recessed areas <b>84</b> also define distally-facing shoulders <b>86</b> against which the screw head projections <b>120</b> are engaged to prevent the bone screw <b>100</b> from being positioned too far into the axial passage <b>70</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the regions intermediate the recessed areas <b>84</b> define inwardly extending transverse protrusions <b>90</b>. In a further aspect of the invention, the transverse protrusions <b>90</b> have distally-facing surfaces <b>92</b> which are taper cut or chamfered in an outward direction relative to the longitudinal axis L at a taper angle &#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In one embodiment of the invention, the taper angle a is approximately 50 degrees. However, other taper angles &#x3b1; are also contemplated, including taper angles greater than 50 degrees or less than 50 degrees. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the tapered surfaces <b>92</b> open onto the distal end <b>72</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. However, it should be understood that the tapered surfaces <b>92</b> need not necessarily open onto the distal end <b>72</b>. Additionally, although the tapered surfaces <b>92</b> are illustrated as having a generally flat or planar configuration, it should be understood that the tapered surfaces <b>92</b> may alternatively take on a curved or arcuate configuration. Further, although the points of intersection between the tapered surfaces <b>92</b> and the axially-extending surfaces <b>94</b> of the transverse protrusions <b>90</b> are illustrated as defining relatively sharp edges <b>96</b>, it should be understood that the edges <b>96</b> may be chamfered or rounded. Additionally, the distal end <b>72</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> is provided with an outer chamfer <b>98</b> to minimize trauma or injury to adjacent tissue. Alternatively, the distal end <b>72</b> may be rounded to minimize trauma or injury to adjacent tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, shown therein is the bone screw <b>100</b> engaged to the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. Specifically, the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> is positioned within the receiver portion <b>82</b> of the axial passage <b>70</b> defined by the drive shaft <b>22</b>, with the Torx&#x2122; style transverse projections <b>120</b> positioned within the transverse recessed areas <b>84</b>. The inner profile of the receiver portion <b>82</b> is preferably sized somewhat smaller than the outer profile of the screw head portion <b>104</b> such that insertion of the screw head portion <b>104</b> into the receiver portion <b>82</b> slightly deflects the flexible arms <b>80</b> in an outward direction. The resilient nature of the arms <b>80</b> results in compression of the arms <b>80</b> about the screw head portion <b>104</b>. The resulting grip or frictional interference fit between the arms <b>80</b> and the screw head portion <b>104</b> maintains engagement between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the bone screw <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with the bone screw <b>100</b> selectively and releasably engaged within the receiver portion <b>82</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>, the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> is driven into bone. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the bone screw <b>100</b> is used to attach a spinal plate <b>200</b> to a vertebra V. Specifically, the plate <b>200</b> includes a number of openings <b>202</b> extending therethrough which are sized and shaped to receive the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>. The openings <b>202</b> may define internal threads adapted for threading engagement with the shank portion <b>102</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b>, or may be unthreaded. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper portion of the plate opening <b>202</b> is tapered or countersunk so as to define a conically-shaped recess <b>204</b> opening onto an upper surface <b>206</b> of the plate <b>200</b>. The conically-shaped recess is sized and shaped to at least partially receive the lower portion of the bone screw head <b>104</b> therein, with the lower tapered surface <b>126</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> engaged in abutment against the upwardly facing tapered surface of the conically-shaped recess <b>204</b> when the bone screw <b>100</b> is fully seated within the plate opening <b>202</b>. However, in other embodiments of the invention, the recess <b>204</b> may take on other configurations, such as, for example, a spherical configuration adapted to receive a spherical-shaped portion of a screw head therein, a cylindrical configuration adapted to receive a cylindrical-shaped portion of a screw head therein, or any other configuration that would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> As should be appreciated, to facilitate driving of the bone screw <b>100</b> into the vertebra V, the surgeon applies a torsional or rotational force onto the handle <b>28</b> in the direction of arrow R, which is in turn transmitted through the outer sleeve <b>26</b> and on to the drive shaft <b>22</b> via rotational engagement between the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> and the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b>. Rotation of the drive shaft <b>22</b> about the longitudinal axis L correspondingly drives the threaded shank portion <b>102</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> into bone via rotational engagement of the inwardly extending protrusions <b>90</b> in the receiver portion <b>82</b> onto the outward projections <b>120</b> of the screw head portion <b>104</b>. As should also be appreciated, to facilitate driving of the bone screw <b>100</b> into the vertebra V, the surgeon also applies an axial force F<sub>1 </sub>onto the handle <b>28</b>, which is in turn transmitted to the coil spring <b>68</b> via engagement of the distally-facing shoulder <b>46</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> onto the proximal-most coil <b>68</b><sub>p</sub>. As should be further appreciated, exertion of an axial force F<sub>1 </sub>onto the handle <b>28</b> to drive the bone screw <b>100</b> into the vertebra V will compress the coil spring <b>68</b> between the distally-facing shoulder <b>46</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> and the upper drive shaft bearing <b>60</b><i>a</i>. As indicated above, the amount of axial force y generated by the compressed coil spring <b>68</b> is equal to the spring constant k multiplied by the distance x that the spring is compressed (i.e., y<sub>lbs</sub>=k*x<sub>in</sub>), with the axial force y generated by the compressed coil spring <b>68</b> being transmitted to the drive shaft <b>22</b> as an axial force F<sub>2</sub>, which is in turn exerted onto the bone screw <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> As should be appreciated, exertion of the axial force F<sub>1 </sub>onto the handle <b>28</b> results in axial displacement of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> in the direction of arrow A. Since the proximal passage portion <b>40</b> and proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> are configured to permit relative axial displacement therebetween, axial displacement of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> does not require corresponding axial displacement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> in the direction of arrow A. Instead, the proximal shaft portion <b>50</b> is relatively displaced through the proximal passage portion <b>40</b>. Notably, so long as the distal end <b>34</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> is not positioned in abutment against the upper surface <b>206</b> of the plate <b>200</b> or against another rigid structure or substrate, the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>exerted onto the bone screw <b>100</b> will be equal to the axial force F<sub>1 </sub>exerted by the surgeon onto the handle <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, once the distal end <b>34</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> is positioned in abutment against the upper surface <b>206</b> of the plate <b>200</b>, the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>exerted onto the bone screw <b>100</b> by the drive shaft <b>22</b> will be limited to the axial force y generated by the compressed coil spring <b>68</b>. In other words, regardless of how much axial force F<sub>1 </sub>the surgeon exerts onto the handle <b>28</b>, once the distal end <b>34</b> of the outer sleeve <b>26</b> is engaged against the upper surface <b>206</b> of the plate <b>200</b>, the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>transmitted to the drive shaft <b>22</b> will be limited to the amount of axial force y transmitted through the compressed coil spring <b>68</b>. Accordingly, the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>transmitted to the drive shaft <b>22</b> by the compressed coil spring <b>68</b> and onto the bone screw <b>100</b> is equal to the spring constant k multiplied by the distance x that the outer sleeve <b>26</b> is displaced between the initial position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the fully displaced position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (i.e., y<sub>lbs</sub>=k*x<sub>in</sub>). As will be discussed below, limiting or regulating the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>applied to the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> facilitates disengagement of the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> from the screw head portion <b>104</b> once a predetermined level or torque is applied to the screw head <b>104</b>. Additionally, limiting or regulating the axial force F<sub>2 </sub>applied to the drive shaft <b>22</b> reduces the risk of breaking or bending the drive shaft <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, once the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> is fully seated within the recess <b>204</b> in the bone plate <b>200</b> (i.e., when the bone screw <b>100</b> can not be driven any further into the vertebra V), the distal end <b>72</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> will be positioned in abutment against the upper surface <b>206</b> of the bone plate <b>200</b>. At this point, further rotational displacement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> will cause the inward protrusions <b>90</b> in the receiver portion <b>82</b> to rotationally ride up onto the projections <b>120</b> of the screw head portion <b>104</b>, which will in turn outwardly deflect the axial arms <b>80</b> to disengage the drive shaft <b>22</b> from the bone screw <b>100</b>. As should be appreciated, the controlled disengagement between the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> limits the amount of torque applied to the bone screw <b>100</b>, thereby significantly reducing the risks associated with screw breakage resulting from the application of excessive torque onto the bone screw <b>100</b>. Moreover, limiting the amount of torque applied to the bone screw <b>100</b> may also reduce the likelihood of stripping out the threads formed in the bone. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Additionally, as the inward protrusions <b>90</b> in the receiver portion <b>82</b> ride up onto the projections <b>120</b> of the screw head portion <b>104</b>, the distally-facing tapered surfaces <b>92</b> defined by the protrusions <b>90</b> further facilitate disengagement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> from the bone screw <b>100</b> by allowing the protrusions <b>90</b> to slide over and along the projections <b>120</b>, which in turn allows the distal end portion <b>24</b> of the drive shaft <b>22</b> to &#x201c;walk off&#x201d; the screw head portion <b>104</b>. Moreover, since the drive shaft <b>22</b> is allowed to be displaced in an axial direction relative to the outer sleeve <b>26</b>, as the inward protrusions <b>90</b> in the receiver portion <b>82</b> ride up onto and slide along the projections <b>120</b> of the screw head <b>104</b>, the drive shaft <b>22</b> will be axially displaced or &#x201c;backed out&#x201d; in the direction of arrow B (i.e., toward the handle <b>28</b>) to further facilitate disengagement of the drive shaft <b>22</b> from the screw head <b>104</b> to thereby limit or regulate the amount of torque applied to the bone screw <b>100</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> As indicated above, limiting the amount of torque applied to the bone screw <b>100</b> reduces the risk of breaking or shearing of the bone screw <b>100</b> and/or stripping out the threads formed in the bone. In one embodiment, the driver instrument <b>20</b> is configured to disengage the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> at a point just before application of additional torque to the screw head portion <b>104</b> would result in the breaking or shearing of the bone screw <b>100</b> due to the buildup of excessive torque and/or stripping of the threads formed in the bone. However, in other embodiments, the driver instrument <b>20</b> may be configured to disengage the head portion <b>104</b> of the bone screw <b>100</b> well before the point at which application of additional torque would result in the breaking or shearing of the bone screw <b>100</b> and/or stripping of the threads formed in the bone. </p>
