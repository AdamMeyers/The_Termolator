<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A surgical obturator includes an obturator member having a distal end and a proximal end, and a blade member adjacent the distal end of the obturator member. The blade member includes first and second surfaces intersecting to define a peripheral cutting edge. At least one, preferably, both, of the first and second surfaces is curved. At least one, preferably, both, of the first and second surfaces is generally concave. The peripheral cutting edge defined by the first and second intersecting surfaces is substantially linear and obliquely arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis of the obturator member. The peripheral cutting edge may define an angle ranging from about 18&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal axis. Alternatively, the peripheral cutting edge defined by the first and second surfaces is generally arcuate, and may be concave or convex in configuration. In accordance with one preferred embodiment, the blade member includes opposed pairs of intersecting first and second surfaces, which define opposed peripheral cutting edges. The opposed peripheral cutting edges extend to the penetrating end of the blade member. A hollow grinding technique is employed to form the curved surfaces and resulting cutting edges. Such technique provides significant benefits with respect to tissue resistance and drag. </p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Technical Field </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present disclosure relates generally to a trocar assembly for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures, such as endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a thin obturator blade for use with a trocar assembly and having cutting edges defined by curved surfaces of the blade. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Background of the Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Minimally invasive procedures are continually increasing in number and variation. Forming a relatively small diameter temporary pathway to the surgical site is a key feature of most minimally invasive surgical procedures. The most common method of providing such a pathway is by inserting a trocar assembly through the skin. In many procedures, the trocar assembly is inserted into an insufflated body cavity of a patient. In such procedures, the trocar assemblies with seal mechanisms are utilized to provide the necessary pathway to the surgical site while minimizing leakage of insufflation gases. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Trocar assemblies typically include an obturator which is removably inserted through a cannula. The obturator may incorporate a penetrating end defining a general pyramidal or frusto-conical shape and having a sharpened or blunt point. In the alternative, the obturator may incorporate a thin bladed member such as the obturator blade disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,372, 5,545,150, 5,607,440, 5,797,443, 5,868,773 each to Danks, the contents of each patent being incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. Advantages of these thin bladed members include reduced penetration forces and smaller openings in the incision thereby reducing patient trauma and facilitating healing. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to further improvements in bladed obturators. In one preferred embodiment, a surgical obturator includes an obturator member having a distal end and a proximal end, and a blade member adjacent the distal end of the obturator member. The blade member includes first and second surfaces intersecting to define a peripheral cutting edge. At least one, preferably, both, of the first and second surfaces is curved. At least one, preferably, both, of the first and second surfaces is generally concave. The peripheral cutting edge defined by the first and second intersecting surfaces is substantially linear and obliquely arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis of the obturator member. The peripheral cutting edge may define an angle ranging from about 18&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal axis. Alternatively, the peripheral cutting edge defined by the first and second surfaces is generally arcuate, and may be concave or convex in configuration. In accordance with one preferred embodiment, the blade member includes opposed pairs of intersecting first and second surfaces, which define opposed peripheral cutting edges. The opposed peripheral cutting edges extend to the penetrating end of the blade member. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The surgical obturator may also include a protective shield coaxially mounted about the blade member. The protective shield and the blade member are adapted for relative longitudinal movement between a first armed position of the blade member and a second disarmed position of the blade member. Preferably, the protective shield is mounted for longitudinal movement relative to the obturator member. The protective shield may be normally biased to a position corresponding to the second disarmed position of the blade member. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In another embodiment, a surgical obturator includes an obturator member defining a longitudinal axis and having proximal and distal ends, and a generally planar blade member disposed adjacent the distal end of the obturator member. The blade member includes peripherally disposed opposed pairs of first and second generally concave surfaces intersecting to define opposed peripheral cutting edges. The peripheral cutting edges extend toward a penetrating end of the blade member. Each cutting edge extends in general oblique relation to the longitudinal axis. The cutting edges may be generally linear or arcuate. The surgical obturator also may include an obturator housing mounted adjacent the proximal end of the obturator member and a protective sleeve coaxially mounted about the obturator member. The protective sleeve is adapted for reciprocal longitudinal movement between an armed position of the blade member and a disarmed position of the blade member. The protective sleeve is biased to a position corresponding to the disarmed position of the blade member. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The curved or concave surfaces defining the cutting edges of the blade member are preferably formed via a hollow grinding technique. Such hollow grinding technique utilizes a rotating grinding wheel to grind an edge on the blade member perpendicular to the cutting edge. This yields a facet that when viewed in cross-section has a curvature resulting from the shape of the grinding wheel. The hollow grind and the cutting edges formed thereby provide substantial benefits in penetrating and passing through tissue particularly when compared to conventional flat grinding techniques which produce flat surfaces on an obturator blade. Specifically, the concave configuration provided by the hollow ground provides sharper, more durable edges, thereby resulting in reduced penetration and drag through tissue.</p>

Alternatively, shield extension <b>116</b> and shield member <b>118</b> may be a single component, monolithically formed during manufacture. In a further alternative, shield extension <b>116</b> could be eliminated. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, shield member <b>118</b> includes first and second shield half-sections <b>118</b><i>a</i>, <b>118</b><i>b</i>. First and second shield half-sections <b>118</b><i>a </i>are identically shaped.

Each transverse wall <b>126</b><i>a </i>includes an upstanding notch <b>128</b> adjacent one end of the wall <b>126</b><i>a </i>and a substantially cylindrical recess <b>130</b> adjacent the other end of the transverse wall <b>116</b><i>a</i>. In the assembled condition of half sections <b>118</b><i>a</i>, notches <b>128</b> are received within corresponding recesses <b>130</b> thereby maintaining proper alignment and symmetry of the half sections <b>118</b><i>a</i>. It is envisioned that notches <b>128</b> and recesses <b>130</b> may be dimensioned to form a friction or interference fit between the components or structured to form a snap fit arrangement. It is further noted that adhesives, cements, etc. may be used to fixedly secure the half sections <b>118</b><i>a </i>to each other. Each transverse wall <b>116</b> further defines semicircular recess <b>132</b><i>a </i>which, in the assembled condition of half sections <b>118</b><i>a</i>, forms a circular passage or recess through shield member <b>118</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> Blade guard sections <b>124</b><i>a </i>define a general tapered configuration when assembled. The tapered configuration may be in the general shape of a cone or conic section. Alternatively, the tapered configuration may be in the general shape of a dolphin-nose having a pair of diametrically opposed surfaces <b>124</b><i>s </i>which are slightly concave in appearance (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Such arrangement is disclosed in the aforementioned commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/103,892, filed Apr. 12, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. Blade guard sections <b>124</b><i>a </i>further define a blade receiving slot <b>133</b> when assembled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 13</figref>-<b>18</b>, obturator assembly <b>100</b> further includes indicator collar <b>134</b> which is secured within the proximal end of protective shield <b>116</b>. In one preferred arrangement, indicator collar <b>134</b> defines distal collar extension <b>134</b><i>a</i>. Collar extension <b>134</b><i>a </i>includes annular rim <b>136</b> on its outer surface. Annular rim <b>136</b> is contained within protective shield <b>116</b> through its engagement with radial tabs <b>138</b> of protective shield <b>116</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> Indicator collar <b>134</b> further includes a shield position indicator, such as indicator flag <b>140</b>, extending transversely relative to the indicator collar <b>134</b>. Indicator flag <b>140</b> is visible from the exterior of obturator housing <b>102</b> as it extends through groove <b>108</b><i>a </i>of housing cover <b>108</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 17</figref>). Preferably, indicator flag <b>140</b> is colored to contrast sharply with the surrounding housing components. For example, indicator flag <b>140</b> may be red if the surrounding housing components are white or light colored. Indicator collar <b>134</b> further includes collar ledge <b>144</b> and a pair of posts <b>146</b> formed below the ledge <b>144</b> and extending radially outwardly from the ledge <b>144</b>. Collar ledge <b>144</b> serves to releasably lock protective shield <b>114</b> in a distal position with respect to blade <b>190</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> Indicator flag <b>140</b> and protective shield <b>114</b> are spring biased in the distal direction by coil spring <b>148</b>. In particular, coil spring <b>148</b> is received within internal bore <b>150</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b> and engages internal shelf <b>152</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) of the indicator collar <b>134</b>. The proximal end of coil spring <b>138</b> is coaxially mounted about spring mount <b>154</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) depending from the interior surface of housing cover <b>108</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-22</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, obturator assembly <b>100</b> includes a latching mechanism disposed within obturator housing <b>102</b> to prevent proximal movement of protective shield <b>114</b> until such time as the obturator assembly <b>100</b> is mounted to cannula assembly <b>1000</b> and the surgeon is prepared to begin trocar entry. Latching mechanism includes latch member <b>156</b>, and release member such as slider <b>158</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Latch member <b>156</b> has two vertical legs <b>160</b> connected by web <b>162</b>. A pair of biasing posts <b>164</b> extends outwardly, one for each side of latch member <b>156</b>. Collar ledge <b>144</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b> is engaged and secured by web <b>162</b> of latch member <b>156</b> when in an initial position of the latch member <b>156</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-22</figref>. In the initial position of latch member <b>156</b>, protective shield <b>114</b> is retained in a first extended position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Latch member <b>156</b> is preferably molded as part of housing base <b>106</b> in cantilever fashion. However, latch member <b>156</b> may be formed as a separate element and secured to base <b>106</b> by suitable known techniques. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> Slider <b>158</b> includes post <b>166</b> disposed at its lower end, arming button <b>168</b> extending distally from the distal face of slider <b>158</b> and a pair of slider legs <b>170</b> which terminate in crooks <b>172</b>. Crooks <b>172</b> defined in slider legs <b>170</b> are configured and dimensioned to engage posts <b>164</b> of latch member <b>156</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>. Slider <b>158</b> is distally biased by slider spring <b>174</b> which is maintained in axial alignment by slider post <b>166</b> of slider <b>158</b>. The proximal end of slider spring <b>174</b> bears against the inner surface of housing cover <b>108</b> and is maintained in position between proximal post <b>178</b> and cylindrical base <b>180</b> formed in base <b>106</b>, (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>). The distal biasing of slider <b>158</b> causes arming button <b>168</b> to project through opening <b>180</b> formed in housing base <b>106</b>. The lower end or transverse leg <b>182</b> of slider <b>158</b> resides with mounting posts <b>172</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of housing base <b>106</b> with post base <b>184</b> of slider <b>158</b> residing within mounting posts <b>172</b><i>b</i>, <b>172</b><i>c</i>.

Mounting of obturator assembly <b>100</b> relative to cannula assembly <b>112</b> causes slider <b>158</b> to translate or rotate generally vertically in a generally proximal direction as will be described further hereinbelow. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the components of obturator shaft <b>104</b> will be discussed. Obturator shaft <b>104</b> includes obturator rod <b>186</b>, blade mount <b>188</b> and obturator blade <b>200</b>. Obturator rod <b>186</b> defines proximal end <b>192</b> having a general semi-circular cross-section and being received within correspondingly dimensioned opening <b>194</b> of spring mount <b>154</b> of housing cover <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). The proximal end <b>192</b> further defines latch <b>196</b> which is received within side opening <b>198</b> of spring mount <b>154</b> in snap relation therewith to secure the two components (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the distal end of obturator rod <b>186</b> defines collar <b>190</b>. Blade mount <b>188</b> includes mounting recess <b>189</b> which is dimensioned to receive collar <b>190</b> of obturator rod <b>186</b>. Blade mount <b>188</b> further includes knife slot <b>191</b> which accommodates obturator blade <b>200</b>. Obturator blade <b>200</b> may be secured within knife slot <b>191</b> by conventional means including adhesives, cements, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, obturator blade <b>200</b> will now be discussed. Obturator blade <b>200</b> is substantially thin defining a thickness &#x201c;t&#x201d; substantially less than a width &#x201c;w&#x201d;. Obturator blade <b>200</b> is generally blade-like in appearance and may be a planar blade or the like. Obturator blade <b>200</b> includes pairs of opposed curved surfaces <b>202</b> formed into the blade <b>200</b> and defining peripheral cutting edges <b>204</b> along the lines of intersection of the curved surfaces <b>202</b>. Curved surfaces <b>202</b> are generally concave in configuration defining a radius of curvature &#x201c;v&#x201d; ranging from about 0.05 inches to about 3.55 inches. Peripheral cutting edges <b>204</b> extend at an angle &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; relative to longitudinal axis. Angle &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; may range from about 18&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0;, preferably, about 20&#xb0;. Cutting edges <b>204</b> terminate adjacent penetrating point <b>206</b>. Penetrating point <b>206</b> may be sharp or blunt. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> In a preferred embodiment, curved surfaces <b>202</b> may be made through conventional means, including, for example, coining, grinding, etc. In one preferred method of manufacture, curved surfaces <b>202</b> are formed via a hollow grinding technique. Such hollow grinding technique utilizes a rotating grinding wheel which is used to grind an edge on a blade perpendicular to the cutting edge. This yields a facet that when viewed in cross-section has a curvature resulting from the shape of the grinding wheel. The hollow grind and the tapered edges formed thereby provide substantial benefits in penetrating and passing through tissue particularly when compared to conventional flat grinding techniques which produce flat surfaces on an obturator blade (See the prior art obturator blade of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Specifically, the concave configuration provided by the hollow ground provides sharper edges, thereby resulting in reduced penetration and drag through tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12E</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> having a variety of radius of curvatures. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12E</figref>, linear cutting edges of the conventional or prior art blade of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are shown in phantom lines.) As indicated hereinabove, the radii of curvature of curved surfaces may vary in accordance with the desired objective and characteristic of the blade. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>A, <b>208</b>A having a 0.020 radius of curvature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>B, <b>208</b>B having a radius of about 0.050 inches curvature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>C, <b>208</b>C having a radius of about 0.070 inches curvature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>D, <b>208</b>D having a radius of curvature of 0.080 inches. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> illustrates surfaces <b>206</b>E, <b>208</b>E having a radius of curvature of 0.090 inches. It is also envisioned that cutting edges <b>204</b> formed by curved surfaces <b>202</b> may have a concave or convex appearance instead of the linear edge shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The concave and convex arrangements of cutting edges <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, respectively. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>, a method of use and operation of trocar assembly <b>10</b> will be discussed. Obturator assembly <b>100</b> is inserted within cannula assembly <b>1000</b> and advanced to where obturator housing <b>102</b> is approximated with seal housing <b>2002</b> of the seal assembly <b>2000</b>. Seal assembly <b>2000</b> may comprise a separate part or may be a component of cannula assembly <b>1000</b>. Seal housing <b>2002</b> and housing base <b>106</b> of obturator housing <b>102</b> may be appropriately dimensioned to form a friction fit or may be coupled to each other by conventional means including bayonet coupling, tongue-groove, etc. Approximating the obturator housing <b>102</b> and the seal housing <b>2002</b> releases the blade guard <b>120</b> from a locked condition, actuating the trocar assembly. With the obturator housing <b>102</b> and seal housing <b>2002</b> approximated, arming button <b>168</b> of slider <b>158</b> engages surface <b>2004</b> of seal housing <b>2002</b> and is forced upwardly (depicted by directional arrow &#x201c;u&#x201d;) from the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>. During this movement, slider <b>158</b> pivots or angulates whereby legs <b>170</b> of slider <b>158</b> push latch member <b>156</b> in a radial outward direction (depicted by directional arrow &#x201c;z&#x201d;) such that web portion <b>162</b> of latch member <b>156</b> is out of axial alignment with ledge <b>144</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b>. In this position, indicator collar <b>134</b> and protective shield <b>114</b> are free to axially move. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-26</figref>, the surgeon begins to insert trocar assembly <b>10</b> through the body wall of the patient. Shield assembly <b>118</b> contacts the tissue and is driven upwardly to cause protective shield <b>114</b> and indicator collar <b>134</b> to move proximally (depicted by directional arrow &#x201c;v&#x201d;) against the bias of coil spring <b>148</b>. Such movement exposes obturator blade <b>190</b> to incise the tissue. This armed condition of obturator assembly <b>100</b> is visually verified by the proximal location of indicator flag <b>140</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b>. In addition, proximal movement of indicator collar <b>134</b> causes posts <b>146</b> of the indicator collar <b>134</b> to ride along outer surfaces <b>170</b><i>a </i>of legs <b>170</b> of slider <b>158</b> to thereby move the slider <b>158</b> at least radially inwardly and upwardly (as shown by the directional arrows &#x201c;r&#x201d;) in a general aligned position relative to the obturator axis &#x201c;x&#x201d;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates this actuated position of latch member <b>156</b>. With obturator blade <b>200</b> exposed, the surgeon may apply a distally-directed force to obturator assembly <b>100</b> to cause penetration through the tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> Once obturator blade <b>200</b> and the guard portion of shield assembly <b>118</b> passes through the body wall of the patient, protective shield <b>114</b> moves distally to cover obturator blade <b>200</b>. Ledge <b>144</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b> also moves into engagement with web portion <b>162</b> of latch member <b>156</b>. In particular, indicator collar <b>134</b> and protective shield <b>114</b> are driven distally under the influence of coil spring <b>148</b>. Concurrently with this movement, slider <b>158</b>, which is aligned relative to axis &#x201c;x&#x201d;, is driven distally under the influence of coil spring <b>174</b>. In the respective positions of indicator collar <b>134</b> and slider <b>158</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, collar ledge <b>144</b> of indicator collar <b>134</b> securely engages web <b>162</b> of latch member <b>156</b> to secure protective shield <b>114</b> in its extended position. The obturator assembly <b>100</b> is removed from cannula assembly <b>1000</b> and surgery is performed with instruments inserted through cannula assembly <b>1000</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> Except where noted otherwise, the materials utilized in the components of the presently disclosed trocar assembly generally include materials such as, for example, ABS, polycarbonate, stainless steel, titanium and any other suitable biocompatible metals and/or polymeric materials. A preferred ABS material is CYCOLAC which is available from General Electric. A preferred polycarbonate material is also available from General Electric under the trademark LEXAN.
