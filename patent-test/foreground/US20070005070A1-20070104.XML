<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to an orthopedic screw and a corresponding screw driver wherein the screw has a torque driving head with a rounded side a spherical wall for multiaxial use, a self starting, self tapping insertion tip and a threaded portion including a cancellous thread. The threaded portion has a major diameter defined by a spiraling thread and a minor diameter. The head is joined to the threaded portion by an area of from about 2 to about 6 turns of the thread along the longitudinal axis in which the minor diameter tapers by an angle of from about 4&#xb0; to about 12&#xb0; and the major diameter of the screw remaining substantially the same. The screw includes a multilobe torque driving recess joined to a cylindrical recess that corresponds to a cylindrical post on the torque driver so as to form a press fit which acts to self-center the screw, to help avoid stripping of the screw/driver interface and to hold the screw in place on the torque driver prior to implantation. </p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This application is based on U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/691,170, filed on Jun. 16, 2005 </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to a screw and screw driver which provides for a self-centering screw which is held in position on the driver for use in surgery, and in particular for use in orthopedic surgery. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Increasing numbers of applications are being developed in the biomedical field, which involve the use of a mechanical construct that is surgically implanted to allow the body to mend or be reconstructed. These applications include spinal constructs and disk replacements, plates used for long bone repair from the femur to the metacarpals, and even soft tissue repair such as bladder and hernia repair. There are even orthopedic or dental areas in which a screw is implanted by itself to hold bone in a certain position, or to provide an anchor for a dental prosthetic. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> One field which is ready for product growth is small bone surgery, i.e. below the elbow and ankle. Much of the work that has been done in this area in the past represents scaled down constructs and instruments from the large bone area. However, many of these products are not adequate for the fine bones and delicate procedures required of the small bone surgeon. These bones are fine and have minimal surface area for placement of an implant, and less mass for the placement of a screw. In addition, there is usually minimal soft tissue to cover an implant. These factors tend to make small bone surgery particularly tedious and unforgiving. Small bone surgeons are particularly appreciative of surgical tools that provide assistance in holding, centering, and implanting the delicate screws that are used in this area of the body, especially when it means that fewer hands need to be involved in the procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present invention is designed to meet the specific needs of the small bone surgeon to facilitate effective and repeatable procedures which provide for ease of use for this specific area of specialization, although it is certainly envisioned that the screw and screw driver of the present invention could be used in a wide variety of other orthopedic and surgical applications including spinal surgery, plating in various areas of the body, soft tissue repair, and bone anchoring. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The present invention provides a screw for use alone or as part of a construct which could include a plate. The screw is designed specifically for the small bone market, i.e. for use in bones distil to the elbow and knee, including, for example, the ulna, radius, tibia, fibula, as well as the metacarpals, carpals, metatarsals, tarsals, and phalanges. The screw can be used in applications previously mentioned, for example those that require fixation within a single bone such as the stabilization of a fracture or the screw can be used across two or more bones so as to facilitate total or partial fusion. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The screws are advantageously, self-starting, self-tapping screws having an internal torque driving recess that terminates in a cylindrical opening or cannulation. The cannulation can extend through the length of the screw or can extend only partially through the length of the screw in a partial cannula. The invention further includes a screw driver having an external torque driving shape and terminating in a conical or cylindrical pilot or boss which mates with the cylindrical cannula or tapered opening in the screw. The pilot is sized and held to a tolerance so as to hold the screw on the screw driver by a friction fit and further acts to center the screw's torque driving recess relative to the torque driver of the screw driver in order to help avoid stripping the torque driving recess of the driver. This is a particular problem for the small screws and even smaller torque driving recesses of the screws. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The screws include an insertion end having multiple flutes, and preferably 2 or 3 flutes about a conical recess. The screws further include a modified cancellous thread. The screw further has a partial taper of the minor diameter of about 5&#xb0; to about 15&#xb0;, and more preferably about 6&#xb0; to about 100, and most preferably about 8&#xb0; over about the first 2 to about 6, and more preferably about 4 complete turns of the threads adjacent to the head of the screw. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The screws further include a torque driving recess that may be a hexagon, a sinusoidal shape, or a modification of a sinusoidal (multilobed) shape. This recess can be of a constant size in the direction of the longitudinal axis, or can taper inward along the longitudinal axis of the screw toward the bottom of the recess. The opening for the pilot of the screw driver can be of any cross section which corresponds to the cross-section of the pilot, but circular is preferable with a taper along the longitudinal axis in one of either the pilot or the hole. Thus, the pilot may have a slight taper and form an interference fit with a cylindrical opening, or alternatively and perhaps of slightly less advantage, the opening may have a slight taper and form an interference fit with a cylindrical pilot on the screw driver. A cylindrical opening with a slightly tapered, i.e. about 2-5&#xb0;, pilot with a flat bottom works well, and is relatively easy to manufacture in the small sizes required. The driver and opening are dimensioned so that the distil end of the pilot is slightly smaller than the distil end of the opening, and the frictional fit optimally occurs right below a transition between the torque driving recess and the opening. An additional feature of the recess/opening is a chamfered transition area, which could be a truncated frutoconical shape that leads from the torque driving recess into the cylindrical opening. In addition, the head of the screw can include a rounded exterior portion or spherical shaped head to permit multiaxial insertion, i.e. in a corresponding rounded or spherical recess in a countersunk screw hole in a plate or other construct. The screws can be provided in typical lengths for small bone use, i.e. from about 5 mm to about 25 mm and typically in lengths of 8, 12 16 and 20 mm with a major diameter of about 2.7 mm or 3.5 mm. The screws can include a constant thread pitch as shown, in particular for use with a bone plate. A further embodiment of the screw for use in fixation by itself is a screw which includes a compression thread which increases in the number of turns over a given length. This variable pitch will preferably be used for the thread over about half of the distil end of the screw. The screws can be made of appropriate biocompatible material, including for example surgical grade stainless steel and titanium. The driver may be an integral design, such as stainless steel, or the pilot may be constructed as an insert for example from a more flexible material. Alternatively, the pilot may be constructed as a separate and preferably retractable assembly, such as a stylet, which rejects using the same mechanism as a retractable ball point pen. Preferably, the driver includes a fillet, or rounded transition between the shaft and the torque driving tip and also one between the torque driving tip and the pilot.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> show an orthopedic screw <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. The distal end of the screw includes a cutting tip <b>12</b> which is self-starting and self-tapping. The term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; is used herein to mean the end that would be farthest from the point of attachment to a plate if one were used, i.e. the insertion tip, and &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; is used to mean the opposite end of the screw, i.e. the head. The cutting tip <b>12</b> is provided by a conical recess <b>13</b> and a plurality of flutes <b>14</b> or grooves that form sharp cutting surfaces at the terminus of the screw. The invention could also be practiced with a blunt tip screw, such ad may be used for a cannulated version. The screw <b>10</b> includes a torque driving recess <b>16</b> terminating in a self-centering opening which can be a partial or full cannula <b>15</b> along its longitudinal axis. While the screw is shown as including a partial cannula in the drawings, the bore can extend fully toward the distal end of the screw, or can be absent. In a preferred embodiment the screw includes the partial cannulation which is a preferably a cylindrical or conical opening, and is more preferably a cylindrical recess extending at least about 1.5 mm up to about 5 mm, and preferably at least about 2 mm to 4 mm or more based upon the diameter of the screw. A chamfered or angled area <b>11</b> has a depth of about 0.05 to about 0.75 mm, or more preferably about 0.2 to about 0.4 mm and connects the cannulation or opening with the torque driving recess and further helps to guide the pilot of the screw driver into the opening <b>15</b>. The opening is about 1.0 to about 2.0 mm, with a tolerance in the vicinity of about +/&#x2212;0.001 to about +/&#x2212;0.005 mm. If the opening is tapered, the pilot is preferably of a constant circular cross-section, so that the interference fit is created in the mating of the taper of either the opening or the pilot with the constant cross-section of its respective mate. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The cannulation is used with a torque driving instrument shown at <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that has a torque driving head <b>52</b> which corresponds in shape to the female shape of the torque driving recess <b>16</b> of the screw and which terminates in a pilot, boss or post <b>54</b> that will fit in the centering opening <b>15</b> of the screw so that the screw is self-centering, is held in position on the torque driving instrument in a friction fit, and further which seats the screw so as to avoid stripping the interface between the screw and the torque driver. Preferably, the pilot has a circular cross-section which may vary in dimension along the longitudinal axis to cause the shape to taper from about 0.5 to about 10&#xb0;, and preferably about 1 to about 5&#xb0;, and most preferably about 2 to about 4&#xb0;. The pilot has a length of about 1-5 mm, and preferably about 1-3 mm. The taper of the pilot causes a frictional fit between the pilot and the opening slightly below the chamfered area which holds the screw on the screw driver and helps to seat the torque driver in the torque driving recess. As is shown in the detail of the torque driving head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the tip includes a first fillet <b>60</b> which forms a transition between the drive shaft <b>53</b> and the contoured tip <b>54</b>, and a second fillet <b>62</b> which forms a transition between the contoured tip <b>54</b> and the pilot <b>54</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The head <b>20</b> of the screw includes a rounded area <b>21</b> which preferably includes from about 0.75 mm to about 2.0 mm of a sphere having a diameter of from about 4 mm to about 5 mm. This defines a side wall which will allow for multi-axial placement in a screw hole, for example, in a plate that has a corresponding concavity. In the event that the screw is used alone, the rounded area eliminates sharp transitions between the threaded area and the head of the screw. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The screw head <b>10</b> has a relatively flat proximal surface <b>22</b> having radiiused transitions <b>24</b> into the rounded area of the side wall of the head. The proximal surface includes a torque driving recess <b>16</b>, such as a modified multilobe shape or torx shape as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The recess <b>16</b> can be of a constant cross-section or can taper toward the bottom. A necked area <b>26</b> joins the rounded area <b>21</b> of the head side wall to a threaded portion <b>27</b> of the screw. The threaded portion <b>27</b> includes a modified cancellous thread <b>30</b> with a constant major diameter <b>32</b> which is defined by the spiraling outer edge of the thread <b>33</b> and a minor diameter <b>34</b> defined by the inner portion of the screw at the base of the thread. The minor diameter <b>34</b> is constant over a distil portion of the thread so as to define a cylinder with a spiraling thread. The minor diameter also includes a proximal portion that tapers inward over the length of the first four proximal threads toward the distal end in order to improve fatigue strength and to improve compression at the proximal cortical bone interface and to compensate for bone re-adsorption. The tapered portion of the screw <b>36</b> includes a taper of from about 2&#xb0; to about 20&#xb0;, or more preferably from about 4&#xb0; to about 12&#xb0;, and most preferably about 6&#xb0; to about 10&#xb0; (i.e. about 8&#xb0;) which tapers over from about 2 to about 10, and more preferably about 3 to about 6 complete turns (360&#xb0;) of the thread <b>33</b>. The pitch is between about 0.5 and 2.0 millimeters in length (i.e. a thread revolution of 360&#xb0; per 0.5 to 2.0 millimeters). </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The thread is a cancellous type thread with a front thrust <b>40</b> surface having an angle of from about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;, or more preferably from about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0;, and most preferably about 18&#xb0; to about 22&#xb0; (i.e. about 20&#xb0;) to a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the screw, while the rear surface <b>41</b> forms an angle of about 0&#xb0; to about 10&#xb0;, or more preferably from about 0&#xb0; to about 8&#xb0;, and most preferably about 3&#xb0; to about 7&#xb0; (i.e., about 5&#xb0;) to the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the screw. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The screw can be made from an appropriate biocompatible material having appropriate strength characteristics including surgical grade stainless steel or titanium or absorptive materials. The driver can be made as an assembly where the torque driving head and shaft are made from biocompatible materials again having appropriate strength characteristics including surgical grade stainless steel or titanium. The pilot tip may be integral with the torque driving head, or may be a separate component made from the same or a different material, for example it could be a biocompatible ceramic, or plastic polymeric material which is press fit into a recess in the torque driving head. Alternatively, the pilot can be a retractable post which operates using the same mechanism that causes the retraction of a ball point pen, including a spring loaded button or a twist mechanism that advances the pilot or stylet. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a screw driver <b>50</b> that is used with the screw of the invention. The screw driver includes a handle <b>51</b> that is preferably ergonometrically designed to feel comfortable in the hand of the surgeon and to provide an appropriate amount of torque per turn to avoid over torquing and stripping the screw. The shaft of the driver <b>50</b> terminates in a head that includes a torque driver <b>52</b> that includes pilot <b>54</b> to hold the screw in position on the screw driver by a friction fit as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This permits the surgeon to load the screw on the driver and than to manipulate the screw using the screw driver rather than to have to try to hold the screw between his or her fingers which would certainly obscure the view of the surgical cite. This greatly eases the surgeon's job and helps to relieve the possibility of cramping hands. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> While in accordance with the patent statutes the best mode and preferred embodiment have been set forth, the scope of the invention is not limited thereto, but rather by the scope of the attached claims. </p>
