The systems include one or more constructs having a motion preserving portion that permits motion of at least a portion of a vertebral level and a motion preventing portion that substantially prevents motion of at least a portion of a second, adjacent vertebral level. 




















BACKGROUND 
 Various types of devices and systems have been used to stabilize portions of bones including the spine. Spinal stabilization techniques have employed plating and rods on the posterior, anterior, lateral, postero-lateral and antero-lateral portions of a spinal column segment. Such systems can provide rigid or dynamic fixation of a spinal column segment for the repair of injured or diseased vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and other elements of the spinal column. There remains a need for stabilization systems that are adaptable for various stabilization requirements in a single spinal procedure. 
SUMMARY 
 According to one aspect, a multi-level, multi-functional spinal stabilization system is provided that includes a construct positionable along at least first and second levels of a spinal column. The construct including a motion preserving portion and a motion preventing portion. 
 In one form, a system is provided where the motion preserving portion includes a first flexible, elongate body flexibly linked with a second substantially rigid, elongate body of the motion preventing portion. The first body includes a length sized to extend between anchors engaged to first and second vertebrae of the first vertebral level, and the second body includes a length sized to extend between anchors engaged to the second vertebra and a third vertebra of the second vertebral level with the first and second bodies in end-to-end engagement with one another. 
 According to another aspect, a multi-level, multi-functional spinal stabilization system includes a first elongate body having a length sized for positioning between first and second vertebrae of a first vertebral level. The first body is flexible to permit motion of the first vertebral level. A second elongate body includes a length sized for positioning between the second vertebra and a third vertebrae of a second vertebral level adjacent the first vertebral level. The second elongate body is rigid to substantially prevent motion of the second vertebral level. A linking member extends between and flexibly links the first and second bodies with one another in end-to-end engagement. 
 According to a further aspect, a method for stabilizing at least two levels of a spinal column segment comprises: coupling a first elongate body to a second elongate body with a linking member extending between the first and second bodies; engaging the first elongate body between first and second vertebrae of a first vertebral level, said first body being flexible to permit motion of the first vertebral level; and engaging the second elongate body the second vertebra and a third vertebra of a second vertebral level adjacent the first vertebral level, said second elongate body being rigid to substantially prevent motion of the second vertebral level.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS 
 For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices, and any such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. 
 Multi-level and multi-functional stabilization systems are provided for attachment to a spinal column segment. The systems include one or more stabilization constructs positionable along the at least two levels of the spinal column and engageable thereto to provide multi-functional stabilization. The stabilization construct includes a motion preventing segment engageable along at least one level of the spinal column to effectively immobilize the at least one level and a motion preserving segment engageable along at least one level of the spinal column adjacent the at least one immobilized level to provide dynamic stabilization. 
 The system can be engaged posteriorly, anteriorly, antero-laterally, laterally, or in any other position to the spinal column segment. Combinations of approaches and stabilization are also contemplated such as, for example, anterior and posterior stabilization construct. The systems can employed with fusion of one or more vertebral levels with bone graft alone or in combination with one or more fusion devices in a disc space between vertebrae. Furthermore, the systems can be employed with artificial discs or motion preserving devices in one or more vertebral levels either alone or in combination with fusion of one or more other vertebral levels. The fusion devices and artificial discs can be positioned through the same approach or through differing approaches than that taken for placement of the stabilization system. 
 Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown one embodiment multi-level multi-functional stabilization system 20 secured to a spinal column segment 10. System 20 includes first and second stabilization constructs 22a, 22b engaged along opposite sides of the spinal column segment 10. Other embodiments contemplate systems employing one construct or more than two constructs. Constructs 22a and 22b are collectively and individually referred to as construct 22 herein. 
 Construct 22 is adapted to extend along at least two vertebral levels. A first vertebral level 11 includes a first vertebra 12, an intermediate vertebra 14 and a disc space 13 therebetween. The second vertebral level 17 includes intermediate vertebra 14 and a second vertebra 16 with a disc space 15 therebetween. A first construct segment 24 extends the first vertebral level 11, and a second construct segment 26 extends along second vertebral level 17. Other embodiments contemplate that either or both of first and second segments 24, 26 extend along multiple vertebral levels. It is further contemplated that the first vertebral level 11 can be located cephaladly or caudally of second vertebral level 17. 
 In one form, the multi-level multi-functional construct 22 includes a motion preserving portion defined by first construct segment 24 and a fixation portion defined by second construct segment 26. The motion preserving portion at least partially maintains the movement capability of first vertebral level 11 while the fixation portion substantially prevents movement of at least a portion of second vertebral level 17. In one procedure, one or more implant I can be positioned in disc space 15 of second vertebral level 17. Implants I can be fusion devices designed to promote or facilitate bony fusion between vertebrae 14, 16 while second construct segment 26 prevents or resists relative movement between vertebrae 14, 16 to facilitate bone growth and formation of bony continuity between vertebra 14, 16. First construct segment 24 simultaneously provides dynamic stabilization of first vertebral level 11, preserving at least partially the motion capabilities of first vertebral level 11 while sharing load carrying to the anchors of the system 20. Construct segment 24 can provide treatment, revision or prevent degeneration of one or more vertebral levels adjacent one or more vertebral levels to be fused. 
 As further shown in FIG. 2, system 20 includes a number of anchors 30 engageable to vertebrae along the spinal column segment to couple construct segments 24, 26 to the vertebra.
