<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present disclosure generally relates to surgical instruments for performing laparoscopic and endoscopic surgical procedures, and, more particularly, relates to a transparent access apparatus incorporating a retention mechanism for securing the apparatus within an incision in a patient's body. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> In laparoscopic and endoscopic surgical procedures, a small incision or puncture is made in the patient's body to provide access for a tube or a cannula device which is inserted into the patient's body to permit viewing of the surgical site, and/or, the insertion of instruments used in performing the surgical procedure. Typically, a trocar assembly, having an obturator with a sharpened tip and a cannula, is used. The obturator is assembled with the cannula and the obturator is used to penetrate the body wall and create the path to the surgical site. When the obturator is removed, the cannula remains in place to maintain access to the surgical site. Several incisions may be made to provide numerous access ports to the surgical objective. Once the cannulas are in place, various surgical instruments such as scissors, dissectors, retractors or the like, may be inserted by a surgeon to perform the surgery. Typically, an endoscope is used to view the area directly, and may incorporate a miniature camera to display the surgical site on a video monitor in the operating room. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> In order to maintain the cannula within the incision, it has been known to provide various mechanisms such as external sleeves, expandable members, etc. which engage the tissue surrounding the incision to prevent undesired removal of the cannula. However, such known mechanisms are generally complex in nature. Moreover, these mechanisms often are potentially invasive to the surrounding tissue thereby increasing the likelihood of undesired tissue tear which consequently increases patient trauma and recovery time. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Accordingly, a surgical access apparatus of the present disclosure includes an access member dimensioned for positioning within body tissue. The access member includes an outer wall defining a longitudinal opening along a longitudinal axis of the access member. The outer wall includes at least one locking element projecting radially outwardly from the outer wall. The at least one locking element defines first, second and third surfaces. The first surface is a leading surface and is arranged at a leading angle relative to the longitudinal axis to permit insertion of the access member in the body tissue. The second surface extends from the first surface. The third surface extends from the second surface and is a trailing surface arranged at a trailing angle relative to the longitudinal axis to resist removal of the access member from the body tissue. Preferably, the outer wall of the access member is transparent. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In one preferred embodiment, the outer wall includes a plurality of locking elements. Adjacent locking elements may be longitudinally spaced relative to the longitudinal axis. The leading angle of the first surface may range from about 5&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis, more preferably, about 14&#xb0; to about 16&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis. The trailing angle is substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The access member may include a beveled leading end. The beveled leading end may include first and second intersecting surfaces. The first and second intersecting surfaces preferably intersect along a median bisecting plane of the access member. Alternatively, the beveled leading end may have an arcuate characteristic. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In another embodiment, a surgical access instrument includes an access member dimensioned for positioning within body tissue and defining a longitudinal axis. The access member has leading and trailing ends. The leading end includes first and second intersecting surfaces arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis at first and second oblique angles. The first and second intersecting surfaces of the leading end intersect along a median bisecting plane of the access member. The first surface of the leading end defines an angle ranging from about 35&#xb0; to about 75&#xb0;, preferably, about 55&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis, and the second surface of the leading end defines an angle ranging from about 25&#xb0; to about 65&#xb0;, preferably about 45&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The access member includes an outer wall defining a longitudinal opening extending along the longitudinal axis. The outer wall includes at least one locking element projecting radially outwardly from the outer wall. The at least one locking element defines first, second and third surfaces. The first surface is a leading surface and is arranged at a leading angle relative to the longitudinal axis to permit insertion of the access member in the body tissue. The second surface extends from the first surface. The third surface extends from the second surface and is a trailing surface arranged at a trailing angle relative to the longitudinal axis to resist removal of the access member from the body tissue. The outer wall may include a plurality of locking projections. Preferably, adjacent locking projections are longitudinally spaced relative to the longitudinal axis.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> The present disclosure is particularly suited for use with surgical access devices including cannulas, catheters, endoscopic tubes, sheaths or the like. Such access devices are typically utilized in conjunction with a surgical procedure for introducing/withdrawing fluids or to permit insertion of instrumentation required to satisfactorily perform the surgical procedure. The following description of the present invention will be focused on its use with a surgical trocar or cannula assembly; however, it is appreciated that the present invention has application in any of the surgical access devices of the type listed hereinabove. In addition, the present disclosure may also be adapted to provide access for a physician's arm or hand during a hand-assisted laparoscopic procedure. In this application, the hand access device is introduced within the body to provide access to underlying tissue in, e.g., the abdominal cavity. Thereafter, the physician's arm and/or hand are introduced through the access device to assist in performing the desired procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> In the following description, as is traditional, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to the portion of the instrument closest to the operator while the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to the portion of the instrument remote from the operator. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numerals identify identical or substantially similar parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a surgical trocar assembly <b>10</b> which incorporates the principles of the present disclosure. One suitable trocar assembly is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,710 to Moll, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Generally, trocar assembly <b>10</b> includes cannula <b>100</b> and obturator <b>1000</b> which is positionable within the cannula <b>100</b>. Obturator <b>1000</b> includes an obturator housing <b>1002</b> and an obturator portion <b>1004</b> extending from the obturator housing <b>1002</b>. Obturator portion <b>1004</b> has pointed or penetrating obturator tip <b>1006</b> for penetrating tissue. Obturator tip <b>1006</b> may be pyramidal in configuration defining sharpened edges along the lines of intersection of the pyramidal blade. Alternatively, obturator tip <b>1006</b> may incorporate a flat or planar blade. It is further envisioned that obturator tip <b>1006</b> may be blunt, conical, or have another shape. Obturator <b>1000</b> is utilized to penetrate the abdominal wall to introduce cannula <b>100</b> through the abdominal wall, and then subsequently is removed from the cannula <b>100</b> to permit introduction of the surgical instrumentation utilized to perform the procedure through the passageway. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, cannula <b>100</b> includes cannula housing <b>102</b> and cannula sleeve <b>104</b> connected to the housing <b>102</b> and extending distally therefrom. Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> may be connected to cannula housing <b>102</b> through any conventional means including cements, adhesives, bayonet coupling, tongue and groove arrangements, etc. In a preferred embodiment, cannula sleeve incorporates flange <b>106</b> which is mounted to corresponding structure of cannula housing <b>102</b> by any of the aforementioned conventional means. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> defines a longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d; extending along the length of the cannula sleeve <b>104</b>. Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> has proximal or trailing end portion <b>108</b> and distal or leading end portion <b>110</b>. Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> includes outer wall <b>112</b> which defines internal longitudinal passage <b>114</b>. Longitudinal passage <b>114</b> is dimensioned to permit passage of surgical instrumentation. Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> may be formed of stainless steel or other rigid materials such as a polymeric material or the like and is desirably a medical grade material. Cannula sleeve <b>104</b> may be transparent, translucent or opaque, or may have different portions of different opacity or translucence. In a preferred embodiment, cannula sleeve <b>104</b> is transparent to permit viewing through outer wall <b>112</b> and into longitudinal passage <b>114</b>. The diameter of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> may vary, but, typically ranges from about 4.5 to about 15 mm. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> As best depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, outer wall <b>112</b> of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> includes a plurality of spaced locking elements or projections <b>116</b> extending radially outwardly from the outer wall <b>112</b>. Locking elements <b>116</b> are integrally formed with outer wall <b>112</b>, and, preferably, monolithically formed during manufacture, e.g., an injection molding process, to define an annular or ring like shaped elements as shown. Locking elements <b>116</b> preferably extend about the entire circumference of outer wall <b>112</b>. It is appreciated, however, that locking elements <b>116</b> may extend about only a peripheral portion of outer wall <b>112</b>. Locking elements <b>116</b> are preferably spaced along the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d; of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> with adjacent elements <b>116</b> being spaced by a distance &#x201c;t&#x201d;. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Each locking element <b>116</b> defines three contiguous surfaces, namely, first or leading surface <b>118</b>, second surface <b>120</b> extending from the first surface <b>118</b> and third or trailing surface <b>122</b> which extends from the second surface <b>120</b>. First surface <b>118</b> is arranged at an angle &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; relative to longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Angle &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; is preferably sufficiently oblique to permit and/or facilitate passage of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> through tissue. In a preferred embodiment, angle &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; extends at an angle ranging from about 5&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0; relative to longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d; and, more preferably, about 14&#xb0; to about 16&#xb0;. First surface <b>118</b> may define a longitudinal length &#x201c;m&#x201d; which ranges from about 0.025 inches to about 0.075 inches and, preferably, about 0.050 inches. Second surface <b>120</b> is preferably substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d; of cannula sleeve <b>104</b>. However, it is envisioned that second surface <b>120</b> may be slightly oblique with respect to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Second surface <b>120</b> defines a longitudinal length &#x201c;b&#x201d; varying from about 0.025 inches to about 0.075 inches and, more preferably, about 0.050 inches. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Third surface <b>122</b> is also arranged at an angle relative to longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Preferably, third surface <b>122</b> is transverse or arranged at about a 90&#xb0; angle relative to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. It is envisioned that third surface <b>122</b> also may be obliquely arranged relative to the axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Third surface <b>122</b> is particularly configured to resist the tendency of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> to move in a withdrawal or proximal direction thus facilitating retention of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> within the tissue. Moreover, third surface <b>122</b> is configured to engage the tissue in a manner to prevent &#x201c;retropulsion&#x201d; of sleeve <b>104</b> relative to tissue. Third surface <b>122</b> defines a height &#x201c;k&#x201d; ranging from about 0.01 inches to about 0.04 inches and, preferably, about 0.025 inches. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> As previously discussed, locking elements <b>116</b> are spaced along the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Preferably, adjacent locking projections <b>116</b> are spaced a longitudinal distance &#x201c;t&#x201d; which is sufficient to accommodate at least some of the tissue portions displaced by the projecting structure of the locking elements <b>116</b>. In a preferred embodiment, distance &#x201c;t&#x201d; ranges from about 0.025 inches to about 0.075 inches and, more preferably, about 0.050 inches. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The above noted dimensions for cannula sleeve <b>104</b> including dimensions &#x201c;t&#x201d;, &#x201c;m&#x201d;, &#x201c;b&#x201d;, and &#x201c;k&#x201d; are for a 12 millimeter (mm) cannula sleeve. Other dimensions are also contemplated. Further embodiments comprise 5-10 mm cannula sleeves, as well as other sizes. It is also envisioned that other dimensions may be applicable for sleeves of other sizes. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The plurality of locking elements <b>116</b> encompass from about 50% to about 95% of the overall longitudinal length of cannula sleeve <b>104</b>. Preferably, locking elements <b>116</b> encompass at least 80% of the longitudinal length of cannula sleeve <b>104</b>. In this manner, cannula sleeve <b>104</b> may be introduced relative to the tissue at various relative locations while ensuring that a sufficient number of locking elements <b>116</b> are in contact with the tissue to prevent retropulsion of the cannula sleeve <b>104</b>. Locking elements <b>116</b> do not extend to flange <b>106</b> but are spaced from the flange <b>106</b> and cannula housing <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the leading or distal end portion <b>110</b> of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> will be discussed. Leading end portion <b>110</b> preferably defines beveled leading end <b>124</b>. Beveled leading end <b>124</b> preferably incorporates first and second end surfaces <b>126</b>,<b>128</b> which intersect along a median plane &#x201c;c&#x201d; bisecting cannula sleeve <b>104</b> and extending along and coincident with longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. First end surface <b>126</b> is preferably arranged at an angle &#x201c;&#x3b8;&#x201d; ranging from about 35&#xb0; to about 75&#xb0;, and, more preferably, about 55&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. Second end surface <b>128</b> is preferably arranged at an angle &#x201c;T&#x201d; ranging from about 25&#xb0; to about 65&#xb0;, and more preferably, about 45&#xb0; relative to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d;. First and second surfaces <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> may be straight or curved or a combination thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> First and second intersecting surfaces <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> provide a generally curved and/or beveled characteristic to leading end <b>124</b>. This arrangement provides advantages with respect to introduction of cannula sleeve <b>104</b>, e.g., including a reduction in the insertion force into tissue when the assembled surgical trocar assembly is inserted into tissue. For example, the beveled characteristic reduces the profile of the distal end of cannula sleeve <b>104</b> to facilitate initial entry into, and passage through, the tissue. It is also envisioned that leading end <b>124</b> may encompass a single linear surface arranged at a desired angle &#x201c;&#x3b4;&#x201d; relative to the longitudinal axis &#x201c;j&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternatively, leading end <b>124</b> may be arcuate in nature having a predetermined radius of curvature. As a further alternative, leading end <b>124</b> may include a compound curve surface incorporating at least two radii of curvature. Other arrangements are also envisioned. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Outer wall <b>112</b> may also incorporate an aperture <b>130</b> spaced from leading end <b>124</b> and extending completely through the outer wall <b>112</b>. Aperture <b>130</b> permits insufflation gases to exit outer wall <b>112</b> and enter the body cavity to maintain or sustain the insufflated state of the body cavity. In addition, aperture <b>130</b> prevents the formation of a vacuum upon withdrawal of the obturator or an instrument from the cannula sleeve. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, trocar assembly <b>10</b> may also include a seal assembly <b>2000</b> which is preferably releasably mounted to cannula housing <b>1002</b>. Means for releasably connected seal assembly <b>2000</b> to cannula housing <b>1002</b> may include a bayonet coupling, friction fit, tongue and groove arrangements, snap-fit, etc. Seal assembly <b>2000</b> includes seal housing <b>2002</b> and an internal seal which is adapted to form a fluid tight seal about an instrument inserted through the seal assembly <b>2000</b>. One suitable seal may be the fabric seal disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,702,787, filed Jun. 6, 2002, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The seal disclosed in certain embodiments of the '787 patent is a flat septum seal having a first layer of resilient material and a second fabric layer juxtaposed relative to the first layer. Further details of the seal may be ascertained by reference to the '787 patent. Seal assembly <b>2000</b> may or may not be a component of cannula assembly <b>1000</b>. Seal assembly <b>2000</b> or cannula housing <b>102</b> may also incorporate a zero closure valve. The preferred zero closure valve is adapted to open to permit passage of surgical instrumentation and close in the absence of the instrument to prevent escape of the insufflation gases when cannula <b>100</b> is not being utilized. For example, the zero closure valve may comprise a flapper valve or duckbill seal. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In use of trocar assembly <b>10</b>, the abdominal cavity is insufflated. Thereafter, the assembled trocar assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is applied to the abdomen whereby obturator tip <b>1006</b> of obturator <b>1000</b> penetrates the abdomen and peritoneal membrane, and enters the peritoneal cavity. Obturator <b>1000</b> is removed from cannula <b>100</b>. Cannula <b>100</b> provides access to the tissue and/or organs within the peritioned cavity for the introduction of instrumentation and/or a laparoscope. By virtue of locking elements <b>106</b>, cannula sleeve <b>104</b> is retained within the tissue in the aforedescribed manner. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> While the invention has been particularly shown, and described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, modifications such as those suggested above, but not limited thereto, are to be considered within the scope of the invention. </p>
