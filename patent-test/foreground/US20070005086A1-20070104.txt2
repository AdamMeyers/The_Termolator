BACKGROUND 
 1. Technical field 
 The present disclosure relates to an adjustable trocar washer for use with a cannula or trocar assembly. More particularly, the present disclosure relates, to an adjustable trocar washer having a compressable collar for securing about a cannula and a skirt for sealing an external surface of an abdominal incision. 
 2. Background Of Related Art 
 During laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures it is necessary to provide sealed access ports into the body cavity. These devices are known as trocars or cannulas. A typical cannula includes an elongate tubular member for providing access into the body cavity through an abdominal incision and a cannula housing having a valve member to seal the elongate tubular member. In order to prevent inadvertent removal or insertion of the elongate tubular member through an abdominal incision, an anchor member is typically provided at a distal end of the elongate tubular member to seal it against an inner surface of the abdominal incision. A securing mechanism is often provided and is movably mounted along the elongate tubular member to seal against an outer surface of the abdominal incision. 
 One known type of cannula includes a compressible foam collar which is slidably mounted along the elongate tubular member to seal against the outer surface of the abdominal incision. However, the compressible foam collar provides limited vertical stability to the cannula relative to the abdominal wall. Therefore, it is desirable to have a securing mechanism which can seal the outer surface of an abominable incision and also provide substantial vertical stability to the cannula.

Alternatively, compressible collar 30 may be provided with an enlarged flange at distal end 54 which is configured to be attached to skirt 32. In further embodiments, the collar 30 and skirt 32 are integrally formed. 
 Referring now to FIG. 6, cannula housing 14 is provided with a valve assembly 60 to prevent escape of insufflation gases after obturator assembly 12 has been removed. As shown, obturator 28 includes an elongate obturator shaft 62 extending from obturator housing 26. An obturator distal tip 64 is provided at a distal end of obturator shaft 62. Insufflation port 24 is in direct communication with the interior surface of the elongate tubular member 16 to provide insufflation fluids directly into the body. Similarly, anchor inflation port 22 is in fluid communication with anchor member 18 through an inflation channel (not shown) provided in a wall of the elongate tubular member 16. As noted hereinabove, latches 38 are provided to secure obturator housing 26 to cannula housing 14. 
 Referring now to FIG. 7, the use of the disclosed surgical instrument to provide an access port into an abdominal cavity will now be described. Initially, an incision is made in the abdominal wall. The surgical instrument, with cannula assembly 10 attached to obturator assembly 12, is advanced through the incision until anchor member 18 is located within an internal cavity of the abdominal wall. Thereafter, inflation fluid is provided to inflation port 24 to inflate anchor member 18. Once anchor member 18 has been inflated, the surgical instrument can be drawn proximally to cause inflated anchor member 18 to abut an inner surface of the abdominal wall. Thereafter, trocar washer 20 is slid distally along elongate tubular member 16 until skirt 32 engages the outer surface of the abdominal wall (AW). Once the proper pressure of skirt 32 against abdominal wall (AW) has been achieved, latch member 46 can be pivoted to engage the appropriate latch opening 38 formed in latch member 46 with post 44. 
 Once the abdominal wall has been secured between anchor balloon 18 and trocar washer 20, obturator assembly 12 can be removed by depressing latches 38 and drawing obturator assembly 12 proximally out of cannula assembly 10. At this point, insufflation fluids can be provided to insufflation port 24 to inflate the cavity within the abdominal wall. The valve assembly 60 provided within cannula housing 14 prevents any escape of insufflation gases and allows for insertion of surgical instruments through cannula assembly 10. 
 Once the surgical procedure has been completed, the surgical instrument can be withdrawn through cannula assembly 10 and cannula assembly 10 can be removed through the abdominal incision. First, insufflation gasses are released from the body cavity through insufflation port 24. Then anchor member 18 is deflated by removing the inflation fluid from anchor member 18 through inflation port 22. The cannula assembly6 10 is removed from the incision after the anchor balloon 18 is deflated. 
 It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, the skirt may be formed of a material which has a medium degree of flexibility such that these skirt provides a vertical support to a the cannula assembly and thus stabilizing the cannula assembly against falling over against the abdominal wall during surgical procedures. Further, alternative latch mechanisms may be provided to secure the compressible collar against the elongate tubular member. Additionally, the disclosed adjustable trocar washer can be used with other devices then a cannula is, such as, for example, a catheter, to secure a tubular member against an outer surface of a patient's skin. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto.
