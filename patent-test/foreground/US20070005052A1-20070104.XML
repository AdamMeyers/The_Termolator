<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> a. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The instant invention is directed toward hydrogel electrode catheters for treatment and diagnosis of tissue. More specifically, the instant invention relates to treatment and diagnostic catheters with hydrogel virtual and sensing electrodes. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> b. Background Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Catheters have been in use for medical procedures for many years. Catheters can be used for medical procedures to examine, diagnose, and treat tissue while positioned at a specific location within the body that is otherwise inaccessible without more invasive procedures (e.g., medical procedures involving the human heart). During these procedures a catheter is inserted into a vessel located near the surface of a human body (e.g., an artery or vein in the leg, neck, or arm of the patient) and is guided or threaded through the vessels, sometimes with the aid of a guidewire or introducer, to a specific location within the body for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. For example, one procedure often referred to as &#x201c;ablation&#x201d; utilizes a catheter to convey energy (e.g., electrical or thermal) or a chemical to a selected location within the human body to create necrosis, which cuts off the path for stray or improper electrical signals. Another procedure often referred to as &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; utilizes a catheter with one or more sensing electrodes to monitor various forms of electrical activity in the human body. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> It is well known that benefits may be gained by forming lesions in tissue during catheter ablation if the depth and location of the lesions being formed can be controlled. In particular, it can be desirable to elevate tissue temperature to around 50&#xb0; C. until lesions are formed via coagulation necrosis, which changes the electrical properties of the tissue. When sufficiently deep lesions are formed at specific locations in cardiac tissue via coagulation necrosis, undesirable atrial fibrillations may be lessened or eliminated. &#x201c;Sufficiently deep&#x201d; lesions means transmural lesions in some cardiac applications. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Several difficulties may be encountered, however, when attempting to form adequately-deep lesions at specific locations using some existing ablation electrodes. For example, when forming lesions with radiofrequency (RF) energy, high temperature gradients are often encountered in the vicinity of the electrode. At the edges of some existing electrodes are regions of very high current density, leading to large temperature gradients and hot spots. These &#x201c;edge effects&#x201d; may result in the formation of undesirable coagulum and charring of the surface tissue. For example, undesirable coagulum may begin to form when blood reaches around 80&#xb0; C. for an appreciable length of time, and undesirable tissue charring and desiccation may be seen when tissue reaches around 100&#xb0; C. for an appreciable length of time. There are two main types of undesirable coagulum: coagulum that adheres to and damages the medical device; and coagulum blood clots or curds that may enter a patient's bloodstream, possibly resulting in other health problems for the patient. Charring of the surface tissue may also have deleterious effects on a patient. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> During RF ablation, as the temperature of the electrode is increased, the contact time required to form an adequately-deep lesion decreases, but the likelihood of charring surface tissue and forming undesirable coagulum increases. As the temperature of the electrode is decreased, the contact time required to form an adequately-deep lesion increases, but the likelihood of charring surface tissue and forming undesirable coagulum decreases. It is, therefore, a balancing act trying to ensure that tissue temperatures are adequately high for long enough to create deep lesions, while still preventing or minimizing coagulum formation and/or charring of the surface tissue. Active temperature control may help, but the placement of thermocouples, for example, is tricky and setting the RF generator for a certain temperature becomes an empirical exercise as actual tissue temperatures are generally different from those recorded next to the electrode due to factors such as convection and catheter design. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Conventional mapping catheters may include, for example, a plurality of adjacent ring electrodes constructed from platinum or some other metal. Since mapping catheters are desirably disposable, incorporation of relatively expensive platinum electrodes may be disadvantageous. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another difficulty encountered with existing ablation catheters and mapping catheters is how to ensure adequate tissue contact. For example, current techniques for creating linear lesions (the term &#x201c;linear lesion&#x201d; as used herein means an elongated, continuous or uninterrupted lesion, whether straight or curved and whether comprising a single line of ablation or a series of connected points or lines of ablation forming a track, that blocks electrical conduction) in endocardial applications may include dragging a conventional catheter on the tissue, using an array electrode, or using pre-formed electrodes. All of these devices comprise rigid electrodes that do not always conform to the tissue surface, especially when sharp gradients and undulations are present, such as at the ostium of the pulmonary vein in the left atrium and the isthmus of the right atrium. Consequently, continuous linear lesions are difficult to achieve. Whether forming lesions or mapping in a heart, the beating of the heart, especially if erratic or irregular, further complicates matters, making it difficult to keep adequate contact between electrodes and tissue for a sufficient length of time. For example, with a rigid electrode, it can be quite difficult to maintain sufficient contact pressure during lesion formation until an adequate lesion has been formed. These problems are exacerbated on contoured or trabeculated surfaces. If the contact between electrodes and tissue cannot be properly maintained, quality lesions or accurate mapping are unlikely to result. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> Catheters based upon a virtual electrode that deliver RF energy via conductive fluid flowing into the patient's body address some of the difficulties with ablation catheters, but these ablation catheters often require high flow rates of the conductive fluid (e.g., typically around 70 milliliters per minute) to maintain effective cooling for high-power RF applications. The introduction of a large amount of conductive fluid into a patient's bloodstream may have detrimental effects on the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Thus, there remains a need for ablation catheters and mapping catheters that address these issues with the existing designs. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Accordingly, it is an object of the disclosed invention to provide improved treatment and diagnostic catheters. </p>

In this form, the catheter includes a distal portion that comprises a straight active region, the straight active region extending parallel to a catheter longitudinal axis; and a hydrogel delivery feature along the straight active region, the hydrogel delivery feature being adapted to be placed against the tissue to be treated. The straight active region defines an outer peripheral wall, wherein the outer peripheral wall defines an outwardly-facing surface, wherein the hydrogel delivery feature is on the outwardly-facing surface. The hydrogel delivery feature comprises at least one opening extending through the outer peripheral wall and its outwardly-facing surface. The at least one opening may comprise, for example, a single row of hydrogel portholes, a plurality of rows of hydrogel portholes radially, a single hydrogel slot, or a plurality of hydrogel slots.

This protuberance may take the shape of a hemisphere, a knob, a flattened gob, a hook, or a hoop. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In another form, the present invention comprises a drug delivery catheter for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In this embodiment, the catheter comprising a distal portion having an active region; a lumen extending inside the catheter adjacent to the active region; and a hydrogel delivery feature along the active region and in fluid communication with the lumen, wherein the hydrogel delivery feature is adapted to be placed against arrhythmia-producing, cardiac tissue inside of a heart.

The hydrogel delivery feature may comprise, for example, a plurality of hydrogel portholes; and a permeable membrane attached at the plurality of hydrogel portholes and adapted to be alternatingly extendable out of and retractable back into the plurality of hydrogel portholes, wherein the membrane is adapted to contain the conductive hydrogel matrix, wherein the membrane is adapted to make contact with the cardiac tissue, and wherein the membrane is adapted to be traversable by the drug formulation. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> In still another form, the present invention comprises a drug delivery system for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The system comprises a catheter having a distal portion. The distal portion of the catheter comprises an active region; a lumen extending adjacent to the active region, the lumen being adapted to contain a conductive hydrogel matrix loaded with, for example, a water-soluble and ionic dispensable drug formulation; and a hydrogel delivery feature. The hydrogel delivery feature comprises an opening through the active region, the opening being in fluid communication with the lumen and being adapted to be placed against arrhythmia-producing, cardiac tissue; and a permeable membrane attached at the opening and adapted to be alternatingly extendable out of and retractable back into the opening, wherein the membrane is adapted to contain the conductive hydrogel matrix, wherein the membrane is adapted to make contact with the cardiac tissue, and wherein the membrane is adapted to be traversable by the ionic dispensable drug formulation. In this embodiment, the system also comprises a current supply adapted to deliver low-intensity direct current to the conductive hydrogel matrix. The opening through the sidewall of the catheter may comprise, for example, at least one hydrogel porthole or at least one hydrogel slot. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> In another form, the present invention comprises a diagnostic catheter for diagnosing cardiac tissue, the catheter comprising at least one conductive hydrogel sensing electrode. The at least one conductive hydrogel sensing electrode may comprise a plurality of isolated, conductive hydrogel disks that are electrically separated by nonconductive hydrogel disks. These conductive and nonconductive hydrogel disks may be constructed from, for example, high-viscosity, rigid hydrogel that is substantially unaffected by moisture. The conductive hydrogel disks may be adhered to the nonconductive hydrogel disks. In this embodiment, each of the plurality of conductive hydrogel disks is electrically connected with a separate electrical lead (e.g., a silver or silver-chloride coated wire) for transmitting electrical signals from the treatment site to instrumentation outside of a patient's body. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> In yet another form, the present invention comprises a method of treating cardiac tissue. The method comprises the steps of guiding an ablation catheter having at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode to the cardiac tissue to be treated; introducing the at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode against the cardiac tissue; and directing ablative energy to the cardiac tissue via the at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> In still another form, the present invention comprises a method of treating cardiac tissue, the method comprising the steps of filling at least a distal portion of a catheter lumen with conductive hydrogel, the catheter lumen extending adjacent to a catheter active region on a catheter outer surface; guiding the catheter active region into contact with the cardiac tissue to be treated; activating a hydrogel displacement device to advance the conductive hydrogel toward the active region until the conductive hydrogel broaches the catheter outer surface to thereby introduce at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode against the cardiac tissue; directing ablative energy through the at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode and into the cardiac tissue; and activating the hydrogel displacement device to retract the conductive hydrogel and thus the at least one conductive hydrogel virtual electrode from contact with the cardiac tissue and back into the catheter lumen. </p>

In all of the embodiments depicted and described herein, the hydrogel does not enter a patient's bloodstream in any appreciable amounts. The portholes, slots, and openings depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-21</figref> are adapted to allow the hydrogel to be alternatingly forced from and retracted back into the catheter using a hydrogel displacement device such as a plunger, a pump, or a syringe, none of which are shown in the drawings. For example, a screw-, gear-, or piston-pump may be used to move the hydrogel under whatever pressure is required (e.g., 500 psi). </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a fragmentary, isometric view of the distal portion <b>101</b> of an ablation catheter according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the distal portion <b>10</b>&#x2032; of the ablation catheter comprises a straight section <b>12</b> and a curved or hoop-shaped section <b>14</b> that are joined at a bend or offset <b>16</b>. A longitudinal axis <b>18</b> extends through both the straight section <b>12</b> and the curved section <b>14</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;longitudinal axis&#x201d; refers to the longitudinal axis extending through the straight section <b>12</b> and through the curved section <b>14</b> of the ablation catheter, from the proximal end (not shown) of the catheter to the distal end <b>20</b> of the ablation catheter. The curved or hoop-shaped section <b>14</b> is C-shaped as shown, but may define a completely circular configuration rather than the open, C-shape depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bend or offset <b>16</b> may be formed or configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein the offset displaces the straight section <b>12</b> of the catheter to the side, causing the straight section <b>12</b> to meet the curved section <b>14</b> of the catheter along the perimeter of the hoop-shaped curved section <b>14</b> (i.e., substantially perpendicularly to the plane containing the C-shaped curved section <b>14</b> and along the imaginary cylindrical surface formed by sliding the C-shaped curved section parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>18</b> of the straight section <b>20</b> to create a substantially cylindrical surface). Alternatively, the offset <b>78</b> (e.g., Fogs. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>) may be configured so that the straight section <b>84</b> approaches the plane containing the C-shaped or hoop-shaped curved section <b>78</b> near the center of the &#x201c;C&#x201d; or hoop (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The &#x201c;straight section&#x201d; <b>84</b> of the catheter shaft is &#x201c;straight&#x201d; relative to the C-shaped or hoop-shaped section <b>78</b>, but remains flexible enough to be navigated through a patient's vasculature to a treatment site (e.g., the ostium <b>22</b> of a pulmonary vein <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The curved section <b>14</b> of the ablation catheter defines a distally-facing surface <b>26</b>.

In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distally-facing surface <b>26</b> defines a distally-facing radial apex <b>30</b>. The distally-facing radial apex is the most distal surface of the curved section <b>14</b> of the ablation catheter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distally-facing radial apex <b>30</b> defines a C-shaped line which, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, overlies a porthole centerline <b>32</b> for a plurality of distally-facing hydrogel portholes <b>34</b>. In particular, the ablation catheter depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a hydrogel deployment feature comprising a single row of hydrogel portholes <b>34</b> centered along the porthole centerline <b>32</b> on the radial apex <b>30</b> of the distally-facing surface <b>26</b>.

In the embodiment <b>10</b><sup>II </sup>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hydrogel deployment feature comprises concentric arcs of staggered hydrogel portholes, including a first plurality of hydrogel portholes <b>40</b> along an outer arc and a second plurality of hydrogel portholes <b>42</b> along an inner arc. Thus, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hydrogel deployment feature is again on the distally-facing surface <b>44</b> of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>II </sup>of the ablation catheter. In the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> has been pushed distally in the catheter until it is flush with the outer surface of the curved section where each hydrogel porthole <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> broaches the outer surface of the catheter. Thus, the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b>, if forced distally any further, will protrude from the hydrogel portholes <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>, distally away from the distally-facing surface <b>44</b> of the ablation catheter, as discussed further below. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> The concentric arcs of staggered hydrogel portholes comprise a plurality of hydrogel portholes on alternating sides of a porthole centerline <b>48</b>, thereby forming a zigzagging row of hydrogel portholes <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>.

By staggering the portholes <b>40</b> of the outer arc of hydrogel portholes relative to the portholes <b>42</b> of the inner arc of hydrogel portholes, it is possible to reduce opportunities for gaps to exist in the lesion formed during treatment.

If the tissue <b>28</b> to be treated has a relatively flat surface, ablative energy may be applied to the tissue while the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> is in this flush, non-protruding configuration. As discussed further below, however, if the tissue <b>28</b> to be ablated comprises trabeculations or undulations, the column or segment of conductive hydrogel in the catheter may be forced distally until the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> actually protrudes from the longitudinally-extending hydrogel slot <b>54</b> so that the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> has an opportunity to conform to the trabeculated tissue surface (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>). </p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> are fragmentary views of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>V </sup>of an ablation catheter according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, however, the single row of hydrogel portholes <b>72</b> is present along a porthole centerline <b>74</b> on the radial apex of an outer peripheral wall <b>76</b> of the curved section <b>78</b> rather than being on the radial apex <b>30</b> of the distally-facing surface <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, the ablation catheter depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> comprises an inner peripheral wall <b>80</b> and an outer peripheral wall <b>76</b> on the hoop-shaped or curved section <b>78</b>, and the portholes <b>72</b> extend substantially radially through the outer peripheral wall <b>76</b> of this C-shaped or hoop-shaped curved section <b>78</b> of the ablation catheter. </p>

In particular, the offset <b>82</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> places the straight section <b>84</b> of the catheter shaft so that, if extended distally, the distal end of the straight section <b>84</b> would pass through a plane containing the C-shaped or hoop-shaped curved section <b>78</b> of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>V </sup>of the ablation catheter at nearly the center of the C-shaped or hoop-shaped curved section <b>78</b>. Since the hydrogel portholes <b>72</b> of this embodiment pass through the outer peripheral wall <b>76</b>, this version of the ablation catheter may be inserted inside of a pulmonary vein <b>24</b>, for example, rather than being placed at the ostium <b>22</b> of a pulmonary vein <b>24</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>.

In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the second lumen <b>136</b> is adjacent to an inner peripheral wall <b>156</b> of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>VIII </sup>of the catheter. </p>

This cross-sectional view is similar to the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, but depicts a hydrogel deployment feature comprising a longitudinally-extending hydrogel slot <b>158</b> (compare slot <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and slot <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and a flexible, permeable or semi-permeable membrane <b>88</b> cooperating to deliver the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> to the tissue <b>28</b> being treated. In the particular configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the protruding conductive hydrogel is contained within the flexible, permeable or semi-permeable membrane <b>88</b>; and it is this membrane <b>88</b> that makes contact with the surface <b>142</b> of the tissue <b>28</b> being treated. This membrane may be used, for example, to facilitate hydrogel containment and/or to ensure that the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> protruding from the distal portion of the ablation catheter takes a desired configuration as explained further below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref> are fragmentary, isometric top views of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>X </sup>of an ablation catheter according to a tenth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a fragmentary, top view of the distal portion of the ablation catheter prior to deployment of the conductive hydrogel. In this figure, an opening <b>160</b> is present at the extreme distal end <b>162</b> of the distal portion <b>10</b><sup>X </sup>of the ablation catheter, and the conductive hydrogel remains within the catheter shaft, behind a shaped, containment membrane <b>164</b>. In particular, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> has not yet been forced distally in the catheter shaft to &#x201c;inflate&#x201d; or &#x201c;fill&#x201d; the shaped, containment membrane <b>164</b>. Although the opening <b>160</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref> is shown as circular, the opening may have a shape other than circular, if desired. The opening <b>160</b> and the containment membrane <b>164</b> together comprise the hydrogel deployment feature in the tenth embodiment. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17, 18</figref>, and <b>19</b> are fragmentary, top views of the distal portion of an ablation catheter according to a first variant <b>10</b><sup>Xa</sup>, a second variant <b>10</b><sup>Xb</sup>, and a third variant <b>10</b><sup>Xc</sup>, respectively, of the tenth embodiment of the present invention. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which depicts the first variant <b>10</b><sup>Xa </sup>of the tenth embodiment, the conductive hydrogel has been forced longitudinally, distally (i.e., in the direction of arrow <b>166</b>) within the catheter shaft and has now filled the shaped, containment membrane <b>168</b>. In this variant, the filled membrane <b>168</b> forms a protuberance having a hemispherical configuration. With the conductive hydrogel <b>46</b> thus deployed in the containment membrane <b>168</b> of this configuration, the distal tip of the ablation catheter may be used to make point or spot ablations <b>170</b> or drag burns. In the second variant <b>10</b><sup>Xb</sup>, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the shaped, containment membrane <b>172</b> has a deployed shape that is slightly different from the deployed shape of the containment membrane <b>168</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In particular, in the variant <b>10</b><sup>Xb </sup>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the filled containment membrane <b>172</b> forms a knoblike protuberance that bulges slightly more adjacent to the surface <b>142</b> of the tissue <b>28</b> than does the hemispherical protuberance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Thus, the ablation catheter with the containment membrane <b>172</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> may be used to make somewhat larger point or spot ablations <b>170</b>&#x2032; than the catheter having the containment membrane of <b>168</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the containment membrane <b>174</b> has yet another deployed configuration. In this third variant <b>10</b><sup>Xc </sup>of the tenth embodiment of the present invention, the filled containment membrane <b>174</b> forms a protuberance at the distal end <b>162</b> of the ablation catheter in the shape of a flattened gob that contacts more of the surface <b>142</b> of the tissue <b>28</b> than is contacted using the membrane shapes <b>168</b>, <b>172</b> respectively depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. In all of the variants <b>10</b><sup>Xa</sup>, <b>10</b><sup>Xb</sup>, <b>10</b><sup>Xc </sup>of the tenth embodiment, the protuberance created by the filled containment membrane forms a &#x201c;conformable surface&#x201d; that contacts the surface <b>142</b> of the tissue <b>28</b> to be treated. By adjusting the specific configuration of the shaped, containment membrane, the size and shape of the resulting lesion may be adjusted. The containment membrane also may be hoop-shaped when filled with conductive hydrogel. With such a hoop-shaped or hook-shaped containment membrane, it would be possible to vary the radius of curvature of the resulting, filled, containment membrane by increasing or decreasing the pressure on the hydrogel filling the containment membrane. The ultimate membrane design, configuration, or shape is dictated by the intended ultimate use for the virtual electrode. </p>

In these embodiments, a &#x201c;loaded&#x201d; conductive hydrogel matrix <b>178</b> is depicted in the first lumen <b>134</b> at the distal portion of the catheter. In particular, a dispensable drug formulation or other beneficial, chemotherapeutic agent <b>180</b> is &#x201c;loaded into&#x201d; the hydrogel <b>178</b> for delivery to the tissue <b>28</b>. The dispensable drug or other beneficial agent <b>180</b> loaded into the hydrogel <b>178</b> may be water soluble and ionic (either positive or negative). For example, ionic botox or ionic paxitaxol may be loaded into the hydrogel <b>178</b>. The dispensable drug or other beneficial agent may be used for the treatment of, for example, cardiac arrhythmias. These catheters may, for example, deliver drugs directly to an area of the heart that is producing arrhythmias to control or eliminate those arrhythmias. The delivered substance may cause a linear lesion or a spot lesion similar to the lesions that are caused by the ablative energy (e.g., RF energy) in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-19</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In the hydrogel drug delivery catheters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the hydrogel deployment feature comprises a permeable or semi-permeable membrane <b>88</b> to contain the loaded conductive hydrogel matrix <b>178</b> and to thereby minimize the amount of hydrogel <b>178</b> potentially entering the patient's bloodstream. Although this membrane is not required, when the membrane is present, the dispensable drug or other beneficial agent <b>180</b> permeates the membrane, whereas the hydrogel <b>178</b> remains substantially (if not completely) contained inside of the membrane <b>88</b>. </p>

Rather than delivering, for example, RF energy to the tissue <b>28</b> (see ablative energy lines <b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), direct current emanating from the electrode is delivered to the tissue.

In this manner, the conductive hydrogel disks may be connected to monitoring equipment outside of the patient, and the catheters depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> may be used as diagnostic devices to map the endocardial tissue of the heart at various locations. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a fragmentary, end view (looking distally) of the distal portion <b>182</b><sup>II </sup>of a diagnostic catheter according to a fourteenth embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the distal portion of the catheter comprises a curved or C-shaped section <b>190</b>, and the stacked conductive hydrogel disks <b>184</b>&#x2032; and nonconductive hydrogel disks <b>186</b>&#x2032; are present along an active region of the curved section <b>190</b> of the distal portion <b>182</b><sup>II </sup>of the diagnostic catheter. The distal portion of the catheter need not be C-shaped and may be formed into any desired shape and configured to any desired size required for a particular application. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> The hydrogel diagnostic catheters depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> may include shape memory wires or steering wires like those depicted in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref> to permit a physician to guide and shape the distal portion of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> As previously mentioned, the hydrogel used to form the conductive and nonconductive hydrogel disks depicted in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> is substantially unaffected by moisture. Therefore, these diagnostic catheters can be placed in, for example, the heart for long periods of time without changing shape. Also, the hydrogel matrix is hydrophilic and, therefore, lubricious, making it easy to move through the patient's vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Although several embodiments of this invention have been described above with a certain degree of particularity, those skilled in the art could make numerous alterations to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention. For example, although each of the treatment and diagnostic catheters is depicted in the figures with a circular transverse cross section, the present invention does not require this circular cross section. An important feature in this invention is that hydrogel is used to treat or diagnose tissue. The conductive hydrogel used in the different embodiments described above comprises a desired hydrogel matrix, whether commercially available or specially designed, and includes additives that result in desired electrical and/or chemical properties. For example, the hydrogel matrix may be adjusted to achieve a desired electrical resistance for the conductive hydrogel to minimize, if desired, heating of the hydrogel itself during ablation. In other words, the hydrogel matrix may be adjusted so that most of the ablative energy is delivered to the tissue rather than merely heating up the conductive hydrogel itself. Further, although the devices depicted and described are all uni-polar and, thus, a dispersive electrode (e.g., a grounding pad) may be placed on the patient during use of these devices, certain bi-polar devices that use hydrogel virtual electrodes may also fall within the scope of the present invention. All directional references (e.g., upper, lower, upward, downward, left, right, leftward, rightward, top, bottom, above, below, vertical, horizontal, clockwise, and counterclockwise) are only used for identification purposes to aid the reader's understanding of the present invention, and do not create limitations, particularly as to the position, orientation, or use of the invention. It is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not limiting. Changes in detail or structure may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </p>
