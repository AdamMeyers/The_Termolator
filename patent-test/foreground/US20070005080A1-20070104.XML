<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention generally relates to tissue fixation devices, and more particularly to devices for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease using the same. The present invention more particularly relates to a bolt action assembly that delivers such tissue fixation devices in surgical environments. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition caused by the failure of the anti-reflux barrier located at the gastroesophageal junction to keep the contents of the stomach from splashing into the esophagus. The splashing is known as gastroesophageal reflux. The stomach acid is designed to digest meat, and will digest esophageal tissue when persistently splashed into the esophagus. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A principal reason for regurgitation associated with GERD is the mechanical failure of a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to close and seal against high pressure in the stomach. Due to reasons including lifestyle, a Grade I normal gastroesophageal flap may deteriorate into a malfunctioning Grade III or absent valve Grade IV gastroesophageal flap. With a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap, the stomach contents are more likely to be regurgitated into the esophagus, the mouth, and even the lungs. The regurgitation is referred to as &#x201c;heartburn&#x201d; because the most common symptom is a burning discomfort in the chest under the breastbone. Burning discomfort in the chest and regurgitation (burping up) of sour-tasting gastric juice into the mouth are classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). When stomach acid is regurgitated into the esophagus, it is usually cleared quickly by esophageal contractions. Heartburn (backwashing of stomach acid and bile onto the esophagus) results when stomach acid is frequently regurgitated into the esophagus and the esophageal wall is inflamed. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Complications develop for some people who have GERD. Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) with erosions and ulcerations (breaks in the lining of the esophagus) can occur from repeated and prolonged acid exposure. If these breaks are deep, bleeding or scarring of the esophagus with formation of a stricture (narrowing of the esophagus) can occur. If the esophagus narrows significantly, then food sticks in the esophagus and the symptom is known as dysphagia. GERD has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a subset of people who have severe GERD, if acid exposure continues, the injured squamous lining is replaced by a precancerous lining (called Barrett's Esophagus) in which a cancerous esophageal adenocarcinoma can develop. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Other complications of GERD may not appear to be related to esophageal disease at all. Some people with GERD may develop recurrent pneumonia (lung infection), asthma (wheezing), or a chronic cough from acid backing up into the esophagus and all the way up through the upper esophageal sphincter into the lungs. In many instances, this occurs at night, while the person is in a supine position and sleeping. Occasionally, a person with severe GERD will be awakened from sleep with a choking sensation. Hoarseness can also occur due to acid reaching the vocal cords, causing a chronic inflammation or injury. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> GERD never improves without intervention. Life style changes combined with both medical and surgical treatments exist for GERD. Medical therapies include antacids and proton pump inhibitors. However, the medical therapies only mask the reflux. Patients still get reflux and perhaps emphysema because of particles refluxed into the lungs. Barrett's esophagus results in about 10% of the GERD cases. The esophageal epithelium changes into tissue that tends to become cancerous from repeated acid washing despite the medication. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Several open laparotomy and laproscopic surgical procedures are available for treating GERD. One surgical approach is the Nissen fundoplication. The Nissen approach typically involves a 360-degree wrap of the fundus around the gastroesophageal junction. The procedure has a high incidence of postoperative complications. The Nissen approach creates a 360-degree moveable flap without a fixed portion. Hence, Nissen does not restore the normal movable flap. The patient cannot burp because the fundus was used to make the repair, and may frequently experience dysphagia. Another surgical approach to treating GERD is the Belsey Mark IV (Belsey) fundoplication. The Belsey procedure involves creating a valve by suturing a portion of the stomach to an anterior surface of the esophagus. It reduces some of the postoperative complications encountered with the Nissen fundoplication, but still does not restore the normal movable flap. None of these procedures fully restores the normal anatomical anatomy or produces a normally functioning gastroesophageal junction. Another surgical approach is the Hill repair. In the Hill repair, the gastroesophageal junction is anchored to the posterior abdominal areas, and a 180-degree valve is created by a system of sutures. The Hill procedure restores the moveable flap, the cardiac notch and the Angle of His. However, all of these surgical procedures are very invasive, regardless of whether done as a laproscopic or an open procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> New, less surgically invasive approaches to treating GERD involve transoral endoscopic procedures. One procedure contemplates a machine device with robotic arms that is inserted transorally into the stomach. While observing through an endoscope, an endoscopist guides the machine within the stomach to engage a portion of the fundus with a corkscrew-like device on one arm. The arm then pulls on the engaged portion to create a fold of tissue or radial plication at the gastroesophageal junction. Another arm of the machine pinches the excess tissue together and fastens the excess tissue with one pre-tied implant. This procedure does not restore normal anatomy. The fold created does not have anything in common with a valve. In fact, the direction of the radial fold prevents the fold or plication from acting as a flap of a valve. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another transoral procedure contemplates making a fold of fundus tissue near the deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to recreate the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The procedure requires placing multiple U-shaped tissue clips around the folded fundus to hold it in shape and in place. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> This and the previously discussed procedure are both highly dependent on the skill, experience, aggressiveness, and courage of the endoscopist. In addition, these and other procedures may involve esophageal tissue in the repair. Esophageal tissue is fragile and weak, in part due to the fact, that the esophagus is not covered by serosa, a layer of very sturdy, yet very thin tissue, covering and stabilizing all intraabdominal organs, similar like a fascia covering and stabilizing muscle. Involvement of esophageal tissue in the repair of a gastroesophageal flap valve poses unnecessary risks to the patient, such as an increased risk of fistulas between the esophagus and the stomach. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> A new and improved apparatus and method for restoration of a gastroesophageal flap valve is fully disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,790,214, is assigned to the assignee of this invention, and is incorporated herein by reference. That apparatus and method provides a transoral endoscopic gastroesophageal flap valve restoration. A longitudinal member arranged for transoral placement into a stomach carries a tissue shaper that non-invasively grips and shapes stomach tissue. A tissue fixation device is then deployed to maintain the shaped stomach tissue in a shape approximating a gastroesophageal flap. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Whenever tissue is to be maintained in a shape as, for example, in the improved assembly last mentioned above, it is necessary to fasten at least two layers of tissue together. In applications such as gastroesophageal flap valve restoration, there is very limited room to maneuver a fastener deployment device. For example, this and other medical fastening applications provide confined working channels and spaces and often must be fed through an endoscope to permit visualization or other small lumen guide catheters to the place where the fasteners are to be deployed. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Visualization under these conditions is difficult and may be obscured. Hence, deploying fasteners in such environments is difficult. It is particularly difficult to visually measure distance, which is so important when deploying a device designed to attach to tissue. Further, most often, more than one fastener is required. It would be desirable to be able to deploy fasteners with a procedure that is uniform in application and repeatable. The present invention addresses these and other issues. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The invention provides an assembly comprising a stylet that guides a fastener into tissue, the stylet having a proximal end, a bolt attached to the proximal end of the stylet, and a receiver that slidingly receives the bolt permitting linear movement of the bolt and stylet along a path. The assembly may further comprise a pusher that intersects the path of the stylet and pushes the fastener along the stylet. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The pusher may be carried on the stylet distal to where the pusher intersects the path of the stylet. The pusher may be tubular and include an opening permitting the pusher to be received on the stylet. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> The bolt may include a lumen that slidingly receives the pusher. The pusher may intersect the path at an intersection and the assembly may further include a loading station that permits a fastener to be loaded onto the stylet distal to the intersection. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The loading station may have a given length dimension and the assembly may further comprise a fastener loader. The fastener loader may have a width dimension less than the given length dimension for loading a fastener onto the stylet within the loading station. The fastener loader is preferably arranged to carry a plurality of the fasteners. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The bolt may include a projecting handle and the receiver may include a track that receives the handle and restricts movement of the bolt. The track may include at least one transverse slot that receive the bolt handle and locks the bolt in a predetermined longitudinal position. </p>

The first subassembly includes a first stylet that guides a first fastener into tissue and has a proximal end, a first bolt attached to the proximal end of the first stylet, and a first receiver that slidingly receives the first bolt permitting linear movement of the first bolt and stylet along a first path into the tissue. The second subassembly includes a second stylet that guides a second fastener into the tissue and has a proximal end, a second bolt attached to the proximal end of the second stylet, and a second receiver that slidingly receives the second bolt permitting linear movement of the second bolt and stylet along a second path into the tissue. The first and second subassemblies are carried by a common housing.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of the esophageal-gastro-intestinal tract <b>40</b> from a lower portion of the esophagus <b>41</b> to the duodenum <b>42</b>. The stomach <b>43</b> is characterized by the greater curvature <b>44</b> on the anatomical left side and the lesser curvature <b>45</b> on the anatomical right side. The tissue of the outer surfaces of those curvatures is referred to in the art as serosa tissue. As will be seen subsequently, the nature of the serosa tissue is used to advantage for its ability to bond to like serosa tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> The fundus <b>46</b> of the greater curvature <b>44</b> forms the superior portion of the stomach <b>43</b>, and traps gas and air bubbles for burping. The esophageal tract <b>41</b> enters the stomach <b>43</b> at an esophageal orifice below the superior portion of the fundus <b>46</b>, forming a cardiac notch <b>47</b> and an acute angle with respect to the fundus <b>46</b> known as the Angle of His <b>57</b>. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) <b>48</b> is a discriminating sphincter able to distinguish between burping gas, liquids, and solids, and works in conjunction with the fundus <b>46</b> to burp. The gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) <b>49</b> includes a moveable portion and an opposing more stationary portion. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The moveable portion of the GEFV <b>49</b> is an approximately 180degree, semicircular, gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> (alternatively referred to as a &#x201c;normal moveable flap&#x201d; or &#x201c;moveable flap&#x201d;) formed of tissue at the intersection between the esophagus <b>41</b> and the stomach <b>43</b>. The opposing more stationary portion of the GEFV <b>49</b> comprises a portion of the lesser curvature <b>45</b> of the stomach <b>43</b> adjacent to its junction with the esophagus <b>41</b>. The gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> principally comprises tissue adjacent to the fundus <b>46</b> portion of the stomach <b>43</b>. It is about 4 to 5 cm long (51) at it longest portion, and its length may taper at its anterior and posterior ends. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> is partially held against the lesser curvature <b>45</b> portion of the stomach <b>43</b> by the pressure differential between the stomach <b>43</b> and the thorax, and partially by the resiliency and the anatomical structure of the GEFV <b>49</b>, thus providing the valving function. The GEFV <b>49</b> is similar to a flutter valve, with the gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> being flexible and closeable against the other more stationary side. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> The esophageal tract is controlled by an upper esophageal sphincter (UES)in the neck near the mouth for swallowing, and by the LES <b>48</b> and the GEFV <b>49</b> at the stomach. The normal anti-reflux barrier is primarily formed by the LES <b>48</b> and the GEFV <b>49</b> acting in concert to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach, and to considerably resist reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus <b>41</b> past the gastroesophageal tissue junction <b>52</b>. Tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal tissue junction <b>52</b> is generally considered part of the stomach because the tissue protected from stomach acid by its own protective mechanisms. Tissue oral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> is generally considered part of the esophagus and it is not protected from injury by prolonged exposure to stomach acid. At the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b>, the juncture of the stomach and esophageal tissues form a zigzag line, which is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;Z-line&#x201d;. For the purposes of these specifications, including the claims, &#x201c;stomach&#x201d; means the tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of an esophageal-gastro-intestinal tract illustrating a Grade I normal appearance movable flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> (shown in dashed lines) and a deteriorated Grade III gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> (shown in solid lines). As previously mentioned, a principal reason for regurgitation associated with GERD is the mechanical failure of the deteriorated (or reflux appearance) gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> to close and seal against the higher pressure in the stomach. Due to reasons including lifestyle, a Grade I normal gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> may deteriorate into a Grade III deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b>. The anatomical results of the deterioration include moving a portion of the esophagus <b>41</b> that includes the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> and LES <b>48</b> toward the mouth, straightening of the cardiac notch <b>47</b>, and increasing the Angle of His <b>57</b>. This effectively reshapes the anatomy aboral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> and forms a flattened fundus <b>56</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a gastroesophageal flap valve <b>49</b> and cardiac notch <b>47</b> that are both significantly degraded. Dr. Hill and colleagues developed a grading system to describe the appearance of the GEFV and the likelihood that a patient will experience chronic acid reflux. L. D. Hill, et al., <i>The gastroesophageal flap valve: in vitro and in vivo observations</i>, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 1996:44:541-547. Under Dr. Hill's grading system, the normal movable flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> illustrates a Grade I flap valve that is the least likely to experience reflux. The deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> illustrates a Grade III (almost Grade IV) flap valve. A Grade IV flap valve is the most likely to experience reflux. Grades II and III reflect intermediate grades of deterioration and, as in the case of III, a high likelihood of experiencing reflux. With the deteriorated GEFV represented by deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> and the fundus <b>46</b> moved inferior, the stomach contents are presented a funnel-like opening directing the contents into the esophagus <b>41</b> and the greatest likelihood of experiencing reflux. Disclosed subsequently is a device, assembly, and method which may be employed to advantage according to an embodiment of the invention in restoring the normal gastroesophageal flap valve anatomy. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it shows a device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>100</b> includes a longitudinal member <b>102</b> for transoral placement of the device <b>100</b> into the stomach. Hence, the device <b>100</b> is at the distal end of the longitudinal member <b>102</b>. Located at the proximal end of the longitudinal member is a control assembly to be described subsequently in detail in connection with fastener delivery and deployment to maintain the restored GEFV flap. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The device further includes a first member <b>104</b>, hereinafter referred to as the chassis, and a second member <b>106</b>, hereinafter referred to as the bail. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail are hingedly coupled at <b>107</b>. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> form a tissue shaper which, as described subsequently in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, shapes tissue of the stomach into the flap of a restored gastroesophageal flap valve. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> are carried at the distal end of the longitudinal member <b>102</b> for placement in the stomach. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The device <b>100</b> has a longitudinal passage <b>101</b> to permit an endoscope <b>110</b> to be guided through the device and into the stomach. This permits the endoscope to service as a guide for guiding the device <b>100</b> through the patient's throat, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. It also permits the gastroesophageal flap valve restoration procedure to be viewed at each stage of the procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> To facilitate shaping of the stomach tissue, the stomach tissue is drawn in between the chassis <b>104</b> and the bail <b>106</b>. Further, to enable a flap of sufficient length to be formed to function as the flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve, the stomach tissue is pulled down so that the fold line is substantially juxtaposed to the opening of the esophagus into the stomach. Hence, the stomach is first gripped at a point out and away from the esophagus and the grip point is pulled to almost the hinged connection <b>107</b> of the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b>. As described in copending application Ser. No. 11/001,666, filed Nov. 30, 2004, entitled FLEXIBLE TRANSORAL ENDOSCOPIC GASTROESOPHAGEAL FLAP VALVE RESTORATION DEVICE AND METHOD, which application is incorporated herein by reference, the device <b>100</b> is fed down the esophagus with the bail <b>106</b> substantially in line with the chassis <b>104</b>. To negotiate the bend of the throat, and as described in the aforementioned referenced application, the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> are rendered flexible. The chassis <b>104</b> is rendered flexible by the slots <b>108</b> and the bail <b>106</b> is rendered flexible by the hingedly coupled links <b>112</b>. Further details concerning the flexibility of the chassis <b>104</b> and the bail <b>106</b> may be found in the aforementioned referenced application. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the device includes a tissue gripper <b>114</b>. The gripper <b>114</b>, in this embodiment, comprises a helical coil <b>115</b>. The coil <b>115</b> is carried at the end of a cable <b>116</b> and may be attached to the end of the cable or be formed from the cable. In this embodiment, the helical coil <b>115</b> is attached to the cable <b>116</b> and is preceded by a guide <b>118</b> whose function will be described subsequently. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> The helical coil <b>115</b> is shown in an approximate position to engage the stomach tissue out and away from the opening of the esophagus to the stomach. The helical coil <b>115</b> is guided into position by a guide structure <b>120</b> carried on the bail <b>106</b>. The guide structure <b>120</b> comprises a guide tube <b>122</b>. When the device <b>100</b> is first introduced down the esophagus into the stomach, the helical coil <b>115</b> is caused to reside well within the guide tube <b>122</b> to preclude the helical coil from accidentally or inadvertently snagging esophageal or stomach tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> The guide tube includes a longitudinal slit <b>126</b> having a circuitous configuration. The slit <b>126</b> permits the end of the cable to release or disassociate from the bail after the stomach tissue is gripped. The circuitous configuration of the slit <b>126</b> assures confinement of the cable <b>116</b> within the guide tube <b>122</b> until release of the cable is desired. The proximal end of the slit <b>126</b> has an enlarged portion or opening (not shown). This opening permits the cable and helical coil to reenter the lumen when the device <b>100</b> is readied for a repeated stomach tissue shaping procedure. To that end, the guide <b>118</b> has a conical surface that serves to guide the cable end back into the opening of the slit <b>126</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the device <b>100</b> further comprises a fastener deployer <b>140</b>. The fastener deployer includes at least one fastener deployment guide <b>142</b>. The fastener deployment guide <b>142</b> takes the form of a guide lumen. Although only one guide lumen <b>142</b> is shown, it will be appreciated that the device <b>100</b> may include a plurality of such lumens without departing from the invention. The guide lumen terminates at a delivery point <b>144</b> where a fastener is driven into the molded stomach tissue. The fastener deployer may take the form of any one of the assemblies fully described and claimed, for example, in </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The device <b>100</b> further includes a window <b>130</b> within the chassis <b>104</b>. The window is formed of a transparent or semitransparent material. This permits gastroesophageal anatomy, and more importantly the gastroesophageal junction (Z-line) to be viewed with the endoscope <b>110</b>. The window includes a location marker <b>132</b> which has a know position relative to the fastener delivery point <b>144</b>. Hence, by aligning the marker with a known anatomical structure, the fastener will be delivered a known distance from or at a location having a predetermined relation to the marker. For example, by aligning the marker with the Z-line, it will be know that the fastener will be placed aboral of the Z-line and that serosa tissue will be fastened to serosa tissue. As previously mentioned, this has many attendant benefits. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> It may also be mentioned at this point that the device <b>100</b> further includes an invaginator <b>145</b> including a plurality of orifices <b>146</b>. These orifices <b>146</b>, which alternatively may be employed on the longitudinal member <b>102</b>, are used to pull a vacuum to cause the device <b>100</b> to grip the inner surface of the esophagus. This will serve to stabilize the esophagus and maintain device positioning during the procedure. This vacuum gripping of the esophagus may also be used to particular advantage if the patient suffers from a hiatal hernia. Upon being thus gripped, the esophagus may be moved downwardly with the device toward the stomach to eliminate the hiatal hernia. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, here the bail <b>106</b> is now closed and stomach tissue aboral of the Z-line <b>52</b> is confined between the bail <b>106</b> and chassis <b>104</b> to create a fold <b>150</b>. The fold is also adjacent the fastener delivery point <b>144</b> at the end of the fastener guide lumen. Since the fastener deployment point <b>144</b> is a known predetermined distance from the marker <b>132</b> of the window <b>130</b>, and since the marker <b>132</b> is aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>, when a fastener is delivered from the fastener deployer of the device, the fastener will exit the fastener delivery point <b>144</b> at a point known to be aboral of the Z-line <b>52</b>. This assures that only serosa tissue is being adhered to serosa tissue in the fixation of the stomach tissue in creating the flap <b>150</b>. The flap <b>150</b> comprises layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> of stomach tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> With the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> now disposed within the mold of the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b>, the bail <b>106</b> may now be locked with respect to the chassis <b>104</b>. It is now time to fasten the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> together by ejecting a fastener from the fastener deployer lumen <b>142</b> at the fastener delivery point <b>144</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Before a fastener is ejected from the fastener deployer lumen <b>142</b>, the stomach may be inflated through the endoscope <b>110</b>. The stomach may be inflated to a point where one has a good view of the tissue fold and bail <b>106</b> with the endoscope. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view of a fastener <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The fastener <b>200</b> generally includes a first member <b>202</b>, a second member <b>204</b>, and a connecting member <b>206</b>. As may be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first member <b>202</b> and second member <b>204</b> are substantially parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the connecting member <b>206</b> which connects the first member <b>202</b> to the second member <b>204</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The first member <b>202</b> is generally cylindrical or can have any other shape. It has a longitudinal axis <b>208</b> and a through channel <b>212</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>208</b>. The through channel <b>212</b> is formed by a through bore which is dimensioned to be slidingly received on a tissue piercing deployment wire to be described. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The first member <b>202</b> also includes a first end <b>216</b> and a second end <b>218</b>. Similarly, the second member <b>204</b> includes a first end <b>220</b> and a second end <b>222</b>. The first end <b>216</b> of member <b>202</b> forms a pointed dilation tip <b>224</b>. The dilation tip <b>224</b> may be conical and more particularly takes the shape of a truncated cone. The tip can also be shaped to have a cutting edge in order to reduce tissue resistance. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The first and second members <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> and the connecting member <b>206</b> may be formed of different materials and have different textures. These materials may include, for example, plastic materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyglycolic acid, polyurethane, or a thermoplastic elastomer. The plastic materials may include a pigment contrasting with body tissue color to enable better visualization of the fastener during its deployment. Alternatively, the fastener may be formed of a metal, such as stainless steel or a shape memory metal, such as Nitinol. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> As may be further noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the connecting member <b>206</b> has a vertical dimension <b>228</b> and a horizontal dimension <b>230</b> which is transverse to the vertical dimension. The horizontal dimension is substantially less than the vertical dimension to render the connecting member <b>206</b> readily bendable in a horizontal plane. The connecting member is further rendered bendable by the nature of the material from which the fastener <b>200</b> is formed. The connecting member may be formed from either an elastic plastic or a permanently deformable plastic. An elastic material would prevent compression necrosis in some applications. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> It may be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, that the first member <b>202</b> has a continuous lengthwise slit <b>225</b> extending between the first and second ends <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. The slit <b>225</b> includes an optional slot portion <b>226</b> that communications with the through channel <b>212</b>. The slot <b>226</b> has a transverse dimension for more readily enabling receipt of a tissue piercing deployment wire during deployment of the fastener <b>200</b>. Also, because the fastener number <b>202</b> is formed of flexible material, the slit <b>225</b> may be made larger through separation to allow the deployment wire to be snapped into and released from the through channel <b>212</b>. This permits both ready fastener loading and fastener release from the deployment wire after deployment in the tissue layers. The slit <b>225</b> extends substantially parallel to the through channel <b>212</b> and the center axis <b>208</b> of the first member <b>202</b>. It may also be noted that the slit <b>225</b> has a width dimension that is smaller or less than the diameter D of the through channel <b>212</b>. This assures that the fastener <b>200</b> will remain on a tissue piercing deployment wire as it is pushed towards and into the tissue as will be seen subsequently. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, they are perspective views with portions cut away of a fastener assembly <b>300</b> illustrating a manner in which a fastener may be deployed according to an embodiment of the present invention. The tissue layer portions above the fastener <b>200</b> have been shown cut away in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> to enable the deployment procedure to be seen more clearly. The assembly <b>300</b> generally includes the fastener <b>200</b>, a deployment wire <b>264</b>, a pusher <b>266</b>, and a guide tube <b>268</b> having a guide lumen <b>269</b> (analogous to guide <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> As will be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> is slidingly received on the deployment wire <b>264</b>. The deployment wire <b>264</b> has a pointed tip <b>278</b> for piercing the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> to be fastened together. The tip <b>278</b> cuts sufficient tissue to enable the fastener member <b>202</b> to readily pass through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. It may also serve as a guide to guide the wire <b>264</b> off of the member <b>202</b> at the end of the deployment. The tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and the pusher <b>266</b> are all within the guide tube <b>268</b>. The guide tube <b>268</b> may preferably take the form of a guide channel, such the guide <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <b>4</b>, as previously mentioned. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> As will also be further noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second member <b>204</b> is disposed along side the first member <b>202</b>. This is rendered possible by the flexibility of the connecting member <b>206</b> and aids in proper deployment of the fastener <b>200</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> The subassembly of the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and pusher <b>266</b> are guided to the intended deployment location by the guide tube <b>268</b>. With the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> slidingly received on the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> and with the pusher <b>266</b> just touching the first member <b>202</b> on the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> is advanced a controlled distance to cause the tip <b>278</b> to pierce through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> a control distance. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> has been advanced a controlled distance by the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> as described subsequently to pierce the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. The pusher <b>266</b> is then used to push the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> on the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> As may be further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first member <b>202</b> has been pushed forward by the pusher <b>266</b> to cause the second member <b>204</b> to engage the tissue layer <b>180</b>. Continued pushing of the first member <b>202</b> causes the first member to pivot in a counter clockwise direction because the second member <b>204</b> is held by the tissue layer <b>180</b>. The counter clockwise movement of the first member <b>202</b> causes the wire <b>264</b> to spread the slit <b>225</b> open, to pass down the slit to enter slot portion <b>226</b> and to eventually pass through the slit <b>225</b> at end <b>218</b>. The fastener <b>200</b> is then ready to release from the wire <b>264</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it will now be seen that the second end <b>218</b> of the first member <b>202</b> has cleared the wire <b>264</b> and tissue layer <b>182</b>. The tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> may now be retracted into the pusher <b>266</b> and the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> and pusher <b>266</b> may be withdrawn. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the fastener <b>200</b> in its fully deployed position. It will be noted that the fastener has returned to its original shape. The tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> are fastened together between the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> and the second member <b>204</b> of the fastener <b>200</b>. The connecting member <b>106</b> extends through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate a control assembly <b>400</b> for controlling the delivery and deployment of fasteners according to an embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, the assembly <b>400</b>, according to this embodiment, is located at the proximal end of the longitudinal member <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for deploying fasteners into stomach tissue in a manner as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref> for maintaining the manipulated stomach tissue which has been folded and molded to restore a GEFV flap. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> The assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> will be described with particular reference to fastener delivery and deployment. The assembly <b>400</b> generally includes a housing <b>402</b>. The housing includes identical, side-bi-side control assemblies <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. Since the control assemblies <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> are identical, only assembly <b>404</b> will be described in detail herein. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> The assembly <b>404</b> includes a bolt <b>410</b>, a receiver <b>412</b> that slidingly receives the bolt <b>410</b> and the pusher <b>266</b>. Projecting from the bolt is a handle <b>414</b>. The handle extends through a track <b>416</b> in the housing <b>402</b> and restricts and measures the movement of the bolt <b>410</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> As previously mentioned, the control assemblies <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> are side-bi-side and identical. Hence, the assembly <b>406</b> may also be seen to include a bolt <b>510</b>, a pusher <b>366</b>, a receiver <b>512</b>, and a handle <b>514</b> projecting through a track <b>516</b>. The operation of the assembly <b>406</b> is identical to the operation of the assembly <b>404</b> to be described subsequently. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> The assembly <b>404</b> still further includes a fastener loading station <b>420</b>. The loading station <b>420</b> has a length dimension <b>422</b> sufficient to receive a fastener loader to be described subsequently with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. The fastener loader and loading station facilitate loading of fasteners onto the deployment stylet <b>264</b>. The assembly <b>406</b> also includes such a loading station <b>520</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> As may be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the bolt <b>410</b> of assembly <b>404</b> is attached to the proximal end of the stylet <b>264</b>. Hence, the bolt and stylet are arranged for linear movement when the bolt <b>410</b> is moved within the receiver <b>412</b> with the handle <b>414</b> along the track <b>416</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> The pusher <b>264</b> intersects the path of the stylet <b>264</b> at an intersection point <b>418</b>. The pusher, as best described in copending application Ser. No. 11/043,903, includes an opening at the intersection <b>418</b>. The opening permits the stylet to be fed into the pusher and hence to allow the pusher <b>266</b> to be carried by the stylet <b>264</b> distal to the intersection <b>418</b>. As previously seen, this permits the pusher <b>266</b> to engage the fastener <b>200</b>. Also, the loading station <b>420</b> is distal to the intersection <b>418</b> to permit the fastener <b>200</b> to be loaded onto the stylet <b>264</b> and engaged by the pusher <b>266</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> The bolt <b>410</b> further includes a lumen <b>411</b> that slidingly receives the pusher <b>266</b>. This permits the movement of the pusher <b>266</b> to be controlled independently of the movement of the bolt <b>410</b> and the stylet <b>264</b>. The bolt <b>510</b> also includes such a lumen <b>511</b> as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> As may be further noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the assembly <b>404</b> further includes a funnel shaped wall <b>430</b> between the loading station <b>420</b> and the guide lumen <b>269</b>. As may be recalled from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, the guide lumen <b>269</b> guides the stylet <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and pusher <b>266</b> to the desired location for deploying the fasteners. The funnel shaped wall <b>430</b>, as more fully described in copending application Ser. No. (2234-3-6), incorporated herein by reference, serves to preposition the second member <b>204</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> within the guide lumen <b>269</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The second member <b>204</b> is prepositioned as a trailing member along side the first member <b>202</b> with the connecting member <b>206</b> therebetween. This fastener configuration and prepositioning assists in the proper functioning of the second member <b>204</b> as the fastener <b>200</b> is deployed. The second member <b>204</b> is automatically rendered in its preposition along side the first member <b>202</b> with the connecting member <b>206</b> therebetween as the fastener <b>200</b> is translated distally through the funnel shaped wall section towards the guide lumen <b>269</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> In operation, when it is time to advance the stylet <b>264</b> in through the tissue as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the handle <b>414</b> is moved in a distal direction forcing the stylet <b>264</b> to move distally. The handle and thus the stylet movement is restricted and measured by a transverse portion of slot <b>417</b> of the track <b>416</b>. The handle <b>414</b> may be locked in a longitudinal position within the transverse portion <b>417</b> of the track. The fastener <b>200</b> is advanced by the pusher <b>266</b>. After a fastener is deployed, the distal end of the pusher is drawn back to be proximal to the loading station <b>420</b> to permit another fastener to be loaded onto the stylet <b>264</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> The fasteners are loaded onto the stylet by presenting the slit <b>225</b> of the fasteners to the stylet. The slit <b>225</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is widened by the stylet <b>264</b> and the stylet <b>264</b> slips through the slit <b>225</b> and into the through channel <b>212</b> of the fastener first member <b>202</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a fastener loader <b>450</b> which may be employed for loading the fasteners onto the stylet. The loader <b>450</b> has a handle <b>452</b> permitting it to be readily hand-holdable. At the distal end, the loader is arranged to carry a plurality of fasteners <b>200</b>. The loader presents the fasteners so that the slit <b>225</b> will be aligned with the stylet <b>264</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> The holder has a width dimension <b>454</b> that is less than the length dimension <b>422</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) of the loading station <b>420</b>. Hence, the loader <b>450</b> may be inserted into a loading station for mounting a fastener onto a corresponding stylet. The loader <b>450</b> may be used on either side of the assembly <b>400</b> for loading a fastener onto stylet <b>264</b> at loading station <b>420</b> or loading a fastener onto stylet <b>364</b> at loading station <b>520</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, modifications may be made, and it is therefore intended in the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </p>
