<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A dermatological device for subcision of sub-epidermic tissues. The device is provided with a blunt dermis contacting surface enabling the operator to lift or cause traction to the skin from underneath the skin, after placement of the dermal contacting surface of the device under the skin. By mere skin lifting from underneath, fibrous bands present within the dermis are detached/disrupted/dissected from their attachments to the skin or from their attachments to deeper layers. Detachment/disruption/dissection of the fibrous bands can be aided by the adjunct of a dissecting arm which by rotation can enhance detachment/disruption/dissection of the fibrous bands. Pathological skin conditions such as edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy known also as cellulite or any depressed scar or deep wrinkle can benefit from the device as dissection of the fibrous bands. which cause depression of skin areas. restitutes a nearly anatomical evened up skin surface. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to medical apparatuses and methods for treatment of dermatological pathological conditions, such as the edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy, commonly known as cellulite, acne scars or even physiological conditions such as deep wrinkles. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND&#x2014;DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Numerous treatments have been devised for the dermatological condition edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy, commonly known as cellulite. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Some of these treatments have a scientific base, some have a pseudo-scientific, empiric base. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy commonly named cellulite, a non medical term coined in Europe, is a disorder of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy is due to the formation of an abnormal fibrous network in the hypoderm. The abnormal fibrous network encapsulates conglomerates of fat cells causing a subcutaneous architectural disruption which results in a dimples and nodules appearance of the skin, known as orange peel skin. Strands of fibrous tissue connect the skin to deeper tissue layers and also separate compartments that contain conglomerates of fat cells. Cellulite affects more commonly the hips, thighs, glutei, abdominal wall and upper arms. Women are commonly more affected than men. Researchers agree that most of cellulite &#x201c;cures&#x201d; have been ineffective. Recent researches have confirmed that cellulite is product of faulty anatomy, genes and hormones. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Anticellulite products with unsubstantiated claims of successful treatment of the condition include creams and gels, brushes, rollers, body wraps toning lotions, electrical stimulation devices, vibrating machines, inflatable hip-high pressurized boots, hormone or enzymes injections and many others. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> More recently, radio frequency and laser devices, cold-laser massage devices, combined radio frequency/infrared devices, fat melting injections, targeted liposuction, tissue fillers have been used for the treatment of cellulite with minimal or marginal success, eventually with only transitory improvements. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> A more recently devised surgical procedure called skin subcision has shown some promising results. The procedure consists of cutting the cellulitic fibrous bands, the tethers which cause the depression in the skin with a special needle having surgical scalpel-like tip. The dimples, freed from their fibrous attachments, pop up and the skin is able to regain the even, pre-cellulitic aspect. Regretfully, the procedure is not void of complications. Pain, bruises, hemosiderosis have been associated with the procedure as reported in the International Journal of Dermatology, Volume 39 Issue 7, Page 539, July 2000. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> With the present invention, applicants propose a simple medical-surgical device having the scientific prerequisites of being capable of detaching the fibrous attachments that connect the skin to the deeper layers and cause the typical dimples of a cellulitic skin, via blunt dissection, rather than via sharp dissection as currently in use. Detachment of such fibrous attachments resolves the skin dimples, restituting normal appearance to the skin, minimizing complications more likely to develop with the current technique of sharp dissection. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The device is composed of a needle having an expandable balloon in proximity of the tip, connected to a syringe provided with a handle. The operator inserts the needle into the skin, inflates the balloon, grossly shaped as a donut. The balloon once inflated has the double finction of dissecting by outward radial expansion the fibrous bands network and of serving as anchoring device for skin traction purposes. The operator gently pulls up the needle acting upon the syringe handle connected to the needle carrying the expanded balloon. In doing so the operator elevates the skin, stretching it to the point of rupture the cellulitic fibrous bands which cause the dimpling of the skin. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> The detachment of the fibrous bands occur by blunt dissection. It is expected that the extensible surrounding blood vessels are just stretched and not severed as in the above mentioned sharp subcision technique. Surrounding structures will be less traumatized being not sharply cut as in the sharp subcision technique. It is reasonable to say that less trauma to the tissue is expected to occur with greater patient comfort and with expectation of lesser complications. In the instances that blunt dissection results insufficient to detach such fibrous bands the device will be able to place the fibrous bands under sufficient tensile traction to be easily detectable at touch by a blindly exploring sharp cutting tool, with consequent economical and efficient severing of such fibrous bands by such cutting tool, or to enable a cutting tool mounted on the skin traction apparatus to economically and efficiently sever such fibrous bands, in both cases with minimal damage to surrounding tissues in a fashion comparable to blunt dissection technique. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0005">OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple, rapidly deployable medical device for the treatment of cellulite, the treatment being based on solid anatomic-pathological foundations. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> It is an object of the present invention to provide the consumer with a simple minimally invasive effective, rapidly deployable means and method for improving cosmetic appearance of the skin affected by cellulite. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> It is an object of the present invention to provide a safe, simple and effective apparatus and method to target and to induce mechanical lysis of the fibrous bands which are at the core of the formation and persistence of the cellulite in body areas of patient's concern. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> It is an object of the present invention to provide the operator with an alternative improved apparatus and method of an already proven effective method of cellulite treatment, i.e. skin subcision: the dissection of the cellulitic fibrous bands. The proposed device dissects the fibrous tissue by blunt, not sharp, dissection, causing less trauma, less bleeding, ultimately less inflammatory reaction in the subcutaneous tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> It is an objective of the present invention to provide the operator with a device which by minimal, needle-like skin invasion ensues an adequate traction on the skin from below without any further puncturing or cutting of the skin. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> It is an objective of this invention to provide the operator with an adequate skin traction device requiring a single skin hole of a diameter comparable to a needle-like element capable of exerting traction pressure to the skin from below without any further puncturing or cutting of the skin. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> It is further objective of this invention to provide the operator with a minimally invasive device for traction of the skin from below to ensue enough tensile traction on fibrous bands responsible of the skin dimpling characterizing the cellulite to cause detachment of such fibrous bands from their attachments to the skin or to deeper layers, and/or to cause easy detection at touch by a blindly exploring sharp cutting tool as a result of the tensile traction applied to them, with consequent economical and efficient severing of such fibrous bands by such cutting tool, or to enable a cutting tool mounted on the skin traction apparatus to economically and efficiently sever such fibrous bands, in both cases with minimal damage to surrounding tissues in a fashion comparable to the blunt dissection technique.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, plunger <b>10</b>, at rest prior to use, is withdrawn to a degree just sufficient to fully inflate balloon <b>14</b> once plunger <b>10</b> is fully downwardly displaced. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> As it can be better understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which shows the device in use, the operator advances needle <b>2</b> with imperforated tip <b>3</b>&#x2032; into the patient skin <b>30</b>. Local anesthetic can be administered prior to skin insertion of needle tip <b>3</b>&#x2032; for pain relief. Needle <b>2</b> is preferably inserted in the depressed center of a skin dimple <b>21</b>&#x2032; of the cellulitic skin <b>30</b>. Dimple <b>21</b>&#x2032; is shown before skin traction, while dimple <b>21</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> during skin traction, as it will be described below. Once needle tip <b>3</b>&#x2032; and distal segment of needle shaft <b>12</b> with balloon <b>14</b> is at sufficient depth underneath the epidermis, balloon <b>14</b> is inflated by the operator by advancement of plunger <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another embodiment of device <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>, generally indicated at <b>29</b>. Device <b>29</b> is in all similar to device <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref> except that hvpodermic needle or elongated member <b>34</b> is mounted with coaxial catheter or flexible sleeve <b>36</b> formed with balloon or expandable member <b>35</b>. Catheter <b>36</b> is sealinglv connected via hub <b>33</b> to hub <b>3</b> of needle <b>34</b>. Needle <b>34</b> is formed with entry segment <b>34</b>&#x2032;, L-shaped, provided with tip <b>31</b> and dissecting means or blade <b>39</b> as better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Tip <b>33</b> of entry segment <b>34</b>&#x2032; is shown blunt in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, but can be also sharp to allow skin penetration. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> As better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> which is a cross sectional view of balloon <b>35</b>, of catheter <b>36</b> and of hollow needle <b>34</b>, hollow needle <b>34</b> is longitudinally fenestrated via longitudinal opening <b>37</b>. Catheter <b>36</b> is tightly mounted over needle <b>34</b> and is provided with openings <b>38</b> which are aligned, and in flow communication, with opening <b>37</b> of needle <b>34</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, distal segment <b>36</b>&#x2032; of catheter <b>36</b> extends into an enlarged and/or expandable segment of such catheter, balloon <b>35</b>, whose wall or distensible airtight membrane <b>35</b>&#x2032; is folded over catheter shaft <b>36</b>&#x2033; and, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, it extends over proximal segment <b>32</b> of catheter <b>36</b> reducing its diameter into sleeve <b>32</b>&#x2032;, which is sealingly bound over proximal segment <b>32</b> of catheter <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> This version offers manufacturing advantages over versions where balloon is sealingly bound with adhesives over the needle, because in this version no adhesive binding is necessary between needle on one side and catheter/balloon on the other side. In fact, in use, air or fluidous component is delivered, by advancement of plunger <b>10</b>, from syringe <b>4</b> into needle <b>34</b> which is hollow up to its fenestration <b>37</b>. Air will preferentially select the pathway of least resistance, and will enter balloon <b>35</b> via openings <b>37</b> of needle <b>34</b>, then via catheter openings <b>38</b> which are aligned in flow communication with needle opening <b>37</b>, rather than opening its way and escaping along the interface between tightly adherent catheter shaft <b>36</b> and needle <b>34</b>. Upon air build up within balloon <b>35</b>, consequent pressure build up within balloon <b>35</b> will result in increased adherence of catheter shaft <b>36</b>&#x2033; to needle <b>34</b>, which in turn will prevent escape of air between catheter and needle. Inflated balloon <b>35</b> will retain needle <b>34</b> from exiting out of the skin when the operator will pull in direction away from the skin the syringe secured to the needle. This action will result with elevation of the skin to such extent of disrupting the attachment of the collagen fibers to the dermis and releasing the skin dimples which characterize the cellulite. </p>

Another application of the devices above and below described, in addition to the treatment of cellulite is the treatment of any depressed scar or even deep wrinkles where dissection/disruption of the fibrotic bands from the dermis or deeper attachments, responsible of the scar tissue or deep wrinkles, will result in elevation of the depressed skin surfaces to an even anatomical level with the surrounding skin surface. An example of this application is the correction and cosmetic amelioration of acne scars. </p>
