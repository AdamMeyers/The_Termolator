<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This invention relates to apparatus for abrading skin to remove outer portions thereof as well as to a method. The system has particular application to microabrading skin by removing outer layers to provide a fresh skin surface. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Dermabrasion, sometimes referred to as microdermabrasion, is a well known process for removing dead cells from the outermost layer of the skin, cleaning out blocked pores and enhancing skin tone. U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,739, discloses a treatment tool and tissue collection system for removing outer layers of skin to provide a revitalized, fresh skin surface, the objective being to remove dead end old cell skins without damaging the remaining skin surface and without the use of powdered abrasive material. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> More particularly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,739 discloses a device for microabrasion comprising a hollow tube with an abrasive material permanently attached to a skin contacting end. The abrasive coated tip is moved over the skin surface while a vacuum is applied through the tube to the skin surface to remove cells abraded from the skin surface. The vacuum also causes the skin to be held in intimate contact with the abrasive tip during the treatment procedure. Specifically suggested as abrasion particles attached to the treatment tip are diamond grit, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, and various metal nitrates. Also suggested is the concept of machining or chemically treating the tip to provide a roughened surface which when moved across skin abrades the epidermis, dislodging cells from the surface. A method employing this technique is also disclosed it U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,739. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,183 matured from a continuation-in-part application based on the patent application resulting in above-described U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,739. U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,183 discloses a treatment tool and tissue collection system for removal of outer layers of skin to provide a revitalized, fresh skin surface, and a method of using same. The tool is an abrasive tipped tool mounted on the end or within the end of a hollow tube, the tube being connected to a source of vacuum. The vacuum aids in maintaining intimate contact between the abrasive tip and the skin during the treatment process and transports the removed tissue to a collection container. The abrasive surface within the tube is a motor driven abrasive pad. Contact between the pad and the abrasive disc is brought about or increased by application of a vacuum through the tube to the skin surface. Other prior art abrasion techniques are known, some of which can be traced back to ancient times wherein alabaster and pumice were utilized to remove blemishes and rough spots and to make the skin smooth and soft. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,712,823, 2,867,214, 2,881,763 and 2,921,585 disclose abrasive tipped devices or rotating brushes and cylinders coated with abrasive particles such as diamond dust to remove skin layers. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,446 describes a stick, fingertip or glove palm coated with an abrasive material which is rubbed over the skin surface to provide a polishing action. U.S. Pat. No. 3,964,212 discloses a pneumatic grinding machine for flat surfaces. U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,804 discloses a skin abrasion device which uses flowing water to rotate an abrasive brush and create a vacuum to remove loosened skin particles. The rotating brush is usually employed in conjunction with a liquid detergent or medicinal compound applied to the skin surface being scrubbed. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> U.S. Pat. No. 5,012,797 shows the use of an ultrasonic surgical tool adapted to abrade soft tissue wherein use of the tool is accompanied by use of rinsing liquid such as an aqueous saline solution and suction means to withdraw the rinsing fluid as well as blood and tissue fragments upwardly into a pipe for disposal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,431 describes a hand-held surgical apparatus wherein a pressurized jet of a liquid, such as water or sterile saline, is employed to fragment diseased tissue and remove the liquid and fragmented tissue by vacuum. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> It is also known to abrade the skin surface using powdered aluminum oxide or a liquid topical composition containing suspended aluminum oxide, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,747. In the arrangement of U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,432 abrasive reducing substances are conveyed under pressure to the skin and a collection tube removes under suction both the reducing substances and the portions of tissue removed during the treatment. Somewhat similar arrangements, employing collection chambers, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,100,412, 5,207,234 and 5,810,842. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> U.S. Pat. No. 5,971,999 is related to an apparatus for microdermabrading by means of a jet of a mixture of air and reducing crystals, and an associated handle. The jet of reducing crystals is, in particular, a jet of corundum crystals. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,552 discloses a device for collecting fragments of walls of internal organs and U.S. Pat. No. 2,701,559 discloses apparatus for exfoliating and collecting diagnostic material from inner walls of hollow visera. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,921,585, 5,207,234 and 6,423,078 show other dermabrasion approaches. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,121,388, 4,646,482 and 5,035,089 relate to non-medical abrasion systems. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment of apparatus constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The apparatus is for abrading skin to remove outer portions thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The apparatus includes a hand-held member <b>10</b> in the form of a handle and having a tube <b>12</b> extending from an end thereof. The tube <b>12</b> is for the purpose of connecting the hand-held member to a suitable vacuum source (not shown). The hand-held member <b>10</b> defines an air-flow passageway or lumen <b>14</b> for communication with the vacuum source through tube <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Threadedly engaged with the distal end of hand-held member <b>10</b> is a skin abrading head <b>18</b> utilized to engage and abrade skin of an individual. The skin abrading head <b>18</b> includes an outer head portion <b>20</b> comprising an outer wall of cylindrical configuration. Outer head portion <b>20</b> has a circular rim <b>22</b> for placement in contact with the skin. The rim <b>22</b> is generally smooth and itself does not abrade the skin. Rather, as will be seen below, the outer head portion and rim thereof cooperate with a skin abrading brush comprising part of the skin abrading head. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Outer head portion <b>20</b> defines a head interior <b>24</b> and an opening <b>26</b> at the distal end of the skin abrading head in communication with the head interior. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> The skin abrading head further includes a brush support in the form of an inner wall or partition <b>28</b>. The brush support is disposed inwardly of and spaced from opening <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> A skin abrading brush having a plurality of bristles is located in the head interior. More particularly, the skin abrading brush comprises a plurality of spaced brush segments <b>30</b>, each of which has a plurality of bristles. The spaced brush segments <b>30</b> project outwardly from the brush support <b>28</b> in the direction of opening <b>26</b>. The spaced brush segments have flattened outer distal brush segment ends <b>32</b> which in the illustrated embodiment are located at the plane of the rim. It is within the scope of the present invention to locate the flattened outer ends inwardly of the plane of the rim to some extent if desired. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> A plurality of orifices <b>40</b> are defined by brush support <b>28</b>, the orifices providing communication between air-flow passageway <b>14</b> and the head interior for creating a vacuum induced air flow within the head interior entraining skin portions removed due to abrasion of the skin by the skin abrading brush and delivering the skin portions to the air-flow passageway. In this embodiment of the invention the orifices <b>40</b> are located between the skin abrading brush and the outer head portion. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> The spaced brush segments <b>30</b> are staggered to provide serpentine air-flow paths for the vacuum induced air flow within the head interior. It has been found that such an arrangement increases vacuum efficiency. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> In operation, the rim <b>22</b> and the bristles of the brush segments are substantially simultaneously brought into engagement with the skin being treated. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> While maintaining that engagement the hand-held member is utilized to move the rim and the bristles along the skin. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> During such movement and while maintaining engagement, a vacuum is created in the air-flow passageway <b>14</b> and in the head interior <b>24</b> causing air flow from the ambient atmosphere under the rim <b>22</b>, into and through the head interior past the bristles and into the air-flow passageway. This pulls the skin toward the rim and skin abrading brush. The skin abraded by the skin abrading brush are entrained in the air flow for removal and disposal. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The amount of vacuum in the head interior and bristle engagement with the skin can be controlled by tilting the rim relative to the skin. The vacuum produced in the head interior serves to maintain the skin in engagement with the rim and bristles. The stronger the vacuum, the tighter the engagement. The vacuum causes blood to move toward the abraded outer skin surface, promoting healing and formation of smooth, clear outermost skin layer. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The rim is substantially smooth and does not itself abrade the skin. The smooth beveling of the rim facilitates movement of the skin abrading head over the skin and facilitates user control and placement of the skin abrading head. Such an arrangement also has been found to essentially eliminate striping, the formation of red streaks on the skin that can otherwise occur. The outer head portion defines spaced air-flow recesses <b>44</b> located at the rim to prevent formation of a complete vacuum seal between the head and the skin even when the apparatus is disposed orthogonally relative to the skin. In this manner, blotchiness, irritation and other types of problems are unlikely to occur due to vacuum application. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an alternative skin abrading head <b>18</b>A which, except for a couple of features, is identical to the skin abrading head <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In this embodiment, the distal brush segment ends <b>32</b> lie in a common plane spaced inwardly of the plane of rim <b>22</b>A. Furthermore, no recesses equivalent to recesses <b>44</b> are formed in the rim, the rim being smoothly beveled and uniform about the entire periphery thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a third embodiment of skin abrading head, the head identified by reference numeral <b>18</b>B. In this embodiment a single orifice <b>40</b>B provides communication between the air-flow passageway and the head interior. The orifice is centrally disposed within the skin abrading head. The brush segments <b>30</b>B surround the orifice. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> embodiment, the skin abrading head <b>18</b>C has a brush support <b>28</b>C defining radially extending slots comprising the orifices <b>40</b>C. The brush segments <b>30</b>C are arrayed in clusters with the orifices <b>40</b>C located between clusters and and the outer head portion <b>20</b>C. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another alternative embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is somewhat similar to the skin abrading head embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> head there is a single, centrally disposed orifice <b>40</b>D. An inner wall or head portion <b>20</b>D surrounds orifice <b>40</b>D and extends upwardly therefrom to define head interior <b>24</b>D and an opening <b>26</b>D communicating with the head interior. The head portion <b>20</b>D has an outer circular rim <b>22</b>D. Brush segments <b>30</b>D surround the inner head portion <b>20</b>D. The outer brush segments are chambered to better conform to the skin surface and reduce likelihood of bristle separation when the head portion is tilted during use. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> In the invention, the different skin abrading heads can be substituted for one another, depending upon the abrading and/or vacuum action desired. Not only can the head components have different configurations and sizes, different brush materials can be utilized. </p>
