<heading level="2" id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to the field of medical devices and more specifically to a tourniquet having a closed loop system. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Tourniquets are used in medical emergencies to restrict blood flow to a particular limb of a patient. Virtually all known tourniquets include a strap for wrapping around the patient's limb to form a loop. The strap is then tied or buckled to prevent loosening. Some tourniquets also include a rigid tightening rod positioned within the loop for further tightening. Conventional tightening rods are typically secured by methods such as pushing the rod under the tightened loop or in at least one instance by insertion into a pocket assembly slidably positioned along the strap as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,710. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Tourniquets are commonly provided to emergency medical personnel and may be found in first aid kits. Since an emergency can happen at any time, tourniquets should be designed for rapid use during the day and night. The present invention addresses these concerns and provides a tourniquet that is quick and easy to use in light or darkness. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present invention provides a tourniquet utilizing a closed loop system to rapidly and easily restrict blood flow to a patient's limb without the need of a buckle for securing a strap. In addition the present invention does not require the user to manipulate the position of a securing loop for a tightening rod while tightening the tourniquet. In one aspect of the present invention a tourniquet is provided including a twistable strap, a base including two opposing entry apertures and an exit aperture, a windlass and a receiving loop. The twistable strap is slidably positioned through the opposing entry apertures and the exit aperture of the base. The strap and base together form a closed loop. The windlass is positioned outside of the closed loop and is affixed to one end of the strap. The windlass includes an aperture capable of slidably receiving the opposing end of the strap therethrough. The receiving loop is capable of receiving the windlass and is attached to the base. The tourniquet may also include additional features such as a coating or treatment along a portion of the strap to increase the gripping capability of the strap to a limb. The coating or treatment may therefore reduce potential slipping of the tourniquet along a limb. In some embodiments there are at least two exit apertures, such as one exit aperture for each end of the strap. There may be two receiving loops, one for each end of the windlass. One receiving end may be a fixed length and the second may have an adjustable length. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In another aspect of the present invention a method of restricting blood flow is provided including providing a tourniquet of the present invention, placing the limb of a patient through the closed loop, pulling the end of the strap opposite the windlass until the windlass reaches or nearly reaches the base, twisting the windlass until blood flow is restricted, and inserting at least one end of the windlass in at least one receiving loop.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000"> Definitions </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The term &#x201c;entry apertures&#x201d; as used herein refers to access or entry sites for the strap to enter the base. &#x201c;Opposing entry apertures&#x201d; are entry sites positioned at substantially opposite ends of the base where the strap may enter the base. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> The term &#x201c;exit aperture&#x201d; as used herein refers to one or more apertures allowing the opposing ends of the strap to exit the base and proceed outward or towards the windlass. Upon exit through the exit aperture by both ends of the strap, a closed loop is formed. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The term &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed loop system&#x201d; as used herein refers to a strap and base that are slidably engaged such that both opposing ends of the strap are slidably positioned through the entry and exit apertures of the base. A &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; tourniquet requires the patient's limb be inserted through the loop formed by the strap and base. A &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; may be opened by removing the grasping end from the exit aperture and the entry aperture. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> The term &#x201c;slidably positioned&#x201d; as used herein refers to the ability to slide along a feature or element. The base may slide along the strap and is thus slidably positioned along the strap. The windlass may slide along a portion of the strap and is thus sidably positioned along the strap. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The term &#x201c;grasping end&#x201d; refers to the portion of the strap that outside of the closed loop and is pulled to tighten the tourniquet. The grasping end is the end portion of the strap that is opposite the windlass-attached end. The grasping end is slidably inserted through the windlass aperture. The grasping end is not limited to the endpoint of the strap but includes the region of the strap that exits the exit aperture. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The term &#x201c;attached end&#x201d; or &#x201c;windlass-attached end&#x201d; as used herein refers to the end region of the strap that is attached to the windlass. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0008">Description of Preferred Embodiments </heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the present invention provides a military emergency tourniquet <b>10</b>, the tourniquet <b>10</b> of the present invention includes a twistable strap <b>12</b> slidably inserted into the base <b>14</b> via two opposing entry apertures <b>15</b>. The strap <b>12</b> exits the base <b>14</b> via the exit aperture <b>16</b>. The resulting tourniquet <b>10</b> is referred to as having a closed loop system <b>17</b>, which does not require the use of a buckle to secure the strap <b>12</b> or require tying or untying the strap <b>12</b> during use. Attached to one of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>and positioned outside of the closed loop <b>17</b> is a windlass <b>18</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> also includes an aperture <b>19</b> through which the opposing end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b </i>is slidably inserted. Therefore the windlass <b>18</b> is attached to one end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>and is capable of sliding along the opposing end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Also included is at least one receiving loop <b>20</b> capable of receiving an end of the windlass <b>18</b>. Since the receiving loop <b>20</b> is attached to the base <b>14</b>, the receiving loop <b>20</b> does not require significant manipulated during tightening of the tourniquet <b>10</b>. The present configuration conveniently places the receiving loop <b>20</b> in close proximity of the windlass <b>18</b> when the windlass <b>18</b> is near or adjacent to the base <b>14</b> (when in a tightened position). </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The tourniquet <b>10</b> of the present invention can be used by a variety of medical personnel, care-givers, security personnel and the like. The tourniquet <b>10</b> is suitable for use for the military, police, lifeguards, nurses, doctors, ski patrol and the like. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the tourniquet <b>10</b> of the present invention can even be used by the victim. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The tourniquet <b>10</b> can be rapidly placed on the patient and removed. Use of the tourniquet <b>10</b> may include inserting a limb through the closed loop <b>17</b>, grasping and pulling the strap end <b>12</b><i>b </i>opposite the windlass <b>18</b> until the windlass <b>18</b> is slidably positioned near the base <b>14</b>, twisting the windlass <b>18</b> causing the strap <b>12</b> to twist upon itself, which shortens the strap <b>12</b>, then inserting at least one end of the windlass <b>12</b> into a receiving loop <b>20</b>. The tourniquet <b>10</b> may be removed by releasing the windlass <b>18</b> from the receiving loop <b>20</b>, substantially unwinding the windlass <b>18</b> and pulling the windlass <b>18</b> away from the base <b>14</b> thereby adding slack to the closed loop system <b>17</b> and removing the limb from the closed loop <b>17</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> The strap <b>12</b> allows the regulation of a patient's blood flow to a limb. Regulation may include restricting or stopping blood flow to the limb. In one preferred embodiment the strap <b>12</b> is maintained in a closed loop system <b>17</b>. In this configuration, the patient's limb is placed through the closed loop <b>17</b>. The strap <b>12</b> is typically first tightened by pulling on one end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b</i>, also referred to as the grasping end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Since the windlass <b>18</b> is slidably positioned along the grasping end <b>12</b><i>b</i>, pulling the grasping end <b>12</b><i>b </i>results in the windlass <b>18</b> being slidably moved towards the base <b>14</b>. The strap <b>12</b> can be further tightened by twisting the windlass <b>18</b>, which forces the strap <b>12</b> to twist upon itself thereby further decreasing the diameter of the closed loop <b>17</b>. In another embodiment, the tourniquet <b>10</b> is opened then closed around a limb. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The strap <b>12</b> is preferably constructed from a twistable or foldable material such as nylon webbing or nylon strapping such as those used in the camping, luggage and pet industries. The strap <b>12</b> should be sufficiently long to encircle a desired limb while also providing enough remaining material to have at one end <b>12</b><i>a </i>an attached windlass <b>18</b> and at the opposing end <b>12</b><i>b </i>enough material to grasp and pull for tightening of the tourniquet <b>10</b>. The strap <b>12</b> may be cut to the desired size using conventional cutting techniques known in the manufacturing arts. As general guidance, the preferred strap <b>12</b> is about 24 inches to about 36 inches in length. However, an individual with a larger limb, such as a large adult's leg, may require a longer strap <b>12</b> (e.g. a length preferably from about 36 inches to about 44 inches) and an individual with a smaller limb, such as a child's arm, may not require as long of a strap <b>12</b> (e.g. 8 inches to about 24 inches). The width of the strap <b>12</b> may vary depending on the strength of the material used. In the preferred embodiments, a nylon strap <b>12</b> has a width of about one inch. However, the strap <b>12</b> may be less than one inch wide, three to five inches wide or more if desired. A strap <b>12</b> may include a coating or treatment for enhanced gripping of a limb. As a non-limiting example, a rubber-based material such as rubber or TUFF-TEC to provide added grip against a limb. Materials may be adhered to or coated on an inner surface the strap <b>12</b> using conventional techniques known in the fabric industries such as weaving, sewing, gluing, melting then cooling and the like. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> At one end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a</i>, is attached the windlass <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>is inserted through the windlass aperture <b>19</b>, returned and sewn upon itself such that the windlass <b>18</b> is attached via a sewn loop. In other non-limiting embodiments the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be tied, buckled, snapped or clipped to the windlass <b>18</b>. Either end or both ends of the strap <b>12</b><i>a</i>/<b>12</b><i>b </i>may be reinforced, such as being doubled back and sewn or by attaching additional fabric or materials to the strap <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b </i>opposite the windlass <b>18</b>, also referred to as the grasping end <b>12</b><i>b</i>, is used to tighten the tourniquet <b>10</b>. The grasping end <b>12</b><i>b </i>may have a reinforced end piece <b>26</b> or may be provided with an end loop for ease of grasping. The end loop may be configured for a single finger, two or more fingers, a hand or the like. When the grasping end <b>12</b><i>b </i>is pulled, tension causes the windlass-attached end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>to slide towards the base <b>14</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> prevents the attached end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>from sliding out from the base <b>14</b> and opening the closed loop <b>17</b>. The remaining strap portion <b>12</b><i>c </i>is within the closed loop <b>17</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The base <b>14</b> in combination with the strap <b>12</b> forms the closed loop system <b>17</b>. The base <b>14</b> is preferably an elongated segment of nylon webbing or reinforced nylon webbing. The base <b>14</b> is typically more rigid than the strap <b>12</b> and may be constructed from a thicker material or may be a reinforced material. In preferred embodiments, the base <b>14</b> has a width of about six inches long by about two inches wide however these measurements are not limiting to the present invention. For example, the base <b>14</b> may be 2&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033;, 4&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033;, 4&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033;, 8&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; and the like. The base <b>14</b> may be cut to the desired size using conventional cutting techniques known in the manufacturing arts. The base <b>14</b> includes two opposing entry apertures <b>15</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>15</b><i>b </i>through which the opposing ends of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>12</b><i>b </i>are slidably positioned and at least one exit aperture <b>16</b> for the exit of the opposing ends of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment, the base <b>14</b> is constructed by providing a bottom segment of nylon webbing approximately 6&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033; and gluing or stitching to the top and at opposing ends, two separate nylon webbing pieces about 2&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#xbe;&#x2033;. The stitching or gluing performed along two of the four perimeter regions of the two top segments forming two entry apertures <b>15</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>15</b><i>b </i>and two exit apertures <b>16</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, a single top segment may be slit at about the middle to form a single exit aperture <b>16</b> and two of the four perimeter regions sewn or glued to the bottom segment forming two entry apertures <b>15</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>15</b><i>b</i>. In the preferred embodiment the strap <b>12</b> exits the exit aperture <b>16</b> generally perpendicular to the base <b>14</b>. The slidability of the base <b>14</b> may be adjusted by adjusting the space between the top segment(s) and the bottom segment and/or the size of the entry apertures <b>15</b> and exit aperture(s) <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The windlass <b>18</b> not only allows the strap <b>12</b> to be further tightened and therefore helps restrict blood flow but can also function as a handle to release the tension from the strap <b>12</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> is attached to one end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a</i>, also referred to as the windlass-attached end <b>12</b><i>a </i>or attached end <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and includes an aperture <b>19</b> for slidably mounting the windlass <b>18</b> to the opposing end <b>12</b><i>b</i>, also referred to as the grasping end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Pulling the grasping end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b </i>transfers the windlass <b>18</b> towards the base <b>14</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> can then be rotated or wound, which causes the strap <b>12</b> to decrease the diameter of the closed loop <b>17</b>. Once blood flow is reduced or halted. At least one end of the windlass <b>18</b> may be inserted into a receiving loop <b>20</b>, which is attached to the base <b>14</b>. The receiving loop <b>20</b> prevents a wound windlass <b>18</b> from unwinding. In the preferred embodiment, both ends of the windlass <b>18</b> and a portion of a single receiving loop <b>20</b> include complementary fasteners <b>24</b>, such as interlocking hook and loop structures functioning similar to VELCRO. In this embodiment, the complementary fasteners <b>24</b> assist in securing the windlass <b>18</b> to the receiving loop <b>20</b>. Both ends of the windlass <b>18</b> may be secured by receiving loops <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> After use, the strap <b>12</b> may be loosened using the windlass <b>18</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> may be substantially unwound then grasped and pulled away from base <b>14</b>. Since one end of the strap <b>12</b><i>a </i>is attached to the windlass <b>18</b>, pulling a substantially unwound windlass <b>18</b> also pulls the strap <b>12</b>, which causes slack in the closed loop <b>17</b>. Therefore the strap <b>12</b><i>c </i>loosens from the limb. The strap <b>12</b><i>c </i>can be further loosened by pulling on a portion of the strap <b>12</b><i>c </i>that makes up the closed loop <b>17</b> so long as the windlass is substantially unwound. The limb can then be removed. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The windlass <b>18</b> should be sufficiently strong to withstand the twisting of the strap <b>12</b>. Non-limiting examples of suitable materials include plastic, metal, metal alloy, carbon fiber, wood and the like. Materials that do not rust or are treated with compound to prevent rusting may be preferred if stored or used in a moist environment. In a preferred embodiment aluminum is used. In the preferred embodiment the windlass <b>18</b> has a rod configuration having a length of about six inches and a diameter of about one half inch. The windlass <b>18</b> may be cut to the desired length using conventional cutting techniques known in the manufacturing arts. In the preferred embodiment, the windlass <b>18</b> includes an aperture <b>19</b> positioned generally at the center of the rod. The aperture <b>19</b> should be sufficiently large that the strap <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be slidably inserted therethrough yet be able to force the strap <b>12</b> to twist when the windlass <b>18</b> is wound. In the preferred embodiment the strap <b>12</b> has a width of about one inch and the aperture <b>19</b> is an elongated aperture having a width of about one and one-eighth inch. The aperture <b>19</b> may be formed using conventional drilling or slot forming techniques known in the manufacturing arts. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The receiving loop <b>20</b> prevents a wound windlass <b>18</b> from unwinding. The receiving loop <b>20</b> is attached to the base <b>14</b>. Since the receiving loop <b>20</b> is attached to the base <b>14</b> it is conveniently positioned for a wound windlass <b>18</b>. In other words, the present invention does not require pre-positioning or adjusting the position of the receiving loop <b>20</b> along the strap <b>12</b> during the tightening procedure, which facilitates the rapid and ease of use of the tourniquet <b>10</b>. One or more receiving loops <b>20</b> may be constructed. The receiving loop <b>20</b> may be constructed from any suitable material. The material should be bendable or foldable. Suitable examples of materials include but are not limited to nylon webbing. The receiving loop <b>20</b> may be attached to the base <b>14</b> using any conventional attachment technique such as sewing, gluing, snapping and the like. The receiving loop <b>20</b> may be reinforced with additional material. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> In the preferred embodiment, a first receiving loop <b>20</b> having a diameter of about two to three inches is sewn to the base <b>14</b>. To an inner portion of the first receiving loop <b>20</b><i>a </i>is attached a portion of a hook and loop fastening means <b>24</b> for releasably fastening the windlass <b>18</b>. A second loop <b>20</b><i>b </i>is attached (e.g. sewn) to the base <b>14</b> opposite the end of the first loop <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The second loop <b>20</b><i>b </i>includes an adjustable diameter from about three or four inches to essentially no diameter, which essentially results in the second loop <b>20</b><i>b </i>laying substantially flat along the top surface of the base <b>14</b>. The adjustment of a receiving loop <b>20</b>, such as the provided second receiving loop <b>20</b><i>b</i>, may use any conventional adjusting techniques such as hook and loop, slides, triglide buckles, adjustable clips, slide release buckles and the like. In the preferred embodiment a Fastex LADDERLOC adjusting structure is used for adjusting the second receiving loop <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The present invention also includes a method of using a tourniquet <b>10</b> including providing a tourniquet <b>10</b> of the present invention, inserting a victim's limb through the closed loop <b>17</b>, pulling the end of the strap <b>12</b><i>b </i>opposite the windlass <b>18</b> until the windlass <b>18</b> reaches or nearly reaches the base <b>14</b>, twisting the windlass <b>18</b>, and inserting at least one end of the windlass <b>18</b> into a receiving loop <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> After the desired medical treatment, the windlass <b>18</b> is removed from the receiving loop <b>20</b>. The windlass <b>18</b> is substantially unwound then pulled to provide slack in the closed loop <b>17</b>. The closed loop <b>17</b> is widened to permit exit of the limb. </p>
