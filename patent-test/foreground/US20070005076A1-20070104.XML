<heading level="2" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The invention relates to medical screwdrivers such as those used for inserting a medical screw into bone. More particularly, the invention relates to medical screwdrivers that include a sleeve to isolate a drive shaft of the screwdriver from tissue surrounding an implant site. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Various conditions are treated by implantation of a medical device secured by a screw, the screw being installed using a screwdriver having a powered rotating shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> As an example, urinary incontinence is a condition that occurs in men and women, and that can be treated by installation of a medical implant. In women, urinary incontinence may be caused by urethral hypermobility, a condition in which the bladder neck and proximal urethra may rotate and descend in response to increases in intra-abdominal pressure. Hypermobility can result because of aging, child delivery, or conditions that weaken, stretch, or tear the muscles around the bladder, bladder neck, urethra, or a combination of these. Urinary incontinence can also be caused by intrinsic sphincter deficiency, a condition in which the urethral sphincter does not coapt properly. In males, urinary incontinence may be caused by damage to the urethral sphincter such as can occur after prostatectomy, after radiation treatment, or after pelvic accidents. Other reasons for male incontinence include bladder instability, over-flowing incontinence, and fistulas. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> There are numerous approaches for treating urinary incontinence. In a bladder neck suspension procedure for treating hypermobility, sutures are placed around the muscle groups on either side of the urethra and are affixed to the pubic bone or other supporting structures to reposition and resuspend the proximal urethra. Also common are sling type operations, which may be performed to treat urethral hypermobility, intrinsic sphincter deficiency, or both. In a sling type operation, a sling is placed under the urethra and bladder and is tensioned to elevate and stabilize the urethra, prevent excessive downward mobility, or compress the sphincter to treat intrinsic sphincter deficiency. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In these procedures, sutures are anchored to supporting structures such as the pubic bone, Cooper's ligament, or the rectus fascia. Bone anchor placement devices are often used to place bone anchors at selected insertion sites in the pubic bone. Sutures can then be attached to the bone anchors. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> One type of bone anchor placement device suitable for installing a bone anchor in the pubic bone is a medical screwdriver. One known medical screwdriver is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,260 to Harari et al. The medical screwdriver of Harari et al. includes a body and a drive shaft that has an end that can drive a bone screw. A sleeve or sheath can be used to isolate the drive shaft from surrounding tissue. The sleeve is stationary and prevents the rotating shaft from injuring tissue surrounding a bone into which a screw is inserted. The sleeve includes a key that fits in a notch in the body of the screwdriver. In use, a surgeon connects the sleeve to the body of the screwdriver by aligning the key of the sleeve to the notch in the body of the screwdriver. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The invention provides medical screwdrivers having a sleeve that can be coupled to the body of the medical screwdriver without the need to rotationally align the sleeve to the medical screwdriver. When coupled to the medical screwdriver, the sleeve resists rotation in at least one direction of rotation such as a driving direction of a drive shaft of the medical screwdriver, and functions to isolate the rotating drive shaft from surrounding tissue at a surgical site. A coupling in accordance with the invention between a sleeve and a medical screwdriver can provide multiple functional capabilities. First, such a coupling provides a physical connection between the sleeve and the medical screwdriver. Second, the coupling provides the capability to connect and disconnect the sleeve from the medical screwdriver. This provides for interchangeability between a single medical screwdriver and various sleeve configurations, which may be selected based on a particular surgical procedure or patient anatomy. Third, the coupling functions to position the sleeve with respect to the drive shaft of the medical screwdriver to isolate a portion of the drive shaft from tissue at a surgical site. Additionally, as noted above, the coupling allows the sleeve to be placed in connection with the medical screwdriver regardless of the rotational alignment of the sleeve to the medical screwdriver. Once connected, the sleeve resists rotation in at least one direction. Because of these features, medical screwdrivers in accordance with the invention can be quickly, easily, and reliably configured by a surgeon during a surgical procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> A medical screwdriver in accordance with one aspect of the invention comprises a body portion having a receiver, a drive shaft, a sleeve, and a coupling connecting the sleeve to the receiver. The sleeve surrounds at least a portion of the drive shaft when the sleeve is coupled to the receiver. The coupling comprises an end of the sleeve and the receiver of the body portion. The end of the sleeve and the receiver are designed so that the end of the sleeve can be coupled with the receiver without rotationally aligning the end of the sleeve to the receiver of the body portion. The end of the sleeve and the receiver are also designed so that when connected, the sleeve resists rotation in a rotational direction such as a drive direction of the drive shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> An exemplary coupling in accordance with the invention can include a sleeve having an end that has one or more raised portions, and a receiver having one or opposing surface such as a recessed region (e.g., groove, slot, or channel, for example) that can mate with and operatively cooperate with the one or more raised portions of the end of the sleeve when assembled to form the coupling. Alternately, positions of the raised portion and recessed region may be reversed, with the raised portion being present at the receiver and the recessed portion being present at the sleeve. An example is a coupled mechanism in the form of a one-way ratchet mechanism. Exemplary couplings can be designed so that a recessed region and a raised portion mechanically interfere to resist rotation of the sleeve in at least one direction, such as in a driving direction of the drive shaft. A recessed region and a raised portion can be designed to frictionally interfere with each other or can be designed to interfere by a hard stop. For example, a hard stop may include a surface portion of a recessed region that can contact a surface portion of a raised portion to impede rotation of the sleeve. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> An aspect of the invention relates to a medical screwdriver that includes a body portion having a receiver; a drive shaft having first and second ends, the first end operatively connected to drive means associated with the body portion, the second end adapted to drive a medical screw; a sleeve surrounding at least a portion of the drive shaft; and a coupling comprising an end of the sleeve and the receiver of the body portion, wherein the end of the sleeve is adapted to be coupled with the receiver without rotationally aligning the end of the sleeve to the receiver, and wherein the coupling is adapted to prevent rotation of the sleeve in at least one direction. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In another aspect the invention relates to a medical screwdriver that includes a body portion; a drive shaft having first and second ends, the first end operatively connected to drive means associated with the body portion, the second end adapted to drive a medical screw; and a receiver at an end of the body portion, the receiver comprising a raised portion or a recessed region extending over a portion of a circumference of the receiver, the raised portion or recessed region exhibiting a variable height along the portion of circumference. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In another aspect the invention relates to a sleeve that includes a cylinder having first and second ends, an end comprising a raised portion or a recessed region over a portion of a circumference of the end, the raised portion or recessed region exhibiting a variable height along the portion of circumference. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Another aspect the invention relates to a method of inserting a medical screw at a surgical site. The method includes providing a medical screwdriver body and sleeve as described herein, coupling the end of the sleeve with the receiver of the body portion, and rotating the drive shaft in a driving direction to drive a medical screw, wherein the sleeve does not rotate with the drive shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Another aspect of the invention relates to a combination of articles for use in a surgical procedure. The combination includes a medical screwdriver according to the present description, including a body and a sleeve, and a surgical implant.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> A medical screwdriver as described herein includes a sleeve that covers a rotatable drive shaft of the medical screwdriver. In use, the sleeve prevents the rotating drive shaft from contacting body tissue at a surgical site. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> A sleeve of the invention is prevented from rotating, e.g., in a drive direction of the drive shaft, when the shaft rotates. The sleeve is attached or coupled to a body portion of the medical screwdriver during a medical procedure. Certain prior medical screwdrivers allow for a sleeve to be uniquely aligned or otherwise keyed to the body of the medical screwdriver when attaching the sleeve to the body. Medical screwdrivers described herein do not require unique alignment between a sleeve and body of a medical screwdriver when attaching the sleeve to the body. A medical screwdriver in accordance with the invention includes a sleeve that can be coupled to a body portion of the medical screwdriver without requiring unique rotational alignment between the sleeve and the body portion. When coupled to the medical screwdriver, the sleeve also is prevented from rotating, e.g., in a direction of rotation of the drive shaft. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> According to certain embodiments of the invention, coupling and anti-rotation features of the shaft can be provided by the use of a ratchet mechanism. Ratchet mechanisms are known and may take various forms including ratchet mechanisms that operate by use of a pawl that engages sloping surfaces of a solid or rotating structure such as a tooth or ramp structure of a wheel, bar, etc., permitting motion in one rotational direction only. Examples of such structures are described herein and others will be understood by those of skill in the mechanical arts. Any such ratchet may be useful for providing one-way rotational movement of a sleeve relative to a screwdriver body, when the sleeve and body are engaged as described herein. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> According to certain specific embodiments, a body of a screwdriver includes a circular or cylindrical receiver near the base of the shaft to receive an end of a cylindrical sleeve. The receiver cooperates with the end of the sleeve in a way to provide features as described herein, including the ability to place the sleeve on the shaft and attach the sleeve to the screwdriver body without the need to circumferentially align the sleeve and the screwdriver body, and additionally the feature that the sleeve is prevented from rotating in a direction of rotation of the shaft. The features can be accomplished by various structures between the sleeve and the receiver, with particular examples of useful structures including certain specific ratcheting mechanisms based on structures of the sleeve and the receiver. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> According to certain exemplary ratchet mechanisms, opposing surfaces of the sleeve and receiver can be in the form of raised portions and recessed regions generally located circumferentially over portions of opposing inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the receiver and the sleeve. A ratcheting effect can be achieved, for example, by having one or more opposing surfaces of raised portions and recessed regions exhibit progressively greater height along the portions of the circumferences (wherein &#x201c;height&#x201d; refers to the distance of a raised portion surface from an axial center of a cylindrical sleeve or receiver; and also refers to the distance of the surface of a recessed region from the axial center of a cylindrical sleeve or receiver, which may sometimes also be referred to as a &#x201c;depth&#x201d; of the recess). Exemplary embodiments of raised portions and recessed regions have surfaces that can be considered to be in the form of &#x201c;bumps,&#x201d; &#x201c;ramps,&#x201d; or &#x201c;teeth,&#x201d; extending circumferentially around inner or outer surfaces of a sleeve or a receiver. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In general, ratcheting structures can include cooperative features at opposing surfaces of the receiver and the sleeve, including a recessed region (generally recessed relative to an inner or outer surface of a sleeve or receiver) and an opposing raised portion (generally extending from, or &#x201c;raised,&#x201d; relative to an inner or outer surface of a sleeve or receiver). The recessed region may be part of either the sleeve or the receiver, as desired. Likewise, the opposing raised portion may be part of either the sleeve or the receiver, with a combination of sleeve and receiver including raised portions cooperatively opposed to recessed regions. In other words, in an opposing ratchet mechanism between a receiver and a sleeve, either of the sleeve or the receiver may include raised or &#x201c;male&#x201d; elements of the ratchet mechanism, with an opposing receiver or sleeve including recessed or &#x201c;female&#x201d; elements of the ratchet mechanism. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Additionally, a raised portion of either a sleeve or a receiver may be located at either an inner or outer surface of the sleeve or receiver, just as an opposing recessed region may be located at either an inner or an outer surface of the opposing receiver or sleeve. This means, for example, that the sleeve can fit inside of the receiver, or the sleeve may fit over the receiver, while according to either embodiment the raised portion could be either on the sleeve or the receiver with the opposing recessed region on the receiver or sleeve, respectively. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> As just four possible configurations of opposing ratchet structures, an opposing sleeve and receiver may include: circumferential raised portions on the outside surface of a sleeve, opposing circumferential recessed regions at an inner surface of a receiver; circumferential raised portions on the inside surface of a sleeve, opposing circumferential recessed regions at an outer surface of a receiver; circumferential raised portions on the outside surface of a receiver, opposing circumferential recessed regions at an inner surface of a sleeve; and circumferential recessed regions on the outside surface of a sleeve, opposing circumferential raised portions at an inner surface of a receiver. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> An exemplary medical screwdriver <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Medical screwdriver <b>10</b> comprises body portion <b>12</b> and drive shaft <b>14</b>. Drive shaft <b>14</b> is controllably drivable by a battery-powered motor (not shown) that is located within body portion <b>12</b>. Driving end <b>16</b> of drive shaft <b>14</b> is designed for driving a medical screw or the like (not shown). A medical screwdriver in accordance with the invention may comprise any drive means, known or future developed, capable of controllably driving a drive shaft for driving a medical screw or the like. Such drive means may include, for example, electric, kinematic, pneumatic, and hydraulic driving devices, as well as combinations thereof. A typical medical screwdriver is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,260 to Harari et al., the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Medical screwdriver <b>10</b>, as illustrated, also includes sleeve <b>18</b> attached to body portion <b>12</b>, at receiver <b>22</b>, by coupling <b>20</b>. Coupling <b>20</b> is made up of receiver <b>22</b> and connecting end <b>24</b> (not specifically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of sleeve <b>18</b>. Receiver <b>22</b> is illustrated in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and connecting end <b>24</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Additionally, cross-sectional views of coupling <b>20</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> and described in greater detail below. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> is designed to be capable of being removably coupled with receiver <b>22</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref> generally, connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> comprises distinct raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> designed to cooperatively engage with corresponding recessed regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, and <b>40</b> of receiver <b>22</b>. As shown, raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> circumferentially extend around portions of an outside surface of connecting end <b>24</b>, between first and second ends of each raised portion. Slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> extend lengthwise between ends of raised portions. Also as shown, each raised portion exhibits a progressively (circumferentially) increasing height, to form a ramp or tooth that increasingly extends outwardly from the outside surface of the sleeve between the first and second ends of each raised portion. Other possible embodiments of such raised portions, not illustrated, may have a variable height that does not form a ramp or a tooth; and raised portions that are present at the inner circumference of the sleeve. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b>, as shown, comprises slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> that form an opening through the wall of sleeve <b>18</b> and extend longitudinally along a length of the sleeve. Slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> define end portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> of the connecting end <b>24</b> of the sleeve <b>18</b>, which end portions, along with slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b>, structurally define raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b>, respectively. Slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> allow end portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> to flex inwardly during attachment of sleeve <b>18</b> to receiver <b>22</b>. Slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b>, are illustrative, and useful slits may alternately be not exactly longitudinal (e.g., may slant along their lengths), or may be placed at positions other than the ends of raised portion (e.g., within a raised portion), if desired. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> By designing coupling <b>20</b> as described, connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> can be coupled to receiver <b>22</b> of body portion <b>12</b> without requiring specific rotational alignment between connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> and receiver <b>24</b>. End <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> can have any rotational alignment relative to receiver <b>22</b>, and an effective operative union between sleeve <b>18</b> and body portion <b>12</b> (i.e., at the receiver of body portion <b>12</b>) can be made as described further below. Slits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> can allow end portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> to flex with respect to each other and with respect to the rest of sleeve <b>18</b>. When connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> is pushed into receiver <b>22</b>, end portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> can flex as needed to allow raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> to engage recessed regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, and <b>40</b> of receiver <b>22</b>. That is, connecting end <b>24</b> is allowed to snap into engagement with receiver <b>22</b> due to the flexibility of end portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Sleeve <b>18</b> resists rotation in at least one direction, such as a direction of rotation of drive shaft <b>14</b>, when sleeve <b>18</b> is coupled to body portion <b>12</b>. Sleeve <b>18</b> is designed so that drive shaft <b>14</b> can functionally rotate within sleeve <b>18</b> with minimal resistance. Referring to cross-sectional views of coupling <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, exemplary illustrated coupling <b>20</b> is designed to function as a ratchet mechanism. As shown, raised portion <b>32</b> of end portion <b>56</b> and slits <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> define free end <b>58</b> and interfering end <b>60</b> of raised portion <b>32</b>. Receiver <b>22</b> includes wall portion <b>62</b> associated with recessed region <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that can cooperatively interfere with interfering end <b>60</b> of raised portion <b>32</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> As shown, wall portion <b>62</b> is provided as part of an inside surface of body piece <b>64</b>. It is contemplated, however, that wall portion <b>62</b> can be functionally provided in other ways such as by being defined by a mating surface of a body piece such as body piece <b>66</b>. For example, body portion <b>12</b> of illustrated exemplary medical screwdriver <b>10</b> is formed from first and second body pieces, <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> respectively, assembled to form body portion <b>12</b>. As shown, wall portion <b>68</b> is provided for cooperatively interfering with end portion <b>50</b>, and is designed to function like wall portion <b>62</b> for cooperatively interfering with end portion <b>56</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Wall portion <b>62</b> is designed to engage with interfering end <b>60</b> of raised portion <b>32</b> when sleeve <b>18</b> rotates in a driving direction of drive shaft <b>14</b> (counter-clockwise rotation of sleeve <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to prevent rotation of sleeve <b>18</b> in the direction of drive shaft <b>14</b>. When sleeve <b>18</b> is rotated in the opposite direction (clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), sleeve <b>18</b> may rotate against the ratchet mechanism. This configuration can be used for driving medical screws or the like with a right-handed thread into bone or tissue. Coupling <b>20</b> may also be designed for removing such screws or for driving screws that have a left-handed thread by reversing the configuration of coupling <b>20</b>. In any case, raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> may be similar to raised portion <b>32</b> and recessed regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>40</b> may be similar to recessed region <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b>, and receiver <b>22</b>, do not need to be aligned in any specific or unique rotational manner to functionally couple sleeve <b>18</b> to body portion <b>12</b>. Another aspect of this feature of coupling <b>20</b> can be explained with reference to the cross-sectional view of coupling <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, sleeve <b>18</b> is illustrated in a rotational position with respect to receiver <b>22</b>, that restricts counter-clockwise rotation of sleeve <b>18</b> in receiver <b>22</b>. This prevents sleeve <b>18</b> from rotating together with drive shaft <b>14</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) during use. In the case where sleeve <b>18</b> is coupled to receiver <b>22</b> in a rotational orientation different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a functional coupling will still be made and sleeve <b>18</b> can be rotated to rotationally position sleeve <b>18</b> in receiver <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to prevent further rotation in that direction. This could happen in use when drive shaft <b>14</b> rotates and frictionally drags sleeve <b>18</b> to seat in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (with a surface of a raised portion in physical contact with a surface of a corresponding recessed region). Alternately, a surgeon may give sleeve <b>18</b> a partial counter-clockwise twist to position sleeve <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after sleeve <b>18</b> is initially installed. The degree of rotation needed will depend on the particular design of the coupling including the number of raised portions, end portions, ramps, or teeth, present at the end of a sleeve; the design of the raised portions and recessed regions; and the manner in which a raised portion and a recessed region interact to resist rotation in a particular direction. In any case, connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> and receiver <b>22</b> can be functionally coupled in any rotational alignment. An infinite number of rotational alignments between connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> and receiver <b>22</b> can be used to provide a functional coupling between connection end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b>, and receiver <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Coupling <b>20</b> is exemplary and various modifications to the structure can be made in accordance with the invention. Moreover, coupling <b>20</b> can be adapted to any medical screwdriver, to attach a sleeve to cover at least a portion of a drive shaft. For example, the connecting end of the sleeve can be divided into any number of end portions, and slits can be provided in any way that allow the end portions to flex for connecting the sleeve to the receiver. The material for the sleeve can be any rigid material such as a plastic, having dimensions (size and shape) to fit over the shaft of a mechanical screwdriver, and having a useful wall thickness, e.g., a thickness that provides a desired flexibility to end portions for attaching to a receiver of a screwdriver body. Generally, cross-sectional profiles of raised portions of a sleeve and recessed regions of a receiver can have any desired shape capable of cooperatively mating together as described. The sleeve can be a rigid tubular structure formed as a single sleeve or formed from plural interconnected or otherwise assembled portions. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> In use, a surgeon can attach an exemplary sleeve <b>18</b> to an exemplary body portion <b>12</b> of medical screwdriver <b>10</b> by simply pushing connection end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> into receiver <b>22</b>. This can be done manually. Advantageously, no special tools are needed to attach sleeve <b>18</b> to receiver <b>22</b>. No unique rotational alignment between connecting end <b>24</b> of sleeve <b>18</b> and receiver <b>22</b> is required. This makes for easier and faster attachment of sleeve <b>18</b> to body portion <b>12</b>. Medical screwdriver <b>10</b> can then be used to insert a medical screw into a bone or the like, such as during a procedure to treat urinary incontinence by installation of a urethral sling. Because of the design of coupling <b>20</b>, sleeve <b>18</b> is prevented from rotating together with drive shaft <b>14</b> when the medical screw is implanted, and also isolates drive shaft <b>14</b> from tissue surrounding the implant site. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Medical screwdriver <b>10</b>, including sleeve <b>18</b>, can be provided together with a medical implant such as a sling for use in a procedure for treating urinary incontinence. The combination of medical screwdriver <b>10</b>, sleeve <b>18</b>, and medical implant can be packaged together, if desired, and supplied to a surgeon in that way. Preferably, medical screwdriver <b>10</b>, sleeve <b>18</b>, and medical implant are packaged in a sterile manner so that a surgeon can open the package and use medical screwdriver <b>10</b>, sleeve <b>18</b>, and the medical implant, during a medical procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> Other ways to make a coupling while still maintaining ease of use as described, could be to reverse portions of the design of the coupling, such as by placing cut features (i.e., slits) on receiver <b>22</b> (instead of sleeve <b>18</b>) such that receiver <b>22</b> flexes and sleeve <b>18</b> is solid. Similarly, other configurations of raised portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b>, different from &#x201c;ramps&#x201d; or &#x201c;teeth,&#x201d; could be useful to interface with recessed regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, and <b>40</b>, to perform functions as described herein including the function of preventing rotation of the sleeve in at lease one direction. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments. The foregoing description and examples have been given for clarity of understanding only. No unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. It will be apparent to those skilled in the arts of mechanical screwdrivers and surgical instruments, that changes can be made to the exemplary embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention. </p>
