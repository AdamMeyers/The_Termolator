<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention is related to deployment systems and methods for accurately and rapidly deploying vascular occlusion devices at a preselected location within the vascular system of a patient, and more particularly, deployment approaches that utilize an expanding chemical reaction chamber to facilitate rapid deployment of vascular occlusion devices. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The use of catheter delivery systems for positioning and deploying therapeutic devices, such as dilation balloons, stents and embolic coils, in the vasculature of the human body has become a standard procedure for treating endovascular diseases. It has been found that such devices are particularly useful in treating areas where traditional operational procedures are impossible or pose a great risk to the patient, for example in the treatment of aneurysms in cranial blood vessels. Due to the delicate tissue surrounding cranial blood vessels, especially for example brain tissue, it is very difficult and often risky to perform surgical procedures to treat such a defect. Advancements in catheter deployment systems have provided an alternative treatment in such cases. Some of the advantages of catheter delivery systems are that they provide methods for treating blood vessels by an approach that has been found to reduce the risk of trauma to the surrounding tissue, and they also allow for treatment of blood vessels that in the past would have been considered inoperable. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Typically, these procedures involve inserting the distal end of a delivery catheter into the vasculature of a patient and guiding it through the vasculature to a predetermined delivery site. A vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, is attached to the end of a delivery member which pushes the coil through the catheter and out of the distal end of the catheter into the delivery site. Some of the problems that have been associated with these procedures relate to the accuracy of coil placement. For example, the force of the coil exiting the delivery catheter may cause the coil to over shoot the predetermined site or dislodge previously deployed coils. Also, once the coil is pushed out of the distal end of the catheter, the coil cannot be retracted and may migrate to an undesired location. Often, retrieving and repositioning the coil requires a separate procedure and has the potential to expose the patient to additional risk. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In response to the above mentioned concerns, numerous devices and release mechanisms have been developed in an attempt to provide a deployment system which allows control of the occlusion device after the device has been delivered by the catheter and provides a rapid release or detachment mechanism to release the device once it is in place. One such device is disclosed in Geremia et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,407, which shows a fiber optic cable including a connector device mounted to the end to the optic fiber. An embolic coil is attached to the connector device by a heat releasable adhesive. Laser light is transmitted through the fiber optic cable to increase the temperature of the connector device, which melts the adhesive and releases the embolic coil. One drawback to using this type of system is the potential risk of melted adhesives contaminating the blood stream. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another coil deployment system employs a pusher member having an embolic coil attached to the pusher member by a connector fiber which is capable of being broken by heat, as disclosed in Gandhi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,773. The pusher member of this arrangement includes an electrical resistance heating coil through which the connector fiber is passed. Electrical current is supplied to the heating coil by a power source connected to the heating coil via wires extending through an internal lumen of the pusher. The power source is activated to increase the temperature of the heating coil which breaks the connector fiber. One drawback is that connecting the resistance heating coil to the power source requires running multiple wires through the pusher member. Additionally, the electrical current traveling through the wires may create stray electromagnetic fields that interfere with other surgical and monitoring equipment. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Yet another embolic coil positioning and delivery system is described in Saadat et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,242, which discloses a catheter having a shape memory alloy connector attached to the distal end of the catheter. The connector includes a socket having a pair of spaced-apart fingers which are responsive to a change in temperature. The fingers are bent towards each other and hold a ball which is connected to an end of an embolic coil. The connector absorbs laser light transmitted through an optical cable and transmits the light into heat energy. The heat energy raises the temperature of the connector and opens the fingers, thereby releasing the embolic coil. This type of ball and socket connection is rigid and causes the catheter to be stiff, making it difficult to guide the catheter through the vasculature of the body. This patent, and all other patents and references identified herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Further, all of the above-identified delivery systems require electronic equipment powered by a power source. If the electronic equipment is defective or the power source fails, for example a battery pack fails, the procedure may be prolonged while the equipment is repaired or replaced. Prolonging the procedure may expose the patient to additional risk. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Therefore, a need remains for a rapid release vascular occlusion deployment system or method that does not rely on electrical equipment or a power supply, is simple to manufacture, flexible and easy to guide through the vasculature of the body, provides better control over the occlusion device, and reduces the possibility of interference with other surgical and/or monitoring equipment. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention embodies a deployment system and method for accurately and rapidly deploying a vascular occlusion device at a preselected site within the vasculature of a patient. The deployment system may employ an elongated flexible delivery catheter for guiding a deployment unit to the preselected site. The deployment unit includes a delivery tube or pusher that pushes and guides the vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, through the delivery catheter to the preselected site. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> The pusher may include an internal lumen which has an opening at the distal end of the pusher. The occlusion device includes a portion, such as a headpiece, which is removeably disposed within the opening by a friction fit between the headpiece and the inner surface of the pusher. This arrangement maintains the connection between the occlusion device and the deployment unit until the desired deployment. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> A reaction chamber is positioned with the lumen of the pusher. The reaction chamber includes an expandable wall adjacent the headpiece of the occlusion device. Two reactants are mixed within the chamber to create a product that expands to a volume greater than the original reactants. The product pushes against the expandable wall of the chamber which in turn contacts the headpiece. The force of the expandable wall against the headpiece overcomes the functional force between the headpiece and the inner wall of the lumen, forcing the headpiece out of the opening, thereby deploying the vascular occlusion device. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriate manner. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally illustrates a preferred embodiment of the vascular occlusion device deployment system of the present invention. The deployment system, generally designated at <b>10</b>, includes an elongated flexible guiding catheter <b>12</b> which is inserted into the vasculature of a patient and used to guide a deployment unit, generally designed <b>14</b>, to a preselected site in a manner generally known in the art. The deployment system <b>14</b> includes an elongated flexible pusher or delivery tube <b>16</b> having a proximal end portion <b>18</b> and a distal end portion <b>20</b>. An internal lumen <b>22</b> extends from the proximal end portion <b>18</b> to the distal end portion <b>20</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. A vascular occlusion device <b>24</b>, generally illustrated as an embolic coil, is removeably disposed within an opening <b>26</b> (which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the lumen <b>22</b> at the distal end <b>20</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The lumen <b>22</b> includes a reaction chamber <b>28</b> located proximal the opening <b>26</b> of the lumen. One embodiment of this reaction chamber <b>28</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the reaction chamber is defined by a proximal wall <b>30</b>, a distal wall <b>32</b> and an inner surface <b>34</b> of the pusher. The reaction chamber <b>28</b> typically has an axial length between about 3 millimeters and about 6 millimeters. An intermediate wall <b>36</b> is located between the proximal wall <b>30</b> and the distal wall <b>32</b> to divide the reaction chamber <b>28</b> into a first chamber <b>38</b> and a second chamber <b>40</b>. Each of the chambers <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> has an axial length preferably between about 1 millimeter and about 5 millimeters. The respective chambers need not have identical axial lengths. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The proximal wall <b>30</b> and the intermediate wall <b>36</b> are comprised of a piercable membrane. The distal wall <b>32</b> is comprised of an elastic expandable membrane. Preferably, the distal wall is a membrane made of a silicone elastomer having substantial flexibility and elasticity. The other membranes also can be made of a silicone polymer. The materials used in forming the proximal wall <b>30</b>, distal wall <b>36</b> and intermediate wall <b>32</b> should be selected as not to significantly degrade while in contact with the reactant materials. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Typically, the respective membranes will have different Durometer hardness values. For example, the proximal wall <b>30</b> and the intermediate wall <b>36</b> preferably are made of a higher Durometer polymer than the distal wall <b>32</b>. Further, the membranes or walls <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>36</b> of this embodiment may be attached to the inner surface <b>34</b> of the pusher <b>16</b> by an adhesive, such as a silicone or cyanoacrylate adhesive, or by any other suitable manner. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> A first reactant <b>42</b> is housed within the first chamber <b>38</b> and a second reactant <b>44</b> is housed within the second chamber <b>40</b>. When the first and second reactants <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are mixed, they produce a product which has a greater volume than the combined volume of the first and second reactants prior to mixing. The first and second reactants <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> can be any reactants that produce a product having a greater volume than the original compositions. Preferably, the first and second reactants may be any of the reactants disclosed in Cooke et al. WO 92/09651, hereby incorporated herein by reference, which produce a polycyanoacrylate foam. In particular, the first reactant is preferably a mixture of cyanoacrylate monomer and ethanol and the second reactant is preferably a mixture of ethanol and N,N-Dimethyl-p-toluidine. Other reactant materials, that when combined form a foam material with an increased bulk volume relative to the reactants, such as precursors for polyurethane foam are also suitable. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The delivery unit <b>14</b> also includes a piercing member <b>46</b>, generally illustrated as a mandrel. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the piercing member <b>46</b> includes a pointed tip <b>48</b> for piercing the proximal wall <b>30</b> and the intermediate wall <b>36</b>. Illustratively, the piercing member <b>46</b> may be axially advanced and retracted through the lumen <b>22</b> by a control cable <b>50</b> that is attached to the proximal end of the piercing member <b>46</b>. A control handle <b>52</b> may be connected to the proximal end of the cable <b>50</b> to facilitate such movement. Alternatively, the control cable <b>50</b> may take the form of a rod, wire or tubular member with sufficient flexibility and pushability to navigate through lumen <b>22</b>, as well as, controllably advance piercing member <b>46</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The illustrated vascular occlusion device <b>24</b> includes a portion or headpiece <b>45</b> which is sized and shaped to be removeably disposed within the opening <b>26</b> at the distal end <b>20</b> of the pusher <b>16</b> so that a proximal end <b>47</b> of the headpiece <b>45</b> is adjacent the distal wall <b>32</b> of the chamber <b>28</b>. The headpiece <b>45</b> is preferably held in place by a friction fit with the inner surface <b>34</b> of the pusher until the desired time of deployment, as will be discussed herein. Alternatively, the headpiece <b>45</b> may by held in place by a relatively weak biocompatible adhesive or by any other suitable manner. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> As stated above, the occlusion device <b>24</b> may be an embolic coil which may take various forms and configurations, and may also be filled with a fibrous material or may be coated with a beneficial substance, such as a biogel to promote clotting. Alternatively, the occlusion device also may be any other occlusive device or approach known in the art such as hydrogels, foams, bioactive coils, braids, cables and hybrid devices. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> A second embodiment of the delivery unit <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. This embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except that the reaction chamber <b>51</b> comprises a unit that is separate from the pusher member, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and positioned within the pusher member. Illustratively, the reaction chamber <b>51</b> comprises a cylindrical housing <b>52</b> having a sidewall <b>54</b>, a proximal wall or membrane <b>56</b> and a distal wall or membrane <b>58</b>. Similar to the first embodiment, the reaction chamber <b>51</b> is separated into two chambers <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> by an intermediate wall or membrane <b>60</b>. The proximal wall <b>56</b>, the distal wall <b>58</b> and the intermediate wall <b>60</b> are preferably of the same material and construction as described above in the previous embodiment. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> The reaction chamber <b>51</b> is located proximal to the opening <b>26</b> of the lumen <b>22</b> so that the distal wall <b>58</b> of the reaction chamber <b>51</b> is adjacent the proximal end <b>47</b> of the headpiece <b>45</b> of the occlusion device <b>24</b>. As previously described, the materials used to form the reaction chamber should be relatively unaffected and not significantly degrade when in contact with the reactant materials. The chamber <b>51</b> may be held in place by an adhesive, such as a silicone or cyanoacrylate adhesive. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In operation, the catheter <b>12</b> is inserted into the vasculature of the patient and positioned at a preselected location, typically in conjunction with other devices and professional procedures as generally known in the art. The delivery unit <b>14</b> is inserted into the catheter <b>12</b>, and once the desired location is reached, the delivery unit <b>14</b> is advanced and/or the catheter <b>12</b> is moved in a retrograde manner such that the delivery unit moves with respect to and within the catheter until the occlusion device <b>24</b> moves through the catheter <b>12</b> and out of the distal end of the catheter. During the procedure and before the occlusion device <b>24</b> has been deployed, if it is determined that the distal end of the catheter <b>12</b> or the occlusion device <b>24</b> is not in the correct location, the occlusion device may be retrieved back into the distal end of the catheter by retracting the delivery unit <b>14</b> proximally or advancing the catheter distally. Once the occlusion device as been retrieved, the catheter and/or the occlusion device may be repositioned. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> When the occlusion device <b>24</b> is in the correct position, the piercing member <b>46</b> may be advanced distally within the lumen <b>22</b> by manipulating the control handle <b>52</b> and cable <b>50</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the piercing member <b>46</b> is advanced until the tip <b>48</b> pierces the proximal membrane or wall <b>30</b> and the intermediate wall <b>36</b> of the chamber <b>28</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, piercing member <b>46</b> is slightly retracted to allow the first reactant <b>42</b> and the second reactant <b>44</b> to mix. The proximal wall <b>30</b> is shown as a self-sealing wall which seals around the piercing element <b>46</b> after the piercing element has pierced the proximal wall so that the reactants are prevented from leaking out of the chamber <b>28</b>. The first and second reactants <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> mix to form a product <b>43</b> which has a greater volume than the first and second reactants. The expanding volume of the product <b>43</b> forces the lower durometer distal wall <b>32</b> of the reaction chamber to expand or stretch distally within the lumen, contacting the proximal end <b>47</b> of the headpiece <b>45</b> and forcing the headpiece <b>45</b> out of the opening <b>26</b>, thereby deploying the occlusion device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Another embodiment of the delivery unit <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Illustratively, the reaction chamber <b>60</b> is formed of a single unit and may be attached within the lumen <b>22</b> at a location and in a manner as described above. The reaction chamber <b>60</b> has a proximal wall <b>62</b> and a distal wall <b>64</b> which are comprised of polymers as described above. Alternatively, the reaction chamber <b>60</b> may be similar to that which is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in that a portion of the reaction chamber <b>28</b> is defined by the inner surface <b>34</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> A dual-lumen dispending tube <b>66</b> extends into the reaction chamber <b>60</b> preferably through the proximal wall <b>62</b>. The dual-lumen dispending tube <b>66</b> includes a first reactant <b>42</b> in a first lumen <b>68</b> and a second reactant <b>44</b> in a second lumen <b>70</b>. Each lumen <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> preferably is closed at a distal location by a breakable seal <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. The first and second reactants <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are the same as described above in the previous embodiments and form a product which has a greater volume than the original compositions. The dual-lumen dispensing tube <b>66</b> is preferably plunger activated, but may also be activated by any other acceptable method known in the art. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> In operation, the previously described procedure is employed to place the occlusion device <b>24</b> at a preselected site within the vasculature of the patient. Once the occlusion device <b>24</b> is at the desired location, the dispensing tube <b>66</b> is activated, and the first reactant <b>42</b> and the second reactant <b>44</b> are dispensed out the dispensing tube <b>66</b> into the reaction chamber <b>60</b>. The reactants <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> mix together and react to form a product which has a larger volume than the original reactants. As the product expands, the product stretches the lower Durometer and/or flexible distal wall <b>64</b> of the reaction chamber <b>60</b> toward the opening <b>26</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. The expanding distal wall <b>64</b> contacts the headpiece <b>45</b> of the occlusion device <b>24</b>, and forces headpiece <b>45</b> out of the opening <b>26</b>. Alternatively the dispensing tube <b>66</b> may include additional lumens of which one may serve as a vent lumen <b>74</b> to reaction chamber <b>60</b> to prevent the build up of fluid pressure within the reaction chamber when dispensing the reactants. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> It will be understood that the embodiments of the present invention which have been described are illustrative of some of the applications of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, including those combinations of features that are individually disclosed or claimed herein. </p>
