Sklar for KNOTLESS SUTURE ANCHOR (Attorney's Docket No. SKLAR-32A PROV), which patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to surgical devices in general, and more particularly to suture anchors of the sort adapted to anchor a piece of conventional suture in bone. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Numerous devices are currently available to attach objects to bone. More particularly, screws, staples, cement and sutures have all been used to attach soft tissue (e.g., ligaments, tendons, muscles, etc.), bone and inanimate objects (e.g., prostheses) to bone. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In certain situations it is desirable to anchor a piece of conventional suture in the bone, so that the suture can be used to attach the desired object (e.g., a ligament or prosthesis) to the bone. This is traditionally accomplished by forming a hole in the host bone and then positioning a suture anchor in the hole, with the suture anchor securing the suture to the host bone. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Traditionally, suture anchors have anchored one end of the suture in bone, with the free end of the suture engaging the tissue, and then the suture is knotted so as to hold the tissue in place. Unfortunately, however, it can be difficult and/or inconvenient to knot the suture when access to the surgical site is limited, e.g., as in the case of an arthroscopic procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> As a result, one object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved suture anchor which can be used to attach an object to bone without requiring that a knot be tied. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> And another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved suture anchor which is easy and convenient to use and which provides significant holding strength. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> These and other objects of the present invention are achieved through the provision and use of a novel suture anchor which preferably comprises a sheath or outer expandable member (hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as a &#x201c;sheath&#x201d;) capable of assuming two different configurations, (i) a first configuration having a reduced cross-sectional diameter, and (ii) a second configuration having an enlarged cross-sectional diameter. The sheath or member is positioned in the bone tunnel while in its first, reduced configuration, with the suture positioned between the sheath and the wall of the bone tunnel, and then the sheath is transitioned into its second, expanded configuration, so that the suture is captured between the wall of the bone tunnel and the wall of the expanded sheath. By properly attaching the suture to the object which is to be captured to the bone, and by properly positioning the suture vis-&#xe0;-vis the sheath before the sheath is secured in the bone tunnel, an object can be secured to the bone without tying any knots. An expansion screw or mandrel or pin or other element may be used to expand the sheath or member when it is in the bone tunnel. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Looking first at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown an object <b>5</b> (e.g., a rotator cuff) which is to be secured to a bone <b>10</b>. In accordance with the present invention, this is accomplished through the use of a suture <b>15</b> and a novel suture anchor assembly <b>20</b>. Suture anchor assembly <b>20</b> in turn comprises a sheath <b>25</b> and an expansion screw <b>30</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Sheath <b>25</b> is formed out of a flexible or expandable material and is capable of assuming two different configurations, (i) a first configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) having a reduced cross-sectional diameter, and (ii) a second configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) having an enlarged cross-sectional diameter. Preferably sheath <b>25</b> has a pair of diametrically-opposing side grooves <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) running the length of sheath <b>25</b>, and a bottom groove <b>40</b> spanning the diameter of sheath <b>25</b> at the bottom end of the sheath. Side grooves <b>35</b> and bottom groove <b>40</b> together form a seat for suture <b>15</b> so that the suture can be controlled during insertion into the bone tunnel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, bottom groove <b>40</b> may be u-shaped to capture sutures. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Sheath <b>25</b> may be formed out of plastic or absorbable material. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In use, a bone tunnel <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is formed in the host bone, suture anchor assembly <b>20</b> is positioned in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</figref> and <b>5</b>, suture <b>15</b> is passed through the object <b>5</b> (e.g., a rotator cuff) which is to be attached to the bone <b>10</b>, the two free ends of the suture are placed parallel to one another and tensioned so as to pull object <b>5</b> into position relative to bone <b>10</b> and then, while tension is maintained on the suture, driver <b>50</b> is used to maneuver suture anchor assembly <b>20</b> so that sheath <b>25</b> is inserted into bone tunnel <b>45</b>, with suture <b>15</b> seated in side grooves <b>35</b> and bottom groove <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</figref> and <b>6</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, suture <b>15</b> may be tensioned at point <b>52</b>. Driver <b>50</b> is used to advance expansion screw <b>30</b> into sheath <b>25</b>, whereby to expand sheath <b>25</b> into its second, expanded state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) and thereby secure suture <b>15</b> to the wall of bone tunnel <b>45</b>. In this way object <b>5</b> may be secured to bone <b>10</b> without the necessity of tying knots in suture <b>15</b>. If desired, several such arrangements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) may be used to secure object <b>5</b> to bone <b>10</b>. Also, sheath <b>25</b> prevents screw <b>30</b> from damaging or twisting suture <b>15</b> during insertion. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show additional aspects of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> These may include: </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> (1) Anti-rotation of sheath: vertically ribbed; </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> (2) Quicker screw insertion: high pitch of screw threads; </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> (3) Tunnel dilation for soft bone: decreased slippage; </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> (4) Slot in sheath: edge of tunnel abrasion reduction; and </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> (5) Sheath thicker at tip: increased diameter at bottom of tunnel. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> If desired, fins or tabs or other elements (not shown) may be added to the body of sheath <b>25</b> so as to help hold sheath <b>25</b> against rotation in bone tunnel <b>45</b> while expansion screw <b>30</b> is deployed. In the case of a pin or mandrel, the desirability for anti-rotation tabs may be obviated or reduced. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> And expansion screw <b>30</b> can have a high pitch rate so as to facilitate quick insertion of the screw into sheath <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Furthermore, if desired, bone tunnel <b>45</b> can be formed using a bone tunnel dilator (not shown) so as to compact the host bone and thereby form a more stable wall for the bone tunnel, whereby to enhance fixation. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Also, a slot (not shown) can be formed in the outer wall of sheath <b>25</b>, so as to provide a space to accommodate the suture: this can help reduce suture abrasion, particularly at the top end of the bone tunnel. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> And sheath <b>25</b> can be formed with a thicker wall at the top end of the device, so as to assist fixation. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Also, suture <b>15</b> can have an repeating pattern of expansions, can be made especially coarse or can carry a sleeve, etc. about a portion of its length so as to increase its effective diameter and thereby facilitate gripping by sheath <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> And sheath <b>25</b> can include ribbing or roughening along a portion of its exterior so as to facilitate gripping of suture <b>15</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Looking next at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, in another preferred form of the invention, the bottom end of sheath <b>25</b> is formed with a pair of projections or posts <b>60</b>. In this arrangement, suture <b>15</b> may be placed between posts <b>60</b> and then the sheath rotated so as to help wrap suture <b>15</b> about the sheath, whereby to help hold suture <b>15</b> more stable relative to sheath <b>25</b> during insertion into bone tunnel <b>45</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>, it is also possible to form sheath <b>25</b> with one or more fracture lines (or break points) <b>65</b> along its length, so that the bottom end of the sheath may expand outwardly when expansion screw <b>30</b> is advanced into sheath <b>25</b>. Furthermore, the side walls of sheath <b>25</b> may include longitudinal channels <b>70</b> for receiving suture <b>15</b>; channels <b>70</b> help seat suture <b>15</b> to the sheath during insertion of the sheath into the bone tunnel and then, when expansion screw <b>30</b> is advanced into the interior of sheath <b>25</b>, channels <b>70</b> collapse so as to help secure suture <b>15</b> to sheath <b>25</b> and reduce the dependence by the device upon the interference fit between the expanded sheath and the bone tunnel wall for securing the suture against slippage. Channels <b>70</b> are thinner walled to allow crimping when screw is inserted. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Looking next at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-22</figref>, it is also possible to form sheath <b>25</b> so that its channels <b>70</b> include a living hinge <b>75</b>; as a result, when expansion screw <b>30</b> expands sheath <b>25</b>, suture <b>15</b> is captured between the closing elements located on either side of living hinge <b>75</b>, achieving the same end result as mentioned in the paragraph immediately above, i.e., capturing the sutures within the sheath itself. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> And looking next at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>, it will be seen that it is also possible to form sheath <b>25</b> with a relatively rigid body and helical threads <b>80</b>, so that it effectively forms a hollow screw, and to form screw <b>30</b> with a diametrical hole <b>85</b>. With this construction, sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b> is set in the bone tunnel, the suture <b>15</b> is passed through screw hole <b>85</b> and tensioned, and then screw <b>30</b> is advanced into sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b> so as to capture suture <b>15</b> to sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b>. Thus sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b> is first placed in the bone and then effectively serves as a seat for receiving screw <b>30</b>, with the screw <b>30</b> capturing the suture to the sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b>. Alternatively, the suture may be wrapped around a smooth bore portion of the screw <b>30</b>, whose threads would be distal, and may be tightened onto sheath (or hollow screw) <b>25</b>, thus securing the suture against slippage. </p>
