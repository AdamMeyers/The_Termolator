<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to systems for dissecting and/or retracting tissue. More particularly, the present invention relates to apparatus and methods for dissecting layers of tissue as well as retracting tissue regions and organs. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Conventional instruments and methods for obtaining access to regions within the body by dissecting tissue and retracting tissue and organs have been previously accomplished through various mechanical methods. Previous devices have included expandable tissue dissectors and retractors used for dissecting or moving sub-surface tissue in arthroscopic and endoscopic surgery percutaneously introduced into a patient through small incisions made in the skin. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Many of these devices are configured to simply expand from a low profile into an expanded profile to simply provide a surface, whether by an expanded structure or via a sheath or covering, for retracting tissue regions within the body. Other devices are also expandable into an expanded profile to not only provide a retraction surface but also to dissect sub-surface regions of tissue. In either case, these devices are typically configured to mechanically expand in a number of different planes while other devices are configured to expand within a single plane. Most of these tools are mechanically expandable in a number of different configurations, for example, expandable mechanical trusses, pivoting interleaved configurations, projecting loops, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Still other devices have utilized expandable balloons which are inflated within the patient through various methods. Generally, expansion is accomplished by inflating the balloon with a fluid or a gas, e.g., carbon dioxide, water, saline, etc., until the balloon is sufficiently expanded. Such balloons have also been utilized for retraction of organs and tissue regions once expanded. However, such balloons are typically lacking because they generally lack sufficient rigidity and cannot be controlled to conform to various sizes or shapes for precise application. Moreover, adequate retraction of tissue can only be accomplished when the balloon is fully expanded. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Accordingly, there is a need for instruments which are sufficiently minimally invasive for passage into a patient and which are also sufficiently rigid and precisely controllable. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> An instrument which enables a surgeon to obtain access within a patient's body through controlled dissection between tissue layers may be advanced percutaneously through one or more incisions made in a patient's skin or through an open surgical procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Such a tissue dissection assembly may generally comprise an elongate body shaft, an actuation member movable relative to the elongate body shaft, and at least one dissector arm member having at least a first end attached to the elongate body shaft, wherein the at least one dissector arm member is adapted to reconfigure within a plane from a low profile to an expanded profile when urged via the actuation member, and wherein the at least one dissector arm is further adapted to dissect tissue within the plane. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In use, such a tissue dissection assembly for dissecting tissue within a plane or along a line may be utilized generally by advancing the elongate body shaft into a tissue region to be dissected, urging the at least one dissector arm member positioned adjacent to or within the tissue region to reconfigure within a plane from a low profile to an expanded profile by moving the actuation member relative to the elongate body shaft, and dissecting the tissue region along the plane via the at least one dissector arm member. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The tissue dissection assembly may include a number of optional features as well. For instance, although a single dissector arm member may be utilized in some variations, at least an additional dissector arm member may be utilized and positioned along the actuation shaft and the elongate body shaft on an opposing side of the dissector arm member. Dissector arm members may extend in opposing directions along a single plane into a dissecting configuration; alternatively, the arm members may be positioned such that they extend or reconfigure themselves along different planes relative to one another. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> As the arm members deploy from their low profile shape, they may be locked into their expanded configuration or any intermediate configuration via a locking mechanism. Moreover, to facilitate insertion of the device through the tissue, a tapered or piercing distal tip, which may be optionally retractable, removable, or integrated as a permanent feature of the device, may also be included. When the dissector arm members are in their low profile configuration with respect to the actuation shaft, the arm members may simply lie adjacent to the actuation shaft. Alternatively, the actuation shaft may define openings along a length of the actuation shaft adjacent to their respective arm members for receiving, at least partially within, their respective dissector arm members. In yet another alternative, the actuation shaft or elongate body shaft may be formed into a member having a cross-sectional shape other than circular or tubular. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Actuation and locking of the arm members may be accomplished in a number of different ways. For instance, a handle assembly coupled to a proximal end of the actuation and/or elongate body shaft may be configured to advance and retract the arm members in a ratcheting manner to maintain one or more intermediate configurations of the arm members during expansion. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In another variation, the elongate body shaft may include a shaft distal portion which is configured to pivot at an angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the elongate shaft. The pivoting end effector may be angled anywhere from 0 degrees to under 180 degrees to facilitate access and deployment within the patient body. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The dissector arm members themselves may be configured into various cross-sectional geometries. Additionally, any of the dissector arm members may be coated or covered with a compliant material to alter the frictional properties of the dissector arm surfaces with respect to the tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In yet another variation of the tissue dissector assembly, a pump may be fluidly connected to the assembly to provide for insufflation/exsufflation of a gas or fluid (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, saline, water, etc.) directly through the elongate body. This gas or fluid may be used before, during, or after mechanical dissection to alternatively initiate, enhance, or support dissection or to maintain or expand a dissected space. Yet another variation may include a viewing or imaging port at a distal end of the assembly or alternatively along the elongate body or even through one or more of the dissector arm members to provide for direct visualization during insertion into the tissue and during dissection. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In another variation, a light source may be provided through the assembly directly. In yet another variation, an optional covering or membrane may be disposed over the dissector arms to form a surface which expands and retracts along with the arms. Tissue retraction may be performed without the covering or membrane at all and with the dissector arms in any number of expanded configurations, i.e., fully or any number of intermediate expanded configurations.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> Although a single dissector arm member <b>22</b> may be utilized in some variations, at least an additional dissector arm member <b>24</b> may be utilized and positioned as shown along actuation shaft <b>18</b> and elongate body shaft <b>12</b> on an opposing side of dissector arm member <b>22</b>. Dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be positioned along assembly <b>10</b>, e.g., at 180 degrees with respect to one another, so that when they are actuated to deploy, arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may extend in opposing directions along a single plane into a dissecting configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Alternatively, arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be positioned such that they extend or reconfigure themselves along different planes, as further described below. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> Each of the arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be fabricated from a biocompatible material such as flexible or compliant metal, e.g., spring stainless steel or a superelastic or shape memory alloy such as Nitinol, so that once arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> have been reconfigured from their low profile shape to their expanded shape, the arms may collapse back into their low profile. Alternatively, arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be fabricated from inflexible or partially flexible metals or polymers which are connected via one or more hinges, e.g., pivoted hinges or living hinges, etc., along the length of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to enable reconfiguration of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. In yet another alternative, arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be fabricated from any number of flexible polymeric materials, e.g., polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyamide, etc. Moreover, these flexible polymeric arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be optionally fabricated to be translucent such that tissue being dissected and/or retracted may be visualized directly through the translucent arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> from within the patient body utilizing any number of imagers, as further described below. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> As arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> deploy from their low profile shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, they may locked into their expanded configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, or any intermediate configuration via locking mechanism <b>28</b>, which may be located along elongate body shaft <b>12</b>, actuation shaft <b>18</b>, or handle <b>16</b>. To release the locked configuration of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, locking mechanism <b>28</b> may be re-depressed. Locking mechanism <b>28</b> is shown as a push-button mechanism, however, any number of conventional locking mechanisms for maintaining the relative position of actuation shaft <b>18</b> with respect to elongate body shaft <b>12</b> may be utilized, e.g., friction locks, ratcheting mechanisms (as shown below), pin locks, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> In use, one method may generally comprise inserting the assembly <b>10</b> into a patient body <b>40</b> through an incision <b>42</b>, e.g., through a patient's umbilicus and into the abdominal wall as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, with arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> in their low profile configuration. The atraumatic tip <b>20</b> of the device may prevent unnecessary trauma to the surrounding tissue as the device is inserted blindly, under direct vision, or through a separate videoscope. In other variations, a videoscope or imager may be integrated or included within the device, as described below in further detail. In either case, the device may be pushed, e.g., towards the pubic bone, while maintaining a presence within a desired tissue plane. Once the tissue plane is to be dissected, handle <b>16</b> may be advanced with respect to elongate body shaft <b>12</b> such that arm member <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are expanded to thereby dissect the surrounding tissue along the desired tissue plane, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. </p>

Arm member <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may then be expanded, either fully or to an intermediate position, to thereby dissect the surrounding tissue TI from one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. Expansion of arm member <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be continued or retracted to thereby leave an open region D between adjacent tissue layers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The arm member <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may also be deployed and retracted as many times as necessary until the desired degree of tissue separation or dissection has occurred. Additionally, the device may be applied in a sweeping motion, e.g., left-to-right, or rotated about its longitudinal axis by any number of degrees until the tissue planes have been appropriately separated. Moreover, insufflation of a gas or fluid may optionally be utilized through a separate instrument or through the assembly itself to further aid tissue dissection, as described below in further detail. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> Aside from use for dissection of tissue surrounding the peritoneal space, the assembly may be utilized in a number of different regions throughout the body. For example, the device may be inserted into the body for providing access to the kidneys in the extra-peritoneal space, to the prostate in the pre-peritoneal space, or for providing vascular access. The assembly may also be utilized for providing access to regions in the legs, arms, etc., as so desired. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> To facilitate insertion of the device through the tissue, a tapered or piercing distal tip <b>50</b> may be included, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. This piercing distal tip <b>50</b> may be optionally retractable, removable, or integrated as a permanent feature of the device. The dissector arm members may be configured to expand from a low profile into an expanded profile having any number of expanded configurations. For instance, as mentioned above, the distal ends of dissector arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be attached to the distal end or portion of actuation shaft <b>18</b> via a securement member <b>52</b>, e.g., band, ring, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, or the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be simply attached directly into receiving channels or via an adhesive in other variations. Allowing for such a non-pivoting attachment may allow for arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to conform into a symmetrically arcuate or curved configuration. Alternatively, the dissector arms may be pivotably connected via a pivot or pinned connection <b>58</b> which may allow for arm members <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> to conform into an asymmetric curve, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> In yet another alternative, arm members <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> may be connected via pivot or pinned connection <b>64</b> while actuation shaft <b>18</b> is overdriven with respect to elongate body shaft <b>12</b>. Overdriving actuation shaft <b>18</b> may conform arm members <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> into an overextended arcuate configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. In another variation, a single dissector arm <b>66</b> may be utilized to form a single looped configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. A first end of looped arm <b>66</b> may be connected at a fixed attachment point <b>70</b> and a second end of looped arm <b>66</b> may be connected at a fixed attachment point <b>72</b> to an actuation shaft which is translatably disposed with respect to elongate body shaft <b>12</b>. Translation of the actuation shaft relative to elongate body shaft <b>12</b> may deploy looped arm <b>66</b> from its low profile configuration into its fully deployed configuration, or into any number of intermediate positions or configurations by moving a single side of dissector arm <b>66</b> in the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, an example of an instrument similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is shown. A single looped dissector arm may be employed, but in this variation, two separate dissector arms <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are illustrated rotatingly joined via rotating attachment <b>73</b>. Each of the dissector arms <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may extend entirely through shaft <b>12</b> and attach directly to a handle <b>78</b>, which may be urged distally and proximally in the directions shown to expand or retract dissector arms <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, as shown by their respective arrows. In this variation, because the proximal ends of dissector arms <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are attached directly to the handle, an actuation shaft may be omitted entirely. Other features, e.g., locking mechanisms or ratcheting mechanisms described herein, may be integrated in combination with this embodiment, as so desired. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> In alternative variations, each of the dissector arm members may attached in alternating methods. For instance, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a first dissector arm <b>22</b> may be connected via a pivoting attachment <b>80</b> while the second arm dissector arm <b>24</b> may be attached to securement member <b>52</b> via a non-pivoting attachment such that each arm <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> conforms to a different configuration. In yet another alternative shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, each of the distal ends of the dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may comprise a looped connector <b>84</b> which slides along a looped attachment member <b>82</b> positioned at the distal end of actuation shaft <b>18</b>. When actuation shaft <b>18</b> is thus actuated, each of the dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may slidingly rotate about looped attachment member <b>82</b> in a non-pivoting manner to expand the arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows a detailed side view of the looped attachment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.

Looped connectors <b>84</b> at the distal ends of dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may slide along looped attachment member <b>82</b>. Although the looped attachment member <b>82</b> is shown in this variation as a circular member, other configurations may be utilized, as practicable. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> shows a semi-circular attachment member <b>88</b> over which angled connectors <b>86</b> located at the distal ends of dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may slide over or upon. Other shapes for attachment members may also include elliptical, angled, straight, triangular, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> Another variation for arm member connection is shown in the detail partial cross-sectional top view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> of actuation shaft <b>18</b> and rotational connection <b>90</b> of the interleaved distal ends of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. As illustrated in the partial perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the distal ends of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be formed into an interleaved element or member <b>92</b> which together form a complementary and rotational connection, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. When the two arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are interleaved with one another, they may be securely held within actuation shaft <b>18</b> while also allowing for free rotation with respect to one another without the need for a pivot joint or connection. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Yet another variation for arm member connection is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C</figref> to <b>5</b>E, which shows a keyed connection for the arm members. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a keyed attachment housing <b>94</b> may be disposed at a distal end of actuation shaft <b>18</b> and have distal ends of dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> slidingly connected within housing <b>94</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> shows a side view of attachment housing <b>94</b>, which, in one variation, may be comprised of individual corresponding half members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B which may be connected to one another and/or to actuation shaft <b>18</b> in a corresponding complementary attachment. Members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B connected to actuation shaft <b>18</b> may define a slot <b>96</b> between the corresponding members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B through which the dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may traverse when expanding or retracting. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> shows an exploded assembly view of the attachment housing members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B and the keyed distal ends <b>93</b>A, <b>93</b>B of their respective dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Keyed channels, slots, or grooves <b>98</b>A, <b>98</b>B may be defined within attachment housing member <b>94</b>A while corresponding channels, slots, or grooves <b>99</b>A, <b>99</b>B may be likewise defined within attachment housing member <b>94</b>B. When attachment housing members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B are correspondingly positioned relative to one another, each of the slots <b>98</b>A, <b>98</b>B may face in apposition to their respective slots <b>99</b>A, <b>99</b>B such that the distal end of dissector arm member <b>22</b> having a bearing or sliding member <b>93</b>A may be keyed to traverse within the apposed slots <b>98</b>A and <b>99</b>A. Likewise, the distal end of dissector arm member <b>24</b>, also having a corresponding bearing or sliding member <b>93</b>B, may be keyed to traverse within the apposed slots <b>98</b>B and <b>99</b>B. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> Each of the apposed slots <b>98</b>A, <b>99</b>A and <b>98</b>B, <b>99</b>B may be defined in a curved or arcuate path within their respective attachment housing members <b>94</b>A, <b>94</b>B such that when dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are expanded or retracted during a procedure, their bearing or sliding members <b>93</b>A, <b>93</b>B may freely slide securely within their respective slots. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> When the dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are in their low profile configuration with respect to the actuation shaft <b>18</b>, the arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may simply lie adjacent to actuation shaft <b>18</b>, as shown in the partial cross-sectional end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, when in their low profile configuration, may have a diameter which is less than or equivalent to a diameter of elongate body shaft <b>12</b>. Dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are shown in this example as each having a respective dissecting edge <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> defined along an outer surface of each arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to facilitate the dissection of tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In another variation, actuation shaft <b>100</b> may define openings <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> along a length of actuation shaft <b>100</b> adjacent to their respective arm members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> for receiving, at least partially within, their respective dissector arm members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, as shown in the cross-sectional end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Arm members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may rest at least partially within their openings <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> when in their low profile for advancement into a patient body. Upon deployment to their expanded profile, arm members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may deploy as described above. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> In yet another alternative, actuation shaft <b>18</b> or elongate body shaft <b>114</b> may be formed into a member having a cross-sectional shape other than circular or tubular. For example, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, elongate body shaft <b>114</b> may be formed to have an elliptical or oval cross-section. Other cross-sectional shapes may be utilized as desired and as practicable, e.g., triagonal, square, octagonal, etc. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> In other variations, the arm members may be angled with respect to one another such that they expand in a non-planar manner. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> illustrates arm members <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B each at some angle, &#x3b8;, which may be greater than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees with respect to actuation shaft <b>18</b>. In yet other variations, more than one or two arm members may be utilized, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, which illustrates in end view four arm members <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, <b>22</b>D which may uniformly spaced about actuation shaft <b>18</b> with respect to one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref> shows another example utilizing three arm members <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C which may be uniformly spaced from one another about actuation shaft <b>18</b>. These examples are not intended to be limiting in any way and are presented merely as examples. Other variations in number of arm members and spacing and angling between arm members are intended to be included in this disclosure. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Actuation and locking of the arm members may be accomplished in a number of different ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows one example of an alternative handle assembly <b>120</b> which may be utilized. Such a handle assembly <b>120</b> may be configured to advance and retract the arm members in a ratcheting manner as well as to maintain one or more intermediate configurations of the arm members during expansion. Handle assembly <b>120</b> may be coupled to a proximal end of elongate body shaft <b>12</b> and actuation shaft <b>18</b> and manipulated externally of a patient body. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> Generally, handle assembly <b>120</b> may comprise housing <b>122</b> to which one or more handle members <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> may be attached. Each handle member may have a respective actuation or retraction handle aligned in apposition for either advancing or retracting the actuation shaft <b>18</b> relative to elongate body shaft <b>12</b>. For example, handle member <b>124</b> may have actuation handle <b>126</b> for actuating the advancement of actuation shaft <b>18</b> relative to elongate body shaft <b>12</b> to expand the arm members and handle member <b>128</b> may have retraction handle <b>130</b> in apposition therewith for actuating the retraction of actuation shaft <b>18</b> relative to elongate body shaft <b>12</b> to retract the arm members. Each of the actuation handles <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> may pivot about respective pivots <b>132</b>, <b>148</b> and may also include a biasing element, such as respective spring members <b>134</b>, <b>150</b> for maintaining a bias in each actuation handle <b>126</b>, <b>130</b>. Each of the actuation handles <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> may be further pivotably connected at pivots <b>138</b>, <b>154</b> within housing <b>122</b> to a respective pawl member <b>136</b>, <b>152</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> Each of the pawl members <b>136</b>, <b>152</b> may be biased to rest against a bi-directional rack member <b>140</b> having a first set of angled teeth or projections <b>142</b> on a first side of rack member <b>140</b> and a second set of angled teeth or projections <b>144</b> on a second side of rack member <b>140</b> where the second set of projections <b>144</b> are angled in an opposite direction to the first set of projections <b>142</b>. The first set <b>142</b> may be angled in a first direction with respect to pawl <b>136</b> to advance rack <b>140</b> in a first distal direction <b>146</b> when engaged by pawl <b>136</b> to expand the arm members. Manipulation of actuation handle <b>126</b> relative to handle <b>124</b> may thus move pawl member <b>136</b> in a reciprocating manner to engage first set <b>142</b> and advance rack <b>140</b> distally with each stroke. Likewise, manipulation of actuation handle <b>130</b> relative to handle <b>128</b> may likewise move pawl member <b>152</b> in a reciprocating manner to engage second set <b>144</b> and advance rack <b>140</b> in a proximal direction <b>156</b> with each stroke. A proximal end of actuation shaft <b>18</b> may be coupled to rack <b>140</b> via connection <b>158</b>. Alternatively, a proximal portion of actuation shaft <b>18</b> may be formed into a bi-directional rack. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> This optional ratcheting of the arm member expansion and retraction may enable a controlled deployment of the arm members. Moreover, locking mechanisms may be incorporated in handle assembly <b>120</b> to ensure that once the arm members have been expanded to their fully deployed configuration or to any intermediate configuration, a configuration of the arm members may be set and maintained despite releasing the handles. An example for incorporating locking features may also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in locking member <b>160</b> having a rack engagement <b>162</b> and locking member <b>166</b> having a rack engagement <b>168</b>. Locking members <b>160</b>, <b>166</b> may each have a respective biasing element such as spring elements <b>164</b>, <b>170</b> for engaging and locking rack member <b>140</b> during advancement and retraction to ensure that release of handles <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> does not release rack member <b>140</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> As mentioned above, dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be deployed, expanded, or retracted in any number of intermediate configurations <b>180</b>. Moreover, expansion and retraction of arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be accomplished simultaneously such that the arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> dissect the surrounding tissue on either side in a simultaneous manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Alternatively, either arm member may be actuated and deployed independently from one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows one example where arm member <b>22</b> may be expanded and retracted either fully or in any number of intermediate positions <b>182</b> while maintaining the other arm member <b>24</b> in its low profile position. Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> shows another example where the other arm member <b>24</b> may be expanded and retracted also either fully or in any number of intermediate positions <b>184</b> while maintaining the arm member <b>22</b> in its low profile position. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Another feature which may be optionally incorporated into the assembly may include a pivoting tissue dissector end effector <b>190</b>, as shown in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In such a variation, elongate body shaft <b>192</b> may include a shaft distal portion <b>194</b> which is configured to pivot at an angle, &#x3b1;, relative to a longitudinal axis of elongate shaft <b>192</b>. Pivoting end effector <b>190</b> may be angled anywhere from 0 degrees to under 180 degrees to facilitate access and deployment within the patient body. Even when angled, dissector arm members <b>196</b>, <b>198</b> may be expanded and retracted in any number of configurations, as described above. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> In pivoting end effector <b>190</b>, various active or passive mechanisms may be employed. For instance, pivoting end effector <b>190</b> may be configured to self-pivot to a set pre-determined angle, &#x3b1;, e.g., 45 degrees. In such an embodiment, a bending or pivoting portion proximal to end effector <b>190</b> may be fabricated from a spring stainless steel or shape memory alloy such as Nitinol such that when the instrument is deployed, unlocked, or otherwise unconstrained, end effector <b>190</b> automatically reconfigures to curve, angle, or curl into its predetermined deployment configuration, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a detail partial cross-sectional view of the distal portion of elongate body shaft <b>192</b> and shaft distal portion <b>194</b> to illustrate another example for a pivoting mechanism <b>200</b>. This example shows an actively actuated pivoting, bending, or curling mechanism. As shown, an actuation shaft <b>204</b> for actuating dissector arm members <b>196</b>, <b>198</b> may extend through lumen <b>218</b> defined through shaft <b>192</b> and <b>194</b>. A portion of actuation shaft <b>204</b> may include a bending or pivoting portion <b>202</b> which may transmit a longitudinal actuation force along the curved or angled portion <b>202</b>. The pivoting portion <b>202</b> may be comprised of a reduced section of actuation shaft <b>204</b> capable of bending repeatedly or it may alternatively be comprised of a linkage to enable force transmission over a curved or angled section. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Shaft distal portion <b>194</b> may be pivotably attached to elongate body shaft <b>192</b> via dissector assembly pivot <b>206</b> to enable free rotation of shaft distal portion <b>194</b> relative to elongate body shaft <b>192</b> when actuated via pivot actuation shaft <b>208</b>. The proximal end of pivot actuation shaft <b>208</b> may be routed through and/or connected to the handle assembly to allow for manipulation of shaft <b>208</b>. By urging shaft <b>208</b> distally or proximally, a longitudinal force may be transmitted to actuate shaft distal portion <b>194</b>, which may in turn transmit this force to pivot shaft distal portion <b>194</b> relative to elongate body shaft <b>192</b>, e.g., to some angled position as illustrated by an example of displaced position <b>216</b>. The angle by which distal portion <b>194</b> may pivot relative to body shaft <b>192</b> may be determined by a number of different methods, e.g., the angle, &#x3b2;, over which pivot <b>214</b> traverses with respect to pivot <b>206</b> when actuation shaft <b>208</b> is urged distally or proximally. Shaft <b>208</b> may be coupled to distal portion <b>194</b> via pivot linkage <b>210</b>, which may in turn be pivotably coupled to distal portion <b>194</b> via pivot <b>214</b> and to actuation shaft <b>208</b> via pivot <b>212</b>. The details for pivoting distal portion <b>194</b> are intended to be merely illustrative and are not intended to be limiting in any way. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> Turning now to variations in dissector arm members, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of tissue dissector assembly <b>10</b> and dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref> to <b>11</b>K show examples of some of the various cross-sections into which dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be formed. These examples are intended to be illustrative of various configurations and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Other configurations for dissecting tissue which are not shown but which are obvious are intended to be included. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a square cross-section <b>220</b> which may be potentially utilized although such a blunt cross-section may not be optimized for dissecting tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows an example in partially curved cross-section <b>222</b> having a curved outer surface <b>224</b> for contacting and dissecting the tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> shows another example in curved cross-section <b>226</b> which has a curved outer surface <b>224</b> and a concavely curved inner surface <b>228</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> shows a tapered cross-section <b>230</b> having a partially blunted outer surface while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> shows a tapered cross-section <b>232</b> having a cutting tip <b>234</b> for dissecting tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref> shows a similarly tapered cross-section <b>236</b> having a diamond-shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref> shows a tissue cutting cross-section <b>238</b> having a partially rectangular portion which tapers into a cutting tip <b>234</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11H</figref> shows another cross-section in a tear-shaped configuration <b>240</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11I</figref> shows a circular cross-section <b>242</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11J</figref> shows another cross-section <b>244</b> which is elliptically shaped. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11K</figref> shows a cross-section which is comprised generally of a curved outer surface and a convex inner surface configuration <b>246</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> In addition to various cross-sectional geometries, any of the dissector arm members may be additionally coated or covered with a compliant material to alter the frictional properties of the dissector arm surfaces. For instance, they may be covered with a material, e.g., polymers, to further decrease any frictional resistance against tissue. Alternatively, the dissector arm surfaces may be coated or covered with a material, e.g., mesh, silicone, etc., to further increase the frictional resistance against the tissue. Alternatively, the dissector arm surfaces may be roughened or patterned with projections to mechanically increase tissue resistance. In yet another variation, the arms may be coated with drug such as antibiotics, anti-thrombin agents, etc., to facilitate tissue healing after dissection. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> In yet another variation of the tissue dissector assembly <b>10</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example in which a pump <b>254</b> may be fluidly connected to assembly <b>10</b> via fluid line <b>252</b> to provide for insufflation/exsufflation of a gas or fluid <b>256</b> (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, saline, water, etc.) directly through elongate body <b>12</b>. This gas or fluid may be used before, during, or after mechanical dissection to alternatively initiate, enhance, or support dissection or to maintain or expand a dissected space. One or more fluid channels may be routed through elongate body <b>12</b> to a respective port or opening <b>250</b> located along assembly <b>10</b> or at its distal end. In another variation, one fluid channel may be dedicated as an insufflation port to enable insufflation during tissue dissection while a second fluid channel may be dedicated as a fluid delivery port. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> In another variation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a perspective view of a tissue dissector assembly <b>10</b> having an additional viewing or imaging port <b>260</b> located at a distal end of assembly <b>10</b>. The imaging port <b>260</b> may be alternatively located along elongate body <b>12</b> or even through one or more of dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to provide for visualization during insertion into the tissue, during dissection, and/or during retraction into or from the patient body. A cable <b>262</b> may be coupled to assembly <b>10</b> and routed to a video processor <b>264</b> for processing any images for display. Any number of conventional imaging modalities may be utilized as desired, e.g., CCD chips, fiber optic imaging fibers, etc., which may be inserted through elongate body <b>12</b> as a separate instrument or integrated directly with assembly <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> show detail perspective views of another alternative for providing visualization within the patient body during a procedure. In this variation, actuation shaft <b>270</b> may also serve as a viewing shaft by having one or more openings or slots <b>272</b> defined along its outer surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. These slots <b>272</b> may be defined on one or both sides of actuation shaft <b>270</b> adjacent to dissector arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. During a procedure, a visualization instrument such as scope <b>274</b> having an imager <b>276</b> and a light source may be advanced through elongate body <b>12</b> and actuation shaft <b>270</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. Before, during, or after dissector arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are deployed into their expanded configuration, imager <b>274</b> may be pointed through either opening <b>272</b> to provide for visualization of the tissue being dissected or of the tissue region in general, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. As mentioned above, dissector arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be optionally configured to be translucent in which case the dissected tissue and/or surrounding tissue may be visualized directly through the translucent arm members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> from within the patient body utilizing imager <b>276</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> In yet another variation, a light source may be provided through the assembly directly. Optical fibers may route the light emitted from an external light source <b>286</b> via light transmission cable <b>284</b> directly through elongate body <b>12</b> to aid visualization of the tissue region. An additional visualization instrument may be integrated or delivered through the assembly, as described above, while coupled via cable <b>288</b> to a video processor <b>290</b>. Alternatively, an integrated light source <b>292</b> may be positioned along the assembly. Examples of integrated light sources may include, e.g., light emitting diodes. In yet another variation, dissector arm members <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> may be fabricated from a light transmitting material, such as polycarbonate, which may transmit light directly from light source <b>286</b> to the surrounding tissue, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In such an embodiment, light transmitting arm members <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> may not only provide a direct light source to the dissected and surrounding tissue, but the tissue may also be visualized directly through the translucent arm members <b>280</b>, <b>282</b>, as described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. Alternatively, light transmitting optical fibers may be routed directly through dissector arms <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> to provide for light to the tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> In another variation of the tissue dissector assembly, an optional covering or membrane <b>300</b>, e.g., polyurethane, silicone, etc., may be disposed over dissector arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to form a surface which expands and retracts along with the arms, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Covering or membrane <b>300</b> may be utilized to facilitate use of the tissue dissector assembly for tissue or organ retraction along with the tissue dissection capabilities of the assembly. An example of the assembly for organ retraction is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which shows the assembly retracting an organ <b>302</b>, liver, bowel, fat, kidneys, etc., within the patient body. Tissue retraction may be performed without the covering or membrane <b>300</b> at all and with dissector arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> in any number of expanded configurations, i.e., fully or any number of intermediate expanded configurations. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> The applications of the apparatus and methods discussed above are not limited to the disclosed features. Modification of the above-described assemblies and methods for carrying out the invention, and variations of aspects of the invention that are obvious to those of skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of the claims. Furthermore, various features of the dissector arms, visualization, lighting, etc., may be combined with one another in any number of combinations as practicable and are intended to be within the scope of this disclosure. </p>
