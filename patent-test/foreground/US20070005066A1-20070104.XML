<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to industrial fastener systems; and, more particularly, the invention pertains to so-called &#x201c;nut plates&#x201d; that provide a one or a plurality of fastener sites on a single device connected in an assembly. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Assemblies of various types such as, for example, automobiles, appliances and the like, use so-called &#x201c;nut plates&#x201d; as part of a fastener system. In many situations, it is difficult to access a nut, bolt head or other fastener component to complete an assembly. As a remedy to this difficulty, it is known to secure the nut, bolt or other component in a fixed position for engagement with the complimentary component of the fastener system. Affixing a single nut or bolt can be difficult, and positioning of it can be imprecise. It is known to provide a nut or threaded boss on an otherwise generally plate-like structure which can then be secured in place. It is known to secure such nut plates by welding or the like directly to the frame in some assemblies, such as an automobile frame, and by other types of fasteners including push-in fasteners in other, more lightweight assemblies. A single nut plate can be of sufficient size to include several fastener components. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> It is necessary in some assemblies to use the same or similar nut components on nut plates of different size because the spacing between adjacent fasteners is different in different parts of the assembly. In known constructions for nut plates, this has required stocking and making available complete nut plates of different overall size, even though the hut components of the different nut plates are the same. Further, although the nut portion might be required to be of metal or other strong, durable material, the plate portion of a nut plate is needed primarily for positioning purposes and may not have the same requirements of strength and durability. However, if the nut plate is a monolithic body, the plate portion is of the same material, thus adding to cost of the nut plate. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Further, nut plates have been provided only in defined sizes with defined numbers of and locations for fastener sites. This again has added to both expense and inconvenience in that many different types of nut plates may be required. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> What is needed is a modular nut plate adaptable to different uses. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use herein of &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and variations thereof is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof, as well as additional items and equivalents thereof. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Referring now more specifically to the drawings and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, a modular nut plate <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention is shown. Nut plate <b>10</b> includes a carrier <b>12</b>, a first fastener component <b>14</b> connected at one end of carrier <b>12</b> and a second fastener component <b>16</b> connected at an opposite end of carrier <b>12</b> from the end at which fastener component <b>14</b> is connected. Since nut plate <b>10</b> is modular, the individual components thereof can be made of material most suitable for the requirements of the component. For example, carrier <b>12</b> can be made of plastic and fastener components <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> can be made of metal. Alternatively, one or both of fastener components <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> can be made of plastic and/or carrier <b>12</b> can be made of metal. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> In the exemplary embodiment, carrier <b>12</b> is an elongate body <b>20</b> having firs and second connector sites <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at opposite ends thereof. A mounting structure <b>26</b> includes an elongate hole <b>28</b> and a pin <b>30</b> for insertion and therethrough. In the exemplary embodiment, pin <b>30</b> is a so-called &#x201c;Christmas Tree&#x201d; fastener having a rectangular or flat, tapered body to prevent rotation when inserted in a rectangular hole. Other types of push-in fasteners, snap fasteners, threaded fasteners or the like can be used in place of pin <b>30</b>. For long modular nut plates, more than a single fastener can be used. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> Connector site <b>22</b> is configured for receiving and securing fastener component <b>14</b>. Connector site <b>24</b> is configured for receiving and securing fastener component <b>16</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, fastener component <b>14</b> and fastener component <b>16</b> are identical, and connector site <b>22</b> and connector site <b>24</b> are similarly structured for receiving connector components interchangeably. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Body <b>20</b> forms opposed, spaced, elongated channels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> along opposite sides thereof throughout the length of body <b>20</b>. Channels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are part of connector site <b>22</b> and connector site <b>24</b>. While each channel <b>32</b> and channel <b>34</b> is shown as a single continuous channel throughout the length of body <b>20</b>, it should be understood that channels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> can be shorter discontinuous channels provided at each first connector site <b>22</b> and second connector site <b>24</b>. A depression or hole <b>36</b> is provided at connector site <b>22</b>, and a depression or hole <b>38</b> is provided at connector site <b>24</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Fastener component <b>14</b> is a substantially symmetrical body having a base <b>40</b> and a fastener element <b>42</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, fastener component <b>42</b> is an internally threaded boss. However, it should be understood that an externally threaded member or other type of fastener, either threaded or not threaded also can be supported by base <b>40</b>. The present invention is not limited in its application to the use of internally threaded fastener elements, nor is the present invention limited to the use of threaded fastener elements in general. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Fastener component <b>14</b> further includes first and second connector ends <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> at opposite ends of base <b>40</b>. Connector ends <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> include dimples <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, respectively. Connector ends <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> further define lips <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Second fastener component <b>16</b>, is structured similarly to fastener component <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the same reference numerals have been applied to fastener component <b>16</b>, to designate the parts thereof similar to first fastener component <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> First and second connector sites <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and first and second connector ends <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are configured as cooperating pieces of a snap together connection. Accordingly, first fastener component <b>14</b> and second fastener component <b>16</b> can be connected to carrier <b>12</b> without the use of tools. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> In the assembly of modular nut plate <b>10</b>, first fastener component <b>14</b> is attached to carrier <b>12</b> by inserting either connector end <b>44</b> or connector end <b>46</b> in to channels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and slid therein until dimple <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> engages hole <b>36</b>. Registration of a dimple <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> in hole <b>36</b> establishes a fixed overall length for modular nut plate <b>10</b>, and thereby the position of fastener element <b>42</b> relative to mounting structure <b>26</b>. Thus, by accurately positioning the plate through installation via mounting structure <b>26</b>, fastener element <b>42</b> is accurately and precisely located. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Second fastener component <b>16</b> is attached to carrier <b>12</b> at second connector site <b>24</b> in the same manner as attaching first fastener component <b>14</b> at first connector site <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> To further establish fixed positioning of fastener components <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> relative to carrier <b>12</b>, channels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> can be provided with slots <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for channel <b>34</b>. Lips <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> register in slots <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> to further establish fixed positioning and secure location of fastener components <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> relative to carrier <b>12</b>. Further, connector ends <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be angled to define a longitudinal thickness between highest and lowest portions thereof greater than a thickness of channels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Thus, an interference fit is established between fastener component <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> and carrier <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Modular nut plate <b>10</b> is connected in an assembly <b>70</b> having an elongated hole <b>72</b> for receiving fastener <b>30</b>. Thereafter, bolts <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> can be inserted into fastener elements <b>42</b> via holes <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> in assembly <b>70</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> While shown herein with similar first and second components <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> a modular nut plate <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention can be assembled with different fastener components on opposite ends of carrier <b>12</b>. Further, since fastener components <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are symmetrical, with connector ends on opposite longitudinal ends thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that additional carriers <b>12</b> and fastener components <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can be connected end for hand in any number or length. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Variations and modifications of the foregoing are within the scope of the present invention. It is understood that the invention disclosed and defined herein extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text and/or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the present invention. The embodiments described herein explain the best modes known for practicing the invention and will enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention. The claims are to be construed to include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted by the prior art. </p>
