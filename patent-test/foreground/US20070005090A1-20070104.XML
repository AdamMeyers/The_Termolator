<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A device for vascular tamponade includes a compression portion and a curvilinear articulating arm coupled to the compression portion. A method for vascular tamponade includes: manually applying a desired pressure proximate a puncture in a vessel by positioning a compression member to apply pressure against skin of a patient, the desired pressure permitting clot formation at the puncture; coupling the compression member to an object disposed in fixed relationship to the puncture; fixing the compression member in a position so that the desired pressure is maintained proximate the puncture without continuing to manually apply the desired pressure. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The invention relates to a device and method for applying compression to an anatomical region. More particularly, the invention relates to a device and method for vascular tamponade following percutaneous puncture. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Many diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures are performed via intra-vascular access using a percutaneous approach. The common entry points into the vascular tree are through the Femoral vessels in the groin and through the Axillary vessels in the arm. Both types of vessels allow access to all the major organs for example using thin wires and catheters combined with x-ray fluoroscopy and contrast agents for guidance. Diagnostic angiography and insertion of specialized catheters used therapeutically such as for inserting stents, injecting microspheres or drugs, and placement of occlusive or filtering devices are among the typical procedures done by these routes. At the conclusion of these procedures, a hole that varies in size depending on the procedure is left in the vessel wall at the point of access. This hole must be sealed by natural clotting or invasive methods to prevent serious bleeding. This is especially the case if the hole is in an artery and it is a relatively large hole and if the vessel is compromised by disease. Depending on the size of the hole, how it is managed rests with the judgment of the physician. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Various biologic compounds and devices for closing, plugging or filling a vascular hole, such as a hole in a vein or artery, have been developed and are in clinical use. However, these devices are themselves invasive, pose some additional risk, and are relatively expensive. Most commonly, the holes are managed by external manual compression on the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissues for up to 30 minutes. This gives sufficient time for normally active clotting mechanisms to generate an effective natural clot to plug the hole. Manual fingertip compression is the standard because it is the safest, most easily performed, and always available method. It is also manually controlled and constant monitoring is a given. The technique is simple. Sufficient pressure is applied to stop the bleeding but excessive pressure that occludes the vessel is avoided. This may be monitored by checking for a pulse distal to the compression site. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The manual compression method does require some skill and experience to achieve a safe and consistent force of compression and to maintain this force consistently over about a 30 minute time period. Also, it is more difficult than one might imagine because the compression force required varies from patient to patient, the area needs to be observed and observable, the area requiring compression is small, the vessel itself or the overlying tissues are somewhat mobile, and the angle of optimal compression may not be simply vertical but will vary greatly from patient to patient and procedure to procedure. The overall goal, as stated above, is to apply sufficient focal pressure to prevent bleeding through the hole without occluding the vessel, and to apply this pressure for a sufficient length of time for a solid plug of fibrin clot to form and seal the hole. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> One downside of the manual compression method is that it fully occupies a nurse or technician preventing them from doing anything else for the length of time during which compression is applied. Thus, expensive personnel are occupied for a dull, simple, repetitive and somewhat tiring task. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Problems associated with manual compression have been addressed by several different mechanical devices that more or less mimic the manual compression method. One non-invasive device available from Radi Medical Systems AB is called FemoStop&#xae; and is used in femoral artery punctures at the groin area. This device wraps around the hips and provides a rigid backstop over the puncture site. A balloon is inflated between the backstop and the puncture site to compress the soft tissues overlying the puncture site. The balloon is inflated until compression is sufficient. Initially, the artery may be compressed to complete occlusion for several minutes and then the pressure, monitored by a gauge connected to the balloon, typically is reduced until there is a pulse felt in the artery distal to the balloon. This device can be cumbersome to set up, covers the puncture site from view in an undesirable manner, and blocks normal tactile feedback. One advantage to this system is that it will not be easily dislodged from an effective position by minor patient movement. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Another device offered by Advanced Vascular Dynamics is called the CompressAR&#xae; System. It uses a simple mechanical post that is mounted on a plate that is held in position underneath a mattress/patient by the weight of the patient. A vertically sliding cantilevered bar is used to hold a disposable plastic self-aligning disk against the groin to achieve suitable compression. This device also can be cumbersome to set up, interferes with the normal manual approach to vessel compression by blocking tactile feedback in the critical area, and is difficult to position and adjust. It also compresses a larger area than is considered ideal. However, this device does allow better visibility of the wound than the FemoStop device. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention relates to a non-invasive device and method for applying external compression to a punctured vessel. This device may allow full use of the normal tactile manual method of fingertip manual compression, by placing a mechanical pad between the fingertips and the skin that has a hole in a central area. This hole gives direct skin access for palpating the vessel for location and pulse. In an exemplary embodiment, the anatomical site to be compressed is otherwise covered by the pad, the desired pressure and angle of compression is achieved, and a mechanical arm is brought in to engage the mechanical pad and locked in position. The mechanical arm may be attached to a fixed base which in turn may be attached to any of a wide variety of fixed surfaces or objects without moving or displacing the patient. Complete freedom of movement of the end of the arm may be available to engage the mechanical pad at the proper location and angle of compression. The arm may be locked in this position and the pressure may be adjusted by an in-column micro-adjust screw mechanism to dial-in an optimum pressure while an operator is continuously palpating the vessel of concern. The fingertip pressure and hand then may be removed while the original force and angle of compression are maintained. The central hole then may be filled to maintain a smooth and uniform compression surface. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In one preferred exemplary embodiment, the mechanical pad connects to a vertical stem that fits into a socket in the mechanical arm and this socket includes the in-line micro-adjust screw mechanism. The central hole in the mechanical pad may be larger than the tip of a middle finger. The pad may be centered over the vessel by palpation with the middle finger while pressure is applied with all three fingers. The first and fourth finger rest on the mechanical pad while the vessel is felt (palpated) with the middle finger. This allows the important tactile feedback required to locate the vessel and apply an appropriate pressure based on experience. The force applied manually is then taken up by the mechanical arm set at an initial locked position and adjustment allowed by the micro-adjust screw. When ideal pressure is achieved as determined by palpation on the vessel, recording the pulse distal to the puncture site, experience of the user, and direct observation of the puncture site, hands are removed and routine procedures for observation and pressure release are followed. This device may allow the user to increase or decrease pressure on the anatomical site by using the micro-adjust screw at any time. The hole for the middle finger may be plugged to complete the compression surface by advancing a secondary surface plug when the fingertips are removed. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Alternative exemplary embodiments may include the addition of relative pressure measuring devices placed in the pressure path to indicate a stable or reproducible setting of the pressure. A spring scale or more complex arrangement such as a piezo-electric digital or hydraulic indicator may be used. Also, in addition to the in line screw mechanism for pressure adjustment, other in line or offset mechanical or hydraulic methods may be used to adjust the pressure force in a finely controlled manner after the mechanical arm is locked if desired. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Another exemplary preferred embodiment may be achieved by temporary or fixed placement in the central area of the compression pad of an ultrasound transducer that is intended to image the underlying vessel. Using the ultrasound image may allow the user to correctly place and orient the compression surface over the desired vessel, to visualize flow through the vessel and to observe any leakage from the puncture site. All this may be done in real time and continuous ultrasound imaging may function as a monitor of performance during the compression period. This could be accomplished using a purpose built transducer that has a proper shape and surface for compression as an integral part of the casing/handle. Alternatively, an ideally shaped surface may be configured to receive (i.e. may function as a shoe) a more generic linear transducer that functions in the optimal frequency range. This shoe may be cleaned and sterilized for re-use or may be a single use disposable pre-sterilized item. A mechanical arm for holding the compression may be configured to securely grasp the ultrasound transducer and a mechanism may be included for micro-adjustment in the direction of the compression force similar to a purely manual embodiment. By using an ultrasound transducer as an integral part of the compression system, optimal results may be achieved. This is because the absolute minimum compression required to prevent leakage may be &#x201c;dialed-in&#x201d; using real time confirmation from the direct image, and any change in status may be immediately observed. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Words of orientation as used herein such as &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;back&#x201d; and &#x201c;top&#x201d; are used for exemplary convenience only as non-limiting examples of the orientation of features and are not intended to have any particular limiting effect. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a vascular compression device <b>10</b> according to the present invention is shown. Device <b>10</b> includes a body <b>12</b> with a coupling portion <b>14</b> at a first free end thereof. Coupling portion <b>14</b> optionally may include a circumferential groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>therein. Body <b>12</b> may be demountably attached to coupling portion <b>14</b> proximate base portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>using screws <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Coupling portion <b>14</b> preferably is configured to be coupled to an articulating arm assembly as will be described later. A compression portion <b>16</b> is demountably coupled to a second free end of body <b>12</b>. Compression portion <b>16</b> includes a stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>that is configured and dimensioned to be received and secured for example by friction fit in a hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>in body <b>12</b>. In some exemplary embodiments, stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>is received in hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>without any friction fit and thus these components may freely move with respect to one another except when compressed against each other when device <b>10</b> is used to exert pressure against an anatomical region. Portion <b>16</b> also includes a compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>which for example may be a generally circular region disposed in a plane perpendicular to central axis <b>18</b> of device <b>10</b>. Compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>has front and back faces <b>16</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>and <b>16</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, respectively, and front face <b>16</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>for example may be a portion of a sphere and thus be arcuate and symmetrical about central axis <b>18</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In use, compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>may directly contact a patient proximate the anatomical region of interest for vascular tamponade. Portion <b>16</b> may be provided as a sterile component that may be disposable and gauze pads optionally may be placed along compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>so that the patient is directly contacted with thin padding. In alternate embodiments, a sterile sleeve or cover may be provided around a portion or all of device <b>10</b>. Body <b>12</b> and coupling portion <b>14</b> of device <b>10</b> initially may be secured to an articulating arm assembly as will be described, which for example may be mounted to the railing of a hospital bed or otherwise fixed to a stable object. The operator of device <b>10</b> may first position compression portion <b>16</b> proximate the anatomical region of interest by squeezing stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>between their fingers of one hand and positioning compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>(with or without gauze thereon) on the patient's skin over an entry wound or hole in a vessel and apply a desired amount of pressure. With a second hand, the operator may then grasp and maneuver body <b>12</b> so that stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>of compression portion <b>16</b> is received in hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>of body <b>12</b>. Stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>may be advanced in hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>until it &#x201c;bottoms out,&#x201d; and in one exemplary embodiment a portion of stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>extends from a free end of body <b>12</b> when stem <b>16</b><i>a </i>is disposed in hole <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Once compression portion <b>16</b> is held in a desired orientation and position to provide a desired pressure on the hole in the vessel, the articulating arm may be locked in position as will be further described so that compression region <b>16</b><i>b </i>remains in place as set by the operator to provide generally constant pressure for a desired period of time. The fingers of the first hand may be removed from holding compression portion <b>16</b> so that manual compression is no longer applied by the operator. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D-1F</figref>, another exemplary embodiment of a vascular compression device <b>20</b> according to the present invention is shown. Device <b>20</b> includes a body <b>22</b> with a coupling portion <b>24</b> at a first free end thereof. Coupling portion <b>24</b> optionally may include a circumferential groove <b>24</b><i>a </i>therein. Body <b>22</b> may be demountably attached to coupling portion <b>24</b> proximate base portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>using screws <b>24</b><i>c</i>. Coupling portion <b>24</b> preferably is configured to be coupled to an articulating arm assembly as will be described later. A cylinder <b>25</b> is configured and dimensioned to be received and secured for example by friction fit in a hole <b>22</b><i>a </i>in body <b>22</b>. Cylinder <b>25</b> includes a longitudinal hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>therein disposed along central axis <b>28</b>. Hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>includes a first portion <b>25</b><i>a</i><sub>1 </sub>having a first diameter and a second portion <b>25</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>having a second diameter with the second diameter being greater than the first diameter. A central shaft <b>27</b> is disposed on axis <b>28</b> and received in hole <b>25</b><i>a</i>, and shaft <b>27</b> is slidably associated with first portion <b>25</b><i>a</i><sub>1</sub>. Cylinder <b>25</b> also includes a through slot <b>29</b> within which a portion of shaft <b>27</b> may be viewed. A pin <b>30</b> extends perpendicular to axis <b>28</b> through shaft <b>27</b> proximate a first free end <b>27</b><i>a </i>thereof and rides in opposing sides of slot <b>29</b> so that movement of shaft <b>27</b> in hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>is constrained to linear movement along axis <b>28</b> without rotation of shaft <b>27</b> about axis <b>28</b>. A spring <b>32</b> is disposed about shaft <b>27</b> in second portion <b>25</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>of hole <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> A scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>may be visible on the outer surface of cylinder <b>25</b> and may be disposed proximate slot <b>29</b>. In one embodiment, scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>may be in the form of grooves for example disposed circumferentially about cylinder <b>25</b> in planes perpendicular to axis <b>28</b>. In alternate embodiments, other indicia may be used such as other markings including numbers and/or symbols and/or text, or the other indicia may be raised regions on cylinder <b>25</b>. Preferably, scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>indicates evenly spaced positions of pin <b>30</b> in slot <b>29</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> A finger pad <b>34</b> abuts a free end of cylinder <b>25</b>. In addition, a compression portion <b>26</b> is demountably coupled to a free end of shaft <b>27</b> opposite the free end proximate pin <b>30</b>. Compression portion <b>26</b> includes a stem <b>26</b><i>a</i>, and a portion of shaft <b>27</b> is received in a hole <b>26</b><i>a</i><sub>1 </sub>in stem <b>26</b><i>a </i>as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> in which finger pad <b>34</b> is not shown. The free end of stem <b>26</b><i>a </i>abuts a free end of spring <b>32</b> and is configured and dimensioned to be slidably associated with second portion <b>25</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>of hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>in cylinder <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Portion <b>26</b> also includes a compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>which for example may be a generally oval-shaped region disposed in a plane perpendicular to central axis <b>28</b> of device <b>20</b>. Compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>has front and back faces <b>26</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>and <b>26</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, respectively, and front face <b>26</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>for example may be a portion of a sphere and thus be arcuate and symmetrical about central axis <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Thus, in use, compression portion <b>26</b> is spring-loaded. Device <b>20</b> allows full use of the normal tactile manual method of fingertip manual compression, but places a mechanical pad in the form of compression portion <b>26</b> between the operator's fingertips and the skin. Once the desired anatomical area for compression is covered by front face <b>26</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>of compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>of portion <b>26</b>, and the desired pressure and angle of compression are achieved, an articulating arm as will be described herein may be positioned to engage coupling portion <b>24</b> and the arm is then locked in position. The fingertip pressure and hand initially holding portion <b>26</b> may then be removed while the original force and angle of compression are maintained. Scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>serves as a relative pressure force indicator that may be observed at any time by the operator. Thus, the force applied manually may be observed as a relative position on scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>prior to engaging the mechanical articulating arm and then this same force as measured by this relative position may be observed at any time by looking at this reference after the mechanical arm is engaged and the hand is removed from compression portion <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> During use, the fingertips of the operator preferably are placed on finger pad <b>34</b>, and pad <b>34</b> initially is spaced from compression region <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Compression spring <b>32</b> preferably provides pressure to resist movement of compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>on the patient. In one embodiment, compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>and pad <b>34</b> do not rotate relative to one another. In an exemplary preferred embodiment, a force between about 2 lbs. and about 8 lbs. pounds is indicated by scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>and applied to the anatomical region of interest by compression region <b>26</b><i>b</i>, although scale <b>25</b><i>b </i>only may provide reference marks. In one exemplary embodiment, when the spacing of pad <b>34</b> and compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>is at a minimum, 8 lbs. of force is applied by compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>and pin <b>30</b> is disposed in slot <b>29</b> at an end thereof proximate body <b>22</b>. In general, the desired force is determined manually and the markings such as rings <b>25</b><i>b </i>may be used as a reference to continuously confirm that the mechanical articulating arm has achieved and is maintaining the same desired force that was being applied by compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>using the fingertips of the operator. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> In use, compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>may directly contact a patient proximate the anatomical region of interest for vascular tamponade. Portion <b>26</b> may be provided as a sterile component that may be disposable and gauze pads optionally may be placed along compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>so that the patient is directly contacted with thin padding. In alternate embodiments, a sterile sleeve or cover may be provided around a portion or all of device <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> The articulating arm assembly to which device <b>20</b> is coupled for example may be mounted to the railing of a hospital bed or otherwise fixed to a stable object that is disposed in a fixed relationship to the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> Once compression portion <b>26</b> is held in a desired orientation and position to provide a desired pressure on the hole in the vessel, the articulating arm may be locked in position as will be further described so that compression region <b>26</b><i>b </i>remains in place as set by the operator to provide generally constant pressure for a desired period of time. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> In alternate embodiments, device <b>20</b> may include different relative pressure measuring devices such as piezo-electric digital or hydraulic indicators.

A bushing <b>62</b><i>c </i>connected to levers <b>62</b> extends through an oblong-shaped hole <b>55</b><i>a </i>in bracket body <b>55</b> that communicates with central hole <b>55</b><i>b </i>in bracket body <b>55</b> so that when levers <b>62</b> are manipulated by an operator to be generally disposed in a direction transverse to compression portion <b>46</b>, bushing <b>62</b><i>c </i>is urged away from rod <b>60</b> to permit movement thereof. Because of the biasing provided by spring <b>63</b>, the mechanism is self-locking with bushing <b>62</b><i>c </i>bearing against rod <b>60</b> when levers <b>62</b> are generally disposed in a direction parallel to compression portion <b>46</b>. Thus, levers <b>62</b> are operated to loosen contact and readily permit movement of portion <b>59</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> In use, knob <b>45</b> and threaded shaft <b>47</b> provide a micro-adjust screw mechanism for fine-tuning of pressure applied by compression portions <b>46</b>, <b>59</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> Preferably, central hole <b>46</b><i>b </i>in compression portion <b>46</b> is larger than the tip of the middle finger of an operator of device <b>40</b>. Compression portion <b>46</b> may be centered by palpation with the middle finger while pressure is applied to compression portion <b>46</b> with three fingers. The first and fourth finger may rest on compression portion <b>46</b> while the vessel is felt (palpated) with the middle finger. This allows the important tactile feedback required to locate the vessel and apply an appropriate pressure based on experience. The force applied manually is then taken up by an articulating arm disposed in an initial locked position and adjustment allowed by the micro-adjust screw mechanism. When desired pressure is achieved as determined by palpation on the vessel, recording the pulse distal to the puncture site, experience of the user and direct observation of the puncture site, hands are removed and routine procedures for observation and pressure release are followed. Device <b>40</b> allows the user to increase or decrease pressure on the anatomical site of puncture by using the micro-adjust screw mechanism at any time. Hole <b>46</b><i>b </i>for the middle finger may be plugged to complete the compression surface by advancing central raised portion <b>59</b><i>a </i>of secondary compression portion <b>59</b> to be disposed therein. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> In alternate embodiments, relative pressure measuring devices may be placed in the pressure path to indicate a stable or reproducible setting of the pressure. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> Such devices, for example, could be a spring scale or a piezo-electric digital or hydraulic indicator. Also, in addition to the in-line screw mechanism for pressure adjustment, other in-line or offset mechanical or hydraulic methods may be used to adjust the pressure in a finely controlled manner. </p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3G</figref>, yet another exemplary embodiment of a vascular compression device <b>120</b> according to the present invention is shown. A bracket or shoe <b>122</b> is configured and dimensioned to receive an ultrasound transducer <b>124</b> which is held or cradled between a front portion <b>122</b><i>a </i>shaped to house the face of, or entire linear crystal array of transducer <b>124</b> and a back portion <b>122</b><i>b </i>in the form of a movable clip <b>126</b>. Shoe <b>122</b> further includes a pair of generally parallel rods <b>128</b> on which clip <b>126</b> is slidably mounted with sufficient friction to prevent undesired movement thereon when transducer <b>124</b> is retained. Clip <b>126</b> preferably includes an opening <b>126</b><i>a </i>for receiving a free end portion of transducer <b>124</b> as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Shoe <b>122</b> also may be provided with a silicone window <b>130</b> to serve as a buffer between a patient's skin and transducer <b>124</b>. Silicone is transparent to ultrasound and thus may be used to assist in creating a sterile field. The silicone window for example may be disposable, as may be shoe <b>122</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> Shoe <b>122</b> may be mounted on a base <b>132</b> for linear translation thereon. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, shoe <b>122</b> may include a boss <b>122</b><i>c </i>which is threadably received on a lead screw <b>134</b> and disposed in a slot <b>132</b><i>a </i>in base <b>132</b>. In particular, boss <b>122</b><i>c </i>is sized to fit in slot <b>132</b><i>a </i>such that shoe <b>122</b> is only permitted to travel linearly along the axis <b>135</b> defined by lead screw <b>134</b> but not rotate thereabout. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E-3F</figref>, lead screw <b>134</b> has a collar <b>136</b> thereon proximate a free end thereof. Collar <b>136</b> abuts base <b>132</b> and is releasably fixed to a smooth portion <b>134</b><i>a </i>of lead screw <b>134</b> by a set screw <b>138</b>. A bushing <b>140</b> is provided proximate an opposite end of lead screw <b>134</b> and is disposed in a hole in base <b>132</b> and bears against a shoulder portion therein.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, an exemplary preferred curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> is shown for use with a device <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b>. Arm assembly <b>82</b> includes a central arm <b>652</b> with a ball-sleeve arrangement that forms joints. In particular, central arm <b>652</b> includes a plurality of sleeves <b>654</b> with spherical balls <b>656</b> disposed therebetween thus forming ball and socket connections. In the exemplary embodiment shown in the figures, three balls <b>656</b><i>a </i>of a first size are disposed adjacent one another proximate one end of arm <b>652</b>, while the remaining balls <b>656</b><i>b </i>are of a second size smaller than the first size. Sleeves <b>654</b><i>a </i>of a first size and sleeves <b>654</b><i>c </i>of a second size smaller than the first size are provided for accommodating balls <b>656</b><i>a</i>, <b>656</b><i>b</i>, respectively, while a transition sleeve <b>654</b><i>b </i>is provided intermediate sleeves <b>654</b><i>a</i>, <b>654</b><i>c </i>as shown for accommodating a ball <b>656</b><i>a </i>on one side and a ball <b>656</b><i>b </i>on the other side thereof. Sleeves <b>654</b> are configured and dimensioned to receive balls <b>656</b><i>a</i>, <b>656</b><i>b </i>at ends thereof and thus permit articulating of sleeves with respect to each other. A tensioning wire <b>658</b> runs generally centrally through sleeves <b>654</b> and balls <b>656</b>, as will be further described shortly. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> Preferably, wire <b>658</b> is formed of metal. In an exemplary preferred embodiment, wire <b>658</b> is Type 302 stainless steel wire rope, 1&#xd7;19 strand, 5/32 inch diameter, with a breaking strength of 3300 lb. (McMaster-Carr part number 3458T27). One exemplary operation of a wire tensioning mechanism is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,858,578 to Milo, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto. Preferably, curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> may move with six degrees of freedom. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> In the exemplary preferred embodiment, three additional balls <b>656</b><i>a </i>and three additional sleeves <b>654</b><i>a </i>are provided to the arm assembly <b>82</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, with arm assembly <b>82</b> having a fully extended (straightened) length of about 40 inches. In other embodiments, other desired lengths of arm assembly <b>82</b> may be accomplished by changing the number of balls and sleeves. For example, without the three additional balls <b>656</b><i>a </i>and three additional sleeves <b>654</b><i>a</i>, arm assembly <b>82</b> may have a length of about 32 inches. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> A base handle <b>660</b> is coupled to central arm <b>652</b> on a first end thereof, preferably adjacent a ball <b>656</b><i>a</i>. In addition, a free handle <b>662</b> is coupled to central arm <b>652</b> on a second end thereof, preferably adjacent a ball <b>656</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> In one preferred exemplary embodiment, a series of larger balls <b>656</b><i>a </i>is provided proximate base handle <b>660</b> to provide stability to curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b>. If for example a user such as a surgeon orients assembly <b>82</b> by grasping it proximate free handle <b>662</b>, substantial bending forces may be exerted on central arm <b>652</b> proximate base handle <b>660</b>. Thus, the use of larger balls <b>656</b><i>a </i>proximate base handle <b>660</b> as compared to smaller balls <b>656</b><i>b </i>proximate free handle <b>662</b> provides a system with larger surface area balls near base handle <b>660</b> for additional resistance to rotational movement in that portion of central arm <b>652</b> and thus more stability. In alternate embodiments, more than two different sizes of balls <b>656</b> or more than two sets of sizes of balls <b>656</b> may be used, preferably increasing in size toward base handle <b>660</b>. In one alternate embodiment, each of the balls <b>656</b> in central arm <b>652</b> is of increasingly larger size from free handle <b>662</b> to base handle <b>660</b>. The use of only two sizes of balls <b>656</b> advantageously facilitates manufacture and construction of arm assembly <b>82</b> because of the need to only stock two sizes as compared to a larger number of sizes and concomitantly greater case of construction because only two sizes need be assembled to form central arm <b>652</b>. In yet another alternate embodiment, central arm <b>652</b> may be formed of balls <b>656</b> that all are the same size. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D-4L</figref>, base handle <b>660</b> will be described.

Base handle <b>660</b> further includes cam mechanisms <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> as will be described. Portion <b>663</b><i>b </i>of coupling <b>663</b> preferably is noncircular and mechanically engages and is fixed to a like-shaped and sized non-circular opening in portion <b>660</b><i>c </i>of extension <b>660</b><i>b </i>so that rotation of extensions <b>660</b><i>b </i>as by gripping and turning by a user imparts like-rotation of coupling <b>663</b> for example for demountable coupling to clamp <b>16</b> and further coupling to a surgical table rail <b>18</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the preferred exemplary embodiment, coupling <b>663</b> comprises a threaded portion <b>663</b><i>d </i>which may be threadably received in a threaded hole <b>16</b><i>a </i>disposed in clamp <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> Coupling <b>663</b> is disposed proximate a first free end <b>664</b><i>a </i>of a stainless steel shaft <b>664</b> which extends therethrough and is provided with a head that abuts a shoulder disposed in end <b>663</b><i>c </i>of coupling <b>663</b>.

As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D-4E</figref>, cylindrical projections <b>666</b><i>b </i>of lever <b>666</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>1 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a</i>, while cylindrical projections <b>672</b><i>b </i>of rocker arm <b>672</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of lever <b>666</b> toward screw coupling <b>663</b> in direction K lifts pin <b>666</b><i>a</i>, and because rocker arm <b>672</b> rests on pin <b>666</b><i>a</i>, rocker arm <b>672</b> is rotated in direction L in an eccentric fashion. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> As seen particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, shaft <b>664</b> includes a threaded portion <b>664</b><i>b </i>the free end of which is threadably associated with a nut <b>665</b><i>a</i>. Shaft <b>664</b> extends through a hole in rocker arm <b>672</b> and an unthreaded insert <b>665</b><i>b </i>with a hole therein which assists in guiding travel of rod <b>664</b> along the longitudinal axis thereof. Pivoting of lever <b>666</b> in direction K causes rotation of rocker arm <b>672</b>, and with shaft <b>664</b> coupled to nut <b>665</b><i>a </i>and nut <b>665</b><i>a </i>abutting insert <b>665</b><i>b</i>, rod <b>664</b> is translated in direction M. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> When coupling <b>663</b> is threaded into a like threaded hole by rotation of extension <b>660</b><i>b</i>, arm assembly <b>82</b> is relatively loosely coupled by the connection of coupling <b>663</b> to the hole.

The leverage created by even slight movement of the threads against the threaded holes, on the order of tens of thousandths of an inch, creates a wedging effect that strongly locks arm assembly <b>82</b> to the hole. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Lever <b>668</b> of base handle <b>660</b> also is pivotably coupled to a rocker arm <b>670</b> with a pin <b>668</b><i>a </i>that is disposed such that rotation of lever <b>668</b> results in eccentric movement of rocker arm <b>670</b>. As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D-4H</figref>, cylindrical projections <b>668</b><i>b </i>of lever <b>668</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>3 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a</i>, while cylindrical projections <b>670</b><i>b </i>of rocker arm <b>670</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>4 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of lever <b>668</b> toward screw coupling <b>663</b> in direction N lifts pin <b>668</b><i>a</i>, and because rocker arm <b>670</b> rests on pin <b>668</b><i>a</i>, rocker arm <b>670</b> is rotated in direction P in an eccentric fashion. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> A forked member <b>676</b>, which for example may be formed of stainless steel, is coupled to rocker <b>670</b> and includes substantially parallel prongs <b>676</b><i>a</i>, <b>676</b><i>b </i>which mate with side walls of rocker <b>670</b> as shown. Rocker <b>670</b> is pivotably associated with forked member <b>676</b>, with a shaft <b>677</b> extending through aligned holes in prongs <b>676</b><i>a</i>, <b>676</b><i>b </i>and rocker <b>670</b>. Shaft <b>677</b> may be provided with a head <b>677</b><i>a </i>and an external retaining ring <b>677</b><i>b </i>secured in a shaft groove proximate an end opposite head <b>677</b><i>a </i>to retain forked member <b>676</b> in association therewith and thus with rocker <b>670</b>. An axial through hole <b>676</b><i>c </i>is provided in tubular portion <b>676</b><i>d </i>of forked member <b>676</b>. Tensioning wire <b>658</b> is coupled to forked member <b>676</b> by inserting an end portion of wire <b>658</b> in hole <b>676</b><i>c </i>and swaging tubular portion <b>676</b><i>d </i>so that wire <b>658</b>, which extends out of open end <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>5 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a</i>, is retained by compression within tubular portion <b>676</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> When lever <b>668</b> is rotated in direction N, shaft <b>676</b> translates along the longitudinal axis M<sub>1 </sub>toward coupling <b>663</b> creating substantial tension in tensioning wire <b>658</b> such that movement of curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> may be substantially resisted. In particular, actuation of second lever <b>668</b> may increase or decrease the tension in wire <b>658</b> as desired by acting on rocker arm <b>670</b>. By increasing tension in wire <b>658</b>, central arm <b>652</b> preferably becomes increasingly resistant to movement although central arm <b>652</b> preferably still may be moved through its full range of motion. Thus, a user may orient curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> as desired, and then increase the tension of wire <b>658</b> so that the orientation of arm <b>652</b> is releasably fixed. Lever <b>668</b> preferably has an angular range of movement about pin <b>668</b><i>a </i>of up to about 180&#xb0; to permit substantial tension to be generated in tensioning wire <b>658</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> Rockers <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> preferably are associated with each other as with a spring plunger <b>679</b> extending from within one rocker <b>670</b> into a hole in the other rocker <b>672</b>. Spring plunger for example may be a stainless steel spring plunger with a round Delrin nose, without a lock element, with &#xbc;&#x2033;-20 threading, and 3-13 lb. end force (McMaster-Carr part number 84765A33). Spring plunger <b>679</b> is used as shown because under the force of gravity, first lever <b>666</b> may otherwise tend to move toward a closed position with in the direction of arrow K. Instead, spring plunger <b>679</b> applies pressure to rocker arm <b>672</b> to set lever <b>666</b> to tend to a default open position in which shaft <b>664</b> has not otherwise been raised toward open end <b>660</b><i>a</i><sub>5 </sub>of body portion <b>660</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> In a preferred exemplary embodiment, rocker <b>670</b> moves with substantially greater eccentricity than rocker <b>672</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> Clamp <b>16</b> for use with base handle <b>660</b> may be demountably attached to surgical table rail <b>18</b>. As previously discussed, actuation of first lever <b>666</b> permits a user to apply a force on coupling <b>663</b> so that movement is resisted (e.g., in response to an 8 or 10 pound force applied to arm <b>652</b>). In an alternate embodiment which will be further described later, screw coupling <b>664</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> proximate base handle <b>660</b> of arm assembly <b>82</b> may be threadably associated with a threaded hole in another support surface. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> A preferred exemplary embodiment of clamp <b>16</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4M</figref>. Clamp <b>16</b> includes a threaded hole <b>16</b><i>a </i>for threadably receiving threaded portion <b>664</b> of base handle <b>660</b>. In addition, clamp <b>16</b> includes fixed jaw portion <b>16</b><i>b </i>and movable jaw portion <b>16</b><i>c </i>which is pivotable about axle <b>16</b><i>d </i>and lockable in place using screw mechanism <b>16</b><i>e </i>to firmly couple clamp <b>16</b> to a rail <b>18</b> secured between jaw portions <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> Next turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4N-4U</figref>, free handle <b>662</b> will be described. Free handle <b>662</b> includes a wire receiving portion <b>680</b> and an end effector receiving portion <b>681</b>. In particular, wire receiving portion <b>680</b> preferably is configured to receive a ball <b>656</b><i>h </i>therein, along with an end portion of wire <b>658</b>. As described previously with respect to base handle <b>660</b>, a pivotable lever <b>682</b> is associated with free handle <b>662</b> and preferably is coupled to tensioning wire <b>658</b> so that actuation of lever <b>682</b> may increase or decrease the tension in wire <b>658</b> as desired by acting on rocker arm <b>684</b>. By increasing tension in wire <b>658</b>, central arm <b>652</b> preferably becomes less flexible. Thus, a user may orient curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> as desired, and then increase the tension of wire <b>658</b> so that the orientation of arm <b>652</b> is releasably fixed. Free handle <b>662</b> has a body portion <b>662</b><i>a</i>, and lever <b>682</b> is rotatable with respect thereto. An interface lock <b>683</b> also is rotatably associated with body portion <b>662</b><i>a </i>proximate end effector receiving portion <b>681</b>, as will be described shortly. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> Lever <b>682</b> is pivotably coupled to rocker arm <b>684</b> with a pin <b>686</b><i>a </i>that is disposed such that rotation of lever <b>682</b> results in eccentric movement of rocker arm <b>684</b>. Cylindrical projections <b>682</b><i>a </i>of lever <b>682</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>662</b><i>a</i><sub>1 </sub>of body portion <b>662</b><i>a</i>, while cylindrical projections <b>684</b><i>a </i>of rocker arm <b>684</b> are received and rotate in arcuate cradle portions <b>662</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>of body portion <b>662</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of lever <b>682</b> toward wire receiving portion <b>680</b> in direction T lifts pin <b>686</b><i>a</i>, and because rocker arm <b>684</b> rests on pin <b>686</b><i>a</i>, rocker arm <b>684</b> is rotated in direction U in an eccentric fashion. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"> Rocker arm <b>684</b> includes a hole in which a self-aligning setup washer <b>690</b> (a two-piece washer with one portion that rocks in another portion) is disposed. Setup washer <b>690</b> for example may be an 18-8 stainless steel self-aligning setup washer, 4 inch in size, 17/64 inch inner diameter, &#xb1;2 inch outer diameter, and 0.250 inch to 0.281 inch thick (McMaster-Carr part number 91944A028). A nut <b>692</b> also may abut setup washer <b>690</b> on the flat upper surface thereof and rock thereon. A threaded stud (not shown) may be swaged to the end of tensioning wire <b>658</b> opposite the end attached to forked member <b>676</b>, thus coupling wire <b>658</b> to the threaded stud by compression. The threaded stud may in turn be threadably associated with nut <b>692</b>. Wire <b>658</b> is provided with suitable length to span from forked member <b>676</b> to nut <b>692</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"> Pivoting of lever <b>682</b> in direction T causes rotation of rocker arm <b>684</b>, and with tensioning wire <b>658</b> coupled to nut <b>692</b> and nut <b>692</b> abutting insert <b>690</b>, tension in wire <b>658</b> may be increased. In particular, actuation of lever <b>682</b> may increase or decrease the tension in wire <b>658</b> as desired. By increasing tension in wire <b>658</b>, central arm <b>652</b> preferably becomes increasingly resistant to movement although central arm <b>652</b> preferably still may be moved through its full range of motion. Thus, a user may orient curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> as desired, and then increase the tension of wire <b>658</b> so that the orientation of arm <b>652</b> is releasably fixed. Lever <b>668</b> preferably has an angular range of movement about pin <b>686</b><i>a </i>of up to about 90&#xb0; to permit tension to be generated in tensioning wire <b>658</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> In the preferred exemplary embodiment, actuation of lever <b>682</b> free handle <b>662</b> permits initial tensioning of central arm <b>652</b> while still permitting restricted movement. And, actuation of lever <b>668</b> of base handle <b>660</b> permits substantially greater tensioning of central arm <b>652</b> while also still permitting restricted movement thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> Advantageously, with tension created in wire <b>658</b> of central arm <b>652</b> to restrict movement thereof, the orientation of lever <b>668</b> such as with respect to a patient still may readily be reset or adjusted before lever <b>666</b> in base handle <b>660</b> is actuated to create sufficient force to prevent rotation of threaded portion <b>663</b><i>d </i>of coupling <b>663</b> in the hole in which it is received. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4U</figref>, interface lock <b>683</b> includes a knurled knob portion <b>683</b><i>a </i>and a cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b </i>that is provided with an arcuate cutout <b>683</b><i>e</i>. Interface lock <b>683</b> is coupled to body portion <b>662</b><i>a </i>with set screw <b>683</b><i>d </i>which is threadably received in a threaded hole <b>662</b><i>b </i>in body portion <b>662</b><i>a</i>. Set screw <b>683</b><i>d </i>is further received in a slot <b>683</b><i>e </i>in post <b>683</b><i>b </i>to lock post <b>683</b><i>b </i>in a position with arcuate cutout <b>683</b><i>c </i>oriented to be movable along the longitudinal axis of cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> Cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in a disengaged position in which the axial position of post <b>683</b><i>b </i>is such that arcuate cutout <b>683</b><i>c </i>generally follows the inner cylindrical contour of end effector receiving portion <b>681</b>. Also, cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in an engaged position in which the axial position of post <b>683</b><i>b </i>is such that a portion of cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b </i>other than arcuate cutout <b>683</b><i>c </i>extends past the inner cylindrical contour of end effector receiving portion <b>681</b> toward the central longitudinal axis of end effector receiving portion <b>681</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> In use, in order for example to couple articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> to an end effector such as a device <b>90</b>, by capturing post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1 </sub>of coupling portion <b>94</b><i>aa </i>of device <b>90</b> in end effector receiving portion <b>681</b> of free handle <b>662</b>, post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1 </sub>is inserted therein while interface lock <b>683</b> is disposed in the aforementioned disengaged position. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"> While lock <b>683</b> is in the disengaged position, post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1 </sub>may freely rotate about the central axis of receiving portion <b>681</b>. Once a desired orientation is set, lock <b>683</b> may be translated along the major axis defined by slot <b>683</b><i>a </i>so that a portion of cylindrical post <b>683</b><i>b </i>of lock <b>683</b> is disposed in an engaged position and bears against post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1</sub>. Such interference between post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1 </sub>of device <b>90</b> and post <b>683</b><i>b </i>of lock <b>683</b> provides sufficient pressure so that post <b>94</b><i>aa</i><sub>1 </sub>will remain fixed in rotational position and translation along the longitudinal axis thereof against the inner cylindrical contour of end effector receiving portion <b>681</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"> In one method of conducting vascular tamponade according to the present invention, a curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> with base attachment <b>73</b> is releasably secured to a surgical table rail <b>72</b>. Device <b>90</b> is demountably coupled to the free end of arm assembly <b>82</b> at free handle <b>662</b>. By articulating the lever <b>682</b> at the free end to a locked position, arm assembly <b>82</b> will hold position when left alone but can be easily repositioned with one hand without having to loosen or unclamp any other mechanisms. In this mode, arm assembly <b>82</b> should have sufficient resistance to hold device <b>90</b> in position absent other external forces, much like a gooseneck lamp. If locking lever <b>668</b> near the base of arm assembly <b>82</b> is also locked then arm assembly <b>82</b> will hold position against a much greater force, but this lever <b>668</b> will then have to be released when ready movement of the arm/device combination is required. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"> Once curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> is fixed in position, curvilinear articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> is designed to result in reliable position holding for device <b>90</b>. There is no need to adjust any locking or tensioning mechanisms because of the geometry of the setup and the resistance provided by the arm in its &#x201c;gooseneck lamp&#x201d; mode. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"> In some methods, gross movements of the device&#x2014;for example to move the device away from a puncture that has had sufficient clotting and thus no longer needs pressure to be applied&#x2014;may be accomplished by grabbing the articulating arm assembly <b>82</b> proximate the swivel joints and reorienting the device from that gripping point. For smaller movements, it is possible to simply grab and torque the device <b>90</b> itself. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"> Each of the devices <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b> described herein may be used in accordance with the aforementioned methods, and each of the examples above with respect to device <b>90</b> also may be applied to devices <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"> Also, although an exemplary curvilinear articulating arm assembly is described herein, it should be understood that other, preferably curvilinear articulating arm assemblies instead may be used which preferably provide six degrees of freedom of movement and permit relatively rigid positioning such as described herein. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"> In some embodiments, other retaining systems may be employed to position a device <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b> in fixed relationship to a puncture without the need for continuing to manually apply pressure. Such retaining systems preferably offer multiple degrees of freedom. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"> In some embodiments of the present invention, a device for vascular tamponade such as an arm <b>82</b> and device <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1N</figref> may be coupled to a patient support other than a rail of a table. For example, referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary support system <b>710</b> according to the present invention is shown with a variety of components coupled thereto. Support system <b>710</b> includes a tray <b>712</b>, curvilinear articulating arm assemblies <b>82</b>, <b>716</b> having respective end effectors <b>100</b>, <b>720</b>, an IV pole <b>722</b>, an arm board <b>724</b>, and rail assemblies <b>726</b>, <b>728</b>. A variety of end effectors may be demountably attached for example to articulating arm assembly <b>716</b> to assist a technician or practitioner with a medical/imaging procedure or provide other features useful with respect to a patient. End effector <b>720</b>, for example, is configured as a self-centering abdominal probe bracket. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"> In one preferred exemplary embodiment, tray <b>712</b> may include two pairs of hold regions <b>730</b>, each pair being disposed proximate a free cranial end <b>732</b> or free caudal end <b>734</b> of tray <b>712</b>. In alternate embodiments, other numbers of hold regions <b>730</b> may be provided such as two or more, and hold regions <b>730</b> may be provided in other regions of tray <b>712</b> such as intermediate ends <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> proximate sides <b>736</b>, <b>738</b>. Hold regions <b>730</b> may be configured as hand holds, or alternatively may be configured to receive strapping so that tray <b>712</b> may be releasably coupled to another object such as an ambulance stretcher, hospital bed, operating room table, or imaging scanner table. In some embodiments, handles may be coupled to tray <b>712</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, attachment regions <b>740</b> are provided proximate sides <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> for demountably coupling components as previously described to tray <b>712</b>, as will be farther described below. In the exemplary preferred embodiment, tray <b>712</b> is provided with thirteen attachment regions <b>740</b>, although in alternate embodiments another number of regions <b>740</b> may be provided such as at least one or tray <b>712</b> may be provided with a surgical rail or track permitting substantial freedom of coupling of components along the length thereof. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"> Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, additional features of tray <b>712</b> are shown. Although hand hold regions <b>730</b> are not included in the figure, such regions may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Attachment regions <b>740</b> are provided in spaced arrangement along the perimeter of tray <b>712</b>. Preferably, tray <b>712</b> includes a central arcuate portion <b>742</b> disposed between outer ledge portions <b>744</b>. Preferably, regions <b>740</b> are provided on outer ledge portions <b>744</b>. Central arcuate portion <b>742</b> preferably has an upper concave surface <b>742</b><i>a </i>for receiving a patient and optionally a cushion (not shown) for the patient to rest against, and optionally includes a lower convex surface <b>742</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, outer ledge portions <b>744</b> include upper and lower surfaces <b>744</b><i>a</i>, <b>744</b><i>b </i>connected by a sidewall <b>744</b><i>c </i>at an angle &#x3b1; with respect to surface <b>744</b><i>b</i>. In a preferred exemplary embodiment, sidewall <b>744</b><i>c </i>is disposed at an angle &#x3b1; between about 60&#xb0; and about 100&#xb0;, more preferably between about 70&#xb0; and about 90&#xb0;, and most preferably at about 80&#xb0;. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"> In a preferred exemplary embodiment, tray <b>712</b> is formed of natural finish carbon fiber, R-51 foam core, and phenolic. Attenuation preferably is less than 1 mm Al equivalency. Thus, tray <b>712</b> is radiolucent and suitable for use with computed axial tomography (CT) scanners. In other embodiments, tray <b>712</b> is formed of a material suitable for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MR) scanners. In addition, tray <b>712</b> preferably supports a load of 900 lbs. evenly distributed along centerline <b>746</b>, about which tray <b>712</b> may be substantially symmetric as shown. Indicia <b>748</b> optionally may be provided, as shown for example proximate ends <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>. The indicia may for example indicate preferred orientation of tray <b>712</b> with respect to a patient lying thereon. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"> In the preferred exemplary embodiment, attachment regions <b>740</b> on each side of tray <b>712</b> are evenly spaced from each other by about 6 inches between centers thereof. To accommodate patients and equipment attached to tray <b>712</b>, in one preferred embodiment tray <b>712</b> has a length of about 78 inches, a width of about 21 inches, a generally uniform thickness of about 0.9 inch, and a height h of about 2.5 inches. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"> Corners may be provided with a radius R<sub>1 </sub>of about 2 inches. In the preferred exemplary embodiment, attachment regions <b>740</b> preferably accommodate threaded inserts, which may be formed of aluminum. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"> In some embodiments, tray <b>712</b> is sized to hold an adult patient, and may be between about 180 cm and about 200 cm long. However, it will be appreciated that longer and shorter trays may be provided. In order to accommodate an adult patient, tray <b>712</b> may support an overall weight capacity of at least about 200 pounds, and preferably at least about 300 pounds. However, if a tray <b>712</b> is sized for use with a pediatric patient, tray <b>712</b> may only accommodate weights that do not exceed 200 pounds, and more preferably do not exceed 100 pounds. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"> Although the surface of portion <b>742</b> of tray <b>712</b> is substantially smooth in the preferred exemplary embodiments in alternate embodiments the surface may be textured to provide additional resistance to motion of objects and/or a patient placed thereon. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"> Tray <b>712</b> thus is suitable for use in multiple environments, and thus may &#x201c;move&#x201d; with the patient from one environment (e.g., ambulance) to the next (e.g., CT scanner) without removing a patient supported thereon. </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"> While various descriptions of the present invention are described above, it should be understood that the various features can be used singly or in any combination thereof. Therefore, this invention is not to be limited to only the specifically preferred embodiments depicted herein. Further, it should be understood that variations and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention may occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. For example, each of devices <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b> described herein may be used with an articulating arm that may be mounted to the railing of a hospital bed or otherwise fixed to a stable object. Also, each of devices <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b> may be fixed to stable objects without the use of an articulating arm as described herein; for example, a vise or simple clamp may be used to grasp the coupling portion of each of the devices preferably with the vise or clamp being in a fixed position with respect to the patient. Moreover, although the use of ultrasound transducer for providing pressure proximate punctures has been disclosed herein, other imaging devices are contemplated to be used instead of ultrasound transducers. For example, devices for detecting hematoma may be secured in brackets <b>92</b>, <b>122</b> and positioned to apply constant pressure proximate a puncture. A variety of imaging devices may be secured in brackets <b>92</b>, <b>122</b> such as infrared thermal imaging systems. Even further, the devices and methods disclosed herein for vascular tamponade may be used in combination with scanning technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MR) or computed axial tomography (CT). Based on results of such imaging, pressure applied by a device <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>120</b> proximate the puncture may be varied or adjusted for example as a result of identification of a hematoma. </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"> Accordingly, all expedient modifications readily attainable by one versed in the art from the disclosure set forth herein that are within the scope and spirit of the present invention are to be included as further embodiments of the present invention.
