<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> Various types of devices and systems have been used to stabilize portions of bones including the spine. Spinal stabilization techniques have employed plating and rods on the posterior, anterior, lateral, postero-lateral and antero-lateral portions of a spinal column segment. Such systems can provide rigid or dynamic fixation of a spinal column segment for the repair of injured or diseased vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and other elements of the spinal column. There remains a need for stabilization systems that are adaptable for various stabilization requirements in a single spinal procedure. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> According to one aspect, a multi-level, multi-functional spinal stabilization system is provided that includes a construct positionable along at least first and second levels of a spinal column. The construct including a motion preserving portion and a motion preventing portion. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> In one form, a system is provided where the motion preserving portion includes a first flexible, elongate body flexibly linked with a second substantially rigid, elongate body of the motion preventing portion. The first body includes a length sized to extend between anchors engaged to first and second vertebrae of the first vertebral level, and the second body includes a length sized to extend between anchors engaged to the second vertebra and a third vertebra of the second vertebral level with the first and second bodies in end-to-end engagement with one another. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> According to another aspect, a multi-level, multi-functional spinal stabilization system includes a first elongate body having a length sized for positioning between first and second vertebrae of a first vertebral level. The first body is flexible to permit motion of the first vertebral level. A second elongate body includes a length sized for positioning between the second vertebra and a third vertebrae of a second vertebral level adjacent the first vertebral level. The second elongate body is rigid to substantially prevent motion of the second vertebral level. A linking member extends between and flexibly links the first and second bodies with one another in end-to-end engagement. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> According to a further aspect, a method for stabilizing at least two levels of a spinal column segment comprises: coupling a first elongate body to a second elongate body with a linking member extending between the first and second bodies; engaging the first elongate body between first and second vertebrae of a first vertebral level, said first body being flexible to permit motion of the first vertebral level; and engaging the second elongate body the second vertebra and a third vertebra of a second vertebral level adjacent the first vertebral level, said second elongate body being rigid to substantially prevent motion of the second vertebral level. </p>
