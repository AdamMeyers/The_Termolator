DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
 Reference is now made to the figures, in which like element numbers refer to like elements throughout. 
 FIG. 1 is a partial diagrammatic side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2 defining a guidewire lumen and an outer tubular member 14 defining an inflation lumen. A balloon 4 has a proximal waist 10 sealingly attached to the outer tubular member 14 and a distal waist 12 sealingly attached to the inner tubular member 12. The balloon defines an inflation cavity and may include a proximal cone 6 and a distal cone 8. The distal end of the outer tubular member may be spaced apart from the surface of the inner tubular member to permit the flow of inflation fluid therethrough. The opening formed by the outer tubular member distal end and the inner tubular member is annular, although it may have other shapes. For example, a balloon catheter may include a crescent-shaped opening. The distal end of the outer tubular member may extend into the balloon cavity and there may be one or more orifices 16 in the side wall of the outer tubular member. These orifices 16 may provide additional pathways for inflation fluid. A stopper 20 is affixed to the inner tubular member and is disposed in the balloon cavity. The stopper has an outer profile that prevents distal movement of the outer tubular member with respect to the inner tubular member but permits distal movement of the inner tubular member with respect to the outer tubular member. The stopper may be located further from or closer to the distal end of the outer tubular member as desired. For example, the stopper may abut the distal end of the outer tubular member. Stopper 20 includes several lobes 20 that define gaps therebetween that permit fluid flow to and from the distal end of the outer tubular member even when the stopper abuts the distal end thereof. 
 FIG. 2 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member 14. Attached to the inner tubular member is a basket 22. The basket has a proximal end that prevents the outer tubular member from moving distally relative to the inner tubular member but allows elongation of the balloon. The basket may include arms that can be compressed against the inner tubular member and are biased to spring out to the position shown. The basket may be made from metal, polymer resin or other suitable material. The outer tubular member may include orifices 16 that allow for inflation and deflation of the balloon. 
 FIG. 3 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A stopper 24 is attached to the inner tubular member. The stopper may flare proximally to abut against or envelop the distal end of the outer tubular member and thus prevent the outer tubular member from moving distally relative to the inner tubular member while permitting balloon elongation. Orifices 16 may be included in the outer tubular member to provide a fluid flow path for inflation fluid. 
 FIG. 4 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A stopper 25 is attached to the inner tubular member. The stopper is sized to abut against the distal end of the outer tubular member and prevent distal movement thereof. The stopper may include lumens extending from the proximal face to the distal face to provide a fluid flow path for the inflation fluid. Alternatively or in addition, orifices 16 may be provided in the distal end of the outer tubular member. 
 FIG. 5 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 26, a balloon 4 defining a balloon cavity and an outer tubular member 14. Inner tubular member 26 has a first outer profile and a second outer profile distal the first outer diameter and of greater size. The second outer profile is sized to prevent the distal passage of the outer tubular member thereon. The two sections of the inner tubular member may be joined by a flare 28, a step-wise increase, or other suitable configuration. The outer tubular member may include orifices 16 to provide an additional fluid flow path. 
 FIG. 6 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. The proximal waist of balloon 4 extends distally of the distal end of outer tubular member 14. A stopper 30 is attached to the inner tubular member and flares proximally to abut the distal end of the outer tubular member within the proximal balloon waist and prevent relative distal motion of the outer tubular member. As shown in FIG. 7, the stopper includes slots 32 to provide a fluid flow path. The stopper may have different configurations. For example, the stopper may be substantially cylindrical and have lumens extending longitudinally therethrough to provide an inflation fluid flow path. 
 FIG. 8 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A slidable stopper 34 is disposed on the inner tubular member. Stopper 34 is prevented from moving distally beyond radiopaque marker 36 by the proximal profile of the marker. The distal end of the outer tubular member is prevented from moving distally beyond the stopper by the proximal profile of the stopper. Orifices 16 may be included to provide additional fluid flow paths. 
 FIG. 9 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A wire 38 disposed in the lumen of the outer tubular member and attached proximally to a proximal part of the outer tubular member and distal to the inner tubular member proximate the proximal waist of the balloon reduces relative movement of the inner and outer tubular members and may provide increased column strength. The term wire is used in this example embodiment and in all places in this application to denote a component having a length that is substantially greater than the transverse dimensions. The term wire does not imply a specific shape, cross-section or material. For example, a metal, a polymer resin or any suitable material may be used for wire 38. In an additional example, wire 38 could have a square, hollow, or variable cross-section. As shown in FIG. 10, the wire may have a coil 40. The coil is shown at the distal end of the wire but may be located elsewhere, such as further proximally. The coil is proximal the distal connection of the wire to the inner tubular member. The coil can compress along the longitudinal axis of the catheter to prevent relative movement of the inner and outer tubular members while permitting longitudinal expansion of the balloon. As shown in FIG. 11, wire 38 may have multiple distal attachment points 42 or may extend to a radiopaque marker 36 as shown in FIG. 12. Wire 38 may extend over only a portion of the catheter. For example, wire 38 may be attached proximally to a midpoint of the outer tubular member and distally to the inner tubular member at a radiopaque marker. 
 FIG. 13 is a partial diagrammatic view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A closely wound coil 44 is disposed on the inner tubular member in the balloon cavity. The coil may be attached at a proximal end to the outer tubular member and at a distal end to the distal waist of the balloon. The coil provides columnar support to prevent distal movement of the outer tubular member from compressing the balloon while permitting the balloon to expand. The coil may be a spiral cut tube, a shaped wire coil or other suitable configuration. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 14, the coil is also distally attached to the inner tubular member. 
 FIG. 15 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14 in an expanded position. FIG. 16 depicts the balloon catheter in a contracted position. The balloon catheter includes texture 46 on the inner surface of the balloon and texture 48 on the outer surface of the inner tubular member. When in the contracted position, textures 46 and 48 interact and mesh to prevent relative movement of the inner tubular member and the balloon. Textures 46 and 48 may be any compatible textures. For example, texture 48 may be a plurality of transverse or zigzag ribs and texture 46 may be small protrusions. Conversely, texture 46 may be transverse or zigzag ribs and texture 48 may be protrusions or ribs. Any suitable texture may be used. 
 FIG. 17 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14 in an expanded position. FIG. 18 depicts the balloon catheter in a contracted position. On the inner surface of the balloon and the outer surface of the inner tubular member in the balloon cavity, a tacky adhesive 50 is disposed. Adhesive 50 is tacky but not so strong as to prevent inflation of the balloon and operates to prevent relative longitudinal motion between the balloon and the inner catheter. Adhesive 50 may be, for example, an uncured rubber gum. In some embodiments, adhesive 50 may lose its adhesive qualities once the balloon has been inflated. In some embodiments, adhesive 50 may be applied only to the balloon wall or only to the outer surface of the inner tubular member. 
 FIG. 19 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. A stopper 52 is attached to both the inner tubular member and the outer tubular member. The stopper includes several telescoping rings which collapse as shown in FIG. 20. Alternatively, the stopper includes a plurality of interlocking segments that slide into each other. The stopper permits only a limited range of relative movement between the inner tubular member and the outer tubular member. 
 FIG. 20 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 54, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 56. As can be seen in FIG. 22, inner tubular member 54 has a non-circular cross sectional profile. In this embodiment the profile is hexagonal, but other suitable profiles include but are not limited to pentagonal, gear-shaped, elliptical, and screw-shaped. The outer surface of the inner tubular member contacts the inner surface of the outer tubular member proximate the proximal end of the balloon. The inner catheter is in an interference fit with the outer catheter, preventing relative movement thereof. In other embodiments, adhesive or welding may be used to join the inner and outer catheters. The non-circular profile of the inner catheter ensures that one or more lumens remain open for the passage of the inflation medium, as can be seen in FIG. 23. In other embodiments, the outer catheter may have a non-circular inner profile that creates an interference fit with a substantially circular inner catheter. The outer catheter may have a reduced distal profile to engage the inner catheter. 
 FIG. 24 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. An insert 58 is disposed between the outer tubular member and the inner tubular member and prevents relative longitudinal movement between the two. The insert extends distally into the balloon cavity. Insert 58 may have an interference fit with one or both of the outer and inner tubular members or may be adhesively joined or welded to one or both of the outer and inner tubular members. Insert 58 has a non-circular outer profile as may be seen in FIG. 26. The profile of insert 58 is hexagonal, but many profiles are suitable, some of which have been described above. The profile of the insert provides lumens for the passage of inflation fluid to the balloon. In other embodiments, insert 58 has a non-circular inner profile. Circular and non-circular are terms used with respect to the balloon catheters depicted herein. A circular profile is a profile that may be coincident with the profile of one of the tubular members, all of which are shown herein as circular. However, non-circular tubular members may be used and in such cases, the profile of the insert may be modified to be used with the non-circular tubular member. In other words, the term circular is not intended to be so limiting. 
 FIG. 27 is a partial side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 defining an inflation cavity and an outer tubular member 14. An insert 60 is disposed between the outer tubular member and the inner tubular member and prevents relative longitudinal movement between the two. The insert is positioned proximally of the outer tubular member distal end, although other positions may be suited. For example, the insert may be placed at the outer tubular member distal end. FIGS. 28 and 29 are perspective views depicting example tubular members disposed on inner tubular members 2. Both insert 60 and insert 62 have circular inner and outer profiles and both have lumen patterns therethrough to provide a pathway for inflation fluid. FIG. 30 is a perspective view of an insert 64 having a noncircular hexagonal outer profile. FIG. 31 depicts a cross-sectional view of a balloon catheter having this insert therein. FIG. 32 is a perspective view of an insert 66 having a noncircular elliptical outer profile. FIG. 33 depicts a cross-sectional view of a balloon catheter having this insert therein. As can be readily inferred from these four example inserts, many inserts with varied profiles may be suitable. 
 FIG. 34 is a diagrammatic side view of a balloon catheter having an inner tubular member 2, a balloon 4 and an outer tubular member 14. A protrusion 68 is attached to the inner tubular member and is confined by a protrusion 70 attached to the outer tubular member. The inner catheter can rotate with respect to the outer catheter at this point, but has very limited proximal or distal relative motion. As can be seen from FIG. 35, protrusion 70 is a ring defining an annular groove. The ring may have proximal and distal tapers as shown. Protrusion 68 includes four tabs (though fewer or more tabs may be used) that are trapped in the annular groove. The combination of the protrusions does not fully occlude the inflation lumen, thereby providing the inflation fluid with a path to the balloon. Other embodiments may include variations of this. For example, one embodiment not pictured has a protrusion on the inner tubular member that is a ring defining an annular groove and a protrusion on the outer tubular member that has five tabs confined in the groove. FIG. 36 depicts an embodiment having a ring 68 on the inner tubular member confined by pairs of tabs 72 on the outer tubular members. Tabs 72 may or may not be axially aligned. FIG. 37 is a perspective view of an example outer tubular member 74. Protrusions may be created in outer tubular member 74 by forming indents 76 in the outer surface of the member. Such indents may be thermoformed, for example. FIG. 38 depicts a balloon catheter having rounded protrusions 78 on the inner tubular member forming a channel for confining protrusions 80 on the outer tubular member. Protrusions 80 are one, two or more beads disposed on the inner surface of the outer tubular member. FIG. 39 depicts a balloon catheter having tapered protrusions 82 defining a channel for confining protrusions 84. Protrusions 84 may be one, two or more tabs extending from the inner surface of the outer tubular member.
