<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to urinary incontinence and to methods and devices useful in treating the same. In particular, this invention relates to methods and devices for treating urinary incontinence, especially in females, by reforming the urethra with heat to; correct a loss of normal size or shape and thereby restore the ability of urethral tissue to properly coapt and seal to prevent urine flow; to reform the urethra to diffuse or attenuate aberrant pressure pulses; or both. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Urinary continence involves coaptation of urethral tissue to produce a seal that prevents flow of urine from the bladder. Urinary incontinence can be caused if pressures or strains exerted on urethral tissue affect the shape or size of the urethra and the change in shape or size causes the urethra to lose the normal ability to coapt and produce a functional seal. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> For urine to pass through the annular lumen passage of the urethra, both a pressure differential and an open lumen passage are necessary. Under most conditions there exists a pressure differential caused by static hydraulic pressure due to urine in the bladder. The pressure differential may be increased by stress-induced pressure pulses caused by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or other straining. When not urinating (or in the steady state condition), at least some portion of the urethra lumen has zero volume, i.e., the lumen is closed. The inner walls or surfaces of the urethra must be in intimate contact to prevent leakage. Also, the tissue at the closed portion of the urethra must exhibit enough squeeze force to overcome the fluid pressures and forces in the urethra due to anatomy and other causes. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The internal mucous membrane of the urethra (i.e., the collagenous tissue or lining of the inner wall) forms many longitudinal folds and the shape of the lumen varies from crescentic to stellate. These irregular surfaces make sealing more difficult and may require more squeeze force, smoother seal surface or both. A lack of squeeze force, a mismatch of tissue surface irregularities, or both, will allow leakage to occur, i.e., incontinence. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Selective heating and reformation of urethral lumen tissue can improve continence based on more than a single mechanism. Heating urethral tissue is believed to affect collagen in a way that produces both axial shrinkage of the urethra and radial swelling of collagenous urethral tissue or lining of the lumen. Only a minute amount of axial shrinkage or radial swelling is believed to be needed to improve continence. Examples of possible mechanisms of improving continence, by heating urethral tissue, include increasing the available squeeze force for sealing; smoothing the tissue sealing interfaces; and/or modifying flow field geometry. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Squeeze force can be increased by heat shrinking inner urethral lumen collagenous tissue. For example, if a small loose opening exists at the normal urethral closure (coaptation) area, leakage will occur. Heating the tissue surrounding the small opening will produce closure of the opening. Swelling the tissue to a degree beyond what is needed to have a zero opening will produce extra squeeze force. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Alternately, or in addition, selective shrinkage of the surfaces of the inner mucous membrane may make the sealing surfaces less irregular, that is smoother, thereby enhancing sealing. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Optionally, only a portion of the perimeter or circumference of coapting urethral tissue or surface, as opposed to the entire perimeter of coapting urethral tissue, may be treated with heat to improve seal performance. For example, if a portion of a perimeter of urethral tissue is damaged or misshapen, heat treatment of only a portion of the urethra, e.g., a damaged portion or an undamaged portion, may improve continence. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In other embodiments of the invention, multiple segments along a length of a urethra may be treated to achieve desired results. For example, during a coughing episode, stress-induced pressure pulses may propagate from the bladder down the liquid in the urethra, forcing the sealed junction (i.e., the coaptation area) apart. Alternatively, liquid momentum in the bladder neck could force the walls apart. If the bladder neck area acts as a diffuser, significant pressure rises may also take place at the sealing junction. Thus, according to certain methods of treatment, one or more segments along the length of a urethra may be heat treated to prevent, dissipate or attenuate pressure pulses, pressure rises, etc., from causing leakage. For example, a segment of urethral tissue at or near the bladder neck may be heat treated to produce a first treated segment. A second segment may be treated at a mid-urethra location. Reformation in this manner along the length of the urethra can create discontinuities that diffuse or attenuate coughing signatures by interfering with the propagation of the pressure pulse. They may also reduce other possible causes of leakage. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Users of the present invention will understand that treatment resulting in too high of a urethral squeeze force or too small of a lumen passage may interfere with normal or acceptable urination by potentially creating diminished urine flow during micturation. In swelling the tissue and decreasing the potential orifice size, or increasing the urethra squeeze force, care must be taken to avoid excessive tissue shrinkage, excessive squeeze force, and unduly diminished urine flow during micturation. It is important to recognize that the heated collagen may conform to the shape of the heated element and create an undesirable topographical geometry. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Described herein are devices and methods that may be used to evaluate and treat urinary incontinence, especially in females. According to the invention, a device such as probe, a catheter or a similar elongate device can be inserted into the urethra and used to selectively heat urethral tissue to modify geometry of the urethra and urethral lumen, and thereby improve continence. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0037"> The inner mucous membrane (i.e., the lining) of the urethra is primarily made up of collagen tissue. Collagen tissue can shrink up to 30% when heated to a temperature of at least 65 degrees Celsius or more, e.g., to a temperature of or above 70 degrees Celsius. In normally healthy patients, coaptation appears to take place at the mid-urethra where the urethral tissue fibers primarily run parallel (i.e., axially) to the urethral lumen. When heated to at least 65 degrees Celsius, collagen shrinks axially and swells in a direction perpendicular to the primary fiber orientation (i.e., radially). This will tend to cause shortening of the urethra and swelling of the collagenous lining resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the urethral lumen. Applying heat selectively at a coaptation site or a portion thereof, e.g., at a mid-urethral location, may improve continence, e.g., by shrinking urethral tissue to smooth sealing surfaces of the urethral walls or to otherwise reduce or eliminate surface irregularities and/or openings in the urethral lumen, or by increasing sealing squeeze forces. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0038"> Generally, the invention comprises an apparatus and technique that involves a probe or catheter or similar device (probe and catheter are used interchangeably herein) having a shaft and one or multiple urethral tissue energy-delivering elements (e.g. heating elements) along the length of the shaft. When the probe is installed in the urethra, the heating element (or multiple elements) is (are) located in the urethra at a location for remodeling. The heating element can be actuated to emit heat energy for a time and a temperature to affect and re-shape urethral tissue, e.g., by heating collagen to cause urethral tissue to shrink or to recreate one or more discontinuities in the path of the lumen. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0039"> A device for treating urinary incontinence (e.g., in females) by heating and reforming urethra tissue may take different forms depending on the heating method, treatment site, and the desired post-treatment geometry. Exemplary probes can include a flexible elongate shaft that can be inserted into the urethra, with one or more heating elements along the length of the shaft, e.g., toward the distal end. The elongate shaft can be designed and prepared using materials and techniques that are useful in preparing elongate bodies for urethral catheters. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0040"> The energy-delivering element may be any form of heat generator that is useful to heat urethral tissue and that may be adapted to a catheter shaft. The heat generator can be any one or more of a laser, radio frequency (RF) probe, microwave probe, hot water element, steam element, resistance (i.e., electric) element, or the like. The heating element may include various components that allow selective heating of different portions or segments of the lining of the urethra, e.g., to produce desired geometries, and may exhibit any desired geometry, shape, size, and heating properties. Examples of features of a heating element may include an expandable element such as a balloon, a bladder, narrow elongate needles or extensions, and other metal extensions or assemblies such as expanding cages. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0041"> A heating element in the form of a balloon (or non-urinary bladder) can be expandable to a desired size in the urethral lumen, e.g., to expand urethral lumen during heat treatment. A heated fluid can be contained by the balloon, and can transfer sufficient heat energy through the balloon to produce a desired heat treatment of the collagenous tissue of the urethral lumen. The fluid can be any fluid, e.g., a liquid such as water, saline, or another biocompatible liquid. The fluid may be heated while in the balloon, e.g., by electric heating or another type of heat source, and the temperature may be monitored and controlled by a temperature sensor such as a thermocouple, also in the balloon. Pressure and volume of heated fluid in the balloon may also be monitored and controlled during heat treatment&#x2014;e.g., fluid pressure can be maintained by removing heated fluid from a balloon to shrink the balloon as tissue shrinks during heat treatment. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0042"> Alternately, a heating element may include metal extensions that can be deployed to extend from the catheter shaft and contact urethral tissue. The metal extensions and assemblies can be expandable to a desired size in the urethral tissue, e.g., to displace urethral tissue. To produce certain geometries of treated urethral tissue, special heating element shapes and geometry modifiers fabricated out of special materials (e.g. stainless steel, titanium, etc.) may be useful. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0043"> In another embodiment of a heating element, a thin and elongate, small diameter heating element may extend from the shaft, e.g., either as a single heating element or multiple elements in an array. Optionally, multiple such small diameter elongate heating elements may extend from the shaft such that they are in approximate alignment with the shaft but extend a small distance from the shaft. The heating element can be sized and shaped so that when inserted into the urethra, the small diameter heating element fits into folds or wrinkles of the urethral lumen. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0044"> Optionally, an additional balloon (e.g., a locating balloon or end balloon) may be included at the distal end or tip of the elongate shaft of the probe. The end balloon can be used to fix the probe at a desired location during use by inflating the balloon within the bladder or bladder neck then retracting the probe to locate the balloon at the base of the bladder neck. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0045"> The attached figures illustrate various embodiments of devices of the invention. These embodiments illustrate probes that include an end balloon and multiple heating elements for treating urethral tissue (i.e., therapeutic heating elements) located along a catheter shaft proximal from the end balloon. &#x201c;Proximal&#x201d; refers to a location along the length of the catheter shaft that is closer to the external end of the catheter when the catheter is installed for treatment. The proximal heating elements are illustrated to be in the form of balloons, expandable metal heating elements (e.g., expandable cages), and elongate metal heating elements that may be extended from the shaft of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0046"> Therapeutic balloons along the catheter shaft can be used to impart heat and pressure to treatment areas within the urethral lumen. If two therapeutic heating elements (e.g., balloons) are used, a first (e.g., distal) therapeutic balloon (a therapeutic balloon closest to a distal end of the device) could be used to reform urinary lumen tissue near the bladder neck to resist (i.e., dissipate or attenuate) aberrant pressures. A second, more proximal, therapeutic balloon could be used to reform urethra tissue at a coaptation or seal area. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0047"> Exemplary therapeutic energy-delivering elements can include a heating element and a temperature sensor as a part of temperature control. The energy delivered by the therapeutic element should be sufficient to produce a temperature at the mucous membrane wall that is sufficient to treat and reform urethral tissue, such as a temperature of at least 65 degrees Celsius or more, for example about 70 degrees Celsius. If the therapeutic energy-delivering probe employs or comprises a balloon, pressure within the balloon could also be monitored. The pressure could correspond to the squeeze force produced by the deformed urethra tissue. These therapeutic balloons could be non-distensible to allow more meaningful readings of the pressure in the balloon. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0048"> Referring to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a device or probe <b>10</b> of the invention as installed in a urethra <b>20</b> for heat treatment of urethral tissue.

The upper portion of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</figref> and <b>4</b>, and the top and middle portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates a catheter shaft <b>30</b>, therapeutic balloons <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, and end balloon <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0051"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> further illustrate that the catheter shaft has end balloon <b>12</b>, first therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>, second therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</figref>, <b>4</b>), second therapeutic heating element <b>17</b><sup>1</sup>, <b>17</b><sup>II </sup>and <b>17</b><sup>III </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>), heating elements <b>17</b>, and thermocouple <b>18</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0052"> The probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that three first therapeutic balloons <b>14</b> are provided. The probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that the second therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> has a heating element on only one side of the balloon. The probes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> differ from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that each has a therapeutic heating element <b>17</b><sup>II </sup>and <b>17</b><sup>III </sup>that is an expanded or expandable array of heating elements. The array of elements <b>17</b><sup>II </sup>comprises a longitudinal array of small diameter heaters. The array <b>7</b><sup>II </sup>has a larger cross-section than that of the catheter <b>30</b>. The array of elements <b>17</b><sup>III </sup>comprises an expandable cage having an outer mesh <b>19</b> and struts (not shown) that support the mesh when expanded. Either of, or both of, the mesh <b>19</b> and the struts can be heaters. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0053"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates yet another probe useful in the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> specifically illustrates a urethra having a lumen of generally crescentric shape. The wall of the lumen is irregular and comprises a plurality of longitudinal folds or wrinkles <b>21</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic element <b>25</b> comprises one or more small diameter heating elements that fit into the folds <b>21</b> of the urethra <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0054"> The lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> schematically indicates useful locations of these elements of the catheter relative to urethral tissue during use. When the device is installed, the end balloon is located at the bladder neck <b>22</b>. The first or distal therapeutic balloon <b>14</b> is at a location near the bladder neck, and a second therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> is located more proximal to the external end of the catheter device, mid-urethra. The first therapeutic balloon <b>14</b> is designed to heat treat the urethral tissue of the urethral lumen to reform a portion <b>26</b> of the length of the urethral lumen, e.g., near the bladder neck, to resist, diffuse, or attenuate pressure and flow pulses such as those that can occur during coughing or due to other stresses. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</figref> and <b>5</b> reformed portion <b>26</b> may be larger in cross-sectional area than the lumen. Alternatively, portion <b>26</b> may comprise a serpentine path as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The second therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> is designed to heat treat the tissue at a mid-urethral location to reform the urethra for coaptation or sealing. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0055"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref> also illustrate some of the following optional features of the invention. For example, various heating elements and balloon configurations may be useful to perform selective heat treatment such as heating a portion of a total circumference or perimeter of urethral tissue, i.e., a heating element can be located only on one side of a perimeter of a catheter shaft (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0056"> Two treatment sites may be useful, such as a treatment site at a coaptation area (normally at a mid-urethral location) and a separate treatment site distal from the coaptation area treatment site (closer to the bladder) to disrupt pressure or fluidic pulses due to coughing, etc., similar to a hydraulic attenuator. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0057"> Selective heat treatment (e.g., relative to the length of the urethra or the perimeter of the urethra) may be useful to cause an overall shrinkage of urethral tissue and still leave small areas untreated to retain tissue dynamics (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</figref>, and <b>5</b>). </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0058"> A probe device may also include an optional vacuum feature, e.g., for use to reform tissue to improve heat transfer and move (relative to its original position) treated tissue to promote increased sealing or coaptation. The vacuum device moves tissue by collapsing the urethra so that the tissue is in improved proximity to the element. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0059"> A therapeutic balloon may be fabricated using a micro porous membrane (surface weeping), in which case a solution of lidocaine (or facsimile) may be used as an analgesic. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0060"> A heated cage-like structure (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may be used to produce a matrix of treated and untreated urethral tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0061"> A thin and narrow (e.g., approximately 0.5 millimeter diameter) longitudinal heating element, or an array of thin and narrow heating elements, may be used to selectively treat and shrink tissue furrows in the urethra walls (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0062"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a system according to the invention. The system comprises internal (distal) and external (proximal) features of an installed device. The system includes an end balloon <b>12</b> located at the distal end of a catheter device and installed at the bladder or bladder neck, and a single therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> for heat treating tissue of the urethra <b>20</b>. At the proximal end is an end of an inflation lumen <b>40</b> for inflating and deflating the end balloon <b>12</b> and therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>. The inflation lumen <b>40</b> terminates in an inflation coupling port <b>41</b> that receives an inflation /deflation device (not shown). A syringe <b>50</b> is shown for injecting and removing fluid into and out of the therapeutic balloon through a fluid lumen <b>51</b> to inflate and deflate the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>. Separate inflation lumens may be used to separately inflate balloons <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> if desired. A heating element (not shown) in the therapeutic balloon can heat the fluid once the fluid has been injected and the balloon has been inflated as desired. Also shown is a control module <b>70</b> that can monitor and control treatment conditions such as: temperature of the fluid in the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>; the amount (volume) of heated fluid in, and the volume of, the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>; the fluid pressure in the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>; and the residence time of the heated fluid in the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0063"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates details of a therapeutic balloon <b>16</b>. The balloon <b>16</b> is inflated by, for example, injection of a fluid (e.g., water). A heating element <b>17</b> (e.g., an electric heating element) is wound around an internal shaft of the catheter device, and a thermocouple <b>18</b> extends from the shaft to monitor temperature of the fluid in the inflated balloon <b>16</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is end balloon <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0064"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates selected steps from a sequence of operation of a therapeutic balloon installed at a desired location for treatment of urethral tissue, in terms of a therapeutic balloon at a mid-urethral location and an external syringe with fluid for inflating and deflating the balloon. As shown from the top to the bottom of illustrated step 1 through 5, an exemplary treatment cycle for heat treating a coaptation area of a urethra could be as follows: 
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0065"> At step 1, the device <b>10</b> is inserted into the urethra with a therapeutic balloon located mid-urethra. The mid-urethra is the preferred position of the balloon <b>16</b> in the method. An optional distal or end balloon (not shown) can be inflated and the catheter can be withdrawn to locate the distal balloon at the bladder neck entrance and in turn position the therapeutic balloon at the seal area (e.g., mid-urethra). An inflation device <b>80</b> is secured to the distal end of the device <b>10</b>. Inflation device comprises a valve <b>81</b> that controls the flow of fluid into and out of device <b>10</b>, an inlet port <b>82</b>, an outlet port <b>83</b>, a pressure chamber <b>84</b>, and a pressure measuring means (e.g., a gauge) <b>85</b>. At time zero, pressure measuring means <b>85</b> reads zero and the volume of fluid <b>86</b> (represented by a cross-hatched area) to be used to inflate balloon <b>60</b> is also zero. Inflation occurs when valve <b>81</b> is opened to allow fluid volume <b>86</b> to pass through inlet <b>82</b> into balloon <b>16</b> to push against the urethral wall. The pressure <b>87</b> in the urethra at the coaptation site (see means <b>85</b>) resulting from the increased volume of fluid <b>86</b><sup>I </sup>can be recorded if desired. </li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0066"> At step 2, the therapeutic balloon <b>16</b> is inflated until the balloon <b>16</b> begins to push at the urethra wall. This volume would be recorded. </li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0067"> At step 3, the balloon <b>16</b> would be further inflated by the use of an increased volume <b>86</b><sup>II </sup>until it reaches an internal pressure <b>87</b><sup>I </sup>of a therapeutic level (pressure exerted by a normal urethra). The increased volume of the fluid would be recorded. </li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0068"> Also at step 3, the fluid in the balloon would be heated and controlled via an internal heating element (not shown) and temperature sensor (e.g. thermocouple not shown). </li>
        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0069"> At step 4, the heated fluid would heat the surface of the balloon and subsequently the urethral tissue (i.e., the collagenous tissue of the lining of the urethral lumen). As the heated tissue shrinks, the tissue squeezes back on the balloon (see arrows) and liquid is caused or allowed to leave the balloon through outlet <b>83</b> such that the internal pressure <b>87</b><sup>I, </sup>remains at the therapeutic level and the balloon volume approaches zero. </li>
        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0070"> At step 5, the end balloon (not shown) if used, is deflated and the device <b>10</b> can be removed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0071"> A catheter device as described can also be used as a diagnostic tool. For example a collapsed balloon placed at the urethra seal area may be inflated to a therapeutic pressure level and then tested for coaptation. The volume displaced represents an approximation of the shrink volume required to maintain the therapeutic pressure or squeeze force. This therapeutic application of the device could be combined with installation of a urethral sling implant, whereby the diagnostic catheter could be used to assist in setting tension of a urethral sling. </p>
