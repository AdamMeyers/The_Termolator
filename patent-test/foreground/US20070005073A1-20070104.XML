<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to cut guides for resecting the end of a bone and, more particularly, adjustable cut guides for resecting the end of a bone. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Orthopedic procedures for the replacement of all, or a portion of, a patient's joint typically require resecting (cutting) and reshaping of the bones of the joint. For instance, total knee replacement procedures typically involve resecting the distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia prior to implanting the prosthesis components. Resecting the distal end of the femur often involves making several cuts of the distal end of the femur including a distal cut, an anterior cut, a posterior cut, an anterior chamfer cut, and a posterior chamfer cut. The depth, angle and position of these cuts may depend on a variety of factors including the size of the prosthetic component, size of the patient's knee, and conditions of the patient's bone. In addition, the presentation of the patient's knee may indicate the need for adjustments for varus, valgus, flexion, extension, and rotation of the knee. Such adjustments may also affect the depth, angle and position of the cuts. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Cut guides have been developed to guide the saw and achieve the proper angle and position of these cuts. Conventional cut guides are often in the form of blocks having permanently positioned slots therein for receiving and guiding the saw. Different sized cut guide blocks are provided to correspond to different sized prostheses and to achieve the different cuts. In addition, some cut guide blocks require additional cut accessories to be mounted thereon to provide additional necessary guide slots. Accordingly, making the necessary cuts of the distal end of the femur may require the installation and assembly of multiple cut guide blocks and accessories. In addition, the location and angle of the slots cannot be adjusted once the block is mounted on the femur. Accordingly, it may be challenging to make adjustments in the depth, angle and position of the cuts for varus, valgus, flexion, extension, and rotation of the knee </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> There is a need for an adjustable cut guide that can be used to guide a saw in making the distal, anterior, posterior and chamfer cuts. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The present invention provides a multi-positionable cut guide for resecting the end of a bone. The cut guide is capable of being adjusted to guide multiple cuts of the end of the bone. In one form, the multi-positionable cut guide includes a bone attachment device, a base, and a guide member. The bone attachment device is adapted to be coupled to the bone and has a base receiving portion. The base includes a mounting portion slideably coupled to the base receiving portion of the attachment device such that the base is slideable relative to the attachment device along at least one dimension. The guide housing is pivotally mounted to the base, and the guide member is rotatably mounted to the guide housing. The guide member defines an axis about which it is rotatable. The guide member also includes an elongated guide slot extending along the axis and adapted to receive and guide a saw for resecting the end of the bone. The guide slot defines a cut guide plane, the position of which is adjustable relative to the bone via the sliding of the base along the at least one dimension, the pivoting of the guide housing relative to the base, and the rotation of the guide member about the axis. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In one aspect, either the base receiving portion or the mounting portion includes at least one groove. The other of base receiving portion and mounting portion includes a tongue complementary in shape to the groove such that the tongue is slideably disposed within the groove. In a further aspect, the at least one groove includes a first groove and a second groove. The first groove is perpendicular to the second groove and the tongue may be slideably coupled to either of first and second grooves such that the at least one dimension includes a first dimension and a second dimension. The base is slideable along the first dimension when the tongue is disposed within the first groove, and the base is slideable along the second dimension when the tongue is disposed within the second groove. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The cut guide of the present invention provides the ability to adjust the depth and angle of the anterior, posterior, distal and chamfer cuts to an infinite number of positions. The cut guide of the present invention, thereby, provides the user flexibility in making adjustments for varus, valgus, flexion, extension, and rotation of the knee.</p>

Base receiving portion <b>38</b> includes first groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>and second groove <b>38</b><i>b</i>, each defined in exterior surface <b>24</b> of bone attachment device <b>12</b>. First groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>extends longitudinally between first and second ends <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and along line or dimension D<sub>1</sub>. Second groove <b>38</b><i>b </i>extends longitudinally along second dimension D<sub>2 </sub>and between first and second sides <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Dimension D<sub>1 </sub>is perpendicular to second dimension D<sub>2 </sub>such that first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>are perpendicular to one another. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, base <b>14</b> includes mounting portion <b>40</b>. Mounting portion <b>40</b> has a shape complementary to first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>and is adapted to slide within first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>to slideably couple base <b>14</b> to bone attachment device <b>12</b>. More particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>are in the form of dove tail-shaped grooves, while mounting portion <b>40</b> of base <b>14</b> is in the form of a dove tail-shaped tongue. Mounting portion <b>40</b> slideably fits within either of grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>. It should be understood that mounting portion <b>40</b> and first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>may have any shape suitable to slideably secure base <b>14</b> to bone attachment device <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, guide housing <b>16</b> is pivotally coupled to base <b>14</b> via guide housing adjustment device <b>42</b>. Guide housing adjustment device <b>42</b> may be any mechanism adapted to pivot, swivel or turn housing <b>16</b> relative to base <b>14</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, adjustment device <b>42</b> may be a worm gear-type mechanism including actuator or knob <b>42</b><i>a</i>, threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>and gear <b>42</b><i>c</i>. Knob <b>42</b><i>a </i>is coupled to threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>such that rotation of knob <b>42</b><i>a </i>affects the rotation of threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b</i>. The threads of threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>engage gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>such that the rotation of threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>affects the rotation of gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>about housing axis A<sub>1</sub>. Although not shown, gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>may be a toothed gear, the teeth of which engage the threads of threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b</i>. Gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>engages gear surface <b>42</b><i>d </i>of guide housing <b>16</b>, such that the rotation of gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>about axis A<sub>1 </sub>affects the swiveling of housing <b>16</b> as indicated by the double ended arrow. Gear surface <b>42</b><i>d </i>may have teeth (not shown) for engagement with gear <b>42</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, guide member <b>18</b> is rotatably coupled to housing <b>16</b>. Guide member <b>18</b> is cylindrical in shape and defines guide axis A<sub>2</sub>. It should be understood that guide member <b>18</b> need not be cylindrical in shape. For instance, guide member may be a substantially flat, rectangular paddle pivotally connected to housing <b>16</b> at guide axis A<sub>2</sub>. Guide member <b>18</b> includes elongated slot <b>20</b> extending through guide member <b>18</b> along guide axis A<sub>2</sub>. Guide slot <b>20</b> is adapted to receive and guide a saw (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, guide slot <b>20</b> defines cut guide plane P along which the saw will cut when extending through guide slot <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, cut guide <b>10</b> may include guide member adjustment device <b>46</b> operably engaged to guide member <b>18</b> and adapted to rotate or pivot guide member <b>18</b> about guide axis A<sub>2</sub>. Guide member adjustment device <b>46</b> may be in any form capable of affecting the rotation of guide member <b>18</b>. For instance, adjustment device <b>46</b> may be in the form of a worm gear mechanism (not shown). Such a mechanism might include a knob at one end and a threaded portion at the other end. The threaded portion would engage a gear (not shown) defined on the end of guide member <b>18</b>. Rotation of the knob would induce the rotation of the threaded portion which, in turn, would cause the rotation of the gear of guide member <b>18</b>. Alternatively, adjustment device may be in the form of a bevel gear mechanism or pivoting lever. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10B</figref>, the operation of cut guide <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to its use in preparing the distal end of a femur. It should be understood, however, that the cut guide of the present invention may be adapted for use in preparing bones other than the distal end of the femur. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, femur F includes distal end F<sub>d</sub>, posterior side F<sub>p</sub>, anterior side F<sub>a</sub>, medial side (not indicated) and lateral side F<sub>L</sub>. Femur F defines mechanical axis A<sub>M</sub>, commonly defined as a line drawn from the center of the femoral head (not shown) to the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis of the distal end of femur F. The A/P axis (not shown) is a line extending anterior to posterior across the distal end of the femur midway between the two condyles. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> First, bone attachment device <b>12</b> is attached to lateral side F<sub>L </sub>of femur F. This may be accomplished by drilling a hole into lateral side F<sub>L </sub>of femur F and then driving spike <b>34</b> into the pre-drilled hole. As noted above, attachment device <b>12</b> may include features alternative to, or in addition to, spike <b>34</b> for attaching bone attachment device <b>12</b> to femur F. Bone attachment device <b>12</b> is coupled to and positioned on femur F such that second dimension D<sub>2 </sub>of second groove <b>38</b><i>b </i>is nearly parallel with mechanical axis A<sub>M </sub>of femur F. As will be demonstrated in the discussion below, cut guide <b>10</b> is capable of adjusting the position of guide slot <b>20</b> relative to multiple aspects and to an infinite number of positions. As such, second dimension D<sub>2 </sub>need not be aligned perfectly parallel with mechanical axis A<sub>M</sub>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Next, base <b>14</b> is coupled to bone attachment device <b>12</b> by sliding dove-tailed mounting portion <b>40</b> into one of first and second grooves <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>. Assuming that the distal end F<sub>d </sub>of femur F will be cut first, mounting portion <b>40</b> is slid into second groove <b>38</b><i>b </i>such that guide member <b>18</b> is positioned adjacent distal end F<sub>d </sub>of femur F, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the guide slot <b>20</b> is then adjusted to achieve the desired cut depth and angle. The position of guide slot <b>20</b> and, thus, cut plane P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is adjustable relative to three aspects. First, the depth of the cut may be adjusted by sliding mounting portion <b>40</b> within second groove <b>38</b><i>b </i>such that the position of guide slot <b>20</b> and cut plane P translates along second dimension D<sub>2</sub>. Second, the slope of cut guide plane P in an anterior to posterior direction may be adjusted by pivoting housing <b>16</b> about housing axis A<sub>1</sub>. This pivoting movement of housing <b>16</b> tilts or pivots guide slot <b>20</b> relative to second dimension D<sub>2 </sub>such that an angle &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>formed between guide axis A<sub>2 </sub>and dimension D<sub>2 </sub>changes as housing <b>16</b> is pivoted. This pivoting motion may be achieved using adjustment device <b>42</b>. More particularly, knob <b>42</b><i>a </i>is rotated which causes threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>to rotate. Threaded drive <b>42</b><i>b </i>engages gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>causing gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>to rotate about housing axis A<sub>1</sub>. Rotating gear <b>42</b><i>c </i>travels along gear surface <b>42</b><i>d </i>of housing <b>16</b> to thereby turn housing <b>16</b>. Thirdly, guide member <b>18</b> may be rotated about guide axis A<sub>2 </sub>to adjust the slope of cut guide plane P in a medial-lateral direction by activating guide member adjustment device <b>46</b>. A saw (not shown) is inserted through guide slot <b>20</b> and a cut along cut guide plane P is made to remove a portion of distal end F<sub>d </sub>of femur F. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, posterior side F<sub>p </sub>of femur F is cut by first sliding mounting portion <b>40</b> of base <b>14</b> from second groove <b>38</b><i>b </i>and sliding mounting portion <b>40</b> into first groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>at first end <b>26</b> of attachment device <b>12</b>. Guide member <b>18</b> is now positioned adjacent posterior side F<sub>p </sub>of femur F. The depth of the posterior cut is adjusted by sliding mounting portion <b>40</b> within second groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>thereby adjusting the position of guide slot <b>20</b> along first dimension D<sub>1</sub>. The slope of cut plane P in the distal to proximal direction may be adjusted by pivoting guide housing <b>16</b> and, thereby, adjusting angle &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>between guide axis A<sub>2 </sub>and dimension D<sub>1</sub>. Guide housing <b>16</b> may be pivoted, as described above, using housing adjustment device <b>42</b>. The slope of cut plane P extending medial-laterally is adjusted by rotating guide member <b>18</b> about axis A<sub>2</sub>, using guide member adjustment device <b>46</b>. Once cut plane P is properly positioned, a saw (not shown) may be inserted through guide slot <b>20</b> to guide the posterior cut. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, if chamfer cuts are needed, housing <b>16</b> is pivoted to thereby adjust angle &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>until the distal-proximal slope of cut plane P is in position to guide the posterior chamfer cut. A saw is then inserted through guide slot <b>20</b> to guide the posterior chamfer cut. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, to remove a portion of anterior side F<sub>a </sub>of femur F, mounting portion <b>40</b> is slidingly removed from first groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>and re-inserted into first groove <b>38</b><i>a </i>from second end <b>28</b> of bone attachment device <b>12</b>, such that guide member <b>18</b> is positioned adjacent anterior side F<sub>a </sub>of femur F. The adjustment steps described above with respect to the posterior cut are repeated to achieve the proper depth, medial-lateral slope and proximal-distal slope of cut guide plane P. Once cut plane P is positioned, the cut of the anterior side F<sub>a </sub>of femur F is made by inserting a saw through guide slot <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, if chamfer cuts are needed, housing <b>16</b> is pivoted to thereby adjust angle &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>until the distal-proximal slope of cut plane P is in position to guide the posterior chamfer cut. A saw is then inserted through guide slot <b>20</b> to guide the anterior chamfer cut. Once the distal, posterior, anterior and chamfer cuts are made, cut guide <b>10</b> is removed from femur F by pulling spike <b>34</b> from femur F. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> As demonstrated above, the cut guide of the present invention provides the ability to infinitely adjust the depth and angle of the anterior, posterior, distal and chamfer cuts, thereby allowing the user flexibility in making adjustments for varus, valgus, flexion, extension, and rotation of the knee. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> Although use of cut guide <b>10</b> is described above as a lateral approach wherein cut guide <b>10</b> is mounted on the lateral side of femur F, cut guide <b>10</b> may be used alternatively in a medial approach wherein cut guide <b>10</b> is mounted on the medial side of the femur. Cut guide <b>10</b> may also be adapted to mount on the distal end of the femur to make the anterior, posterior and chamfer cuts. In this case, the cut guide may be adapted to mount on an IM rod. In addition, cut guide <b>10</b> described above illustrates base receiving portion <b>38</b> as being grooves and mounting portion <b>40</b> as being a complementary tongue. Alternatively, the cut guide could be adapted such that the base receiving portion on the bone attachment device includes the tongue, while the mounting portion on the base includes the grooves. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> Cut guide <b>10</b> may be formed of any surgical grade rigid material such as stainless steel. The components of cut guide <b>10</b>, particularly bone attachment device <b>12</b>, base <b>14</b>, guide housing <b>16</b> and guide member <b>18</b> may be formed of the same material or differing materials. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains. </p>
