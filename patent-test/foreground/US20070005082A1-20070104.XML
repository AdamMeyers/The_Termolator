<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Stomach tissue is manipulated to form, for example, a restored flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve. The manipulation includes gripping stomach tissue from within the stomach while the stomach is inflated to promote visualization and stabilization of the gripped stomach tissue. Once the stomach tissue is gripped, the stomach is deflated and pulled into a mold. The molded tissue is then fastened with at least one fastener. The stomach is inflated to a first pressure during visualization and then to a second higher pressure during the stomach tissue gripping. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention generally relates to manipulation of stomach tissue as by folding, molding, and/or fastening and to treating gastroesophageal reflux disease using such techniques. The present invention more particularly relates to locating tissue fixation devices for fixing stomach tissue to stomach tissue in surgical environments to promote reliable fixating of stomach tissue. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition caused by the failure of the anti-reflux barrier located at the gastroesophageal junction to keep the contents of the stomach from splashing into the esophagus. The splashing is known as gastroesophageal reflux. The stomach acid is designed to digest meat, and will digest esophageal tissue when persistently splashed into the esophagus. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A principal reason for regurgitation associated with GERD is the mechanical failure of a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to close and seal against high pressure in the stomach. Due to reasons including lifestyle, a Grade I normal gastroesophageal flap may deteriorate into a malfunctioning Grade III or absent valve Grade IV gastroesophageal flap. With a deteriorated gastroesophageal flap, the stomach contents are more likely to be regurgitated into the esophagus, the mouth, and even the lungs. The regurgitation is referred to as &#x201c;heartburn&#x201d; because the most common symptom is a burning discomfort in the chest under the breastbone. Burning discomfort in the chest and regurgitation (burping up) of sour-tasting gastric juice into the mouth are classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). When stomach acid is regurgitated into the esophagus, it is usually cleared quickly by esophageal contractions. Heartburn (backwashing of stomach acid and bile onto the esophagus) results when stomach acid is frequently regurgitated into the esophagus and the esophageal wall is inflamed. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Complications develop for some people who have GERD. Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) with erosions and ulcerations (breaks in the lining of the esophagus) can occur from repeated and prolonged acid exposure. If these breaks are deep, bleeding or scarring of the esophagus with formation of a stricture (narrowing of the esophagus) can occur. If the esophagus narrows significantly, then food sticks in the esophagus and the symptom is known as dysphagia. GERD has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a subset of people who have severe GERD, if acid exposure continues, the injured squamous lining is replaced by a precancerous lining (called Barrett's Esophagus) in which a cancerous esophageal adenocarcinoma can develop. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Other complications of GERD may not appear to be related to esophageal disease at all. Some people with GERD may develop recurrent pneumonia (lung infection), asthma (wheezing), or a chronic cough from acid backing up into the esophagus and all the way up through the upper esophageal sphincter into the lungs. In many instances, this occurs at night, while the person is in a supine position and sleeping. Occasionally, a person with severe GERD will be awakened from sleep with a choking sensation. Hoarseness can also occur due to acid reaching the vocal cords, causing a chronic inflammation or injury. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> GERD never improves without intervention. Life style changes combined with both medical and surgical treatments exist for GERD. Medical therapies include antacids and proton pump inhibitors. However, the medical therapies only mask the reflux. Patients still get reflux and perhaps emphysema because of particles refluxed into the lungs. Barrett's esophagus results in about 10% of the GERD cases. The esophageal epithelium changes into tissue that tends to become cancerous from repeated acid washing despite the medication. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Several open laparotomy and laparoscopic surgical procedures are available for treating GERD. One surgical approach is the Nissen fundoplication. The Nissen approach typically involves a 360-degree wrap of the fundus around the gastroesophageal junction. The procedure has a high incidence of postoperative complications. The Nissen approach creates a 360-degree moveable flap without a fixed portion. Hence, Nissen does not restore the normal movable flap. The patient cannot burp because the fundus was used to make the repair, and may frequently experience dysphagia. Another surgical approach to treating GERD is the Belsey Mark IV (Belsey) fundoplication. The Belsey procedure involves creating a valve by suturing a portion of the stomach to an anterior surface of the esophagus. It reduces some of the postoperative complications encountered with the Nissen fundoplication, but still does not restore the normal movable flap. None of these procedures fully restores the normal anatomical anatomy or produces a normally functioning gastroesophageal junction. Another surgical approach is the Hill repair. In the Hill repair, the gastroesophageal junction is anchored to the posterior abdominal areas, and a 180-degree valve is created by a system of sutures. The Hill procedure restores the moveable flap, the cardiac notch and the Angle of His. However, all of these surgical procedures are very invasive, regardless of whether done as a laparoscopic or an open procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> New, less surgically invasive approaches to treating GERD involve transoral endoscopic procedures. One procedure contemplates a machine device with robotic arms that is inserted transorally into the stomach. While observing through an endoscope, an endoscopist guides the machine within the stomach to engage a portion of the fundus with a corkscrew-like device on one arm. The arm then pulls on the engaged portion to create a fold of tissue or radial plication at the gastroesophageal junction. Another arm of the machine pinches the excess tissue together and fastens the excess tissue with one pre-tied implant. This procedure does not restore normal anatomy. The fold created does not have anything in common with a valve. In fact, the direction of the radial fold prevents the fold or plication from acting as a flap of a valve. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Another transoral procedure contemplates making a fold of fundus tissue near the deteriorated gastroesophageal flap to recreate the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The procedure requires placing multiple U-shaped tissue clips around the folded fundus to hold it in shape and in place. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> This and the previously discussed procedure are both highly dependent on the skill, experience, aggressiveness, and courage of the endoscopist. In addition, these and other procedures may involve esophageal tissue in the repair. Esophageal tissue is fragile and weak, in part due to the fact, that the esophagus is not covered by serosa, a layer of very sturdy, yet very thin tissue, covering and stabilizing all intraabdominal organs, similar like a fascia covering and stabilizing muscle. Involvement of esophageal tissue in the repair of a gastroesophageal flap valve poses unnecessary risks to the patient, such as an increased risk of fistulas between the esophagus and the stomach. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> A new and improved apparatus and method for restoration of a gastroesophageal flap valve is fully disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,790,214, issued Sep. 14, 2004, is assigned to the assignee of this invention, and is incorporated herein by reference. That apparatus and method provides a transoral endoscopic gastroesophageal flap valve restoration. A longitudinal member arranged for transoral placement into a stomach carries a tissue shaper that non-invasively grips and shapes stomach tissue. A tissue fixation device is then deployed to maintain the shaped stomach tissue in a shape approximating a gastroesophageal flap. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Whenever tissue is to be maintained in a shape as, for example, in the improved assembly last mentioned above, it is necessary to first grip stomach tissue and then fasten at least two layers of gripped tissue together. In applications such as gastroesophageal flap valve restoration, it is desirable to grip stomach tissue displaced from the esophageal opening into the stomach so that when the stomach tissue is pulled aborally to form a flap, the flap will have sufficient length to cover the opening and function as a flap valve. With the gastroesophageal anatomy thus restored, the GERD will be effectively treated. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> Locating the proper gripping point in the stomach is not a simple matter. When the stomach is empty, it is normally in a collapsed state. Visualization within the stomach is extremely difficult. Once a desired gripping point is found, it is then necessary to form the GEFV flap and maintain its shape without involving the esophageal tissue. Still further, these manipulations of the stomach tissue must be repeated many times about the esophageal/stomach opening. Such further manipulation must repeat the dimensions of the manipulated stomach tissue to result in a valve structure of uniform geometry. This is, of course, extremely difficult under the circumstances provided by the anatomy of the stomach. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In maintaining the shape of the manipulated stomach tissue, fasteners may be employed. However, care must be taken against inadvertently fixing esophageal tissue to stomach tissue. As previously mentioned, this is fraught with potential complications. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> Still further, the mere act of gripping stomach tissue may be problematic. For example, one way stomach tissue may be gripped is snare it with a helical coil. In doing so, the helical coil is screwed into the tissue. Unfortunately, the mere act of turning the coil can cause the stomach tissue to also rotate and &#x201c;ball-up&#x201d; about the helix. Such an event greatly complicates the therapeutic procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> Hence, there is a need in the art for techniques and devices which enable more ready manipulation of stomach tissue from within the stomach. The present invention addresses these and other issues. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> The invention provides a method of restoring a flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve associated with a stomach. The method comprises inflating the stomach, gripping stomach tissue from within the stomach at a point displaced from the esophageal opening of the stomach, and deflating the stomach. The method further comprises pulling the gripped stomach tissue into a mold to form molded tissue, and deploying at least one fastener through the molded tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> The method may further comprise gripping a wall of the esophagus prior to gripping the stomach. The step of gripping a wall of the esophagus may include gripping the wall of the esophagus with a vacuum. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The method may further comprise reinflating the stomach before deploying the at least one fastener. The inflating step may include inflating the stomach to a first pressure. The method may further comprise visualizing the stomach from within the stomach after inflating the stomach to the first pressure, and increasing inflation pressure within the stomach to a second pressure after visualizing the stomach before gripping stomach tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> The invention further provides a method of restoring a flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve associated with a stomach, comprising gripping stomach tissue from within the stomach at a point displaced from the esophageal opening of the stomach and collapsing the stomach. The method further comprises pulling the gripped stomach tissue into a mold to form folded flap of tissue and deploying at least one fastener through the folded flap of tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The gripping, collapsing, pulling, and deploying steps may be repeated for forming another folded flap of tissue. Another fastener displaced from the at least one fastener may be deployed. The method may further comprise inflating the stomach before deploying the at least one fastener. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> The method may further comprise inflating the stomach before gripping the stomach tissue. The method may then comprise the further step of re-inflating the stomach prior to deploying the at least one fastener. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Before the gripping step, the stomach may be inflated to a first pressure. This may be followed by visualizing the stomach from within the stomach, and inflating the stomach to a second pressure. The second pressure may be greater than the first pressure. The method may further comprise repeating the inflating, gripping, collapsing, pulling, and deploying steps for forming another folded flap of tissue and deploying at least one other fastener displaced from the at least one fastener. The method may further comprise measuring from the folded flap of tissue prior to repeating the gripping step. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The invention still further provides a method of gripping stomach tissue from within a stomach. The method comprises visualizing the stomach from within the stomach to determine a gripping location, inflating the stomach, and gripping the stomach at the gripping location while the stomach is inflated. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The invention still further provides an assembly for restoring a gastroesophageal flap valve associated with a stomach. The assembly comprises an elongated member having a distal end for placement in the stomach, and a gastroesophageal flap valve restoration device. The device includes a chassis and a bail carried at the elongated member distal end. The chassis has a proximal end connected to the elongated member distal end and a distal end hingedly coupled to the bail. The chassis and bail are arranged to mold stomach tissue there between. The chassis further includes a window that permits gastroesophageal anatomy visualization. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The window is at the proximal end of the chassis. The device may further comprise a passage that slidingly receives an endoscope adjacent the window. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The device may further include a fastener deployment guide having a predetermined orientation relative to the window. The fastener deployment guide may comprise at least one guide lumen. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The window may include a location marker. The device may further include a fastener deployment guide that guides a fastener into molded tissue. The deployment guide may have a predetermined orientation relative to the location marker. A fastener deployer may then deploy a fastener in molded tissue at a predetermined location relative to the location marker. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The invention still further provides a method of deploying a fastener through stomach tissue a predetermined distance from a gastroesophageal junction. The method comprises providing a fastener deployment apparatus including a window permitting visualization of gastroesophageal anatomy when placed in an esophagus, a location marker viewable in the window, and a fastener deployer that ejects a fastener for deployment at a predetermined location relative to the location marker. The method further comprises feeding the apparatus down the esophagus, aligning the location marker with respect to the gastroesophageal junction to cause the fastener deployer to be aboral of the gastroesophageal junction, and ejecting a fastener from the fastener deployer with the location marker aligned with respect to the gastroesophageal junction. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> The invention further provides a fastener deployment apparatus that deploys a fastener in body tissue. The apparatus comprises a window permitting visualization of internal body anatomy when placed in a body, a location marker viewable in the window, and a fastener deployer having a predetermined orientation relative to the location marker that ejects a fastener for deployment at a predetermined location relative to the location marker.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of the esophageal-gastro-intestinal tract <b>40</b> from a lower portion of the esophagus <b>41</b> to the duodenum <b>42</b>. The stomach <b>43</b> is characterized by the greater curvature <b>44</b> on the anatomical left side and the lesser curvature <b>45</b> on the anatomical right side. The tissue of the outer surfaces of those curvatures is referred to in the art as serosa tissue. As will be seen subsequently, the nature of the serosa tissue is used to advantage for its ability to bond to like serosa tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> The fundus <b>46</b> of the greater curvature <b>44</b> forms the superior portion of the stomach <b>43</b>, and traps gas and air bubbles for burping. The esophageal tract <b>41</b> enters the stomach <b>43</b> at an esophageal orifice below the superior portion of the fundus <b>46</b>, forming a cardiac notch <b>47</b> and an acute angle with respect to the fundus <b>46</b> known as the Angle of His <b>57</b>. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) <b>48</b> is a discriminating sphincter able to distinguish between burping gas, liquids, and solids, and works in conjunction with the fundus <b>46</b> to burp. The gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) <b>49</b> includes a moveable portion and an opposing more stationary portion. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The moveable portion of the GEFV <b>49</b> is an approximately 180 degree, semicircular, gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> (alternatively referred to as a &#x201c;normal moveable flap&#x201d; or &#x201c;moveable flap&#x201d;) formed of tissue at the intersection between the esophagus <b>41</b> and the stomach <b>43</b>. The opposing more stationary portion of the GEFV <b>49</b> comprises a portion of the lesser curvature <b>45</b> of the stomach <b>43</b> adjacent to its junction with the esophagus <b>41</b>. The gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> principally comprises tissue adjacent to the fundus <b>46</b> portion of the stomach <b>43</b>. It is about 4 to 5 cm long (<b>51</b>) at it longest portion, and its length may taper at its anterior and posterior ends. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> The gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> is partially held against the lesser curvature <b>45</b> portion of the stomach <b>43</b> by the pressure differential between the stomach <b>43</b> and the thorax, and partially by the resiliency and the anatomical structure of the GEFV <b>49</b>, thus providing the valving function. The GEFV <b>49</b> is similar to a flutter valve, with the gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> being flexible and closeable against the other more stationary side. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> The esophageal tract is controlled by an upper esophageal sphincter (UES) in the neck near the mouth for swallowing, and by the LES <b>48</b> and the GEFV <b>49</b> at the stomach. The normal anti-reflux barrier is primarily formed by the LES <b>48</b> and the GEFV <b>49</b> acting in concert to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach, and to considerably resist reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus <b>41</b> past the gastroesophageal tissue junction <b>52</b>. Tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal tissue junction <b>52</b> is generally considered part of the stomach because the tissue protected from stomach acid by its own protective mechanisms. Tissue oral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> is generally considered part of the esophagus and it is not protected from injury by prolonged exposure to stomach acid. At the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b>, the juncture of the stomach and esophageal tissues form a zigzag line, which is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;Z-line.&#x201d; For the purposes of these specifications, including the claims, &#x201c;stomach&#x201d; means the tissue aboral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of an esophageal-gastro-intestinal tract illustrating a Grade I normal appearance movable flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> (shown in dashed lines) and a deteriorated Grade III gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> (shown in solid lines). As previously mentioned, a principal reason for regurgitation associated with GERD is the mechanical failure of the deteriorated (or reflux appearance) gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> to close and seal against the higher pressure in the stomach. Due to reasons including lifestyle, a Grade I normal gastroesophageal flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> may deteriorate into a Grade III deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b>. The anatomical results of the deterioration include moving a portion of the esophagus <b>41</b> that includes the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> and LES <b>48</b> toward the mouth, straightening of the cardiac notch <b>47</b>, and increasing the Angle of His <b>57</b>. This effectively reshapes the anatomy aboral of the gastroesophageal junction <b>52</b> and forms a flattened fundus <b>56</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"> The deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a gastroesophageal flap valve <b>49</b> and cardiac notch <b>47</b> that are both significantly degraded. Dr. Hill and colleagues developed a grading system to describe the appearance of the GEFV and the likelihood that a patient will experience chronic acid reflux. L. D. Hill, et al., <i>The gastroesophageal flap valve: in vitro and in vivo observations</i>, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 1996:44:541-547. Under Dr. Hill's grading system, the normal movable flap <b>50</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> illustrates a Grade I flap valve that is the least likely to experience reflux. The deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> of the GEFV <b>49</b> illustrates a Grade III (almost Grade IV) flap valve. A Grade IV flap valve is the most likely to experience reflux. Grades II and III reflect intermediate grades of deterioration and, as in the case of III, a high likelihood of experiencing reflux. With the deteriorated GEFV represented by deteriorated gastroesophageal flap <b>55</b> and the fundus <b>46</b> moved inferior, the stomach contents are presented a funnel-like opening directing the contents into the esophagus <b>41</b> and the greatest likelihood of experiencing reflux. Disclosed subsequently is a device, assembly, and method which may be employed to advantage according to an embodiment of the invention in restoring the normal gastroesophageal flap valve anatomy. </p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it shows a device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>100</b> includes a longitudinal member <b>102</b> for transoral placement of the device <b>100</b> into the stomach. The device further includes a first member <b>104</b>, hereinafter referred to as the chassis, and a second member <b>106</b>, hereinafter referred to as the bail. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail are hingedly coupled at <b>107</b>. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> form a tissue shaper which, as described subsequently in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, shapes tissue of the stomach into the flap of a restored gastroesophageal flap valve. The chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> are carried at the distal end of the longitudinal member <b>102</b> for placement in the stomach. </p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"> The device <b>100</b> has a longitudinal passage <b>101</b> to permit an endoscope <b>110</b> to be guided through the device and into the stomach. This permits the endoscope to service as a guide for guiding the device <b>100</b> through the patient's throat, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. It also permits the gastroesophageal flap valve restoration procedure to be viewed at each stage of the procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> As will be seen subsequently, to facilitate shaping of the stomach tissue, the stomach tissue is drawn in between the chassis <b>104</b> and the bail <b>106</b>. Further, to enable a flap of sufficient length to be formed to function as the flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve, the stomach tissue is pulled down so that the fold line is substantially juxtaposed to the opening of the esophagus into the stomach. Hence, as will be seen, the stomach is first gripped at a point out and away from the esophagus and the grip point is pulled to almost the hinged connection <b>107</b> of the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b>. As described in copending application Ser. No. 11/001,666, filed Nov. 30, 2004, entitled FLEXIBLE TRANSORAL ENDOSCOPIC GASTROESOPHAGEAL FLAP VALVE RESTORATION DEVICE AND METHOD, which application is incorporated herein by reference, the device <b>100</b> is fed down the esophagus with the bail <b>106</b> substantially in line with the chassis <b>104</b>. To negotiate the bend of the throat, and as described in the aforementioned referenced application, the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b> are rendered flexible. The chassis <b>104</b> is rendered flexible by the slots <b>108</b> and the bail <b>106</b> is rendered flexible by the hingedly coupled links <b>112</b>. Further details concerning the flexibility of the chassis <b>104</b> and the bail <b>106</b> may be found in the aforementioned referenced application. </p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the device further includes a tissue gripper <b>114</b>. The gripper <b>114</b>, in this embodiment, comprises a helical coil <b>115</b>. The coil <b>115</b> is carried at the end of a cable <b>116</b> and may be attached to the end of the cable or be formed from the cable. In this embodiment, the helical coil <b>115</b> is attached to the cable <b>116</b> and is preceded by a guide <b>118</b> whose function will be described subsequently. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> The helical coil <b>115</b> is shown in an approximate position to engage the stomach tissue out and away from the opening of the esophagus to the stomach. The helical coil <b>115</b> is guided into position by a guide structure <b>120</b> carried on the bail <b>106</b>. The guide structure <b>120</b> comprises a guide tube <b>122</b>. When the device <b>100</b> is first introduced down the esophagus into the stomach, the helical coil <b>115</b> is caused to reside well within the guide tube <b>122</b> to preclude the helical coil from accidentally or inadvertently snagging esophageal or stomach tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> The guide tube includes a longitudinal slit <b>126</b> having a circuitous configuration. The slit <b>126</b> permits the end of the cable to release or disassociate from the bail after the stomach tissue is gripped. The circuitous configuration of the slit <b>126</b> assures confinement of the cable <b>116</b> within the guide tube <b>122</b> until release of the cable is desired. The proximal end of the slit <b>126</b> has an enlarged portion or opening (not shown). This opening permits the cable and helical coil to reenter the lumen when the device <b>100</b> is readied for a repeated stomach tissue shaping procedure. To that end, the guide <b>118</b> has a conical surface that serves to guide the cable end back into the opening of the slit <b>126</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the device <b>100</b> further comprises a fastener deployer <b>140</b>. The fastener deployer includes at least one fastener deployment guide <b>142</b>. The fastener deployment guide <b>142</b> takes the form of a guide lumen. Although only one guide lumen <b>142</b> is shown, it will be appreciated that the device <b>100</b> may include a plurality of such lumens without departing from the invention. The guide lumen terminates at a delivery point <b>144</b> where a fastener is driven into the molded stomach tissue. The fastener deployer may take the form of any one of the assemblies fully described and claimed, for example, in </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"> The device <b>100</b> further includes a window <b>130</b> within the chassis <b>104</b>. The window is formed of a transparent or semi-transparent material. This permits gastroesophageal anatomy, and more importantly the gastroesophageal junction (Z-line) to be viewed with the endoscope <b>110</b>. The window includes a location marker <b>132</b> which has a know position relative to the fastener delivery point <b>144</b>. Hence, by aligning the marker with a known anatomical structure, the fastener will be delivered a known distance from or at a location having a predetermined relation to the marker. For example, by aligning the marker with the Z-line, it will be know that the fastener will be placed aboral of the Z-line and that serosa tissue will be fastened to serosa tissue. As previously mentioned, this has many attendant benefits. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"> It may also be mentioned at this point that the device <b>100</b> further includes an invaginator <b>145</b> including a plurality of orifices <b>146</b>. These orifices <b>146</b>, which alternatively may be employed on the longitudinal member <b>102</b>, are used to pull a vacuum to cause the device <b>100</b> to grip the inner surface of the esophagus. This will serve to stabilize the esophagus and maintain device positioning during the procedure. This vacuum gripping of the esophagus may also be used to particular advantage if the patient suffers from a hiatal hernia. Upon being thus gripped, the esophagus may be moved downwardly with the device toward the stomach to eliminate the hiatal hernia. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"> Now that a device <b>100</b> according to the present invention and which may be used in a method of restoring the flap of a gastroesophageal flap valve according to this embodiment of the present invention has been described, reference may now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The procedure, according to this embodiment, for restoring the flap of the gastroesophageal flap valve begins with loading a fastener or a plurality of fasteners into the device <b>100</b>. As will be seen hereinafter, the fastener deployer includes a stylet which guides each fastener into the tissue to be fastened. The process of loading a fastener, according to this embodiment, includes snapping a fastener onto the stylet. A representative fastener and stylet will be described subsequently with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Next, the bail <b>106</b> is moved to be substantially in line with the chassis <b>104</b>. Next, the endoscope <b>110</b> is inserted into the device with an appropriate lubricant on the endoscope. Next, a bite block, of the type well known in the art, is inserted into the patient's mouth. A lubricant may be applied to the device and the device may now be inserted through the bite block in the subject's mouth. With the endoscope leading the device as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the endoscope and device combination are fed down the esophagus <b>141</b> into the stomach. Of course, when the endoscope <b>110</b> reaches its fully inserted position, the device <b>100</b> may be further advanced on the endoscope utilizing the endoscope as a guide to within the stomach of the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"> As previously mentioned, the device <b>100</b> is able to clear the bend in the patient's throat by virtue of being flexible as previously described. With the endoscope serving as a guide tube, very little force should be needed to get the device around the neck into the pharynx and down into the esophagus. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the device <b>100</b> upon reaching the interior of the stomach <b>43</b>. Here it may be seen that the bail <b>106</b> is substantially in line with the chassis <b>104</b>. The endoscope <b>110</b> remains within the device <b>100</b>. Also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> it may be noted that the stomach is deflated. This is the normal condition of the stomach when the stomach is empty. </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> Once the device is positioned in the stomach as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the stomach is inflated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by passing air through the endoscope into the stomach. The inflation of the stomach may be noted by the outward arcuate deflection of the stomach <b>43</b>. The stomach should be inflated to a first pressure just sufficient to open the stomach and provide good visibility of gastric folds on the interior wall <b>59</b> of the stomach. Visualization of such gastric folds permits discernment of a proper point to grip the stomach for forming the gastroesophageal flap valve flap in a manner to be described hereinafter. Once the stomach has been inflated to the first pressure, the device is placed in a desired position relative to the Z-line by placing the marker of the window <b>130</b> in a desired position relative to the Z-line <b>52</b> marking the transition from the esophagus <b>41</b> to the stomach <b>43</b>. In accordance with this embodiment, the marker <b>132</b> is aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>. In order to visualize the marker and the Z-line, the endoscope <b>110</b> is pulled back into the device <b>100</b> and more particular adjacent the marker <b>132</b> to visualize when the marker is aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>. With the marker <b>132</b> aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>, the distance from the marker <b>132</b> to a proximal point of the elongated member <b>102</b> relative to a rather fixed anatomy site of the patient, such as an incisor may be measured. This measurement may be marked on the elongated member <b>102</b> and later utilized for positioning the marker <b>132</b> adjacent the Z-line <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with the stomach still inflated to the first pressure, the endoscope is positioned inside the device just past the hinged connection <b>107</b> of the bail <b>106</b> and chassis <b>104</b>. With the endoscope being located just past the hinged connection <b>107</b>, the bail is then actuated to an approximally one-half closed position as illustrated. As the bail moves, the bail should be watched to make sure that it moves towards the greater curve <b>56</b> so it can move freely in the open space of the gastric cavity. With the endoscope in the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the bail should be visible at all times. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the endoscope <b>110</b> is advanced back into the stomach <b>43</b> and brought to a reflexed view as illustrated so that it may look back on the device <b>100</b>. With the operating end of the device in clear view, the device <b>100</b> is positioned in the center of the gastroesophageal flap valve to be formed where the posterior and anterior groove should be. This position is typically opposite the lesser curve <b>45</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> Next, the device positioning relative to the Z-line <b>52</b> is checked to make sure that the marker <b>132</b> is in its desired position relative to the Z-line <b>52</b>. In accordance with this embodiment, the marker <b>132</b> is placed adjacent or is aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> With the device in the correct starting position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a vacuum pump communicating with orifices <b>146</b> is energized to pull a vacuum through the orifices <b>146</b>. This causes the orifices to engage the wall of the esophagus <b>41</b> for gripping the esophagus. As previously mentioned, this invagination permits the esophagus to be pushed into the stomach by distal movement of the elongated member <b>102</b> to treat a hiatal hernia and to stabilize the position of the device within the stomach. The vacuum is continued to be pulled through the orifices <b>146</b> until the vacuum is above the 50 kps mark on the vacuum pump. The device is then pushed gently aborally to reposition the esophagus to correct a hiatal hernia. It may be noted that this maneuver can also be used to visually check the position of the faster delivery point <b>144</b> relative to the Z-line. During this maneuver, the esophagus may roll back on itself and expose the esophageal Mucosa and the Z-line adjacent to the fastener delivery ports. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with the device locked in position by the vacuum orifices <b>146</b>, the area in which the helical coil is to be engaged may be identified. The gripping location may be largely determined by the size or length of the flap to be restored of the restored gastroesophageal flap valve. This of course may differ from one patient to another depending on the severity of the hiatal hernia and the degree of valve degradation. Once the gripping location is selected, the stomach <b>43</b> is inflated to a second and higher pressure. The inflation pressure of the stomach is increased to the second and higher pressure so that the Mucosa appears tight and the folds essentially flatten. With the correct gripping spot identified, the bail <b>106</b> is moved to position the tip of a helical coil <b>115</b> at the correct gripping spot. Next, the device <b>100</b> is gently pulled upwardly or orally until the bail contacts the tissue at the desired gripping spot. Next, the helix <b>115</b> is advanced by the pushing of the cable <b>116</b> until the helix pushes into the Mucosa. Next, the cable <b>116</b> is turned to likewise turn the helix <b>115</b> in a clockwise direction to screw the helix into the tissue. As the cable is turned, some wind-up may be filled in the helix drive cable. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> With the helical coil <b>115</b> firmly seated in the tissue, the wind-up in the cable <b>116</b> is released. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, with the retractor firmly seated in the tissue, the device <b>100</b> may be advanced slightly orally while at the same time the bail <b>116</b> may be opened slightly. This releases the cable <b>116</b> from the guide tube which has now been pulled back into the bail <b>106</b>. The cable <b>116</b> exits the guide tube <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) by slipping through the circuitous slit <b>126</b>. This operation is more particularly described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/061,318, filed Feb. 18, 2005, incorporated herein by reference. Also at this time, the correct positioning of the device relative to the Z-line may be verified. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> With the bail <b>106</b> slightly opened and the helix <b>115</b> engaged with the tissue <b>43</b>, the interior of the stomach is now deflated through the endoscope <b>110</b>. The stomach should be deflated such that the tissue appears loose and collapsed with the Mucosa folds being prominent. However, enough room should be left to view the device. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the gastric tissue is now gently pulled with the helix <b>115</b> and cable <b>116</b> towards the hinged connection <b>107</b> and the valve mold to be formed by the chassis <b>104</b> and closing bail <b>106</b>. Once the helix is fully retracted into the bail <b>116</b>, it is locked in place. The bail <b>106</b> may now be closed and the device and anatomy will appear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Here it will be noted that the stomach tissue aboral of the Z-line <b>52</b> is confined between the bail <b>106</b> and chassis <b>104</b> to create a fold <b>150</b>. The fold is also adjacent the fastener delivery point <b>144</b> at the end of the fastener guide lumen. Since the fastener deployment point <b>144</b> is a known predetermined distance from the marker <b>132</b> of the window <b>130</b>, and since the marker <b>132</b> is aligned with the Z-line <b>52</b>, when a fastener is delivered from the fastener deployer of the device, the fastener will exit the fastener delivery point <b>144</b> at a point known to be aboral of the Z-line <b>52</b>. This assures that only serosa tissue is being adhered to serosa tissue in the fixation of the stomach tissue in creating the flap <b>150</b>. The flap <b>150</b> comprises layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> of stomach tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> With the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> now disposed within the mold of the chassis <b>104</b> and bail <b>106</b>, the bail <b>106</b> may now be locked with respect to the chassis <b>104</b>. It is now time to fasten the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> together by ejecting a fastener from the fastener deployer lumen <b>142</b> at the fastener delivery point <b>144</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> Before a fastener is ejected from the fastener deployer lumen <b>142</b>, the stomach is once again inflated through the endoscope <b>110</b>. The stomach is inflated to a point where one has a good view of the tissue fold and bail <b>106</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> illustrate a manner in which the device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-13</figref> may deploy a fastener <b>200</b> through the layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> of gripped stomach tissue. The fastener <b>200</b> generally includes a first member <b>202</b>, a second member <b>204</b>, and a connecting member <b>206</b>. As may be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the first member <b>202</b> and second member <b>204</b> are substantially parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the connecting member <b>206</b> which connects the first member <b>202</b> to the second member <b>204</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> The first member <b>202</b> is generally cylindrical or can any shape. It has a channel <b>212</b> that extends therethrough. The though channel <b>112</b> is dimensioned to be slidingly received on a tissue piercing deployment wire <b>264</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> The first member <b>202</b> includes a pointed tip <b>224</b>. The tip <b>224</b> may be conical and more particularly takes the shape of a truncated cone. The tip can also be shaped to have a cutting edge in order to reduce tissue resistance. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> The first member <b>202</b> also has a continuous lengthwise slit <b>225</b>. The slit <b>225</b> includes an optional slot <b>226</b> that communicates with the through channel <b>212</b>. The slot <b>226</b> has a transverse dimension for more readily enabling receipt of the tissue piercing deployment wire <b>264</b> during deployment of the fastener <b>200</b>. Also, because the fastener member <b>202</b> is formed of flexible material, the slit <b>225</b> may be made larger through separation to allow the deployment wire to be snapped into and released from the through channel <b>212</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"> In addition to the fastener <b>200</b> and the deployment wire <b>264</b>, the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> further includes a pusher <b>266</b> and a guide tube <b>268</b>. The subassembly of the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and pusher <b>266</b> may be guided to its intended location relative to the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> by the guide tube <b>268</b>. The tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and the pusher <b>266</b> are all initially within the guide tube <b>268</b>. The guide tube <b>268</b> is representative of the fastener deployment guide and to that end, includes the fastener deployment guide lumen <b>142</b>. The subassembly of the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>, fastener <b>200</b>, and pusher <b>266</b> may be guided to its intended location relative to the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> by the guide lumen <b>142</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> has a tip <b>270</b> helping it pierce the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> that will form the restored gastroesophageal flap valve flap <b>150</b>. The pusher <b>266</b> has pushed the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> on the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086"> In accordance with a further method of utilizing the fastener deployment assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> may be first advanced through the tissue layers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> by a full stroke and then locked. The tip <b>270</b> of the deployment wire <b>264</b> should extend through the bail <b>206</b> with minimal tenting of the tissue. Next, the pusher <b>266</b> is advanced. Visual confirmation that the first fastener member <b>202</b> is through the tissue is then made. In doing so, the very distal end of the pusher <b>266</b> may be visible when the first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> is fully deployed. Next, while holding the pusher <b>266</b> at the last noted position, the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> is retracted. The first member <b>202</b> of the fastener <b>200</b> will fall to the side when the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> reaches the pusher <b>266</b>. When the tissue piercing wire <b>264</b> reaches the pusher <b>266</b> and after the fastener <b>200</b> is deployed, the pusher <b>266</b> is pulled back with the tissue piercing wire. If additional fastener deployment guides are provided, the foregoing steps for deploying a fastener such as fastener <b>200</b> may be repeated. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"> With the fasteners successfully deployed, the vacuum pull through orifices <b>146</b> may now be turned off to release the device from the esophagus wall as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. At this time, the bail <b>106</b> of the device <b>100</b> may be slightly opened and the helical coil <b>115</b> may be released from the stomach tissue. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the procedure just described results in a flap <b>150</b> to be formed. At this time, an additional fastener or fasteners may be loaded onto the tissue piercing deployment wire <b>264</b> at the proximal end of the longitudinal member <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"> To render the flap uniform about the opening of the orifice into the stomach, it is necessary at this time to rotate the device <b>102</b> and repeat the previously described procedure for forming a further flap portion. Before this is done, however, it is desirable to position the bail <b>106</b> to an almost closed position. Then, the device <b>100</b> is moved aborally further into the stomach until the tip end <b>107</b> of the bail <b>106</b> comes to rest on the tip <b>151</b> of the newly formed flap portion. This is the location where the helical coil <b>115</b> will next engage the stomach tissue for molding and fixating as previously described. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"> The foregoing is repeated until a complete valve flap is formed. When the appearance of the valve flap is satisfactory as viewed through the endoscope for visual confirmation, the helical coil <b>115</b> is reloaded back into its original position with the device <b>100</b>. The vacuum suction through orifices <b>146</b> is turned off to release the wall of the esophagus from the device. The bail <b>106</b> is then moved to a fully opened position as seen, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The endoscope may now be retracted along with the stylet and pusher controls. With the retraction of the foregoing verified, the stomach may now be deflated and the device <b>100</b> may be removed from the stomach and esophagus. This then completes the procedure according to this embodiment of the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"> While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, modifications may be made, and it is thereto intended in the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </p>
