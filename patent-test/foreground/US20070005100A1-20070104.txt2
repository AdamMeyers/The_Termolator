A vascular occlusion device deployment system for placing an occlusion device at a preselected site within the vasculature of a patient. The deployment system employing light energy transferred through an optical fiber to sever a securing filament attaching the occlusion device to the deployment system, thereby releasing the occlusion device at the preselected location. 














FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention is related to deployment systems and methods for accurately deploying vascular occlusion devices at a preselected site within the vasculature of a patient, and more particularly, deployment systems that provide rapid release of vascular occlusion devices by using light transmitted through an optical fiber to break a severable securing filament connecting the occlusion device to the deployment system. 
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 
 The use of catheter delivery systems for positioning and deploying therapeutic devices, such as dilatation balloons, stents and embolic coils, in the vasculature of the human body has become a standard procedure for treating endovascular diseases. It has been found that such devices are particularly useful in treating areas where traditional operational procedures are impossible or pose a great risk to the patient, for example in the treatment of aneurysms in cranial blood vessels. Due to the delicate tissue surrounding cranial blood vessels, especially for example brain tissue, it is very difficult and often risky to perform surgical procedures to treat such a defect. Advancements in catheter deployment systems have provided an alternative treatment in such cases. Some of the advantages of catheter delivery systems are that they provide methods for treating blood vessels by an approach that has been found to reduce the risk of trauma to the surrounding tissue, and they also allow for treatment of blood vessels that in the past would have been considered inoperable. 
 Typically, these procedures involve inserting the distal end of a delivery catheter into the vasculature of a patient and guiding it through the vasculature to a predetermined delivery site. A vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, is attached to the end of a delivery member which pushes the coil through the catheter and out of the distal end of the catheter into the delivery site. Some of the problems that have been associated with these procedures relate to the accuracy of coil placement. For example, the force of the coil exiting the delivery catheter may cause the coil to over shoot the predetermined site or dislodge previously deployed coils. Also, once the coil is pushed out of the distal end of the catheter, the coil cannot be retracted and may migrate to an undesired location. Often, retrieving and repositioning the coil requires a separate procedure and has the potential to expose the patient to additional risk. 
 In response to the above mentioned concerns, numerous devices and release mechanisms have been developed in an attempt to provide a deployment system which allows control of the occlusion device after the device has exited the catheter and provides a rapid release or detachment mechanism to release the device once it is in place. One such device is disclosed in Geremia et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,407, which shows a fiber optic cable including a connector device mounted to the end to the optical fiber. An embolic coil is attached to the connector device by a heat releasable adhesive. Laser light is transmitted through the fiber optic cable to increase the temperature of the connector device, which melts the adhesive and releases the embolic coil. One drawback to using this type of system is the potential risk of melted adhesives contaminating the blood stream. 
 Another coil deployment system employs a pusher member having an embolic coil attached to the pusher member by a connector fiber which is capable of being broken by heat, as disclosed in Gandhi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,773. The pusher member of this arrangement includes an electrical resistance heating coil through which the connector fiber is passed. Electrical current is supplied to the heating coil by a power source connected to the heating coil via wires extending through an internal lumen of the pusher. The power source is activated to increase the temperature of the heating coil which breaks the connector fiber. One drawback is that connecting the resistance heating coil to the power source requires running multiple wires through the pusher member. Additionally, the electrical current traveling through the wires may create stray electromagnetic fields that interfere with other surgical and monitoring equipment. 
 Yet another embolic coil positioning and delivery system is described in Saadat et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,242, which discloses a catheter having a shape memory alloy connector attached to the distal end of the catheter. The connector includes a socket having a pair of spaced-apart fingers which are responsive to a change in temperature. The fingers are bent towards each other and hold a ball which is connected to an end of an embolic coil. The connector absorbs laser light transmitted through an optical cable and transmits the light into heat energy. The heat energy raises the temperature of the connector and opens the fingers, thereby releasing the embolic coil. This type of ball and socket connection is rigid and causes the catheter to be stiff, making it difficult to guide the catheter through the vasculature of the body. This patent, and all other patents and references identified are hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
 Therefore, a need remains for a rapid release vascular occlusion device deployment system that is simple to manufacture, flexible and easy to guide through the vasculature of the body, minimizes the risk of foreign materials entering the bloodstream, provides enhanced and superior control over the occlusion device, and reduces the possibility of interference with other surgical and monitoring equipment. 
SUMMARY OF INVENTION 
 The present invention is related to a deployment system and method for accurately and rapidly deploying a vascular occlusion device at a preselected site within the vasculature of a patient. The deployment system may employ an elongated flexible catheter for guiding a deployment unit to the preselected site. The deployment unit includes a delivery tube or pusher that pushes and guides the vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, through the catheter to the preselected deployment site. The delivery tube includes an optical fiber, which may extend through a lumen of the delivery tube, for transmitting light energy from the proximal end of the delivery tube to the distal end of the delivery tube. The light energy preferably is provided by a laser light source operatively connected to the proximal end of the optical fiber. An element which increases in temperature upon exposure to light is located at the distal end of the delivery tube. The occlusion device is connected to the distal end of the delivery tube by a securing filament which is capable of being severed by heat. The element and the securing filament are positioned within the delivery unit so that generated heat energy causes the securing filament to break, deploying the occlusion device at the predetermined site. 
 It is accordingly a general aspect or object of the present invention to provide a deployment system and method for accurately deploying a vascular occlusion device within the vasculature of the body. 
 Another aspect or object of the present invention is to provide a deployment system and method for rapidly deploying an occlusion device. 
 Another aspect or object of the present invention is to provide an occlusion device deployment system and method that eliminates or minimizes risk of undesirable materials entering the body of the patient. 
 Another aspect or object of the present invention is to provide a deployment system in which control is retained over the occlusion device after it has exited the catheter. 
 Another aspect or object of the present invention is to provide a deployment system which eliminates or minimizes any interference, including electrical or magnetic interference with other equipment used in medical procedures, including surgical and monitoring equipment. 
 Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will be understood from the following description according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, specifically including stated and unstated combinations of the various features which are described herein, relevant information concerning which is shown in the accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 While detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various further forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in any appropriate manner. 
 FIG. 1 generally illustrates a preferred embodiment of the vascular occlusion device deployment system of the present invention. The deployment system, generally designated at 10, includes an elongated flexible guiding catheter 12 which is inserted into the vasculature of a patient and used to guide a deployment unit 14 to a preselected site in a manner generally known in the art. The deployment unit, generally designated at 14, includes an elongated flexible optical fiber 16 which is capable of transmitting light energy from a proximal end portion 18 to a distal end portion 20. The optical fiber 16 may be comprised of any suitable material, such as quartz. The optical fiber 16 may also be housed within a delivery tube 22 which may comprise any suitable insulated or noninsulated material. A laser light source 24, for providing laser light energy, is operatively connected to the proximal end portion 18 of the optical fiber, and a vascular occlusion device, such as embolic coil 25, is connected to the distal end of the deployment unit in a manner consistent with the discussion herein. 
 The distal end portion of the pusher includes an element which facilitates application of energy to sever a connecting member holding the occlusion device to the deployment unit. This element is illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 as an element 26 connected to the distal end portion 20 of optical fiber 16. The element 26, which may be considered a heating element, is capable of absorbing light energy and converting it into heat energy. Preferably, the element 26 is a heating element comprised of any suitable metal, such as brass, brass alloy or nickel-titanium alloy. The element 26 may be attached to the distal end portion 20 of the optical fiber 16 by a shrink tubing 28 as illustrated. Preferably, the shrink tubing 28 is a heat shrink tubing which may be comprised of a polyethylene terephthalute (PET) or any other suitable material. 
 The illustrated arrangement of shrink tubing 28 includes a proximal end portion 30 and a distal end portion 32. The proximal end portion 30 of the shrink tubing 28 overlaps the distal end portion 20 of the optical fiber and the distal end portion 32 of the shrink tubing 28 overlaps the proximal end portion 34 of the element 26. The shrink tubing 28 is shrunk to operatively connect the element 26 to the optical fiber 16 in a secure manner. In this illustrated embodiment, the element 26 remains within the delivery tube 22 to minimize any possible contact between the element 26 and tissue of the patient. 
 The embolic coil 25 is connected to the delivery unit 14 by a severable securing filament 36 which is capable of being broken by energy generated at the element 26, typically by heat energy. The securing filament 36 is preferably comprised of a polymer such as a polyolefin, such as polyethylene or a polyamide such as nylon or a polyester such as PET and may be about 0.001 to 0.030 inches (about 0.025 mm to about 0.76 mm) thick, preferably, between about 0.003 and 0.015 inches (about 0.076 mm to about 0.38 mm) thick. When the filament is generally circular in cross-section, this thickness is a diameter. The securing filament 36 is designed to break when a portion of the filament is exposed to a temperature which is above body temperature. As an example, the temperature of the element 26 can, preferably, be raised to between about 45       C. and about 65       C. A higher temperature range from about 65       C. to 80       C. may be used for a very short period of time. 
 The embolic coil 25 may take various forms and configurations and may also be filled with a fibrous material or may be coated with a beneficial substance, such as a biogel to promote clotting. Alternatively, the embolic coil may take the form of any other occlusive device or approach known in the art such as hydrogels, foams, bioactive coils, braids, cables and hybrid devices having a suitable configuration for attachment. The illustrated embolic coin 25 is provided with a head piece 38 having an orifice 40 therethrough. The securing filament 36 loops through the orifice 40, and the ends 42 of the securing filament 36 are secured in place. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the ends 42 are positioned to engage the shrink tubing 28; for example, ends 42 may be placed between the shrink tubing 28 and the element 26. When the shrink tubing 28 is shrunk, the ends 42 will be securely retained between the shrink tubing and the element 26, even after severance of the filament to release the vascular occlusion device. 
 In a second preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the proximal end portion 34 of the element 26 may by attached to the distal end portion 20 of the optical fiber 16 by means other than shrink tubing, for example by an adhesive, such as a cyanoacrylate adhesive. Further, the securing filament 36 may be connected to the element 26 by wrapping the end lengths 44 of the securing filament around the element 26. If desired, an adhesive may be applied to the wrapped portions or end lengths 44 of the securing filament 36 for extra support. 
 In operation, the catheter 12 is inserted into the vasculature of the patient and positioned at a preselected location, typically in conjunction with other devices and professional procedures as generally known in the art. The delivery unit 14 is inserted into catheter 12 and once a desired location is reached, the unit 14 is advanced and/or the catheter is moved in a retrograde manner until the embolic coil 25 or other vascular occlusion device moves through the catheter and out of the distal end of the catheter. During the procedure, and before the filament has been broken, if it is determined that the distal end of the catheter 12 or the embolic coil 25 is not at the correct location, the coil 25 may be retrieved back into the distal end of the catheter so that the catheter and/or the coil may be repositioned. 
 When the embolic coil 25 is at the correct location and in the correct position, the laser light source 24 is activated to expose the proximal end portion 18 of the optical fiber 16 to laser light energy. The optical fiber 16 transmits the laser light energy to the distal end portion 20 of the optical fiber, exposing the element 26 to the laser light energy. The element 26 receives the laser light energy for severing the filament. In a typical approach, the element 26 absorbs the laser light energy and converts this optical energy to thermal energy, whereby the temperature of the element 26 increases. With this, the element 26 produces the necessary heat energy to sever the heat severable securing element 36, releasing the embolic coil 25 at the preselected site, as illustrated in FIG. 5. 
 In order to ensure that the securing filament 36 severs at only a single location, the filament may have a thickness or diameter that is smaller at the desired breakpoint location than that of the rest of the securing filament. Alternatively, the filament may be insulated except at the desired breakpoint location or exhibit a greater responsiveness to heat absorption at the desired breakpoint location by composition or physical differences. 
 After the filament 36 has been broken and the embolic coil 25 has been released, the delivery unit 14 may be withdrawn from the catheter 12 and a new delivery unit may be inserted to deploy another coil. This procedure may by repeated until the desired number of coils has been deployed. 
 It will be understood that the embodiments of the present invention which have been described are illustrative of some of the applications of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, including those combinations of features that are individually disclosed or claimed herein.
