<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> Various types of devices and systems have been used to stabilize portions of bones including the spine. Spinal stabilization techniques have employed plating and rods on the posterior, anterior, lateral, postero-lateral and antero-lateral portions of a spinal column segment. Such systems can provide rigid or dynamic fixation of a spinal column segment for the repair of injured or diseased vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and other elements of the spinal column. There remains a need for stabilization systems that are adaptable for various stabilization requirements in a single spinal procedure. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> According to one aspect, a multi-directional spinal stabilization system is provided that includes a motion preserving construct extending trans-axially between pedicles of adjacent vertebrae. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> According to another aspect, there is provided a multi-directional spinal stabilization system that includes a first anchor engageable to a first vertebra on a first side of a central axis of a spinal column and a second anchor engageable to the first vertebra on a second side of the central axis and a third anchor engageable to a second vertebra on the first side of the central axis and a fourth anchor engageable to the second vertebra on the second side of the central axis. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In one form, the system includes a first stabilization construct with an elongate flexible body in the form of a loop positionable about the first and fourth anchors. The system further includes a second stabilization construct with an elongate flexible body in the form of a loop positionable about the second and third anchors. When engaged to the respective anchors, the second stabilization construct extends transversely to the first stabilization construct and each of the first and second stabilization constructs are obliquely oriented to the central axis. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In another form, the system includes a stabilization construct with an elongate flexible body having a first trans-axial portion engageable to the first anchor and extendable obliquely across the central axis to the fourth anchor. The construct further includes a second trans-axial portion engageable to the second anchor and extendable obliquely across the central axis to the third anchor. The stabilization construct also includes a connecting portion extendable between the third and fourth anchors. The stabilization construct is slidable relative to the third and fourth anchors in response to axial rotation of the first and second vertebrae to maintain tension on the stabilization construct. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In a further form, the system includes a flexible, compressible stabilization construct including a central body positionable between the first, second, third and fourth anchors along the central axis. The stabilization construct further includes a first arm extending from the central body to the first anchor, a second arm extending from the central body to the second anchor, a third arm extending from the central body to the third anchor, and a fourth arm extending from the central body to the fourth anchor. The arms are each obliquely oriented to the central axis and the stabilization construct limits distraction and compression of the first and second vertebrae when engaged to the anchors. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> According to another aspect, a multi-directional spinal stabilization system includes a first member structured for positioning between and engagement to said first and second anchors engaged bi-laterally or on opposite sides of the central axis of a first vertebra and a second member structured for positioning between and engagement to said third and fourth anchors engaged bi-laterally or on opposite sides of a central axis of a second vertebra. A third member is engageable to the first member between the first and second anchors. The third member is structured to extend from the first member to the second member. The third member is further engageable to the second member between the third and fourth anchors. At least one of said first, second and third members is flexible and at least one other of the first, second and third members is rigid. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In another aspect, methods for multi-directional spinal stabilization are provided. The method includes engaging a first anchor to a first vertebra on a first side of a central axis of the spinal column; engaging a second anchor to the first vertebra on a second side of the central axis; engaging a third anchor to a second vertebra on the first side of the central axis; and engaging a fourth anchor to the second vertebra on the second side of the central axis. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In one form, the method further includes positioning a first elongate stabilization construct about the first anchor and the fourth anchor in an oblique orientation to the central axis; and positioning a second elongate stabilization construct about the second anchor and the third anchor in an oblique orientation to the central axis, wherein the first and second stabilization constructs each form a loop extending between the respective anchors to which each is engaged. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In another form, the method further includes fixing a first end of an elongated, flexible stabilization construct to the first anchor; extending the stabilization construct from the first anchor trans-axially and obliquely to the central axis to the fourth anchor; securing the stabilization construct to the fourth anchor; extending stabilization construct trans-axially from the fourth anchor to the third anchor; securing the stabilization construct to the third anchor; extending the stabilization construct from the third anchor trans-axially to and obliquely to the central axis to the second anchor; and fixing a second end of the stabilization construct to the second anchor, wherein the stabilization construct is slidable relative to the third and fourth anchors in response to axial rotation of the spinal column segment. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices, and any such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> Multi-directional stabilization systems are provided for attachment to a spinal column segment. The systems include one or more stabilization constructs positionable along at least one level of the spinal column and engageable thereto to provide multi-directional stabilization. The stabilization constructs include motion preserving capabilities to allow motion of the motion segment while limiting extension, flexion and/or axial rotation of the motion segment to provide effective dynamic stabilization. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The systems can be engaged posteriorly, anteriorly, antero-laterally, laterally, or in any other position to the spinal column segment. Combinations of approaches and stabilization are also contemplated such as, for example, anterior and posterior stabilization systems. The systems can be employed with fusion of one or more vertebral levels with bone graft alone or in combination with one or more fusion devices in a disc space between vertebrae. Furthermore, the systems can be employed with artificial discs or motion preserving devices in one or more vertebral levels. The fusion devices and artificial discs can be positioned through the same approach or through differing approaches than that taken for placement of the stabilization systems. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown one embodiment of an anchor <b>20</b> engageable to a vertebral body. Any of the stabilization systems discussed herein may include a number of anchors <b>20</b> engageable to vertebrae along the spinal column segment to couple construct <b>30</b> to one or more of the vertebra. Each of the anchors <b>20</b> can include a receiving portion <b>22</b> and an anchoring portion <b>24</b>. Anchoring portion <b>24</b> may include any suitable form for engaging one or more of the vertebrae. Examples of contemplated forms for anchoring portion <b>24</b> include bone screws either multi-axial or uni-axial in form, hooks, staples, and interbody devices, for example. The anchoring portions for any two or more of the anchors may be of the same form or of different forms. Receiving portion <b>22</b> may be in the form of a post, saddle, clamp, top-loading connector, side-loading connector, bottom-loading connector, or any other suitable device for engaging construct <b>30</b> with the respective anchor portion <b>24</b>. Receiving portions <b>22</b> may be of the same form for each of the anchors <b>20</b>, or of differing forms. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In the illustrated embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref>, spinal column segment <b>10</b> extends along a central axis <b>11</b>. Spinal column segment <b>10</b> includes an upper or superior vertebra <b>12</b> and a lower or inferior vertebra <b>14</b>. Vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> comprise a spinal motion segment with a disc space <b>16</b> therebetween. Applications are also contemplated in which there are three or more vertebrae in the spinal column segment. Anchor <b>20</b><i>a </i>is engaged to vertebra <b>12</b> along one side of central axis <b>11</b>, and anchor <b>20</b><i>b </i>is engaged to vertebra <b>12</b> on an opposite side of central axis <b>11</b>. Similarly, anchor <b>20</b><i>c </i>is engaged to vertebra <b>14</b> along one side of central axis <b>11</b>, and anchor <b>20</b><i>d </i>is engaged to vertebra <b>14</b> on an opposite side of central axis <b>11</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown one embodiment multi-directional stabilization system <b>30</b> secured to spinal column segment <b>10</b>. System <b>30</b> includes first and second trans-axial stabilization constructs <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Each trans-axial construct <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>extends trans-axially to axis <b>11</b> and is engaged to each of the vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> at opposite sides of the axis <b>11</b>. Other embodiments contemplate systems employing one construct or more than two constructs. Constructs <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>are collectively and individually referred to as construct <b>32</b> herein. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Each construct <b>32</b> is adapted to extend along at least one vertebral level and between anchors in a trans-axial and oblique orientation to central axis <b>11</b> of the spinal column. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, construct <b>32</b><i>a </i>extends between anchors <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>d</i>, and construct <b>32</b><i>b </i>extends between anchors <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Each construct <b>32</b> includes an elongated body <b>34</b> that is looped around the receiving portion <b>22</b> of the respective anchors <b>20</b>. Body <b>34</b> may be of any suitable form, such as a tether, suture, wire, tether, band, cord, cable, or rope, for example. Body <b>34</b> may also be made from any material compatible with the human body, including ceramics, plastics, metals, elastomers, shape memory material, or carbon fiber composites. The opposite ends of body <b>34</b> may overlap one another and be secured to one another to form a loop configuration with a crimp, swage, suture, fastener, adhesive, or other suitable means. In another embodiment, body <b>34</b> is provided in the form of a continuous loop without overlapping ends. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> When looped around anchors <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, constructs <b>32</b> constrain movement of at least the adjacent sides of vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> away from one another by tensioning. Movement of the vertebrae relative to one another by axial rotation is also constrained by the respective construct <b>32</b> extending in the direction from the lower vertebra <b>14</b> to the upper vertebra <b>12</b> that corresponds to the direction of rotation. For example, axial rotation in the direction of arrows <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is resisted by tensioning of construct <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown another embodiment multi-directional stabilization system <b>130</b> secured to spinal column segment <b>10</b> with anchors <b>20</b>. System <b>130</b> includes a trans-axial stabilization construct <b>132</b> having a body <b>134</b> with first and second trans-axial portions <b>134</b><i>a</i>, <b>134</b><i>b </i>and a connecting portion <b>136</b>. Each trans-axial portion <b>134</b><i>a</i>, <b>134</b><i>b </i>extends trans-axially to and is obliquely oriented with central axis <b>11</b>, and is engaged to each of the vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> at opposite sides of the axis <b>11</b>. Connecting portion <b>136</b> extends between anchors <b>20</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>along vertebra <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Construct <b>132</b> is adapted to extend along at least one vertebral level and between anchors in a trans-axial orientation to central axis <b>11</b> of the spinal column. Construct <b>132</b> includes an elongated body <b>134</b> that is fixedly secured at a first end <b>138</b> to anchor <b>20</b><i>a </i>and at a second end <b>140</b> to anchor <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Body <b>134</b> extends trans-axially between vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> obliquely to axis <b>11</b> from anchor <b>20</b><i>a </i>to anchor <b>20</b><i>d</i>. Body <b>134</b> is looped around at least a portion of anchor <b>20</b><i>d </i>and extends trans-axially and orthogonally to axis <b>11</b> to anchor <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Body <b>134</b> is further looped around anchor <b>20</b><i>c </i>and extends trans-axially between vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> from anchor <b>20</b><i>c </i>to anchor <b>20</b><i>b </i>obliquely to axis <b>11</b>. A second end <b>140</b> of body <b>134</b> is fixedly secured to anchor <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Body <b>134</b> may be of any suitable form, such as a tether, suture, wire, tether, band, cord, cable, or rope, for example. Ends <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> may be fixedly secured to anchors <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>by any suitable connection. Ends <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> may be wrapped or looped around the receiving portion <b>22</b> of anchor <b>20</b>. Ends <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> can also be secured in a passage of receiving portion <b>22</b> or about a post of receiving portion <b>22</b> with a set screw, crimp, spike or other suitable fastening device. Body <b>134</b> can be secured to anchors <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>by positioning body <b>34</b> in a groove, recess, receptacle, passage or other structure of receiving portion <b>22</b> to allow body <b>34</b> to slidably move relative thereto while being retained on receiving portion <b>22</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> Construct <b>132</b> is flexible yet tensions to limit or constrain movement of vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> away from one another at the respective adjacent side of the vertebrae <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Movement of the vertebrae relative to one another by axial rotation, as indicated by arrows <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, is also resisted by tensioning of construct <b>132</b>. Body <b>134</b> can slide around anchors <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>as indicated by arrows <b>142</b> so that the tension of construct <b>132</b> is maintained during axial rotation. The dynamic connection of body <b>134</b> with anchors <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>allows the length of trans-axial portion <b>134</b><i>a </i>between anchors <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>to increase and the length of trans-axial portion <b>134</b><i>b </i>between anchors <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>to decrease. Axial rotation in the opposite direction would in turn result in sliding movement of body <b>134</b> about anchors <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>in a direction opposite arrows <b>142</b>, allowing the length of trans-axial portion <b>134</b><i>a </i>between anchors <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>to decrease and the length of trans-axial portion <b>134</b><i>b </i>between anchors <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>to increase. The ability to slide to vary the length between anchors maintains construct <b>132</b> in tension between anchors <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a compression member <b>60</b>.
