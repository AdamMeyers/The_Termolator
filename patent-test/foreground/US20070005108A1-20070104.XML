<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The tissue holding device of the present invention is composed of at least two, substantially hollow, adjustable suction clamps, configured for one-sided clamping, that detachably adhere to the surface of the tissue by way of at least one suction opening in each suction clamp. The suction clamps are mechanically associated by a displacement mechanism. When the suction clamps are drawn toward each other the underlying adherent tissue margins are drawn toward each other. The tissue holding device holds the tissues during a bonding procedure, or the application of tissue bonding material or any other suitable substance to the adjacent tissue margins. When the application process is finished, the suction clamps may be easily removed by releasing the suction force (i.e. negative pressure). The tissue holding device may be used to bring two tissue surfaces together, such as during surgery and for the purpose of wound repair. The suction clamps and the displacement mechanism create a support structure to which additional devices such as, but not limited to, a medical adhesive applicator, a laser, laser optic fibers, and bandage application devices can also be mounted. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to holding body tissue and in particular, to a medical device for temporarily holding body tissue sections in alignment during a bonding procedure in which the tissue sections are bonded together. </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The proper alignment of body tissue edges for application of tissue bonding devices or glues is crucial for proper wound healing. Inappropriate tissue alignment may interfere with the normal wound healing process. A device that is capable of achieving and maintaining such proper alignment also frees the surgeon from the need to keep tissue edges in proximity and alignment, thus allowing the surgeon to use both hands freely for other tasks. It also reduces the possibility of adherence of the surgeon's hands or gloves to the underlying tissue bonding material. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A number of devices intended to hold body tissue or organs during medical procedures have been suggested. Some of these are specific to the intention of tissue alignment during connection or bonding procedure such as, for example, gluing, suturing, stapling, clipping, laser welding and laser soldering. Most notable of these devices in relation to the present invention is the device of U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,794 to Sauer et al. Sauer et al. clearly describes an apparatus specific for use with a laser welding device and a clamp mechanism for holding tubular tissues in alignment during the laser welding procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> One drawback to the clamp mechanism of Sauer et al., and other such clamps of prior art, is that each arm (jaw) grasps the tissue section from two opposing sides, such as the top and the bottom. In many cases, such as, for example, closing wounds or other procedures where only one surface of each of the tissue sections is exposed or available, the clamp mechanism of Sauer et al. is inoperable. To illustrate this, Sauer et al. suggests that in order to facilitate securement and approximation of tubular tissue sections, an absorbable stent can optionally be utilized. The proximal end of the stent may be inserted into a proximal tubular section prior to clamping. After clamping of the proximal tubular section, the distal tubular section is then pulled over the distal end of the stent. Therefore the sent provides yet another surface between which tissues may be grasped. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another issue not addressed by the prior art is that of sterilization of the device. Since this issue is not addressed in the documents of prior art, it is reasonable for one of ordinary skill in the art to assume that the entire device is to be sterilized or the device must be disassembled and the pertinent parts are sterilized: The downtime of the device while being sterilized presents a further drawback. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> There is therefore a need for a medical device for temporarily holding body tissue sections in alignment during a bonding procedure in which the sections are bonded together, the device grasping each of the tissue sections on only one surface. It would be beneficial if the device were configured with easily detachable grasping elements. It would be of further benefit if the device were partially or entirely configured so as to be disposable. </p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> By way of introduction, a tissue holding device of the present invention helps the surgeon achieve and maintain proper tissue edge alignment and proximity for as long as needed during a tissue bonding procedure. An automatic tissue bonding apparatus, such as, but not limited to, a laser, laser optic fibers, or medical adhesive applicator can also be mounted on the suggested frame of substantially any embodiment of the present invention for automatic tissue bonding. Any of several bandage application devices, as are known in the art, may also be connected to the frame of the present invention so as to facilitate bandage application after the bonding procedure is finished and before the tissue holding device is removed. Such bandage application while the tissue sections are supported by the tissue holding device helps support the bonded tissue edges in a manner similar to the support given by the device even after the tissue is no longer supported by the tissue holding device. Further, additional suction clamps may be attached so as to hold, by non-limiting example, an additional piece of grafting material, as in a grafting procedure. The grafting material may be one of several different materials, such as, but not limited to, natural tissue, tissue cultures and biological or synthetic grafting material. The schematic illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a non-limiting suggestion for the attachment of an additional suction clamp <b>80</b> for holding an additional piece of grafting material, which is deployed above the working area between the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, to the tissue holding device <b>30</b>. As illustrated here, the attachment bracket <b>70</b> is, by non-limiting example, a flexible metal tube, such as is commonly used on microphone stands, that has plastic properties and may therefore be bent so as to position the additional suction clamp <b>80</b> substantially wherever necessary. Other such additional devices may include, but not be limited to, an automatic tissue bonding apparatus and a bandage application device, as mentioned above. When the additional device requires a fixed position, bracket <b>70</b> may be configured so as to be substantially ridged and fixedly attached to attachment flange <b>72</b>. As discussed above, when the additional device requires repositioning during use, bracket <b>70</b> may be flexible, or alternatively, movably attached, such as, but not limited to hinged, rotatable, and slideable, to attachment flange <b>72</b>. It should be noted that when the additional device is a suction device, such as, but not limited to, the additional suction clamp described above, a vacuum regulator and an emergency pressure release mechanism, as are discussed below, may also be associated with the vacuum elements of the additional device. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> It should be noted that the tissue holding device of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with, but not be limited to, gluing, suturing, stapling, clipping, laser welding and laser soldering. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> In general, as illustrated in a first preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tissue holding device <b>2</b> of the present invention is composed of at least two, substantially hollow, adjustable suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> having a substantially flat profile. The suction clamps are configured for one-sided clamping of the tissue. That is, each suction clamp element is operative to grip the adjacent tissue without requiring an opposing element against which to apply clamping pressure. The suction clamps detachably adhere to the surface of substantially flat tissue by way of at least one suction opening <b>8</b> in each suction clamp. Suction is created by generating negative pressure, i.e. pressure below atmospheric, within the suction clamps. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, negative pressure in the range of 100-800 millibars below atmospheric pressure is used. This range, however, is not intended as a limitation, and substantially any amount of negative pressure required may be generated with in the suction clamps. When the suction openings are placed against the surface of the tissue the suction creates one-sided clamping of the tissue. That is, a suction bond is created between the suction clamp and one-side of the tissue. Therefore, the phrase &#x201c;substantially flat tissue&#x201d; is used herein to refer tissue having a surface suited for clamping with a suction clamp having a flat profile and on which a suction bond may be created. That is, the tissue is flat or has a radius of curvature not more than a few centimeters so that the region clamped by the suction clamps typically does not turn through more than about 30 degrees. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the suction clamps includes a tube attachment extension <b>10</b> whereby a tube may be used to establish fluid communication between each suction clamp and a vacuum generation source. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> The suction clamps are mechanically associated by a displacement mechanism. In one preferred implementation as shown here, the displacement mechanism includes at least one elongated rod <b>12</b>, which may be of substantially any cross-sectional contour. The suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> and elongated rod <b>12</b>, or rods depending on the particular application, create a framework around the tissue edges. When the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are drawn toward each other by sliding one or both of them along the elongated rods <b>12</b>, the underlying adherent tissue margins are drawn toward each other. The suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, may be locked in place on the elongated rods <b>12</b>, by, for example, set screws <b>14</b>. Once the tissue margins are aligned, positioning of the tissue edges may be finalized using forceps. The tissue holding device <b>2</b> holds the tissues during the application of tissue bonding material or any other suitable substance to the adjacent tissue margins. When the application process is finished, the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> may be easily removed by releasing the suction, i.e. negative pressure. The tissue holding device <b>2</b> may be used externally to bring two skin surfaces together, such as, but not limited to, following surgery, and wound repair. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> It should be noted that alternatively, the tissue holding device of the present invention may also be configured so as to be useable internally, such as, but not limited to, procedures on an internal organ. The tissue holding device may also be inserted into a natural or temporarily-generated body cavity via any opening for minimally invasive surgery (endoscopy) purposes. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a second preferred embodiment of the tissue holding device <b>20</b> of the present invention. The hollow portion <b>22</b> of the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> is visible in the cut-way portion of suction clamp <b>4</b>. In this embodiment, the elongated rods <b>12</b> include fixedly attached height adjustment brackets <b>24</b> that are configured to allow the height of suction clamp <b>6</b> relative to suction clamp <b>4</b> to be adjusted. As illustrated here, rods <b>12</b><i>a </i>are slideably engaged in the height adjustment bracket and the relative height of suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> adjusted. Once the desired height differential is achieved, the engaged ends of rods <b>12</b><i>a </i>are locked in the height adjustment brackets <b>24</b>. The elongated rods <b>12</b> are attached to the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> by articulation extensions that attach to the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> in, for example, a ball and socket configuration that allows the angle of alignment of the suction clamps in relation to each other to be varied. That is, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the contact surface <b>16</b> of the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are coplanar. The articulation extensions <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> allow the contact surface <b>16</b> of the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> to be aligned so as to be either coplanar or non-coplanar. Here too, set screws <b>14</b> may be used to lock the position of the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> In some applications it may be desirable to provide flexible elongated rods <b>12</b> in order to facilitate bringing the contact surfaces <b>16</b> of the suction clamps <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> into contact with the surfaces of the tissues to which they are to adhere. In such applications, the elongated rods <b>12</b> may be configured from flexible materials having plastic or inelastic properties allowing them to be bent to shape. Alternatively, the elongated rods <b>12</b> may be configured from materials with elastic properties so as to be bendable in order to achieve adhesion to the tissue and then return to the original shape. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> illustrate a third preferred embodiment of the present invention, generally referred to as <b>30</b>, in which the displacement mechanism includes a pair of elongated arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> interconnected at a hinge <b>40</b>. As shown in the illustration here, the elongated arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> extend beyond the hinge <b>40</b> into handles <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>respectively, thereby forming a scissor mechanism such that suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are positioned by rotation of the elongated arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> about the hinge <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> In this embodiment, the displacement mechanism also includes a pair of alignment elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, which are configured to maintain the angular alignment of the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. As seen in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, alignment element <b>42</b> includes two parallel linear bars <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> that are rotatably attached to the cross bar <b>70</b> by hinge pins <b>94</b> and <b>98</b>, respectively, and to the top of attachment flange <b>72</b><i>a </i>by hinge pins <b>96</b> and <b>100</b> respectively. Linear bar <b>90</b> is also rotatably attached to elongated arm <b>36</b> by hinge pin <b>120</b>. Thusly configured, the alignment of the cross bar <b>70</b> and the attachment flange <b>72</b> is maintained as the position of the attachment flange <b>72</b><i>a </i>is changed. Similarly, alignment element <b>44</b> includes two parallel linear bars <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> that are rotatably attached to the cross bar <b>70</b> by hinge pins <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>, respectively, and to the top of attachment flange <b>72</b><i>b </i>by hinge pins <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>, respectively. Linear bar <b>90</b> is also rotatably attached to elongated arm <b>38</b> by hinge pin <b>122</b>. It will be readily appreciated that as elongated arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are rotated about hinge pin <b>40</b> in a scissor type motion the position of each of the alignment elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> will correspondingly change as they rotate about their respective hinge pins, but the angle of alignment between the cross bar <b>70</b> and each of the attachment flanges <b>72</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>b </i>will remain substantially constant. Preferably, the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are aligned so as to be parallel; however, substantially any angle of alignment is within the scope of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"> A further optional structural feature illustrated here is the joining of vacuum tubes <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> at tube coupling element <b>50</b>, thereby reducing the number of tubes required to connect the tissue holding device to the vacuum source necessary to operate the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"> The proper position of the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in this embodiment is locked by the locking arm <b>60</b>. As illustrated here, the locking arm <b>60</b> is mounted on alignment element <b>42</b> and has a serrated edge <b>62</b> configured to engage the serration of the locking block <b>64</b> mounted on alignment element <b>44</b>. The locking arm <b>60</b> is preferably configured from material with spring properties so as to be biased toward the locking block <b>62</b>. Alternatively, the locking arm <b>60</b> may be mechanically biased toward the locking block <b>64</b> by, for example, a spring. It should be noted that the locking arm <b>60</b> and locking block <b>64</b> may alternatively be appropriately mounted on the elongated arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> of the scissor mechanism, or substantially any appropriate points on the displacement mechanism. Further, substantially any locking mechanism may be used to lock the position of the suction clamps once they are positioned. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"> As seen in better detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the axle <b>40</b><i>a </i>of hinge <b>40</b> extends downward and attaches to the cross bar <b>70</b> of the displacement mechanism, thereby facilitating substantially equal displacement of the suction clamps as the scissor mechanism is operated. The suction openings <b>78</b> are also clearly visible from this angle. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"> The detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the attachment flanges <b>72</b> used to attach the suction clamps to the displacement mechanism. The attachment flanges <b>72</b> may be configured in any one or combination of several configurations, including, but not limited to: 
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0082"> 1. The attachment flanges <b>72</b> being solidly affixed such that the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are permanently attached to the displacement mechanism and are non-rotatable. </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0083"> 2. The attachment flanges <b>72</b> being releasably affixed such that the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are releasably attached to the displacement mechanism. Affixation of this sort may be by use of screws or nuts and bolts, for non-limiting example. </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0084"> 3. The attachment flanges <b>72</b> being releasably affixed such that the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are rotatable. </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0085"> 4. The attachment flanges <b>72</b> being releasably affixed so as to act as &#x201c;quick release&#x201d; elements such that the suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are quickly and easily removable from the displacement mechanism. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086"> Although not illustrated herein, either one or both alignment elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> may be configured so as to allow for the adjustment of the relative height of suction clamps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to one another, as was discuss above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This may be accomplished by, but not be limited to, articulation of the alignment elements, sliding brackets attached to the attachment flanges <b>72</b>, and substantially any other height adjustment mechanism know that is adaptable to the elements of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087"> It should be noted that for applications requiring the use of long suction clamps such that the angle of alignment of the suction clamps may not be maintained by the displacement mechanism that is attached to the proximal end of the suction clamps, a supplementary mechanical link may be attached at the distal end of the suction clamps, such as the non-limiting example of <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The supplementary mechanical link illustrated here includes a link bar <b>82</b> that is fixedly attached at one end to a raised portion of the distal end of suction clamp <b>90</b>. The link bar <b>82</b> is slidingly interconnected to a raised portion <b>86</b> of suction clamp <b>92</b>. The raised portion <b>86</b> includes a locking screw <b>84</b> configured to lock the position of the link bar <b>82</b>. Therefore, during positing of the suction clamps <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, the link bar <b>82</b> slides within raised portion <b>86</b>, and once the suction clamps <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are positioned, the locking screw <b>84</b> is tightened so as to lock the position of the link bar <b>82</b>, thereby maintaining the distance between, and thus the alignment of, the suction clamps <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>. The raised portions <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> may be integrally formed on the respective suction clamps or they may be separate elements that are attached to the suction clamps. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088"> With regard to substantially all of the embodiments possible according to the teaching of the present invention, it should be noted that at least a portion of the section clamps may be configured so as to be disposable. The disposable portion may be attached so as to be quickly and easily detachable, such as by a quick release mechanism. Alternatively, each of the suction clamps may be covered by disposable perforated sleeves; this is particularly applicable to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It will be appreciated, then, that any appropriate part or the entire device may be disposable. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a vacuum regulator <b>74</b> may be associated with the tissue holding device so as to regulate the suction force, i.e. negative pressure, within the suction clamps. An emergency pressure release mechanism <b>72</b> may also be associated with any of the vacuum elements of the tissue holding device; here it is incorporated into the tube coupling element <b>50</b>. The emergency pressure release may be actuated either automatically or manually, or a combination of the two. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090"> With regard to the suction clamps, they may be of substantially any length and any cross-sectional contour. They may be manufactured in different fixed lengths. Alternatively, the suction clamps may be manufactured so as to be &#x201c;cut to length&#x201d; by the end user. This may be accomplished by, but not limited to, supplying extended lengths of suction clamp having a tube attachment extension on one end, such that the suction clamp is cut to a desired length, and a plug, for example, is inserted into the open (cut off) end. The suction openings may be configured as, but not limited to, holes in the contact surface of the suction clamps, or as suction pads or cups extending from the contact surface. The suction openings may be of substantially any size or shape. Further, the size and shape of the suction openings on the contact surface may be uniform or of mixed sizes, shapes or both. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref> illustrate two alternative, non-limiting, examples of suction clamp embodiments of the present invention configured for use With tubular tissue, such as, but not limited to, blood vessels. Either of these embodiments may be associated with any of the above described displacement mechanisms to provide the movement necessary to bring tissue edges together for a bonding procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092"> A first preferred embodiment of a suction clamp <b>200</b>, for use with tubular tissues, is configured as a single at least partially-circular clamp element <b>202</b> having a contact surface <b>204</b> on its inner surface. That is to say, the contour of the contact surface <b>204</b> is shaped so as to include at least part of the circumference of a cylinder. The total proportion of the circumference of the cylinder circumscribed by the suction clamp, either as a single clamp element (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), or by the two or more clamp elements considered together (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), may range from as little as 30 degrees up to 360 degrees. Most preferably, the circumference of the cylinder circumscribed by a single clamp element is in the range of 180 degrees to 240 degrees. For two or more clamps considered together the preferred total range is between 150 degrees and 200 degrees. The contact surface <b>204</b> is configured with suction openings <b>206</b> as described above. Thus, when deployed so as to partially circumscribe the tubular tissue and suction is generated within the clamp element, a suction bond is created between the contact surface and the surface of the tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a pair of such suction clamp elements <b>200</b><i>a </i>and <b>200</b><i>b </i>is used to bring the edges of tissues <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> together in region <b>214</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094"> Alternatively, the single clamp element <b>200</b> may be configured as two substantially opposing clamp elements <b>250</b> and <b>252</b> that may be alternated between an open deployment, as illustrated by the second preferred embodiment of a suction clamp for use with tubular tissues in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and a closed deployment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As shown here, clamp elements <b>250</b> and <b>25</b> are deployed at distal ends of rods <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, respectively. Contact surfaces <b>258</b> and <b>260</b> are each configured with suction openings (not shown). Therefore, when clamp elements <b>250</b> and <b>252</b> are brought to a closed deployment with a tubular tissue <b>270</b> therebetween, and suction is generated within the each of the clamp elements <b>250</b> and <b>252</b>, a suction bond is created between the contact surfaces <b>258</b> and <b>260</b>, and the surface of the tissue. In order to perform the procedure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> with this embodiment of the present invention, it would be necessary to use two sets of opposing clamp elements, each set clamping a different tissue section. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095"> The benefit of using the section clamps configured for use with tubular tissue during internal medical procedures will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. An appropriate displacement mechanism for such internal deployment will also be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, and may be configured from, by non-limiting example, a single interconnecting rod upon which at least one of the suction clamps may be displaced. It will also be understood that the elements of the device may be inserted into a body cavity through a single opening or multiple openings. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096"> It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as examples, and that many other embodiments are possible within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. </p>
