<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates to medical devices. Particularly, the present invention relates to an emboli capturing device with a netted outer surface for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Embolic protection to capture emboli within the vasculature is a growing concern in the medical industry. Currently, there are a number of approaches for embolic protection to prevent emboli from traveling within the vasculature to create an undesirable embolism, e.g., pulmonary embolism. For example, vena cava filters are more commonly being used for trapping emboli in the vena cava filter to prevent pulmonary embolism. Also, anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants may be used to breakdown blood clots. Moreover, snares and baskets (e.g., stone retrieval baskets) are more commonly used for retrieving urinary calculi. Additionally, occlusion coils are commonly used to occlude aneurysms and accumulate thrombi in a body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Treatments for a stenotic lesion provide a potential in releasing blood clots and other thrombi plaque in the vasculature of the patient. One example is the treatment for a carotid artery stenosis. Generally, carotid artery stenosis is the narrowing of the carotid arteries, the main arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain. Carotid artery stenosis (also called carotid artery disease) is a relatively high risk factor for ischemic stroke. The narrowing is usually caused by plaque build-up in the carotid artery. Plaque forms when cholesterol, fat and other substances form in the inner lining of an artery. This formation process is called atherosclerosis. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Depending on the degree of stenosis and the patient's overall condition, carotid artery stenosis has been treated with surgery. The procedure (with its inherent risks) is called carotid endarectomy, which removes the plaque from the arterial walls. Carotid endarectomy has proven to benefit patients with arteries substantially narrowed, e.g., by about 70% or more. For people with less narrowed arteries, e.g., less than about 50%, an anti-clotting drug may be prescribed to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Examples of these drugs are anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Carotid angioplasty is a more recently developed treatment for carotid artery stenosis. This treatment uses balloons and/or stents to open a narrowed artery. Carotid angioplasty is a procedure that can be performed via a standard percutaneous transfemoral approach with the patient anesthetized using light intravenous sedation. At the stenosis area, an angioplasty balloon is delivered to pre-dilate the stenosis in preparation for stent placement. The balloon is then removed and exchanged via catheter for a stent delivery device. Once in position, a stent is deployed across the stenotic area. If needed, an additional balloon can be placed inside the deployed stent for post-dilation to make sure the struts of the stent are pressed firmly against the inner surface of the vessel wall. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> During the stenosis procedure however, there is a risk of such blood clots and thrombi being undesirably released into the blood flow within the vasculature. Embolic or distal protection devices have been implemented to capture emboli from a stenotic lesion undergoing angioplasty. However, many current emboli capture devices restrict flow when deployed within the vasculature of the patient. Moreover, many emboli capture devices are relatively difficult to collapse and retrieve after the need for such device in the vasculature passes. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Thus, there is a need to provide a device and method for distally capturing and trapping emboli within a body lumen during a stenosis procedure. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> In one embodiment, the present invention provides an embolic protection and emboli capture device with a netted wall for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. The device comprises an expandable stent having a partially-expanded state, a fully-expanded state and a closed state. The expandable stent is configured about a longitudinal axis to define an outer surface of the stent. The device further comprises a filter portion attached about the stent for capturing and trapping emboli. The filter portion is placed against the body vessel when the stent is in the partially-expanded and fully-expanded states for capturing emboli. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In another embodiment, the present invention provides an emboli capture assembly for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. In this embodiment, the assembly comprises a balloon catheter having a tubular body portion and an expandable balloon attached to and in fluid communication with the tubular body portion for angioplasty at the stenotic lesion. The expandable balloon has distal and proximal portions. The assembly further includes the emboli capture device. In this embodiment, the expandable stent of the device includes a filament having struts connected together by bends configured about the longitudinal axis to define an outer surface of the stent. The device is coaxially disposed through the balloon catheter during treatment of the stenotic lesion in the body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In another example, present invention provides a method for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. The method comprises percutaneously introducing the emboli capture assembly. The method further comprises deploying the device in its partially-expanded state downstream from the stenotic lesion to capture emboli during treatment of the stenotic lesion and engaging emboli during treatment of the stenotic lesion. The method further comprises deploying the device in the fully-expanded state to capture the emboli between the device and the body vessel. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> The present invention generally provides an emboli capture device for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. Embodiments of the present invention provide a device that captures undesirably released emboli and traps the emboli from traveling further downstream of the vasculature of a patient. The device further has a reduced cross-sectional profile for delivery of the device prior to pre-dilitation of the stenotic lesion, and a relatively simple manner of trapping the emboli therein. In one embodiment, the device includes an expandable stent having a closed state, a partially-expanded state, and a fully-expanded state. In the closed state, the device is allowed to have a reduced cross-sectional profile for delivery through a stenosed area. In the partially-expanded state, the device captures emboli from an upstream angioplasty treatment. In the fully-expanded state, emboli are trapped between the outer surface of the device and the body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an emboli capture device <b>10</b> for capturing and trapping emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel <b>11</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the emboli capture device <b>10</b> comprises an expandable stent <b>12</b> including a continuous filament <b>14</b> having a plurality of struts <b>16</b> connected together. The expandable stent <b>12</b> may be formed in any suitable configuration or manner to provide the continuous filament <b>14</b> or a plurality of filaments <b>14</b> having the plurality of struts <b>16</b> connected together. For example, the continuous filament <b>14</b> may be a single continuous filament <b>14</b> having struts <b>16</b> connected together by arcuate bends axially extending therealong. The expandable stent <b>12</b> that is configured to expand radially upon deployment. As shown, the filament <b>14</b> is axially configured about a longitudinal axis A to define an outer surface <b>20</b> of the stent <b>12</b>. Of course, the filament <b>14</b> may be configured in any other suitable manner, e.g., spirally. The outer surface <b>20</b> is preferably a cylindrical surface. Preferably, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is configured to self-expand to the fully-expanded state. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In this embodiment, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is formed to have a closed state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), a partially-expanded state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), and a fully-expanded state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). In the closed state, the device <b>10</b> is provided a reduced cross-sectional profile for delivery through a stenosed area. In the partially-expanded state, the device <b>10</b> is configured to capture or wedge emboli from an upstream angioplasty treatment. In the fully-expanded state, the device <b>10</b> is formed to trap emboli between the outer surface <b>20</b> of the device <b>10</b> and the body vessel while maintaining blood flow therethrough. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> In this embodiment, the expandable stent <b>12</b> has a proximal portion <b>22</b> including a proximal end <b>23</b> and a distal portion <b>24</b> including a distal end <b>25</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, in the fully-expanded state, each of the proximal end <b>23</b> and the distal end <b>25</b> is open to allow for blood to flow therethrough. Preferably, the proximal end <b>23</b> may comprise deployment members <b>26</b> that, when cooperating together, allow for controlled deployment of the device <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</figref>, and <b>6</b>, each of the deployment members <b>26</b> has a neck <b>27</b> and a ring <b>28</b> integral with the neck <b>27</b>. The members cooperate together with a delivery system for relatively precise and accurate deployment of the device <b>10</b> prior to treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the emboli capture device <b>10</b> in the partially-expanded state in which the device <b>10</b> is partially deployed from a tubular member, e.g., a catheter <b>29</b>. As shown, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is partially deployed from the catheter <b>29</b> for capturing or filtering emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. The device <b>10</b> may be associated with a delivery mechanism <b>30</b> that cooperates with the deployment members <b>26</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b>. For example, the delivery mechanism <b>30</b> may include a maneuverable grasping loop <b>42</b> for grasping the neck <b>27</b> of each of the deployment members <b>26</b> together. In the partially-expanded state, the deployment members <b>26</b> cooperate together to allow the proximal portion <b>22</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b> to remain grasped and undeployed for capturing emboli during angioplasty. In this example, the grasping loop <b>42</b> may then be manipulated to release the deployment members <b>26</b> in the fully-expanded state for trapping emboli that are captured. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> depict the device <b>10</b> in its fully-expanded state to which the stent <b>12</b> is configured to self-expand for trapping the emboli between the device <b>10</b> and the body vessel wall on which it engages. The device <b>10</b> preferably takes on a cylindrical shape in its fully-expanded state. As shown, each of the proximal end <b>23</b> and the distal end <b>25</b> is an open end. This is to allow blood to flow therethrough similar to a typical expandable angioplasty stent <b>12</b>. As mentioned, the device <b>10</b> is biased to self-expand to its fully-expanded state. The self-expanding configuration provides an outward radial force to engage the outer surface with the body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> illustrate the device <b>10</b> further comprising a filter portion <b>32</b> attached about the outer surface <b>20</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b> for trapping emboli. Preferably, the filter portion <b>32</b> has a proximal edge <b>34</b> and a distal edge <b>36</b>. The proximal edge <b>34</b> of the filter portion <b>32</b> is attached to the proximal portion <b>22</b>, preferably at the proximal end <b>23</b>, of the expandable stent <b>12</b> and extends distally therefrom. The distal edge <b>36</b> is attached to the distal portion <b>24</b>, preferably at the distal end <b>25</b>, of the expandable stent <b>12</b>. Thus, the filter portion <b>32</b> preferably attaches entirely about the outer surface <b>20</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the emboli capture device <b>10</b> in the closed state. As shown, the device <b>10</b> is loaded in a tubular member, e.g., a catheter <b>29</b>, providing a reduced cross-sectional profile for delivery through a stenosed area. As discussed above, the delivery mechanism having the grasping loop may be used to axially advance the device loaded within a catheter. However, it is understood that any other suitable delivery mechanism may be used without falling beyond the scope or spirit of the present invention. For example, a pusher or push wire may be used to distally advance the device within a catheter to a desired deployment location in the vasculature of a patient. As the device is deployed from the distal end of the catheter, the deployed portion of the device is axially biased outwardly to self-expand and engage the vessel wall in which the device is inserted (in the partially-expanded state), thereby capturing released emboli. Upon release of the grasping loop from the rings, the catheter may be retracted relative to the delivery mechanism <b>30</b> to fully deploy the device <b>10</b> against the vessel wall (in the fully-deployed state), thereby trapping emboli. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The expandable stent <b>12</b> may be comprised of any suitable material such as a superelastic material, stainless steel wire, cobalt-chromium-nickel-molybdenum-iron alloy, or cobalt-chrome alloy. It is understood that the expandable stent <b>12</b> may be formed of any other suitable material that will result in a self-opening or self-expanding expandable stent <b>12</b>, such as shape memory alloys. Shape memory alloys have the desirable property of becoming rigid, that is, returning to a remembered state, when heated above a transition temperature. A shape memory alloy suitable for the present invention is Ni&#x2014;Ti available under the more commonly known name Nitinol. When this material is heated above the transition temperature, the material undergoes a phase transformation from martensite to austenic, such that material returns to its remembered state. The transition temperature is dependent on the relative proportions of the alloying elements Ni and Ti and the optional inclusion of alloying additives. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> In one embodiment, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is made from Nitinol with a transition temperature that is slightly below normal body temperature of humans, which is about 98.6&#xb0; F. Thus, when the expandable stent <b>12</b> is deployed in a body vessel and exposed to normal body temperature, the alloy of the expandable stent <b>12</b> will transform to austenite, that is, the remembered state, which for one embodiment of the present invention is the expanded state when the expandable stent <b>12</b> is deployed in the body vessel. To remove the expandable stent <b>12</b>, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is cooled to transform the material to martensite which is more ductile than austenite, making the expandable stent <b>12</b> more malleable. As such, the expandable stent <b>12</b> can be more easily collapsed and pulled into a lumen of a catheter <b>29</b> for removal. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> In another embodiment, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is made from Nitinol with a transition temperature that is above normal body temperature of humans, which is about 98.6&#xb0; F. Thus, when the expandable stent <b>12</b> is deployed in a body vessel and exposed to normal body temperature, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is in the martensitic state so that the expandable stent <b>12</b> is sufficiently ductile to bend or form into a desired shape, which for the present invention is an expanded configuration. To remove the expandable stent <b>12</b>, the expandable stent <b>12</b> is heated to transform the alloy to austenite so that the expandable stent <b>12</b> becomes rigid and returns to a remembered state, which for the expandable stent <b>12</b> in the closed state. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> The filter portion <b>32</b> may be comprised of any suitable material to be used for capturing and trapping emboli from the stenotic lesion during treatment thereof. In one embodiment, the filter portion <b>32</b> is made of connective tissue material for capturing emboli. In this embodiment, the connective tissue comprises extracellular matrix (ECM). As known, ECM is a complex structural entity surrounding and supporting cells that are found within mammalian tissues. More specifically, ECM comprises structural proteins (e.g., collagen and elastin), specialized protein (e.g., fibrillin, fibronectin, and laminin), and proteoglycans, a protein core to which are attached are long chains of repeating disaccharide units termed of glycosaminoglycans. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Most preferably, the extracellular matrix is comprised of small intestinal submucosa (SIS). As known, SIS is a resorbable, acellular, naturally occurring tissue matrix composed of ECM proteins and various growth factors. SIS is derived from the porcine jejunum and functions as a remodeling bioscaffold for tissue repair. SIS has characteristics of an ideal tissue engineered biomaterial and can act as a bioscaffold for remodeling of many body tissues including skin, body wall, musculoskeletal structure, urinary bladder, and also supports new blood vessel growth. In many aspects, SIS is used to induce site-specific remodeling of both organs and tissues depending on the site of implantation. In theory, host cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into site-specific connective tissue structures, which have been shown to completely replace the SIS material in time. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> In other embodiments, the filter portion <b>32</b> may also be made of a mesh/net cloth, nylon, bio-polymeric material, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), e.g., Teflon&#x2122;, porous polyurethane biomaterial (e.g., Thoralon&#x2122;), or woven mixtures thereof without falling beyond the scope or spirit of the present invention. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Upon deployment from the catheter <b>29</b>, the distal portion <b>24</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b> self-expands radially, thereby pressing a part of the filter portion <b>32</b> against the wall to capture emboli undesirably released during angioplasty. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> in the partially-expanded state of the device <b>10</b>, the filter portion <b>32</b> partially engages the vessel wall and is placed between the expandable stent <b>12</b> and the body vessel. As a result, the distal portion <b>24</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b> is deployed and the proximal portion <b>22</b> is undeployed as the delivery mechanism <b>30</b> maintains engagement with the rings <b>28</b> and maneuverability of the device <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"> Upon release from the delivery mechanism <b>30</b> and deployment from the catheter <b>29</b>, the proximal portion <b>22</b> of the expandable stent <b>12</b> expands radially, thereby fully pressing the filter portion <b>32</b> against the vessel wall to trap the emboli that were captured. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> in the fully-expanded state, the outer surface <b>20</b> of the filter portion <b>32</b> is placed in substantially full engagement with the vessel wall and is held between the expandable stent <b>12</b> and the wall. As a result, the device <b>10</b> is fully deployed and the outer surface <b>20</b> fully presses the vessel wall. This covers the emboli that were captured during angioplasty and traps the emboli between the filter portion <b>32</b> and the vessel wall while allowing blood to flow therethrough. In time, the SIS material of the filter portion <b>32</b> will begin to differentiate into site-specific connective tissue structures as mentioned above. </p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>illustrate an emboli capture assembly <b>40</b> for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the assembly <b>40</b> comprises a delivery mechanism <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the delivery mechanism <b>30</b> is an elongated member having a grasping loop <b>42</b> extending through the end of the mechanism and maneuverable relative thereto. As mentioned above, in cooperation with the deployment member of the stent <b>12</b>, the grasping loop <b>42</b> may be manipulated to advance and maintain the device <b>10</b> in its partially-expanded state. The grasping loop <b>42</b> may then be moved, e.g., loosened, to release the deployment member thereby allowing the stent <b>12</b> to fully expand. </p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>further depict the assembly <b>40</b> comprising a balloon catheter <b>44</b> having a tubular body <b>46</b> and an expandable balloon <b>50</b> attached to and in fluid communication with the tubular body <b>46</b> for angioplasty at a stenotic lesion. In this embodiment, the assembly <b>40</b> comprises the emboli capture device <b>10</b> mentioned above. The tubular body <b>46</b> is preferably made of soft flexible material such as silicon or any other suitable material. In this embodiment, the balloon catheter <b>44</b> includes an outer lumen and an inner lumen. The outer lumen is in fluid communication with the balloon for inflating and deflating the balloon. The inner lumen is formed therethrough for percutaneous guidance through the body vessel. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As shown, the assembly <b>40</b> further includes an outer catheter <b>52</b> having a distal end <b>54</b> through which the balloon catheter <b>44</b> is disposed for deployment in the body vessel. The outer catheter <b>52</b> is preferably made of a soft, flexible material such as silicon or any other suitable material. Generally, the outer catheter <b>52</b> further has a proximal end <b>56</b> and a plastic adaptor or hub to receive the emboli capture device <b>10</b> and balloon catheter <b>44</b> to be advanced therethrough. The size of the outer catheter <b>52</b> is based on the size of the body vessel in which it percutaneously inserts, and the size of the balloon catheter <b>44</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> As shown, the assembly <b>40</b> may also include a wire guide <b>60</b> configured to be percutaneously inserted within the vasculature to guide the outer catheter <b>52</b> to a location adjacent a stenotic lesion. The wire guide <b>60</b> provides the outer catheter <b>52</b> (and balloon catheter <b>44</b>) a path during insertion within the body vessel. The size of the wire guide <b>60</b> is based on the inside diameter of the outer catheter <b>52</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> In one embodiment, the balloon catheter <b>44</b> has a proximal fluid hub <b>48</b> in fluid communication with the balloon via the outer lumen for fluid to be passed therethrough for inflation and deflation of the balloon during treatment of the stenotic lesion. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> As shown, the emboli capture device <b>10</b> is coaxially disposed through the inner lumen of the balloon catheter <b>44</b> prior to treatment of the stenotic lesion in the body vessel. The distal protection device <b>10</b> is guided through the inner lumen preferably from the hub and distally beyond the balloon of the balloon catheter <b>44</b>, exiting from the distal end <b>25</b> of the inner or balloon catheter <b>44</b> to a location within the vasculature downstream of the stenotic lesion. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> In this embodiment, the apparatus further includes a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) introducer sheath <b>62</b> for percutaneously introducing the wire guide <b>60</b> and the outer catheter <b>52</b> in a body vessel. Of course, any other suitable material may be used without falling beyond the scope or spirit of the present invention. The introducer sheath <b>62</b> may have any suitable size, e.g., between about three-french to eight-french. The introducer serves to allow the inner and balloon catheters <b>44</b> to be percutaneously inserted to a desired location in the body vessel. The introducer sheath <b>62</b> receives the outer catheter <b>52</b> and provides stability to the outer catheter <b>52</b> at a desired location of the body vessel. For example, the introducer sheath <b>62</b> is held stationary within a common visceral artery, and adds stability to the outer catheter <b>52</b>, as the outer catheter <b>52</b> is advanced through the introducer sheath <b>62</b> to a dilatation area in the vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> When the distal end <b>54</b> of the outer catheter <b>52</b> is at a location downstream of the dilatation area in the body vessel, the balloon catheter <b>44</b> is inserted therethrough to the dilatation area. The device <b>10</b> is then loaded at the proximal end <b>53</b> of the balloon catheter <b>44</b> and is advanced through the inner lumen thereof for deployment through its distal end <b>55</b>. In this embodiment, the proximal stem is used to mechanically advance or push the device <b>10</b> through the catheter <b>29</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a flow chart of one method <b>110</b> for capturing and trapping emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel. In this example, the assembly and device discussed above may be used. The wire guide is percutaneously inserted in the vasculature of the patient at a deployment location adjacent a stenotic lesion to provide a path that subsequently guides the outer catheter and balloon catheter to the deployment location. The device is attached to the delivery mechanism (discussed above) and loaded in box <b>112</b> in the inner lumen of the balloon catheter which, in turn, is disposed through the outer catheter for insertion into the vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> The method <b>110</b> further comprises percutaneously introducing in box <b>114</b> the outer catheter and balloon catheter in the vasculature. The outer catheter is advanced through the vasculature and is crossed over the stenotic lesion. The method <b>110</b> further includes deploying the device in box <b>116</b> in its partially-expanded state downstream from the stenotic lesion to capture emboli during treatment of the stenotic lesion. This may be accomplished by partially deploying the device through the distal ends of the balloon catheter and the outer catheter while the delivery mechanism maintains engagement with the device to place the device in its partially-expanded state. In its partially-expanded state (discussed above), the device has a receiving area defined by the space between the outer surface thereof and the vessel wall, placing the device in a position to capture emboli. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The treatment of the stenotic lesion, e.g., angioplasty, is then performed on the patient. As mentioned, the device captures emboli released upstream during angioplasty. When treatment is completed and the stenosis condition has passed, the device is ready to be placed in its fully-expanded state. The method further includes deploying the device in its fully-expanded state to trap emboli captured during treatment of the stenotic lesion. This may be accomplished by fully deploying the device from the balloon catheter and the outer catheter, and then disengaging the delivery mechanism from the deployment member of the stent. In one example, the grasping loop may be loosened to disengage the delivery mechanism from the device, thereby placing the device in its fully-expanded state. In its fully-expanded state, the device self-expands radially and the outer surface of the device covers the captured emboli, trapping the emboli between the outer surface and the vessel wall. </p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an emboli capture assembly <b>210</b> for capturing emboli during treatment of a stenotic lesion in a body vessel in accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the assembly <b>210</b> comprises a catheter <b>212</b>, e.g., micro-catheter, through which a wire guide <b>213</b> is disposed for deployment of an emboli capture device <b>214</b>. As shown, the wire guide <b>213</b> has a lumen <b>216</b> (shown in phantom) formed therethrough. In this embodiment, the wire guide <b>213</b> has a distal portion <b>220</b> that extends to a cap end <b>221</b>. Preferably, the wire guide <b>213</b> is cannular-shaped to allow a pusher <b>224</b> to be disposed through the lumen <b>216</b> of the wire guide <b>213</b>. Preferably, the pusher <b>224</b> has a distal end <b>230</b> comprising a coupler <b>232</b>. In this embodiment, the coupler <b>232</b> includes radial pegs <b>234</b> formed about the coupler <b>232</b> about which the device <b>214</b> attaches for delivery as described in greater detail below. </p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"> It is understood that the device <b>214</b> has components similar to the components of the device <b>10</b> mentioned above. For example, the device <b>214</b> comprises an expandable stent <b>250</b>, a filament <b>252</b>, struts <b>254</b>, and a filter portion <b>256</b> similar to the expandable stent <b>12</b>, the filament <b>14</b>, struts <b>16</b>, and the filter portion <b>32</b> of the device <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the device <b>214</b> has a proximal portion <b>240</b> including struts <b>254</b> having holes <b>241</b> formed therethrough. Each of the proximal holes <b>241</b> mates with one of the radial pegs <b>234</b> formed about the coupler <b>232</b>. Thus, in the closed state, the device <b>214</b> mates with the coupler <b>232</b> and is held about the pusher <b>224</b> within the cap end <b>221</b> of the wire guide <b>213</b>. The pusher <b>224</b> is configured to be pulled back inside the wire guide <b>213</b>. In turn, the wire guide <b>213</b> configured to be pulled back inside the catheter <b>212</b> for delivery of the device <b>214</b>. </p>
