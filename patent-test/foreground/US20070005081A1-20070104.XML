<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A tissue fastening device includes a suture clip holder and a suture cutter. A suture clip can be releasably secured to the suture clip holder, and a suture line or lines can pass through the clip and adjacent the suture cutter. A first movement of a control handle causes the suture clip to be released from the suture clip holder, and a second movement of the control handle causes the suture cutter to cut the suture line or lines. The first movement is different from the second movement. The first movement can be rotational, with the second movement being longitudinal. Alternatively, the first movement can be longitudinal, with the second movement being rotational. The device may include a main body, an inner body, and an outer body. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention relates to medical devices and methods. In particular, the present invention relates to a system, apparatus, and method for fastening tissue, and particularly for fastening tissue using a suture and clip. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> Many medical procedures involve joining tissue pieces. Suturing adjacent tissue pieces is commonly performed using suture, particularly where the tissue pieces are easily accessible to the surgeon. In conventional surgical techniques, the surgeon will secure the tissue pieces by forcing a needle and suture material through various portions of the tissue, and then tying a knot in the suture material to secure the tissue pieces. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Minimally invasive surgical techniques have emerged as an alternative to conventional surgical techniques to perform a plurality of surgical procedures. Minimally invasive procedures differ from conventional surgical procedures in that a plurality of devices may be introduced into the body through a small incision. As a result, trauma to the body is greatly reduced, thereby decreasing the recovery time of the patient. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Percutaneous and other minimally-invasive methods of surgery, where the surgery may be performed remotely via catheters, often include the need to fasten tissue pieces which the surgeon cannot directly access. For example, in percutaneous operations to close a patent foramen ovale (PFO), adjacent tissue pieces on either side of the PFO must be secured together via a catheter. Further description of such PFO procedures is included in co-pending patent application Ser. No. ______, filed concurrently herewith and entitled &#x201c;System, Apparatus, and Method for Repairing Septal Defects,&#x201d; the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> One challenge presented when performing a heretofore conventional surgical procedure using a minimally invasive technique is to remotely position and secure sutures to an area of interest. In minimally invasive surgical techniques the surgeon's access to the approximation site is greatly reduced. One method involves using a surgical device to attach the suture material to the tissue, while allowing for sufficient suture so that the suture ends lead outside of the patient's body for easy access by the surgeon. The surgeon can remotely form a loose knot in the suture material and advance the knot to the tissue within the patient using a so-called &#x201c;knot pusher.&#x201d; The surgeon can then remotely tighten the suture and knot, thereby securing the tissue pieces together. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Several knot pushing devices are known which permit an operator to push suture knots which have been formed extracorporeally towards tissue to be sutured. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,769,863, issued to Garrison et al., discloses a surgical knot pusher having an elongated body connected to a pushing head. The pushing head engages a portion of suture material containing a knot and is advanced to the area of interest, thereby &#x201c;throwing&#x201d; the knot. Once the suture knot is placed the knot pushing device is removed and a cutting implement is introduced into the body and cuts the remaining suture material. The remaining suture material is then removed. Another example of a knot pusher is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,860,890, entitled &#x201c;Surgical Knot Pushing Device and Method of Use,&#x201d; the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> In light of the foregoing, there is presently a need for improved systems for remotely securing tissue pieces. More specifically, there is a present need for an improved method, apparatus, and system for fastening tissue. The current invention meets this need. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The present invention solves the problem of effectively securing tissue pieces using a suture and clip. Additionally, the present invention provides a device capable of securing and cutting suture via a catheter from a remote insertion location. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The present invention utilizes two separate and distinct handle movements to deploy a fastener and cut the suture. In a first embodiment, a rotational handle movement is used to deploy the fastener and a longitudinal handle movement is used to cut the suture ends. In another embodiment, a longitudinal handle movement is used to deploy the fastener and a rotational handle movement is used to cut the suture ends. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> An embodiment of the invention includes a suture cutting catheter where a rotational handle movement and a rotational inner body movement cuts suture ends. The suture cutting catheter may include an inner body comprising an angled distal face, and a main body comprising a distal opening and a cutting recess through which suture may pass. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> In a method according to the invention, the user deploys suture through tissue within a patient's body, leaving one or more suture leads that pass out of the patient's body. A catheter according to the invention is advanced into the patient's body along the suture leads, positioned adjacent the tissue, and the catheter cuts the suture leads at a position near the tissue. The catheter may also be used to deploy a clip or other fastener to secure the suture in place in the tissue. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed description. </p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"> The invention is an apparatus, system, and method for securing suture. More specifically, the invention provides for percutaneous or other minimally-invasive techniques of securing and cutting of suture. </p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an embodiment of a fastener catheter <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. The fastener catheter <b>10</b> has a generally tubular main body <b>12</b>, a proximal end <b>14</b>, and a distal end <b>16</b>. The proximal end <b>14</b> includes a handle knob <b>18</b>. The distal end <b>16</b> includes a suture clip <b>20</b> positioned thereon. The fastener catheter <b>10</b> may be manufactured in a variety of shapes, sizes, lengths, widths, and biologically-compatible materials as desired for a particular application. </p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The generally tubular main body <b>12</b> has a longitudinal inner lumen <b>22</b> therethrough which terminates in a distal opening <b>24</b>. A longitudinally slidable inner body <b>26</b> is slidably positioned within the main body <b>12</b>. The inner body <b>26</b> includes an inner tubular member distal end <b>28</b> which extends out of the main body distal opening <b>24</b>. The inner tubular member distal end <b>28</b> itself includes an inner tubular member distal opening <b>30</b>, which leads to an inner body lumen <b>32</b>. These and other features are depicted in additional detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>c</i>, which illustrate (in exploded fashion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>b</i>, and assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>), distal portions of the fastener catheter <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"> The inner body <b>26</b> includes a suture recess <b>34</b> formed in the side thereof, which in turn is in communication with the inner body lumen <b>32</b>. Inner body <b>26</b> also includes a pin <b>36</b> extending radially outward therefrom. The main body <b>12</b> has a cutting recess <b>38</b> formed in an axial side thereof and a cutting member <b>40</b> which, in the embodiment depicted, is on a proximal edge of cutting recess <b>38</b>. A pin recess in the form of slot <b>42</b> extends parallel to the axis of the main body <b>12</b> and radially through to main body lumen <b>22</b>. The slot <b>42</b> is thus configured to receive pin <b>36</b> in sliding relation. </p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, the inner body <b>26</b> is slidably positioned within main body <b>12</b>, such that suture recess <b>34</b> is in alignment with cutting recess <b>38</b>. Pin <b>36</b> is in slidable communication with slot <b>42</b> thereby permitting relative linear motion, but preventing relative rotational motion, between inner body <b>26</b> and main body <b>12</b>. A clip <b>20</b> is positioned on the inner body distal end <b>28</b>, which protrudes from the main body distal opening <b>24</b>. The clip, which is depicted in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>b</i>, includes a clip distal opening <b>44</b>, clip proximal opening <b>46</b>, and engagement members <b>48</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, the clip <b>20</b> has been placed on inner member distal end <b>28</b> by deflecting the engagement members <b>48</b> radially outward until they can be placed around the outer circumference of inner body distal end <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the clip <b>20</b> is secured to the inner body distal end <b>28</b> by means of the frictional engagement between the engagement members <b>48</b> and the outer surface of inner body <b>26</b>. Suture <b>50</b> extends from the fastener clip <b>20</b>, with suture leads <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>extending through the clip distal opening <b>44</b>, engagement members <b>48</b>, and proximal opening <b>46</b>, passing through inner member distal opening <b>30</b> and inner member lumen <b>32</b>, exiting the inner member <b>26</b> via suture recess <b>34</b>, and exiting the side of main body <b>12</b> through cutting recess <b>38</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>illustrate a fastener <b>20</b> of the present invention. Fastener <b>20</b> may be manufactured from a variety of materials including, for example, Nickel-Titanium alloys, shape-memory alloys, stainless steel, titanium, various plastics, and other biologically-compatible materials. Fastener <b>20</b> has a distal opening <b>44</b> leading to an internal attachment lumen <b>54</b> extending axially through the clip <b>20</b>, including passing through the one or more engagement member(s) <b>48</b> formed on a proximal end <b>52</b> thereof. Between the engagement members <b>48</b> is defined proximal opening <b>46</b>, which in the embodiment depicted acts as an engagement aperture.

Attachment lumen <b>54</b> and proximal opening <b>46</b> are sized to receive a first suture lead <b>50</b><i>a </i>and a second suture lead <b>50</b><i>b </i>therein. Prior to deployment, engagement member(s) <b>48</b> are deflected radially away from the axis of the fastener clip <b>20</b> such that proximal opening <b>46</b> has a relative large first diameter sufficient to permit suture leads <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>to slide therethrough, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a. </i>Upon deployment, i.e. after the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>have been retracted, engagement members <b>48</b> are deflected or permitted to spring back toward the central axis of the fastener <b>20</b> such that the proximal opening <b>46</b> assumes a second smaller diameter compressing and securing suture leads <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>in place, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"> Depending on the particular embodiment, including the materials from which a particular fastener is made, the engagement member(s) <b>48</b> may tend to spring toward a natural position at the axis of fastener <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>shows the fastener <b>20</b> in the deployed configuration in which suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>are secured in fastener <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>depict the handle portion <b>18</b> of the catheter <b>10</b>, which includes a rotatably and slidably movable portion <b>60</b> and a stationary portion <b>62</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the movable portion <b>60</b> is rotatably and slidably positioned about the stationary portion <b>62</b>. The movable portion <b>60</b> is secured to the catheter inner body <b>26</b> via a rotational hub <b>61</b> which permits rotational but not longitudinal movement of the movable portion <b>60</b> with respect to inner body <b>26</b>. The stationary portion <b>62</b> is secured to the catheter main body <b>12</b>. Accordingly, longitudinal movement of the movable portion <b>60</b> with respect to the stationary portion <b>62</b> causes corresponding longitudinal movement of the catheter inner body <b>26</b> with respect to the catheter main body <b>12</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>, the movable portion <b>60</b> includes an inward-facing threaded surface <b>64</b> configured to interact with an outward-facing threaded surface <b>66</b> on the stationary portion <b>62</b>. Rotational movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> will cause the threaded surfaces to interact. Accordingly, rotational movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> with respect to the stationary handle portion <b>62</b> will cause corresponding longitudinal movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> with respect to the stationary handle portion <b>62</b>. Because the movable handle portion <b>60</b> is secured to the catheter inner body <b>26</b>, and the stationary portion <b>62</b> is secured to the catheter main body <b>12</b>, longitudinal movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> causes longitudinal movement of the catheter inner body <b>26</b> with respect to the catheter main body <b>12</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"> In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the movable handle portion <b>60</b> is positioned with a distally-facing portion, namely its distal end <b>68</b>, abutting a proximal-facing structure <b>70</b> of the stationary handle portion. Accordingly, distal longitudinal movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> with respect to the stationary handle <b>62</b> from the positioned depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is prevented. Because a clockwise movement (in the case of a right-handed screw engagement system) of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> causes distal longitudinal movement, the proximal-facing edge <b>70</b> prevents not only (initial) distal proximal movement but also clockwise rotational movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"> When a user rotates the movable portion <b>60</b> counterclockwise with respect to the stationary portion <b>62</b>, the movable portion <b>60</b> is longitudinally displaced proximally with respect to the stationary portion.

After a certain amount of rotational movement, the inward threaded surface <b>64</b> will have moved proximally of the outward facing threaded surface <b>66</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i>At this point the movable portion <b>60</b> is no longer restrained by the threaded portion from direct (i.e., longitudinal as opposed to spiral) proximal movement with respect to the stationary portion <b>62</b>. Once the movable portion <b>60</b> is in the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, the user can pull the movable portion <b>60</b> proximally with respect to the stationary portion <b>62</b> handle, thereby moving the movable portion <b>60</b> to a position such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c. </i></p>

In the embodiment depicted, the suture <b>50</b> has previously been passed through the desired tissue structure within the patient's body <b>76</b>, which in the embodiment depicted is heart tissue <b>78</b>. Various methods and/or systems can be used to pass the suture through the desired tissue. Examples of such a suturing methods and apparatuses are depicted and described in issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,930, issued to Allen et al.; co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/106,583, entitled &#x201c;Sequential Heart Valve Repair Device and Method of Use&#x201d; and filed on Mar. 26, 2002; co-pending U.S. application Ser.

No. ______, filed concurrently herewith and entitled &#x201c;System, Apparatus, and Method for Repairing Septal Defects&#x201d;; the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. With the suture <b>50</b> passing through the tissue <b>78</b> and the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>passing out of the patients' body <b>76</b>, the user can advance the fastener catheter <b>10</b> into the vicinity of the tissue <b>78</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The fastener catheter will advance along the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>and, if present, along the guidewire (not shown). </p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"> The user can initially tighten the suture <b>50</b> to determining whether the suture <b>50</b> is properly positioned in accordance with the desires of the user in the particular application. The advancement of the fastener catheter <b>10</b>, combined with the user holding (and possibly pulling on) the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, causes the suture <b>50</b> to tighten. The user can verify the effectiveness of the tightened suture by monitoring various patient functions. For example, the user may confirm the result by monitoring blood flow using radiopaque dyes combined with fluoroscopy. If the user is dissatisfied with the results when the suture is initially tightened, the user can remove the suture entirely from the patient's body and repeat the suture deployment to try to achieve a better positioning of suture. If, however, the user is satisfied with the results, the user can release the clip <b>20</b> from the catheter <b>10</b>, which in the handle embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>is achieved by rotating the handle movable portion <b>60</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>e </i>depict another embodiment of a catheter handle <b>10</b> according to the invention. The catheter includes a stationary handle portion <b>62</b> having proximal portion <b>80</b> and a distal portion <b>82</b>. The stationary handle proximal and distal portions <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are rigidly connected to each other via one or more longitudinal elements <b>84</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>e</i>, there are two such longitudinal elements <b>84</b>. The movable handle portion <b>60</b> has a threaded inner surface <b>86</b>. A butterfly wheel <b>88</b> is positioned within the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. The butterfly wheel <b>88</b> is connected to the inner body <b>26</b> via a spindle <b>93</b> and wire <b>89</b>, so that proximal movement of the butterfly wheel <b>88</b> causes corresponding proximal movement of the inner body <b>26</b>. The butterfly wheel <b>88</b> has a threaded outer surface <b>90</b> configured to engage the threaded inner surface <b>86</b> of the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. The butterfly wheel <b>88</b> is held in alignment with the central axis <b>100</b> of the catheter via an axis rod <b>91</b> which passes proximally through the center of the butterfly wheel <b>88</b>, and a distal spindle <b>93</b>. The butterfly gear and distal spindle include a lumen <b>95</b> configured to slidingly receive the axis rid <b>91</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the wire <b>89</b> at a proximal end is bonded to the spindle <b>93</b>, and at a distal end is bonded to the inner body <b>26</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"> In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>e</i>, there is a stationary plate <b>92</b> held rigidly with respect to the stationary handle portion <b>62</b>, which can be accomplished by securing the stationary plate <b>92</b> to the handle portion longitudinal elements <b>84</b>. The stationary plate has a hole <b>94</b> at a particular location thereon. The movable handle portion <b>60</b> is secured to a proximally-facing pinion alignment rod <b>96</b>, which is at an identical radial distance <b>98</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>) from the movable handle portion rotational axis <b>100</b> as the radial distance <b>102</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>c</i>-<b>7</b><i>d</i>) of the hole <b>94</b>. The alignment rod <b>96</b> is also sized to pass through the hole <b>94</b> when in alignment therewith. The stationary plate <b>92</b> also serves as the distal anchor for the spindle <b>93</b> and butterfly wheel <b>88</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"> With the alignment rod <b>96</b> at a starting position <b>104</b>, indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, the rod <b>96</b> engages the stationary plate <b>92</b>, thereby preventing proximal movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. The movable handle portion <b>60</b> is, however, able to be rotated. As the movable handle portion <b>60</b> is rotated, the threaded inner surface <b>86</b> of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> engages the threaded outer surface <b>90</b> of the butterfly wheel <b>88</b>. The butterfly wheel <b>88</b> cannot rotate because it is held in rotational position by the stationary portion longitudinal elements <b>84</b>. Instead of rotating, the butterfly wheel <b>88</b> is proximally displaced by the rotation of the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. The proximal movement of the butterfly wheel <b>88</b> causes a corresponding proximal movement of the inner body distal end <b>28</b>, so that the inner body distal end <b>28</b> retracts into the main body <b>12</b> and the clip is deployed, as was depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"> At the same time that the butterfly wheel <b>88</b> is displaced proximally, the rotation of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> moves the pinion engagement rod from its starting (retrained) position <b>104</b> (depicted with respect to the stationary plate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>) to an alignment position <b>106</b>, wherein the engagement rod <b>96</b> is in alignment with hole <b>94</b>. With the rod <b>96</b> in alignment with the hole <b>94</b>, the movable handle portion <b>60</b> is freed to move be moved proximally with respect to the stationary handle portion <b>62</b>. The user can thus pull back on the movable handle portion <b>60</b> and move the main body cutting member <b>40</b> to cut the suture <b>50</b>, as was depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c. </i>In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>e</i>, the stationary plate has an arresting member <b>108</b> that can engage the alignment rod <b>96</b> to prevent the movable member <b>60</b> from being rotated &#x201c;backwards&#x201d; from the starting point, and which can also prevent the movable member from being &#x201c;over-rotated&#x201d; such that the alignment rod goes past the hole <b>94</b>. A spring <b>110</b> is also provided, which urges the butterfly wheel <b>88</b> and movable handle member <b>60</b> to a distal direction. The spring <b>110</b> thus serves to prevent the movable handle member <b>60</b> from being inadvertently moved in the proximal direction, even after the pinion engagement rod <b>96</b> is aligned with the hole <b>94</b>. The spring <b>110</b> provides sufficient forward pressure to prevent inadvertent proximal movement of the movable handle member <b>60</b>, but insufficient pressure to prevent the user from intentionally moving the movable handle member <b>60</b> proximally. When a user pulls the movable handle portion <b>60</b> proximally with a force greater than the spring force, the movable handle portion <b>60</b> moves proximally, thereby moving the inner body <b>26</b> proximally and severing the suture lines. </p>

As the movable handle portion <b>60</b> is rotated, the butterfly gear <b>88</b> is moved proximally. Because the butterfly gear <b>88</b> is connected via the spindle <b>95</b> and wire <b>89</b> to the inner body <b>26</b>, the proximal movement of the butterfly gear <b>88</b> causes corresponding proximal movement of the inner body <b>26</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067"> Proximal movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> with respect to the stationary handle portion <b>62</b> causes the inner body distal end <b>28</b> to retract within the main body <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b </i>depicts the movable handle portion <b>60</b> retracted proximally with respect to the stationary handle portion, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>b </i>depicting the corresponding position of the inner body distal end <b>28</b>, which is retracted within the main body <b>12</b>. The retraction of the inner body distal end <b>28</b> causes the clip <b>20</b> to be released, with the released clip <b>20</b> securing the suture <b>50</b>. The new position of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> places the post <b>112</b> within the circumferential portion <b>118</b> of the slot <b>114</b>, thereby permitting rotational movement of the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"> Once the movable handle portion <b>60</b> has been retracted to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a, </i>thereby releasing the clip <b>20</b> and securing the suture <b>50</b>, the user can cut the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>by rotating the movable handle portion <b>60</b>. This rotation of the movable handle portion <b>60</b> causes the main body cutting element <b>40</b> to move adjacent to and cooperate with the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b>, with the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>caught between and severed by the scissor-like action between the main body cutting member <b>40</b> and the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b>. With clip <b>20</b> deployed and the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>severed, the user can withdraw the catheter <b>10</b> from the patient's body. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"> Although the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c </i>includes two sharpened elements, namely the main body cutting member <b>40</b> and the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b>, providing only one such sharpened edge, or no sharpened edge at all, is within the scope of the invention. Moreover, the edges could be located on different parts of the apparatus. For example, the main body cutting member <b>40</b> may be replaced with an unsharpened edge, so that the actual cutting is performed by the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b>. Alternatively, the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b> may be replaced with an unsharpened edge, so that the actual cutting is performed by the main body cutting member <b>40</b>. Or both the inner body cutting edge <b>126</b> and the main body cutting member <b>40</b> may be replaced by unsharpened edges, with the suture being cut by the sheering force created by the cooperation between the relatively unsharp edges. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"> The cutting devices and methods described herein may be used with the clip deployment structure, as discussed above, or as a separate catheter and method for suture cutting without clip deployment. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c </i>depict a catheter <b>132</b> configured for suture cutting, which can be used in percutaneous or other minimally-invasive procedures where it is desirable to remotely cut suture lines. The suture cutting catheter <b>132</b> could be used as discussed above with respect to cutting suture that has been secured with a clip, and could also be used to cut suture that has already been remotely tied, such as where a knot pusher has been used to advance a knot along suture to a desired site in a patient's body. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"> In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c</i>, a suture cutting catheter <b>130</b> has a main body <b>132</b>, a distal portion <b>134</b>, and a proximal portion <b>136</b>. The proximal portion <b>136</b> includes a rotatable handle portion <b>138</b> and a stationary handle portion <b>140</b>. The catheter <b>130</b> has an inner body <b>142</b> rotatably received within the main body <b>132</b>. The rotatable handle portion <b>138</b> is connected, directly or indirectly, to the inner body <b>142</b>, so that rotation of the rotatable handle portion <b>138</b> causes corresponding rotation of the inner body <b>142</b>. The stationary handle portion <b>140</b> is connected, directly or indirectly, to the main body <b>142</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>c </i>depict the distal portion <b>134</b> in greater detail. The main body <b>132</b> has a distal end opening <b>143</b>. Inner body <b>142</b> has a distal end <b>144</b> defining a beveled surface <b>146</b>. The beveled surface includes a sharpened edge portion <b>148</b>. The main body <b>132</b> includes a recess <b>150</b> in the side thereof. The recess <b>150</b> includes a cutting member <b>152</b> in a side edge thereof. Rotation of the inner body <b>142</b> with respect to the main body <b>132</b> causes the inner body sharpened edge portion <b>148</b> to move adjacent to and cooperate with the main body cutting member <b>152</b> to cut any suture caught therebetween. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"> Suture lines <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>(depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>b</i>) pass through the distal opening <b>143</b> and out of the recess <b>150</b>. In order to facilitate the threading of the suture lines <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, the inner body <b>142</b> can be positioned longitudinally within the main body <b>132</b> such that a proximal edge <b>153</b> of the beveled surface <b>146</b> is in alignment with a proximal edge <b>151</b> of the recess <b>150</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>c</i>. Such alignment provides a generally smooth path along which the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>can be threaded, with the beveled surface <b>146</b> effectively forming a ramp leading to the recess <b>150</b>. Positioning the beveled surface proximal edge <b>153</b> just distal of the recess proximal edge <b>151</b> will also provide a generally smooth and convenient path through which the suture leads <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>may be inserted. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>c </i>depict a catheter <b>10</b> according to the invention provided with a distal opening structure <b>154</b> configured to facilitate the introduction of suture therein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>c</i>, the distal opening structure <b>154</b> is a distal cap <b>156</b> which is secured to the distal end of the catheter main body <b>12</b>. The distal cap <b>156</b> includes a distal opening <b>158</b>, with the distal opening <b>158</b> including a generally funnel-shaped entrance <b>160</b> to help guide suture into an entry lumen <b>162</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the funnel-shaped entrance defines an angle <b>164</b> of about <b>100</b> degrees. The distal cap may be formed as an integral part of the main body, or may be a separate structure secured to the main body <b>12</b> by glue (such as Loctite) or some other method, as in the distal cap <b>156</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>c</i>. For a catheter configured to deliver a clip, a distal opening structure such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>b </i>could be located on the distal portion of the clip itself, either in addition to or in lieu of a distal opening structure on the catheter itself. Note that the distal opening structure <b>154</b> is compatible with all catheter embodiments of the invention, including the dedicated suture cutter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c </i>and the combined clip delivery and suture cutting catheter depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and elsewhere. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>c </i>depict a further embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a </i>depicts a top view of the catheter <b>10</b> with a protective outer sheath positioned <b>170</b> thereon, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b </i>depicting a side view of the distal portion of the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a. </i>The catheter <b>10</b> includes a protective outer sheath <b>170</b> (depicted by itself in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>c</i>) configured to be placed about and longitudinally moved along the catheter main body <b>12</b>. The protective outer sheath <b>170</b> has a distal end <b>172</b> and a proximal end <b>174</b>, with the distal end <b>172</b> having a distal opening <b>173</b>. The proximal end <b>174</b> is connected to movable sheath handle <b>176</b>. In the particular embodiment depicted, the movable sheath handle <b>176</b> is positioned distally of the main catheter handle <b>18</b>. The apparatus includes a first arresting mechanism <b>178</b> and a second arresting mechanism <b>180</b> which cooperate an engagement mechanism <b>182</b> (depicted as indentations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>c</i>) on the movable sheath handle <b>176</b> to prevent inadvertent movement of the movable sheath handle <b>176</b>. With the outer sheath <b>170</b> in a delivery position (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>), the distal end <b>172</b> of the protective outer sheath <b>170</b> extends over the main body <b>12</b> as well as the protruding inner body distal end <b>28</b> and the clip <b>20</b>. The sheath <b>170</b> thus protects the clip <b>20</b>, preventing the clip <b>20</b> from being inadvertently dislodged from the catheter <b>10</b> during advancement and positioning of the catheter distal end <b>16</b> within the patient's body. The sheath <b>170</b> includes a sheath cutout <b>184</b> which permits suture leads to pass from the main body cutting recess and out of the sheath <b>170</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"> Once the clip <b>20</b> is positioned at or near the desired deployment location within the patient's body, the user can proximally withdraw the movable sheath handle <b>176</b> with respect to the main catheter handle <b>18</b>, thereby proximally withdrawing the outer sheath <b>170</b> to expose the clip <b>20</b> and inner body distal end <b>28</b>. With the outer sheath <b>170</b> withdrawn, the clip <b>20</b> can be deployed and the suture <b>50</b> cut, as discussed previously. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"> While the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be understood that various changes and additional variations may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention or the inventive concept thereof.
