<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> The present invention is related to deployment systems and methods for accurately and rapidly deploying vascular occlusion devices at a preselected location within the vascular system of a patient, and more particularly, deployment approaches that utilize a pusher having an expandable gripper which is opened by the action of an expandable chemical reaction chamber to facilitate rapid deployment of vascular occlusion devices. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The use of catheter delivery systems for positioning and deploying therapeutic devices, such as dilation balloons, stents and embolic coils, in the vasculature of the human body has become a standard procedure for treating endovascular diseases. It has been found that such devices are particularly useful in treating areas where traditional operational procedures are impossible or pose a great risk to the patient, for example in the treatment of aneurysms in cranial blood vessels. Due to the delicate tissue surrounding cranial blood vessels, especially for example brain tissue, it is very difficult and often risky to perform surgical procedures to treat such a defect. Advancements in catheter deployment systems have provided an alternative treatment in such cases. Some of the advantages of catheter delivery systems are that they provide methods for treating blood vessels by an approach that has been found to reduce the risk of trauma to the surrounding tissue, and they also allow for treatment of blood vessels that in the past would have been considered inoperable. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Typically, these procedures involve inserting the distal end of a delivery catheter into the vasculature of a patient and guiding it through the vasculature to a predetermined delivery site. A vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, is attached to the end of a delivery member which pushes the coil through the catheter and out of the distal end of the catheter into the delivery site. Some of the problems that have been associated with these procedures relate to the accuracy of coil placement. For example, the force of the coil exiting the delivery catheter may cause the coil to over shoot the predetermined site or dislodge previously deployed coils. Also, once the coil is pushed out of the distal end of the catheter, the coil cannot be retracted and may migrate to an undesired location. Often, retrieving and repositioning the coil requires a separate procedure and has the potential to expose the patient to additional risk. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In response to the above mentioned concerns, numerous devices and release mechanisms have been developed in an attempt to provide a deployment system which allows control of the occlusion device after the device has been delivered by the catheter and provides a rapid release or detachment mechanism to release the device once it is in place. One such device is disclosed in Geremia et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,407, which shows a fiber optic cable including a connector device mounted to the end to the optic fiber. An embolic coil is attached to the connector device by a heat releasable adhesive. Laser light is transmitted through the fiber optic cable to increase the temperature of the connector device, which melts the adhesive and releases the embolic coil. One drawback to using this type of system is the potential risk of melted adhesives contaminating the blood stream. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another coil deployment system employs a pusher member having an embolic coil attached to the pusher member by a connector fiber which is capable of being broken by heat, as disclosed in Gandhi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,773. The pusher member of this arrangement includes an electrical resistance heating coil through which the connector fiber is passed. Electrical current is supplied to the heating coil by a power source connected to the heating coil via wires extending through an internal lumen of the pusher. The power source is activated to increase the temperature of the heating coil which breaks the connector fiber. One drawback is that connecting the resistance heating coil to the power source requires running multiple wires through the pusher member. Additionally, the electrical current traveling through the wires may create stray electromagnetic fields that interfere with other surgical and/or monitoring equipment. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Yet another embolic coil positioning and delivery system is described in Saadat et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,242, which discloses a catheter having a shape memory alloy connector attached to the distal end of the catheter. The connector includes a socket having a pair of spaced-apart fingers which are responsive to a change in temperature. The fingers are bent towards each other and hold a ball which is connected to an end of an embolic coil. The connector absorbs laser light transmitted through an optical cable and transmits the light into heat energy. The heat energy raises the temperature of the connector and opens the fingers, thereby releasing the embolic coil. This delivery system and the other above-identified delivery systems require electronic equipment powered by a power source. If the electronic equipment is defective or the power source fails, for example a battery pack fails, the procedure may be prolonged while the equipment is repaired or replaced. Prolonging the procedure may expose the patient to additional risk. This patent, and all other patents and references identified herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Therefore, a need remains for a rapid release vascular occlusion deployment system or method that does not rely on electrical equipment or a power supply, is simple to manufacture, flexible and easy to guide through the vasculature of the body, provides better control over the occlusion device, and reduces the possibility of interference with other surgical and/or monitoring equipment. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The present invention embodies deployment systems and methods for accurately and rapidly deploying a vascular occlusion device at a preselected site within the vasculature of a patient. The deployment system may employ an elongated flexible delivery catheter for guiding a deployment unit to the preselected site. The deployment unit includes a pusher which has a gripper located at a distal end portion of the pusher. The gripper has an expandable gripping element, for example a plurality of gripping jaws, for releasably attaching a vascular occlusion device, such as an embolic coil, to the deployment system. The pusher guides the vascular occlusion device through the delivery catheter to the preselected site. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> An expandable reaction chamber operatively communicates with the gripper. The delivery system also includes a first dispensing unit for dispensing a first reactant into the reaction chamber and a second dispensing unit for dispensing a second reactant into the reaction chamber. When the first and second reactants are dispensed into the chamber, they react to form a product that has a larger volume than the combined volumes of the first and second reactants prior to reacting. The product pushes against the inner wall of the expandable reaction chamber which causes the reaction chamber to outwardly expand. As the reaction chamber expands, it pushes against the gripping element causing the gripping element to outwardly expand or open so that the gripping element releases the vascular occlusion device, thereby deploying the vascular occlusion device at the preselected location. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriate manner. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally illustrates a preferred embodiment of the vascular occlusion device deployment system of the present invention. The deployment system, generally designated at <b>10</b>, includes an elongated flexible guiding catheter <b>12</b> which is inserted into the vascular system of a patient and used to guide a deployment unit, generally designed <b>14</b>, to a preselected site in a manner generally known in the art. The deployment system <b>14</b> includes an elongated flexible pusher or delivery tube <b>16</b> having a proximal end portion <b>18</b> and a distal end portion <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a gripper <b>22</b> is located at the distal end portion <b>20</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. The gripper <b>22</b> includes an outwardly expandable gripping element <b>24</b>, which is generally illustrated as a plurality of jaws. The gripping element <b>24</b> releasably engages a protruding portion or headpiece <b>26</b> of a vascular occlusion device <b>28</b>, such as an embolic coil. As will be discussed in more detail below, when the gripping element expands outwardly, it releases the headpiece <b>26</b> of the vascular occlusion device <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> The gripper <b>22</b> may be comprised of polymer, such as FEP Teflon, PTFE Teflon, polyvinyl chloride, a polyolefin or a neoprene, or any other suitable polymer, and may be constructed as disclosed in Bennett et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,608, hereby incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the gripper <b>22</b> may be constructed of any suitable metal, or the gripper could comprise a microtube which has been slit. A suitable microtube may be made of stainless steel or of a nickel-titanium alloy such as Nitinol, or other suitable material. Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the gripper <b>22</b> is a separated unit which is attached to the pusher <b>16</b> in any suitable manner, for example by a silicone or cyanoacrylate adhesive. However, it is also contemplated that the gripper <b>22</b> and pusher <b>16</b> could be a unitary structure. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> As stated above, the occlusion device <b>28</b> may be an embolic coil which may take various forms and configurations, and may also be filled with a fibrous material or may be coated with a beneficial substance, such as a biogel to promote clotting. Alternatively, the occlusion device also may be any other occlusion device or approach known in the art such as hydrogels, foams, bioactive coils, braids, cables, and hybrid devices. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> An expandable reaction chamber <b>30</b> is positioned within the gripper <b>22</b>. The reaction chamber <b>30</b>, which for illustrative purposes is depicted as a microballoon, is preferably comprised of an elastic membrane <b>31</b>. The elastic membrane may be constructed from materials that do not significantly degrade while in contact with the reactant materials or the product formed therefrom. Typically, these will be an elastic polymer, such as silicone, a polyamide, a nylon, or a polyolefin such as polyethylene. The reaction chamber <b>30</b> includes a cavity <b>32</b> defined by the inner surface <b>33</b> of the membrane <b>31</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> The delivery unit <b>14</b> also includes a first dispensing unit <b>34</b> for dispensing a first reactant <b>36</b> into the cavity <b>32</b> of the reaction chamber <b>30</b> and a second dispensing unit <b>38</b> for dispensing a second reactant <b>40</b> into the cavity <b>32</b> of the reaction chamber <b>30</b>. For illustrative purposes, the dispensing units <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> comprise a dual-lumen, plunger-activated dispensing tube <b>39</b> which extends within the pusher <b>16</b> from the proximal end portion <b>18</b> to the distal end portion <b>20</b> of the pusher <b>16</b>. A distal end portion <b>41</b> of the dual lumen dispensing tube <b>39</b> may extend through the membrane <b>31</b> of the reaction chamber <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>32</b>. The membrane <b>31</b> and dispensing tube <b>39</b> may be attached and sealed together by an adhesive, such as a silicone or cyanoacrylate adhesive. Alternatively, the membrane <b>31</b> may be wrapped around the dispensing tube <b>39</b> and attached and sealed with a similar adhesive. Other connection approaches can be practiced, such as those incorporating shrink tubing or other connector members. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The reactants <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> may be dispensed from the lumens to the cavity <b>30</b> by activating a plunger <b>42</b> (which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) located at a proximal end portion of the dispensing tube <b>39</b>. Typically, the reactants, prior to dispensing them, are secured within the respective lumens by a breakable seal <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, respectively. Such seals should be selected to be made of a material that does not significantly degrade while in contact with the reactant materials. In addition, a fluid pressure release feature can be included to prevent the build up of fluid pressure within the reaction chamber when dispensing the reactants. This may take the form of a vent lumen <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the first and second reactants <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> are dispensed into the cavity <b>30</b>, they are mixed to produce a product <b>44</b> which has a greater volume than the combined volume of the first and second reactants prior to mixing. The expanding product <b>44</b> pushes against the inner surface <b>33</b> of the membrane <b>31</b>, causing the membrane <b>31</b> to outwardly expand. The force of the expanded membrane <b>31</b> against the gripping element <b>24</b> forces the gripping element to outwardly expand or open. Movement in this regard can be in a generally radial direction. Additionally, the expanding membrane <b>31</b> also may contact the headpiece <b>26</b> of the occlusion device <b>28</b> and push the headpiece <b>26</b> out of and away from the expanded gripping element <b>24</b>, when this action is desired. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The first and second reactants <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> can be any reactants that produce a product <b>44</b> having a greater volume than the original compositions. Preferably, the first and second reactants may be any of the reactants disclosed in Cooke et al. WO 92/09551, hereby incorporated herein by reference, which produce a polycyanoacrylate foam. In particular, the first reactant is preferably a mixture of cyanoacrylate monomer and ethanol and the second reactant is preferably a mixture of ethanol and N,N-Dimethyl-p-toluidine. Other reactant materials, that when combined form a foam material with an increased bulk volume relative to the reactants, such as precursors for polyurethane foam, are also suitable. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, in operation, the catheter <b>12</b> is inserted into the vasculature system of a patient and positioned at a preselected location within a blood vessel <b>56</b>, typically in conjunction with other devices and professional procedures as generally known in the art. The delivery unit <b>14</b> is inserted into the catheter <b>12</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, once the desired location is reached, the delivery unit <b>14</b> is advanced, and/or the catheter <b>12</b> is moved in a retrograde manner, such that the delivery unit moves with respect to and within the catheter until the occlusion device <b>28</b> moves through the catheter <b>12</b> and out of the distal end of the catheter. During the procedure and before the occlusion device <b>28</b> has been deployed, if it is determined that the distal end of the catheter <b>12</b> or the occlusion device <b>28</b> is not in the correct location, the occlusion device may be retrieved back into the distal end of the catheter by retracting the delivery unit <b>14</b> proximally or advancing the catheter distally. Once the occlusion device has been retrieved, the catheter and/or the occlusion device may be repositioned. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> When the occlusion device <b>28</b> is in the correct position, the plunger <b>42</b> may be activated to dispense the first and second reactants <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> into the cavity <b>32</b> of the reaction chamber <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first and second reactants <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> mix within the cavity <b>32</b> and react to form a product <b>44</b> which has a larger volume than the combined volumes of the first and second reactants prior to mixing. The expanding product <b>44</b> pushes against the inner wall <b>33</b> of the membrane <b>31</b> of the reaction chamber <b>30</b>, causing the membrane <b>31</b> to expand. The expanded membrane <b>31</b> presses against the gripping element <b>24</b> outwardly expanding or opening the gripping element to release the occlusion device <b>28</b> at the preselected location within the blood vessel <b>56</b>. If desired, the membrane <b>31</b> may simultaneously press against the headpiece <b>26</b> to push it out of and away from the gripping element <b>24</b>, thereby deploying the vascular occlusion device <b>28</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> It will be understood that the embodiments of the present invention which have been described are illustrative of some of the applications of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, including those combinations of features that are individually disclosed or claimed herein. </p>
