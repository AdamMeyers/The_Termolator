<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> A further embodiment includes operating an instrument that percutaneously extends into a patient's body, the instrument including a tube, a threaded conveying rod extending inside the tube, a proximal end portion, and a distal end portion. The instrument is placed into position with the distal end portion in proximity to a spinal structure of the patient's body while the proximal end portion remains outside the patient's body. With a deformable prosthesis being positioned between the tube and the rod, it is moved through the tube by rotating the rod while in position. At least a portion of the prosthesis is deposited on the spinal structure with the instrument. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Various forms of this embodiment optionally include: reversing direction of rotation to change direction of deformable prosthesis movement through the tube, and/or turning a handle coupled to the rod to cause rod rotation. Alternatively or additionally this embodiment can optionally include: attaching a tool to the tube, maintaining location of the tube relative to the rod with the tool, and holding down the rod by engaging a travel stop fixed to the rod with a member connected to the tool. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Another embodiment is directed to a kit or system to perform a spinal implantation procedure. In one form, this kit includes: a tube device with an inner surface defining a passage from a proximal end portion to a distal end portion, a conveyor including a threaded conveying rod to be received in the passage of the tube device that can be rotated in the tube or moved in translation along the passage, and a deformable prosthesis structured to move through the passage of the tube by rotating the threaded conveying rod while at least a portion of the deformable prosthesis is positioned between the inner surface and the rod. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Still another embodiment includes instrumentation that comprises: a threaded conveying rod structured to rotate about an axis of rotation, a tube device including a tube extending along the axis of rotation and defining a passage therethrough to receive the rod, a handle coupled to a proximal end portion of the threaded conveying rod, and a travel stop structured to engage the tube device to limit at least one translational direction of travel of the rod along the axis. The rod is structured to rotate in response to rotation of the handle and to move in translation in response to movement of the handle along the axis of rotation and the tube is sized and shaped to have a distal end portion placed inside a body of a patient while a proximal end portion remains outside the body of the patient. The tube includes an accessway to the passage to receive a deformable prosthesis that can be inserted in the patient's body with the instrumentation. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> One object of the present application is to provide a unique implantation technique. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Alternatively or additionally, another object of the present application is to provide a unique method, system, device, kit, tool, instrument, and/or apparatus involving implantation of a deformable prosthetic device. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations or further modifications of the described embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates surgical implantation system <b>20</b>, which includes instrumentation <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Instrumentation <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes implant insertion instrument <b>21</b> shown in a partial, perspective view. System <b>20</b> also schematically depicts kit <b>22</b> including packing or container <b>24</b> and labeling <b>26</b>. Labeling <b>26</b> would typically provide instructions, warnings, and other information regarding the use of its contents. Instrument <b>21</b> can be provided in kit <b>22</b> along with other instrumentation and materials as will be further described hereinafter. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, instrument <b>21</b> extends along longitudinal axis A and has proximal end portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>opposite distal end portion <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Distal end portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>is not designated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> because of the partial view of instrument <b>21</b> shown. Instrument <b>21</b> includes rotational conveyor <b>30</b> that has proximal end portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposite distal end portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Along proximal end portion <b>32</b><i>a</i>, conveyor <b>30</b> includes T-shaped handle <b>34</b>. Handle <b>34</b> is connected to threaded conveying rod <b>36</b>. Rod <b>36</b> includes helical threading <b>36</b><i>a </i>that extends from proximal end portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>to distal end portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Travel stop <b>38</b> is fixed to conveyor <b>30</b> proximal to rod <b>36</b> and is in the shape of a circular portion of a cone. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> Instrument <b>21</b> also includes tube device <b>50</b>. Device <b>50</b> includes tube <b>51</b> having proximal end portion <b>53</b> opposite distal end portion <b>58</b> and inner surface <b>52</b> opposite outer surface <b>54</b>. Inner surface <b>52</b> defines passage <b>56</b> through tube <b>51</b> that extends along axis A. At least a portion of tube <b>51</b> is transparent to visualize structure therein. Distal end portion <b>58</b> defines distal end <b>59</b> that is shaped to a point to assist with the passage of tube <b>51</b> through tissue. Distal end <b>59</b> defines distal opening <b>59</b><i>a</i>. Connected along distal end portion <b>58</b> is flange <b>60</b> that is provided to bear against hard tissue as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. At proximal end portion <b>53</b>, tube device includes head <b>55</b> that has protruding members <b>55</b><i>a </i>and <b>55</b><i>b</i>. Members <b>55</b><i>a </i>and <b>55</b><i>b </i>laterally extend away from axis A. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, conveyor <b>30</b> is arranged to rotate about axis A as designated by curved arrow R<b>1</b> and can move in translation relative to axis A as designated by double-headed arrow T<b>1</b>. For the position of conveyor <b>30</b> relative to device <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, accessway <b>57</b> is provided in the form of an opening to passage <b>56</b> at the proximal end of head <b>55</b>. In comparison, stop <b>38</b> engages head <b>55</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> because conveyor <b>30</b> has been repositioned relative to device <b>50</b> by translational movement along axis A. As a result, accessway <b>57</b> is closed in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Correspondingly, further translational motion of conveyor <b>30</b> into tube <b>51</b> is limited by stop <b>38</b> when it engages head <b>55</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> System <b>20</b> further includes deformable prosthesis <b>70</b> in the form of an elongated implant material <b>71</b>. Prosthesis <b>70</b> can also be included in kit <b>22</b>. Prosthesis <b>70</b> is loaded into passage <b>56</b> of instrument <b>21</b> through accessway <b>57</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Prosthesis <b>70</b> includes distal end portion <b>72</b> opposite proximal end portion <b>74</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.). As prosthesis <b>70</b> is loaded, it is positioned between rod <b>36</b> and inner surface <b>52</b> of tube <b>51</b>. Threading <b>36</b><i>a </i>contacts at least a portion of prosthesis <b>70</b>, gaining purchase therewith. At the same time, at least a portion of prosthesis <b>70</b> that is in contact with threading <b>36</b><i>a </i>also contacts tube <b>51</b>. Typically, as material <b>71</b> is positioned in this manner, it deforms and at least partly conforms to the surfaces it contacts. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross-sectional view of this spatial relationship between rod <b>36</b>, tube <b>51</b>, and material <b>71</b> is shown that corresponds to section line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and for which like reference numerals refer to like features. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> With prosthesis <b>70</b> disposed between rod <b>36</b> and tube <b>51</b> in this manner, rotation of rod <b>36</b> about axis A tends to move prosthesis <b>70</b> along axis A, operating as a screw or worm gear conveyance device. For rotation of rod <b>36</b> in the direction indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>, prosthesis <b>70</b> advances into tube <b>51</b> towards distal opening <b>59</b><i>a</i>. After prosthesis <b>70</b> is loaded into tube <b>51</b> and/or if there is a continuously open accessway for prosthesis (not shown), stop <b>38</b> can be distally advanced to engage head <b>55</b>. For such placement, the distal end of rod <b>36</b> just passes through opening <b>59</b><i>a </i>of tube <b>51</b> and has its distal travel through tube <b>51</b> limited by this engagement between stop <b>38</b> and head <b>55</b>. For this configuration, rotation of rod <b>36</b> about axis A can continue, providing further distal advancement of prosthesis <b>70</b> through tube <b>51</b> and out opening <b>59</b><i>a</i>. In some applications, it is desirable to maintain device <b>50</b> in a desired position as rod <b>36</b> rotates and/or to hold stop <b>38</b> in a rotational bearing relationship with head <b>55</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, scissor tool <b>80</b> of system <b>20</b> and instrumentation <b>20</b><i>a </i>provides such features. Tool <b>80</b> detachably engages member <b>55</b><i>a </i>of head <b>55</b> in a fixed relationship and stop <b>38</b> in an adjustable bearing relationship. Tool <b>80</b> can also be included in kit <b>22</b>. Tool <b>80</b> includes member <b>82</b> and member <b>84</b> that are pivotally coupled together by coupling <b>86</b>; where the cross hairs designate a corresponding pivot point. Member <b>82</b> includes distal connection <b>90</b> that attaches member <b>55</b><i>a </i>to member <b>82</b> in a fixed spatial relationship and is subject to selective detachment by the user. Opposite distal connection <b>90</b>, member <b>82</b> includes proximal handle <b>92</b> with ear <b>98</b><i>a </i>to facilitate proper gripping by hand. Member <b>84</b> includes distal hold down portion <b>94</b> that is shown bearing against stop <b>38</b> corresponding to the closure of accessway <b>57</b>. Opposite distal hold down portion <b>94</b>, member <b>84</b> includes proximal handle <b>96</b> with ear <b>98</b><i>b </i>to facilitate proper gripping of tool <b>80</b> by hand. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> After distal connection <b>90</b> of tool <b>80</b> is formed, handles <b>92</b> and <b>96</b> are brought together or squeezed by hand to engage a proximal bearing surface of stop <b>38</b> with distal hold down portion <b>94</b>, which pivots about the indicated pivot point of coupling <b>86</b>. Correspondingly, tool <b>80</b> provides adjustable jaw mechanism <b>100</b>. The resulting downward pressure or force provided by mechanism <b>100</b> can be modulated to permit rotation of conveyor <b>30</b> about axis A as further described hereinafter. Tool <b>80</b> can be detached and/or portion <b>94</b> can pivot away to disengage stop <b>38</b> so that rod <b>36</b> can be pulled out of tube <b>51</b>. With the separation of stop <b>38</b> and head <b>55</b>, accessway <b>57</b> is opened. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> further depicts distal end portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>of instrument <b>21</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, material <b>71</b> is deposited on a spinal structure S of patient P through opening <b>59</b><i>a </i>of tube <b>51</b> by rotation of conveyor <b>30</b> in the direction indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>. Spinal structure S can include, but is not limited to, vertebra V with endplate region E, and intervertebral disk space D, just to set forth some representative examples. Instrumentation <b>20</b><i>a </i>of system <b>20</b> further includes endoscope device <b>110</b>. Device <b>110</b> is of a standard variety that includes steerable view port <b>112</b> at a distal end of optic cable <b>114</b>. The application of device <b>110</b> is further described in connection with the operation of system <b>20</b> as follows. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, one mode of operating system <b>20</b> is next described. In this application, system <b>20</b> is utilized to perform a minimally invasive spinal implantation procedure on patient P. This procedure includes forming a percutaneous passage PC through body B of patient P that extends through skin SK and subcutaneous soft tissue T as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For this example, at least a portion of a spinal disk in space D is removed so that it can be replaced by a prosthetic device at least partially comprised of prosthesis <b>70</b>. Such removal can occur through passage PC and/or one or more other passages in body B of patient P. Endoscope device <b>110</b> can be used to visualize tissue dissection/removal via passage PC or otherwise. Tube device <b>50</b> of instrument <b>21</b> can be used to maintain and/or define passage PC between intervertebral disk space D and the patient's skin SK, and/or a different arrangement can be utilized. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> With tube device <b>50</b> positioned through passage PC, instrument <b>21</b> is assembled after discal tissue removal is completed by inserting conveyor <b>30</b> into tube <b>51</b> with distal end portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>proceeding first. Before stop <b>38</b> engages head <b>55</b>, advancement of conveyor <b>30</b> is halted to leave accessway <b>57</b> open and to load prosthesis <b>70</b> as previously described. Stop <b>38</b> is then moved to engage head <b>55</b> in a rotational bearing relationship. Tool <b>80</b> is connected to member <b>55</b><i>a </i>of head <b>55</b> before, during, or after loading of material <b>71</b> of prosthesis <b>70</b>. After head <b>55</b> is engaged by stop <b>38</b>, hold down portion <b>94</b> of tool <b>80</b> is used to maintain such engagement. Tool <b>80</b> otherwise can be used to maintain position of device <b>50</b> as conveyor <b>30</b> is rotated therein with handle <b>34</b> to advance prosthesis <b>70</b> towards distal opening <b>59</b><i>a </i>of tube <b>51</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, device <b>110</b> can be used to visualize the deposition of material <b>71</b> of prosthesis <b>70</b> on spinal structure S with view port <b>112</b> extending through passage PC or through another percutaneous route. Advancement of material <b>71</b> is represented by arrows T<b>2</b> as rod <b>36</b> is rotated about axis A in the direction indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> During the procedure, the need to remove or retract some or all of material <b>71</b> can arise. By reversing rotational direction of conveyor to turn in the opposite rotational direction as represented by arrow R<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, material <b>71</b> can be retracted from space D and back into tube <b>51</b>. Once prosthesis <b>70</b> is fully retracted into tube <b>51</b>, hold down portion <b>94</b> of tool <b>80</b> can be released and conveyor <b>30</b> can be proximally withdrawn from device <b>50</b> to correspondingly withdraw prosthesis <b>70</b>.
