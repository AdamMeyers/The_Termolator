<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Technical field </p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present disclosure relates to an adjustable trocar washer for use with a cannula or trocar assembly. More particularly, the present disclosure relates, to an adjustable trocar washer having a compressable collar for securing about a cannula and a skirt for sealing an external surface of an abdominal incision. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Background Of Related Art </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> During laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures it is necessary to provide sealed access ports into the body cavity. These devices are known as trocars or cannulas. A typical cannula includes an elongate tubular member for providing access into the body cavity through an abdominal incision and a cannula housing having a valve member to seal the elongate tubular member. In order to prevent inadvertent removal or insertion of the elongate tubular member through an abdominal incision, an anchor member is typically provided at a distal end of the elongate tubular member to seal it against an inner surface of the abdominal incision. A securing mechanism is often provided and is movably mounted along the elongate tubular member to seal against an outer surface of the abdominal incision. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> One known type of cannula includes a compressible foam collar which is slidably mounted along the elongate tubular member to seal against the outer surface of the abdominal incision. However, the compressible foam collar provides limited vertical stability to the cannula relative to the abdominal wall. Therefore, it is desirable to have a securing mechanism which can seal the outer surface of an abominable incision and also provide substantial vertical stability to the cannula. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">SUMMARY </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The presently disclosed adjustable trocar washer is provided for use with an elongate tubular member or &#x201c;cannula&#x201d; to seal against an outer surface of an abominable incision. The adjustable trocar washer generally includes a collar slidable along the elongate tubular member and a skirt positioned at the distal end of the collar. The collar and skirt are slit along their longitudinal lengths to be adjustably compressible about the elongate tubular member. A latch mechanism is provided on the collar to retain the collar in a compressed condition about the elongate tubular member. In one embodiment, the latch mechanism includes a post provided on one side of the collar slit and a pivotally mounted latch member formed on the opposing side of the collar slit. The latch member may include one or more openings engageable with the post. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The skirt has sufficient flexibility to seal about an incision in the skin. However, the skirt also has sufficient stiffness to provide vertical stability to the cannula. A proximal opening in the skirt is secured to a reduced diameter portion at the distal end of the collar: </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> There is also disclosed a cannula assembly for providing access to a body cavity which includes an elongate tubular member, an anchor provided on the distal end of the elongate tubular member and an adjustable trocar washer slidably positioned about the elongate tubular member. The adjustable trocar washer includes a compressible collar for securing about the elongate tubular member and a flexible skirt for securing against an incision in skin. A latch mechanism is positioned on the collar to compress the collar about the elongate tubular member. The anchor member is expandable to secure against an interior surface of an abdominal incision. </p>

In further embodiments, the collar <b>30</b> and skirt <b>32</b> are integrally formed. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, cannula housing <b>14</b> is provided with a valve assembly <b>60</b> to prevent escape of insufflation gases after obturator assembly <b>12</b> has been removed. As shown, obturator <b>28</b> includes an elongate obturator shaft <b>62</b> extending from obturator housing <b>26</b>. An obturator distal tip <b>64</b> is provided at a distal end of obturator shaft <b>62</b>. Insufflation port <b>24</b> is in direct communication with the interior surface of the elongate tubular member <b>16</b> to provide insufflation fluids directly into the body.

As noted hereinabove, latches <b>38</b> are provided to secure obturator housing <b>26</b> to cannula housing <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the use of the disclosed surgical instrument to provide an access port into an abdominal cavity will now be described. Initially, an incision is made in the abdominal wall. The surgical instrument, with cannula assembly <b>10</b> attached to obturator assembly <b>12</b>, is advanced through the incision until anchor member <b>18</b> is located within an internal cavity of the abdominal wall. Thereafter, inflation fluid is provided to inflation port <b>24</b> to inflate anchor member <b>18</b>. Once anchor member <b>18</b> has been inflated, the surgical instrument can be drawn proximally to cause inflated anchor member <b>18</b> to abut an inner surface of the abdominal wall. Thereafter, trocar washer <b>20</b> is slid distally along elongate tubular member <b>16</b> until skirt <b>32</b> engages the outer surface of the abdominal wall (AW). Once the proper pressure of skirt <b>32</b> against abdominal wall (AW) has been achieved, latch member <b>46</b> can be pivoted to engage the appropriate latch opening <b>38</b> formed in latch member <b>46</b> with post <b>44</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Once the abdominal wall has been secured between anchor balloon <b>18</b> and trocar washer <b>20</b>, obturator assembly <b>12</b> can be removed by depressing latches <b>38</b> and drawing obturator assembly <b>12</b> proximally out of cannula assembly <b>10</b>. At this point, insufflation fluids can be provided to insufflation port <b>24</b> to inflate the cavity within the abdominal wall. The valve assembly <b>60</b> provided within cannula housing <b>14</b> prevents any escape of insufflation gases and allows for insertion of surgical instruments through cannula assembly <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> Once the surgical procedure has been completed, the surgical instrument can be withdrawn through cannula assembly <b>10</b> and cannula assembly <b>10</b> can be removed through the abdominal incision. First, insufflation gasses are released from the body cavity through insufflation port <b>24</b>. Then anchor member <b>18</b> is deflated by removing the inflation fluid from anchor member <b>18</b> through inflation port <b>22</b>. The cannula assembly<b>6</b> <b>10</b> is removed from the incision after the anchor balloon <b>18</b> is deflated. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, the skirt may be formed of a material which has a medium degree of flexibility such that these skirt provides a vertical support to a the cannula assembly and thus stabilizing the cannula assembly against falling over against the abdominal wall during surgical procedures. Further, alternative latch mechanisms may be provided to secure the compressible collar against the elongate tubular member. Additionally, the disclosed adjustable trocar washer can be used with other devices then a cannula is, such as, for example, a catheter, to secure a tubular member against an outer surface of a patient's skin. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. </p>
