<p id="p-0083" num="0129"> The loading device preferably comprises an elongate neck at the outlet end, and the method preferably comprises the step of at least partially aligning the elongate neck with the reception space before delivering the embolic protection filter through the loading device. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0130"> The method may comprise the step of flushing the embolic protection filter before delivering the embolic protection filter through the loading device. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0131"> The method may comprise the step of flushing the catheter before delivering the embolic protection filter into the reception space. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0132"> In a preferred embodiment the catheter comprises an outer catheter tube and an inner catheter tube, the inner catheter tube defining the internal proximal stop. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0133"> Desirably both the inner catheter tube and the outer catheter tube are flushed before delivering the embolic protection filter through the loading device. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0134"> According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a removable device for loading a collapsible embolic protection filter into a catheter, the device comprising a distal stop for releasably engaging with the embolic protection filter to push the embolic protection filter towards a proximal end of a catheter thereby loading the embolic protection filter into the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0135"> The distal stop is preferably provided on an elongate stem. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0136"> Most preferably the distal stop is integral with the stem. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0137"> In one case the distal stop comprises a step in the stem from a small diameter portion proximal of the step to a large diameter portion distal of the step. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0138"> The small diameter portion preferably has a diameter of approximately 0.014&#x2033; (0.3556 mm). </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0139"> The large diameter portion preferably has a diameter of approximately 0.018&#x2033; (0.4572 mm). </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0140"> The distal stop may be attached to the stem. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0141"> Ideally the stem comprises a wire. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0142"> The stem may comprise a low friction coating for ease of threading through the medical device. Ideally the coating is of polytetrafluoroethylene. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0143"> In one case the device comprises a handle. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0144"> The invention provides a clinician with the freedom to select from different guidewires prior to selection of an embolic filter. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0145"> Prior art assemblies suffer from the disadvantage that different guidewires cannot be used with a particular filter during an interventional procedure. A clinician is thus constrained to discard both the guidewire and the filter if the guidewire proves unsuitable, for example because it is too stiff or some other mechanical property is undesirable. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0146"> An important advantage of the invention is that because the filter is not attached to the guidewire in a collapsed configuration for delivery, the guidewire which is first advanced through the vasculature has a lower profile. Therefore the guidewire alone can more easily navigate narrow and tortuous regions of the vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0147"> Another important advantage of the invention is that because the filter is not fixed to the guidewire, if the deployed filter is mis-sized with respect to the region of the treatment site it is free to be carried distally by blood flow to a narrow section of the vasculature at which the filter effectively achieves apposition with the vessel wall. This ensures that all blood flow with entrained embolic material passes through the filter.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0198"> Referring to the drawings there is illustrated a transvascular embolic protection system according to the invention for safely capturing and retaining embolic material released during an interventional procedure while maintaining blood flow. </p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0199"> The embolic protection system comprises an embolic protection device <b>1</b>, a delivery catheter <b>2</b> for delivery of the embolic protection device <b>1</b> to a desired location in the vascular system and a proximal stop for deployment of the embolic protection device <b>1</b>. The device <b>1</b> is collapsible from an expanded deployed configuration to a retracted delivery configuration. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> has a pod <b>13</b> at the distal end to define a reception space for the embolic protection device <b>1</b> in the collapsed delivery configuration. The proximal stop in this case is provided by the distal end <b>27</b> of an inner catheter <b>25</b> which extends towards the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> for deployment of the embolic protection device <b>1</b> from the pod <b>13</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0200"> In use, the embolic protection device <b>1</b> is loaded into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> which is delivered over a pre-positioned guidewire <b>99</b>. At a desired location the inner catheter <b>25</b> is moved relative to the delivery catheter <b>2</b> to deploy the embolic protection device <b>1</b> from the pod <b>13</b>. The delivery and inner catheters <b>2</b>, <b>25</b> are then withdrawn leaving a bare guidewire <b>99</b> over which various devices such as a dilation balloon and/or a stent can be advanced to the treatment site. Embolic material dislodged during the treatment procedure(s) is collected in the embolic protection device <b>1</b>. After treatment, the device <b>1</b> may be retrieved into a retrieval catheter <b>3</b>. The guidewire <b>99</b> may be left in place for further catheter advancements or may be withdrawn with or subsequent to the withdrawal of the retrieval catheter <b>3</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0201"> Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</figref> pack <b>4</b> is provided to safely store and prepare the embolic protection system for use. The pack <b>4</b> comprises a vacuum-formed tray <b>5</b>, typically of PETG. The tray <b>5</b> has a channel <b>6</b> extending in a looped configuration around the tray <b>5</b> for receiving the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> has a proximal end <b>11</b> and a distal end <b>12</b>. A handle <b>14</b> is provided at the proximal end <b>11</b>, and the inner catheter <b>25</b> which extends through the delivery catheter <b>2</b> has a luer <b>36</b> at the proximal end. The luer <b>36</b> is located in the tray <b>5</b> adjacent to the handle <b>14</b>. The pod <b>13</b> is provided at the distal end <b>12</b> of the inner catheter <b>2</b>. A loading device <b>7</b> in the form of a funnel piece is mounted in the tray adjacent to and, in this case extending into the pod <b>13</b>. The embolic protection device <b>1</b> is mounted in its expanded configuration in a well <b>90</b> in the tray <b>5</b> adjacent to and extending into the loading device <b>7</b>. A pushing device <b>8</b> for loading the collapsible embolic protection device <b>1</b> is mounted in the tray <b>5</b> adjacent to the embolic protection device <b>1</b>. A syringe <b>91</b> is also mounted in a recess <b>92</b> of the tray <b>5</b>. The syringe <b>91</b> is used to flush the system and, after flushing, the pushing device <b>8</b> is used to push the embolic protection device <b>1</b> through the loading device <b>7</b> and into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> in the collapsed configuration. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> is now ready for advancement over the guidewire <b>99</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0202"> Referring now to FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>8</b>, the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is illustrated in more detail. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> comprises a tubular body <b>10</b>, typically of polyimide, or nylon extending between a proximal end <b>11</b> and a distal end <b>12</b>. At the distal end <b>12</b> of the tubular body <b>10</b> a pod <b>13</b> is provided, the pod <b>13</b> having a smaller wall thickness and in this case a larger internal diameter, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to define a reception space for receiving the embolic protection device in a collapsed configuration. The handl <b>14</b>, illustrated in detail in FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b>, is attached to the proximal end <b>11</b> of the tubular body <b>10</b>, with a strain relief member <b>15</b> extending from the handle <b>14</b> partially along the tubular body <b>10</b>. The handle <b>14</b> defines a central lumen <b>16</b> extending between a proximal opening <b>17</b> and a distal opening <b>18</b>. A side port opening <b>19</b> is provided in the handle <b>14</b>, the side port <b>19</b> being in communication with the central lumen <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). A female luer <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is also provided, the luer <b>20</b> being fixedly mounted in the side port <b>19</b>. A double-start thread is provided at the free end of the luer <b>20</b> for threadable attachment of, for example, a flushing syringe <b>91</b> to the luer <b>20</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0203"> In this case the proximal stop is provided by an inner catheter <b>25</b>. As illustrated in FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>12</b>, the inner catheter <b>25</b> comprises a tubular body extending between a proximal end <b>26</b> and a distal end <b>27</b>. The tubular body comprises an inner tubular stem <b>28</b> extending between the proximal end <b>26</b> and the distal end <b>27</b>, and an outer tubular stem <b>29</b>, typically of polyimide, extending from the proximal end <b>26</b> only partially along the inner stem <b>28</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The outer stem <b>29</b> terminates in a protruding O-ring shoulder <b>30</b>. An annular collar <b>31</b> is slidably mounted to the outer stem <b>29</b> proximally of the O-ring shoulder <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The female winged luer piece <b>36</b> is attached to the proximal end <b>26</b> of the stems <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> by means of a flair connector <b>32</b>. The winged luer <b>36</b> defines a central lumen <b>33</b> extending between a proximal opening <b>34</b> and a distal opening <b>35</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0204"> As illustrated in FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>17</b>, the inner catheter <b>25</b> is configured for insertion through the proximal opening <b>17</b> of the handle <b>14</b> and advancement through the handle <b>14</b> and the tubular body <b>10</b> until the collar <b>31</b> engages the handle <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) in the region of the proximal opening <b>17</b>. The collar <b>31</b> is fixedly attached within the proximal opening <b>17</b> of the handle <b>14</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0205"> The inner catheter <b>25</b> is slidable relative to the delivery catheter <b>2</b> between a retracted position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in which the distal end <b>27</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> is proximal of the pod <b>13</b> defining the reception space in the delivery catheter <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), and an extended position, in which the distal end <b>27</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> extends distally of the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Movement of the inner catheter <b>25</b> proximally relative to the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is limited by engagement of the O-ring shoulder <b>30</b> with the collar <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0206"> The pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the inner stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> at least partially comprise a stiff core, for example of a metallic material, such as stainless steel, encased in a more pliable body, for example of a plastics material such as polyimide. The cores comprise a mesh of longitudinally oriented strips of the stiff material and circumferentially oriented strips of the stiff material. </p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0207"> Accurate delivery of a filter to its intended location (a non-diseased vessel area) is a particularly important concern in tortuous anatomy where there is a limited area of non-diseased vessel. The accuracy of deployment is related to the build up of potential stain energy in delivery catheter systems. This strain energy is primarily a combination of strain energy produced in the outer and inner shaft during the deployment action. The designs described below referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 12A</figref> detail a novel solution to these problems. </p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0208"> During the deployment action the outer shaft or delivery catheter <b>2</b> is subjected to high levels of tensile strain. The design/construction of the outer shaft <b>2</b> is such that the amount of strain energy that can be stored within the outer shaft is minimised. Low flexural stiffness is also desirable in catheter design to ensure good catheter flexibility, trackability and low insertion forces. These attributes are achieved by incorporating high tensile elements <b>21</b> within the wall construction of the outer shaft <b>2</b>. These high tensile elements <b>2</b> can be high tensile longitudinal steel wires as shown in the example below or they may be flexible high tensile wires or fibers, carbon fibers and or kevlar fibers. These fibers/wires are contained within the wall <b>22</b> of the catheter which may be a polymeric material (detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a polyimide wall). These wires/fibers provide the outer shaft with high tensile modulus (minimal stretch) which results in a shaft that can not store much strain energy. The inclusion of the above high tensile elements <b>21</b> allows for a low profile outer shaft <b>2</b>. This low wall thickness outer catheter shaft therefore also has low flexural stiffness, good flexibility, trackability and subsequently low insertion force. The inner surface <b>23</b> of the lumen of this shaft <b>2</b> is a low friction (PTFE) material to minimise the friction strain energy incurred during the deployment action. </p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0209"> During the deployment action the inner catheter shaft <b>25</b> is subjected to high levels of compression strain. The design/construction of the inner shaft <b>25</b> is such that the modulus of compression is high which reduces the amount of strain energy that can be stored within the inner shaft <b>25</b>. This is achieved by incorporating elements <b>24</b> with high compression modulus. These elements are contained within a material matrix <b>24</b>A that further enhances the compression modulus of the inner shaft <b>25</b>. The inclusion of the above high compression elements allows for a low profile outer shaft. The low wall thickness inner shaft will therefore also have low flexural stiffness, good flexibility and trackability. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is a high compression modulus steel wire braid <b>24</b> contained within a polymeric matrix <b>24</b>A. The inner lumen of the shaft <b>25</b> is made of a low friction (PTFE) material layer <b>24</b>B. The outer surface of the shaft <b>25</b> is also provided with a low friction (FEP) material layer <b>24</b>C. The layers <b>24</b> B and <b>24</b>C minimise the frictional strain energy incurred during delivery and deployment. Due to the combination of the above inner and outer shaft <b>2</b>,<b>25</b> the amount of strain energy that can be stored within the system during use is very low. Due to the low strain energy build up within the system a precise, controlled, low force deployment is achieved even in difficult vessel paths. </p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0210"> In this case, the embolic protection device <b>1</b> comprises a collapsible filter element <b>40</b> for delivery through a vascular system of a patient and deployment at a desired location in the vascular system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> illustrate the filter element <b>40</b> in detail. </p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0211"> The filter element <b>40</b> comprises a collapsible filter body <b>41</b>, a collapsible filter support frame <b>42</b> contacting the filter body <b>41</b>, and an inner elongate sleeve <b>43</b> to which both the filter body <b>41</b> and the frame <b>42</b> are mounted. A proximal end <b>44</b> of the filter body <b>41</b> and a proximal end <b>45</b> of the frame <b>42</b> are both fixedly attached to a proximal end <b>46</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b>, in this case by means of an adhesive bond. A distal end <b>47</b> of the filter body <b>41</b> and a distal end <b>48</b> of the frame <b>42</b> are free to slide over a distal end <b>49</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0212"> The filter body <b>41</b> has a proximal inlet end and a distal outlet end. The inlet end of the filter body <b>41</b> has one or more, in this case two, large inlet openings <b>50</b>, and the outlet end has a plurality of, in this case approximately three hundred, small outlet openings <b>51</b> sized to allow through passage of blood but to retain undesired embolic material within the filter body <b>41</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0213"> The filter support frame <b>42</b> is movable between a collapsed position for movement of the filter element <b>40</b> through a vascular system and an extended outwardly projecting position to support the filter body <b>41</b> in an expanded position. The frame <b>42</b> has a distal section <b>52</b>, an intermediate section <b>53</b> for urging the filter body <b>41</b> in the expanded position into apposition with a vascular vessel wall, and a proximal section <b>54</b> extending proximally and radially inwardly of the intermediate section <b>53</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0214"> At least part of the proximal section <b>54</b> of the frame is spaced distally of the inlet openings <b>50</b> in the filter body <b>41</b> to accommodate inflow of embolic material through the inlets <b>50</b> and into the expanded filter body <b>41</b>. The filter body <b>41</b> comprises one or more, in this case two, linking webs <b>55</b> between adjacent inlets <b>50</b>, and a part of the proximal section <b>54</b> of the frame extends radially inwardly in alignment with the webs <b>55</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, to avoid occluding the inlets <b>50</b> to the filter body <b>41</b> when the filter body <b>41</b> is in the expanded position. In this manner the possibility of embolic material becoming caught or hung-up on the proximal section <b>54</b> of the frame as the embolic material flows distally through the inlet openings <b>50</b> is minimised. </p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0215"> The proximal section <b>54</b> of the frame comprises one or more frame elements, in this case four. At least one frame element, in this case two, provides the part of the proximal section <b>54</b> which is spaced distally of the inlets <b>50</b>, and at least one frame element, in this case two, provides the part of the proximal section <b>54</b> extending radially inwardly in alignment with the webs <b>55</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0216"> The proximal section of the frame runs generally parallel with a vessel wall and then turns radially inwards. The proximal arm(s) of the frame have a section that is displaced distally. The advantage of this displacement is that it creates an inlet path which is offset and therefore larger. </p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0217"> The frame elements are preferably of a shape memory material, such as Nitinol, or of a superelastic material, and may have a plating of gold or other dense material around the Nitinol. The frame elements facilitate movement of the frame <b>42</b> between the collapsed position and the extended outwardly projecting position. The frame <b>42</b> is electropolished. </p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0218"> The sleeve <b>43</b> defines a lumen <b>56</b> extending therethrough for exchange of the filter element <b>40</b> over the guidewire <b>99</b>. The distal end <b>49</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b> is engageable with a stop such as a stop on the guidewire <b>99</b>. This is particularly useful for retrieval of the filter element <b>40</b> from a vascular system. The sleeve <b>43</b> is typically of polyimide. </p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0219"> The sleeve <b>43</b> acts as a barrier between the lumen <b>56</b> through which a guidewire may be exchanged, and the internal annular volume of the filter body <b>41</b> within which embolic material is retained. In particular, the proximal end <b>46</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b> is proximal of the inlets <b>50</b>, and the distal end <b>49</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b> is distal of the small outlets <b>51</b>. This ensures that all blood flows into the filter body <b>41</b> through the inlets <b>50</b>, through the filter body <b>41</b> and out of the filter body <b>41</b> through the small outlets <b>51</b> which are sized to retain undesired embolic material within the filter body <b>41</b>. The sleeve <b>43</b> prevents escape of any embolic material from the filter body <b>41</b> into the lumen <b>56</b>, for example, during exchange of medical devices over a guidewire received within the lumen <b>56</b>, or during retrieval of the filter element <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0220"> A guide olive <b>57</b> is provided for atraumatic delivery of the filter element <b>40</b> through a vascular system, the guide olive <b>57</b> forms an extension of the distal end <b>47</b> of the filter body <b>41</b> and tapering distally inwardly for a smooth transition profile. In this case, the guide olive <b>57</b> is integral with the filter body <b>41</b> and is of the material Pellethane. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the guide olive <b>57</b> extends distally of the distal end <b>49</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0221"> In use, the region of a vasculature in which the filter element <b>40</b> is deployed is substantially straight for a length at least equal to the longitudinal length of the filter element <b>40</b> to ensure apposition of the filter body <b>41</b> with the vasculature wall. By directly mounting the guide olive <b>57</b> at the distal end <b>47</b> of the filter body <b>41</b>, the overall longitudinal length of the filter element <b>40</b> is reduced to define a longitudinally compact filter element <b>40</b>. Thus, the user has greater freedom when choosing a site in a vasculature to deploy the filter element <b>40</b> because the length of the vasculature which is required to be straight is correspondingly reduced. </p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0222"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the distal end <b>48</b> of the frame <b>42</b> acts to reinforce the proximal section of the guide olive <b>57</b> and prevents flaring of the sleeve <b>43</b>. The guide olive <b>57</b> has a soft distal tip <b>58</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0223"> Two gold marker bands <b>59</b>, <b>60</b> are provided mounted to the sleeve <b>43</b>. One marker band <b>59</b> is fixedly attached to the olive <b>51</b> and one marker band <b>60</b> is fixedly attached to the proximal end <b>45</b> of the frame <b>42</b>. The marker bands <b>59</b>, <b>60</b> assist in visualisation of the filter element <b>40</b> during an interventional procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0224"> A transition element <b>61</b> is fixedly mounted to the proximal end <b>46</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b>, in this case by means of an adhesive bond. The transition element <b>61</b> is sized to fit made the lumen of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> to provide a smooth stiffness transition and prevent kinking. </p>

The pushing device <b>8</b> comprises a handle <b>70</b> for gripping the pushing device <b>8</b> and an elongate stem in this case provided by a wire <b>71</b>, extending from the handle <b>70</b> for threading through the lumen <b>56</b> of the filter element <b>40</b>. The wire <b>71</b> defines a distal stop <b>72</b> for releasably engaging with the distal end <b>49</b> of the sleeve <b>43</b> of the filter element <b>40</b> to push the filter element <b>40</b> into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0226"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> the distal stop <b>72</b> is provided by an end <b>74</b> of an outer hypotube <b>73</b> which extends from the handle <b>70</b> partially along the wire <b>71</b>. The free end <b>74</b> of the hypotube <b>73</b> forms a step from the small diameter wire <b>71</b> proximal of the step to the larger diameter hypotube <b>73</b> distal of the step. The small diameter is preferably approximately 0.014&#x2033; (0.3556 mm), and the large diameter is preferably approximately 0.018&#x2033; (0.4572 mm). The hypotube <b>73</b> may be attached to the wire <b>71</b> by any suitable means, such as an adhesive means, or a mechanical keying means, or by brazing, or soldering, or welding, or by any other suitable means. </p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0227"> The wire <b>71</b> may have a low friction coating, for example of polytetrafluoroethylene, for ease of threading of the wire <b>71</b> through the filter element <b>40</b>. The handle <b>70</b> facilitates ease of gripping and of use of the pushing device <b>8</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0228"> It will be appreciated that the distal stop <b>72</b> may be provided integral with the wire <b>71</b>, for example by machining a step in the wire <b>71</b>. </p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0232"> The cone angle of the bore is chosen from an angle in the range of between 15&#xb0; and 65&#xb0;, preferably between 35&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;. </p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0233"> The loading tube <b>83</b> is preferably formed from polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), and is mounted on a metal spigot <b>84</b>, typically a grit blasted hypotube, by a combination of a polyolefin shrink tube bond and an adhesive bond.

<p id="p-0189" num="0235"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 24</figref> to <b>29</b>, the tray <b>5</b> will now be described in more detail. The tray includes integral projections <b>9</b> that extend into various recesses. The projections <b>9</b> releasably support the loading device <b>7</b> in co-operative alignment with the delivery catheter <b>2</b> before loading and during the loading procedure. In particular, the loading device <b>7</b> is supported with the loading tube <b>83</b> extending proximally into the reception space of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> before loading and during the loading procedure. In addition, the projections <b>9</b> on the channel wall are configured to releasably support the pushing device <b>8</b> in a position in which the distal stop <b>72</b> does not engage the filter element <b>40</b> before the loading procedure commences. </p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0237"> A liquid retaining bath <b>90</b> is provided by recesses in the tray <b>5</b>, the bath <b>90</b> having a depth sufficient to accommodate in a totally submerged state the reception space of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the filter element <b>40</b> for submerged loading of the filter element <b>40</b> through the loading device <b>7</b> and into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the channel <b>6</b> communicates with the bath <b>90</b>, and a ramp is provided at an end of the channel <b>6</b> communicating with the bath <b>90</b> to direct the reception space downwards towards the bottom of the bath <b>90</b> but supporting the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> above the bottom of the bath <b>90</b> by means of a step. </p>

When the pushing device <b>8</b> is further pushed proximally, this causes the inner catheter <b>25</b> to move proximally and with it the delivery catheter <b>2</b> due to the engagement of the O-ring shoulder <b>30</b> with the handle <b>14</b>. In this manner, the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, the inner catheter <b>25</b> and the collapsed filter element <b>40</b> are all moved together proximally away from the loading device <b>7</b>, and thereby the loaded catheter assembly is disassociated from the loading device <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). </p>

<p id="p-0215" num="0261"> The delivery catheter <b>2</b> is retracted while maintaining the position of the inner catheter <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>).

Thus, the user has more freedom to carry out a treatment procedure on the stenosed region <b>111</b> without the risk of intimal abrasion, or of the deployed filter element <b>40</b> becoming dislodged or in some other way creating a potential flow path for embolic material around the filter element <b>40</b>. </p>

<p id="p-0235" num="0281"> The embolic protection system of the invention offers considerable clinical advantages. The arrangement allows a clinician to select a suitable guidewire from a range of such guidewires. This provides enhanced flexibility by ensuring that filter performance can be optimised. The embolic protection device is not dedicated to a particular guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0282"> Because the embolic protection device is not attached to the guidewire, the guidewire which is first advanced through a vasculature can have a low profile and be tailored to the proposed procedure or vasculature. Consequently, the guidewire can easily navigate narrow and tortuous regions of the vasculature. </p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0283"> Thus, a clinician may readily select a particular type of guidewire which provides the appropriate flexibility and performance required for a particular vascular procedure being performed. The system also facilitates the safe crossing of a lesion not only in a first lesion. </p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0284"> Another important advantage is that because the embolic protection device is not attached to the guidewire, if the embolic protection device is under-sized with respect to the region of the treatment site it is free to be carried by blood flow to a distal narrowed section of the vasculature at which the embolic protection device effectively achieves apposition with the vessel wall. This ensures that all blood flow with entrained embolic material passes through the embolic protection device. The guidewire distal stop prevents movement of the embolic protection device distally off the guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0285"> The possibility of successfully achieving filter deployment at the intended site is significantly improved due to: 
<ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0024" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0024-0001" num="0286"> Initial crossing with a bare guidewire is easier as a bare guidewire has an extremely low profile, is highly trackable and highly pushable. </li>
        <li id="ul0024-0002" num="0287"> Attempted crossing with a bare guidewire presents a very low risk of an embolic event due to its low profile, and atraumatic tip. </li>
        <li id="ul0024-0003" num="0288"> Once the bare wire is across the lesion, crossing with the filter delivery system is simplified. Advancing the tip of the guidewire and positioning it in the distal vasculature provides additional support to the filter delivery catheter. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0289"> The possibility of successfully delivering other catheters and interventional devices to the lesion area is enhanced because of the independent movement compatibility of the deployed filter and guidewire. The guidewire tip can be advanced into the distal vasculature to provide anchorage during the advancement of additional catheters and devices. The filter position is maintained by visual apposition and blood flow forces. In this configuration the wire provides extra support to the catheter or interventional device being advanced. This increases the possibility of delivering the catheter to the intended location and minimises the possibility of an uncontrolled proximal movement of the guidewire/filter. This uncontrolled proximal movement occurs when the guidewire has insufficient support to guide an advancing catheter, through a tortuous path. With fixed wire systems the filter may be quickly withdrawn back into the lesion area with increased risk of an embolic event or stent dislodgement. The design of this invention substantially eliminates some of these serious clinical risks. </p>

In this case, the guidewire <b>160</b> does not comprise a step from a small diameter portion to a large diameter portion. </p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0307"> FIGS. <b>71</b> to <b>74</b> illustrate the deployment of an embolic protection device of the embolic protection system which has been delivered over the guidewire <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>. The delivery and deployment procedure is similar to that described above with reference, in particular to FIGS. <b>36</b> to <b>41</b>. In this case, however, a tapered ring <b>161</b> is provided slidably mounted on the guidewire <b>160</b> between the distal end <b>27</b> of the inner stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> and a proximal end <b>163</b> of the embolic protection device. </p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0308"> To deploy the embolic protection device at a desired location in the vasculature <b>110</b>, the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is retracted while maintaining the position of the inner catheter <b>25</b>. The retraction of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> initially draws the embolic protection device proximally due to the frictional force acting between the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the embolic protection device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>). As the embolic protection device is initially drawn proximally it abuts the tapered ring and pushes the tapered ring <b>161</b> proximally until the tapered ring <b>161</b> abuts the distal end <b>27</b> of the inner stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>). Further retraction of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> while maintaining the position of the inner catheter <b>25</b> causes the embolic protection device and the tapered ring <b>161</b> to slide relative to one another along a tapered plane of contact <b>162</b>. This movement exerts an inward force on the tapered ring <b>161</b> to lockingly engage the tapered ring <b>161</b> to the guidewire <b>160</b>. In this way the embolic protection device is taper-locked to the guidewire <b>160</b> by means of an interference fit between the embolic protection device and the tapered ring <b>161</b>, and by means of an interference fit between the tapered ring <b>161</b> and the guidewire <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>). The delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the inner catheter <b>25</b> may then be withdrawn from the vasculature <b>110</b> to leave the deployed embolic protection device engaged to the bare guidewire <b>160</b> in place in the vasculature <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0309"> The embolic protection device is retrieved in a manner similar to that described previously with reference to FIGS. <b>44</b> to <b>47</b>. The retrieval catheter <b>3</b> is advanced over the guidewire <b>160</b> until the retrieval catheter <b>3</b> is proximally adjacent the deployed embolic protection device. The retrieval catheter <b>3</b> is then further advanced while maintaining the position of the guidewire <b>160</b> to collapse and retrieve the embolic protection device into the retrieval catheter <b>3</b>. Because the embolic protection device is taper-locked to the guidewire <b>160</b> it is not necessary to provide a distal stop on the guidewire <b>160</b> for abutment with the embolic protection device. The taper-lock ensures no movement of the deployed embolic protection device distally relative to the guidewire <b>160</b> is possible, and thus facilitates retrieval of the embolic protection device into the retrieval catheter <b>3</b>. The retrieved embolic protection device is then withdrawn from the vasculature <b>110</b> by withdrawing the retrieval catheter <b>3</b> and the guidewire <b>160</b> together. </p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0310"> Referring to FIGS. <b>75</b> to <b>77</b> there is illustrated an embolic protection system which is similar to the embolic protection system described above with reference to FIGS. <b>71</b> to <b>74</b>, and similar elements are assigned the same reference numerals in FIGS. <b>75</b> to <b>77</b>. In this case the embolic protection system comprises two tethers <b>170</b> with inwardly arcing hooks <b>172</b> at distal ends of the tethers <b>170</b>, the tethers <b>170</b> extending between the inner catheter <b>25</b> and the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. The embolic protection device comprises co-operating recesses <b>171</b> in the proximal end <b>163</b> of the embolic protection device for receiving the tether hooks <b>172</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0311"> Deployment of the embolic protection device proceeds in a manner similar to that described above with reference to FIGS. <b>71</b> to <b>74</b>. During retraction of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, the tethers <b>170</b> are also retracted to ensure that the embolic protection device is drawn proximally to effect a secure taper-lock of the embolic protection device to the guidewire <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>). The tethers <b>170</b> act in addition to the frictional force between the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the embolic protection device to draw the embolic protection device proximally. </p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0312"> After deployment and taper-locking of the embolic protection device, the hooks <b>172</b> of the tethers <b>170</b> are unclipped by advancing the inner catheter <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76 and 77</figref>). The distal end <b>27</b> of the inner stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> engages the hooks <b>172</b> and levers the hooks <b>172</b> outwardly disengaging the hooks <b>172</b> from the co-operating recesses <b>171</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>). The tethers <b>170</b> and the inner catheter <b>25</b> are then withdrawn from the vasculature <b>110</b> to leave the deployed embolic protection device in place in the vasculature <b>110</b> taper-locked to the bare guidewire <b>160</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0313"> Referring to FIGS. <b>78</b> to <b>81</b> there is illustrated a rapid exchange embolic protection system which is similar to the embolic protection systems of FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>77</b>, and similar elements are assigned the same reference numerals in FIGS. <b>78</b> to <b>81</b>. In this case, the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> comprises an elongate slit <b>180</b> and the inner stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> comprises a rapid exchange aperture <b>181</b> for passage of a guidewire <b>182</b> through the aperture <b>181</b> and the slit <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0314"> The embolic protection device is delivered to a desired location in the vasculature <b>110</b> distally of the stenosed region <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>) in a manner similar to that described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. The embolic protection device is deployed by retracting the delivery catheter <b>2</b> while maintaining the position of the inner catheter <b>25</b> (FIGS. <b>79</b> to <b>81</b>), which facilitates deployment of the embolic protection device in a manner similar to that described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0315"> The slit <b>180</b> in the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is aligned with the rapid exchange aperture <b>181</b> in the stem <b>28</b> of the inner catheter <b>25</b> to prevent occlusion of the rapid exchange aperture <b>181</b> during the relative movement of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the inner catheter <b>25</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0316"> The aperture <b>181</b> provided in a sidewall of inner stem <b>28</b> of inner catheter is preferably located at a position along the length of the inner catheter which is spaced a relatively longer distance from the proximal end of the catheter than from the distal end of the catheter. Additionally, delivery catheter <b>2</b> desirably incorporates an elongate slit <b>180</b> which is located adjacent the distal end the catheter and co-operates with aperture <b>181</b> and the guide wire <b>182</b> which exits therethrough to facilitate a rapid exchange of the catheter and filter assembly over the guide wire, thereby promoting ease of exchange without the necessity of utilising exchange wires or extension wires. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78-81</figref>, this arrangement permits use of rapid exchange wire techniques as well as controlled deployment and retrieval of the filter at the delivery pod portion <b>13</b> located at the distal end of delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0317"> This is advantageous in that it facilitates single operator use. A shorter guidewire may be used than for conventional systems making the device less cumbersome. </p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0318"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> there is illustrated another embolic protection system <b>200</b> according to the invention. The system is similar to these described above and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals. In this case the guidewire <b>99</b> includes a proximal stop provided by a step <b>201</b> and the filter has a proximal engagement element provided by integral projections <b>202</b> which extend radially inwardly. The projections <b>202</b> are configured to pass over the proximal step <b>201</b> when the filter element is being moved distally over the guidewire <b>99</b> for deployment but are prevented from moving proximally over the proximal step <b>201</b>. Thus, the filter element, on deployment can move between the proximal and distal stops on the guidewire. The arrangement may allow the filter to be retrieved over the proximal step <b>202</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0319"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref> there is illustrated a system <b>205</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals. In this case the proximal step on the guidewire is provided by a proximally tapering element <b>206</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0320"> The embolic protection device is not restricted to use with a particular guidewire because it is not attached or engaged with the guidewire in any way as it is advanced over the guidewire. This is a highly advantageous arrangement. If the guidewire proves unsuitable for some reason, for example because it is too large or not trackable enough to access a desired site in a vascular system, the guidewire may be replaced with a more suitable guidewire, for example a guidewire with greater flexibility. However, because the embolic protection device is independent of the guidewire it may be used with any suitable guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0321"> The invention gives greater freedom to a user by providing a choice of guidewires to suit a patient anatomy without requiring the user to select the embolic protection device to be used with the guidewire until after successful crossing of a lesion with the guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0322"> Numerous vascular catheter functions are facilitated by the invention, such as: </p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000"> (i) Permits Dye Injections: </p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0323"> After performing a therapeutic procedure (e.g. angioplasty or atherectomy), the embolic protection device can be retrieved if desired, in order to inject dye (over the remaining guidewire), such that minimal obstruction or interference occurs with the subsequent dye flow measurements. Alternatively, the wire can also be safely partially-retracted &#x201c;behind&#x201d; or &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; of the treated area, prior to performing the dye injection. </p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000"> (ii) Delivery of Lytic Agents: </p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0324"> Depending upon therapeutic needs, lytic agents can be site-specifically delivered to a region of interest, either with the embolic protection device deployed, or with the embolic protection device retrieved, if desired. </p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000"> (iii) Facilitates Stent Procedures: </p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0325"> Assuming appropriate design considerations have been incorporated, the retrieval sheath can also facilitate safe removal of the embolic protection device following a stenting procedure. For example, after deployment of an intravascular stent, the process of removing the embolic protection device favours certain sheath designs, such as a tapered distal tip. Specifically, the distal tip of the sheath needs to permit easy crossing of the stent in a manner which will not catch up or &#x201c;snag&#x201d; at the proximal edge of the implanted stent, nor along any inwardly-projecting surface of the interior of the implanted stent, as the sheath is being introduced. More specifically, the distal region of the retrieval sheath is also preferably formed of a material which permits radial expansion at the distal tip in order to accommodate retrieval of the embolic protection device. </p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000"> (iv) Facilitates Guidewire Replacements: </p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0326"> Because this embolic protection system accommodates barewire introduction, it is possible to replace a guidewire during a procedure, if desired. For example, during treatment of two or more, distally spaced-apart lesions, it may become necessary to replace the initial guidewire during the procedure with another guidewire offering improved steering or distal flexibility. The present invention might support such guidewire replacements as follows. First, the embolic protection device is retrieved into the retrieval sheath (which has already crossed the first lesion area). Then the wire can be withdrawn (or alternatively, the wire and embolic protection device together can be withdrawn), while the sheath remains across the lesion. Subsequently, a replacement guidewire can be introduced through the sheath lumen to the area of interest. </p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0327"> A number of engagement means between the embolic protection device and the guidewire are described above which ensure that the embolic protection device is anchored or tethered while the retrieval sheath is advanced over the embolic protection device. It is also envisaged that an engagement means may be provided between the embolic protection device and the retrieval sheath after the filter is retrieved, to ensure that there is a positive engagement between the embolic protection device and the sheath. For example, frictional engagement means may be provided on one or both of the embolic protection device and sheath. For example, projections, rings, or the like may be provided on the inner surface of the retrieval sheath adjacent the distal end thereof to provide a frictional fit with the retrieved embolic protection device. Typical arrangements <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> of this type are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84 and 85</figref>. The frictional engagement may be provided by projections <b>225</b> which may be of any type including continuous, discontinuous, radially and/or longitudinally extending. </p>
