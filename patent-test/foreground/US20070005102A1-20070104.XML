<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to a device and a method for loading an embolic protection filter into a catheter. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">STATEMENTS OF INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> According to the invention there is provided a device for loading an embolic protection filter into a catheter, the device comprising: 
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004"> an engagement member for engaging an embolic protection filter to load the embolic protection filter into a catheter; and </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005"> a controller to control the loading force exerted on the embolic protection filter during loading into the catheter. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006"> By controlling the loading force exerted, the controller prevents damage being inadvertently caused during loading of the filter. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007"> The controller prevents the user inadvertently applying an excessive loading force to the embolic protection filter, for example when the filter is fully loaded into the catheter. If this were to occur, this extra loading force could lead to damage to the filter and/or to the catheter, and/or could lead to the loaded filter being incorrectly positioned in the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008"> In one embodiment of the invention the controller is provided by a first part of the device being movable relative to a second part of the device. The first part of the device may be movable relative to the second part of the device between an extended configuration and a retracted configuration. The device may be biased towards the extended configuration. The device may comprise a biasing member to bias the device towards the extended configuration. The biasing member may comprise a coiled spring. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009"> In another embodiment the first part of the device comprises a handle part. The second part of the device may comprise the engagement member. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010"> In a further embodiment the engagement member comprises a pusher for engaging an embolic protection filter to push the embolic protection filter into a catheter. The engagement member may comprise a puller for engaging an embolic protection filter to pull the embolic protection filter into a catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011"> The engagement member may be provided on an elongate stem. The engagement member may be integral with the stem. The engagement member may comprise a step in the stem from a small diameter portion to a large diameter portion. The stem may comprise a wire. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012"> In another aspect the invention provides a method of loading an embolic protection filter into a catheter, the method comprising the steps of: 
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013"> engaging the embolic protection filter; and </li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014"> loading the embolic protection filter into the catheter, the loading force exerted on the embolic protection filter being automatically controlled during loading. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015"> In one embodiment loading of the embolic protection filter into the catheter causes a first part of a controller to move relative to a second part of the controller. The embolic protection filter may be loaded into the catheter by pushing the embolic protection filter into the catheter. The embolic protection filter may be loaded into the catheter by pulling the embolic protection filter into the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016"> In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for loading an embolic protection filter into a catheter, the device comprising: 
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0017"> a loading member for collapsing an embolic protection filter; </li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0018"> an outlet of the loading member, being configured to be aligned with an inlet of a catheter extending along at least part of an exterior surface of the catheter for loading of the collapsed embolic protection filter into the catheter. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019"> Because the outlet of the loading member extends along the exterior surface of the catheter, this ensures that, when the embolic protection filter is loaded, the loaded catheter can be quickly and simply disassociated from the loading member, and inserted into the vasculature of a patient. In particular the loaded catheter may be quickly withdrawn from the catheter without the risk that the embolic protection filter will remain in the loading member. In addition during loading of the embolic protection filter, it is not necessary to move the catheter relative to the loading member to effect a complete loading of the filter into the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020"> Furthermore the wall space and profile of the catheter assembly may be minimised by arranging the outlet of the loading member along the exterior of the catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021"> In one embodiment the loading member has a passageway extending therethrough, through which an embolic protection filter may be passed to collapse the embolic protection filter. The outlet of the loading member may comprise an outlet of the passageway. An inlet of the passageway may have a larger cross-sectional area than the outlet of the passageway. The passageway may be at least partially funnel-shaped. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022"> In another embodiment the loading member comprises a tubular part extendable along part of an exterior surface of a catheter, the outlet of the loading member being provided at an end of the tubular part. The passageway may extend through the tubular part in a substantially cylindrical shape. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023"> In another embodiment the embolic protection system includes loading means for loading the filter into the delivery catheter. Ideally the loading means comprises a funnel having a narrowed portion disposed at the distal end of the delivery catheter and an enlarged portion for receiving a proximal portion of the filter in the expanded configuration, the filter being progressively collapsed as it is moved through the funnel for loading into the delivery catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024"> The invention also provides in another aspect a method of loading an embolic protection filter into a catheter, the method comprising the steps of: 
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">

<heading level="2" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0073"> Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>17</b> thereof, there is illustrated a transvascular embolic protection system for safely capturing and retaining embolic material released during an interventional procedure while maintaining blood flow. </p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0074"> The embolic protection system comprises an embolic protection device <b>1</b> and a delivery catheter <b>2</b> for delivery of the embolic protection device <b>1</b> to a desired location in the vascular system. The device <b>1</b> is collapsible from an expanded deployed configuration to a retracted delivery configuration. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> has a pod <b>13</b> at the distal end to define a reception space for the embolic protection device <b>1</b> in the collapsed delivery configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0075"> In use, the embolic protection device <b>1</b> is loaded into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> which is delivered over a pre-positioned guidewire. At a desired location, the embolic protection device <b>1</b> is deployed from within the pod <b>13</b>. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> is then withdrawn leaving a bare guidewire over which various devices such as a dilation balloon and/or a stent can be advanced to the treatment site. Embolic material dislodged during the treatment procedure(s) is collected in the embolic protection device <b>1</b>. After treatment, the device <b>1</b> may be retrieved into a retrieval catheter. The guidewire may be left in place for further catheter advancements or may be withdrawn with or subsequent to the withdrawal of the retrieval catheter. </p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0076"> Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pack <b>4</b> is provided to safely store and prepare the embolic protection system for use. The pack <b>4</b> comprises a vacuum-formed tray <b>5</b>, typically of PETG. The tray <b>5</b> has a channel <b>6</b> extending in a looped configuration around the tray <b>5</b> for receiving the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> has a distal end <b>12</b>. The pod <b>13</b> is provided at the distal end <b>12</b> of the inner catheter <b>2</b>. A loading device <b>7</b> according to the invention, which in this case is in the form of a funnel piece, is mounted in the tray <b>5</b> adjacent to and extending along an exterior surface of the pod <b>13</b>. The embolic protection device <b>1</b> is mounted in its expanded configuration in a well <b>90</b> in the tray <b>5</b>. A pushing device <b>8</b> according to the invention for loading the collapsible embolic protection device <b>1</b> into the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is mounted in the tray <b>5</b> adjacent to the embolic protection device <b>1</b>. The pushing device <b>8</b> is used to push the embolic protection device <b>1</b> through the loading device <b>7</b> and into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> in the collapsed configuration. The delivery catheter <b>2</b> is now ready for advancement over a guidewire. </p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0077"> Referring now to FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b>, the pushing device <b>8</b> according to the invention for loading the collapsible filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is illustrated. The pushing device <b>8</b> comprises a handle <b>70</b> for gripping the pushing device <b>8</b> and an elongate stem in this case provided by a wire <b>71</b>, extending from the handle <b>70</b> for threading through the filter element. The wire <b>71</b> defines an engagement member, in this case provided in the form of a distal stop <b>72</b>, for releasably engaging with the distal end of a sleeve of a filter element to push the filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0078"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the distal stop <b>72</b> is provided by an end <b>74</b> of an outer hypotube <b>73</b> which extends from the handle <b>70</b> partially along the wire <b>71</b>. The free end <b>74</b> of the hypotube <b>73</b> forms a step from the small diameter wire <b>71</b> proximal of the step to the larger diameter hypotube <b>73</b> distal of the step. The small diameter is preferably approximately 0.014&#x2033; (0.3556 mm), and the large diameter is preferably approximately 0.018&#x2033; (0.4572 mm). The hypotube <b>73</b> may be attached to the wire <b>71</b> by any suitable means, such as an adhesive means, or a mechanical keying means, or by brazing, or soldering, or welding, or by any other suitable means. </p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0079"> As illustrated in FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b>, the handle <b>70</b> is movable relative to the wire <b>71</b> between an extended configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a retracted configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A coiled spring <b>200</b> is housed within the handle <b>70</b> bearing against the wire <b>71</b> to bias the pushing device <b>8</b> towards the extended configuration. </p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0080"> Upon engagement of the distal stop <b>72</b> with the filter element and pushing of the filter element, the engagement pushing force applied by the wire <b>71</b> on the filter element is balanced by an equal and opposite force exerted by the filter element on the wire <b>71</b>. As the pushing force is increased to load the filter element, the opposite force gradually overcomes the biasing force of the spring <b>200</b>, causing the spring <b>200</b> to compress and thereby moving the pushing device <b>8</b> from the extended configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the retracted configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0081"> The stiffness of the spring <b>200</b> is selected to enable a safe loading force to be applied to load the filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. However if it is attempted to apply an excessive loading force the spring <b>200</b> compresses, thus preventing excessive loads being transferred to the system. Thus the movement of the handle <b>70</b> relative to the wire <b>71</b> acts as a controller to control the loading force exerted on the filter element during loading into the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. In this way, the device <b>8</b> allows a safe loading force to be applied to the system, and prevents damage being inadvertently caused due to excessive loading forces. </p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0082"> The wire <b>71</b> may have a low friction coating, for example of polytetrafluoroethylene, for ease of threading of the wire <b>71</b> through the filter element. The handle <b>70</b> facilitates ease of gripping and of use of the pushing device <b>8</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0083"> It will be appreciated that the distal stop <b>72</b> may be provided integral with the wire <b>71</b>, for example by machining a step in the wire <b>71</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0084"> It will further be appreciated that the large diameter portion distal of the step may be only a locally defined feature on the wire <b>71</b> that does not extend distally to the handle <b>70</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0085"> It will be appreciated that the filter element may alternatively be pulled into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> using a suitable pulling device. </p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0086"> The loading device <b>7</b> for loading the filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> is illustrated in detail in FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b>. The loading device <b>7</b> defines a funnel having an inlet end <b>80</b> and an outlet end <b>81</b>, the inlet end <b>80</b> defining a larger cross-sectional area than the outlet end <b>81</b>, and the outlet end <b>81</b> being configured for co-operative alignment with the inlet of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, and for extending along the exterior surface of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0087"> The loading device <b>7</b> has means for collapsing the filter element by radially compressing the filter element from the extended outwardly projecting position to the collapsed position. In this case, the loading device <b>7</b> comprises a main support <b>82</b> having a funnel-shaped bore formed from a frusto-conical filter element receiving portion terminating and a cylindrical portion formed by a thin walled loading tube <b>83</b> projecting from the main support <b>82</b> for positioning extending along the exterior surface of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. A passageway is provided through the main support <b>82</b> and through the loading tube <b>83</b>. By passing the filter element through the passageway, the filter element is collapsed. </p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0088"> The cone angle of the bore is chosen from an angle in the range of between 15&#xb0; and 65&#xb0;, preferably between 35&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;. </p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0089"> The loading tube <b>83</b> is preferably formed from polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), and is mounted on a metal spigot, typically a grit blasted hypotube, by a combination of a polyolefin shrink tube bond and an adhesive bond. The metal spigot is adhesively fixed to the main support <b>82</b> which is formed from &#x201c;Perspex&#x201d; or a similar material. The loading tube <b>83</b> may be coated with a lubricant. </p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0090"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref> to <b>11</b>, the tray <b>5</b> will now be described in further detail. The tray <b>5</b> includes integral projections <b>9</b> that extend into various recesses. The projections <b>9</b> releasably support the loading device <b>7</b> in co-operative alignment with the delivery catheter <b>2</b> before loading and during the loading procedure. In particular, the loading device <b>7</b> is supported with the loading tube <b>83</b> extending proximally along an exterior surface of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> before loading and during the loading procedure. In addition, the projections <b>9</b> on the channel wall are configured to releasably support the pushing device <b>8</b> in a position in which the distal stop <b>72</b> does not engage the filter element before the loading procedure commences. </p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0091"> A liquid retaining bath <b>90</b> is provided by a recess in the tray <b>5</b>, the bath <b>90</b> having a depth sufficient to accommodate in a totally submerged state the reception space of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> and the filter element for submerged loading of the filter element through the loading device <b>7</b> and into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the channel <b>6</b> communicates with the bath <b>90</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0092"> The components of the embolic protection system are placed in the pack <b>4</b> in the following manner. The loading device <b>7</b> is snapped into place in the channel <b>6</b>, with the projections <b>9</b> releasably supporting the loading device <b>7</b> in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0093"> The catheter <b>2</b> is looped through the channel <b>6</b> and held in place so that the loading tube <b>83</b> of the loading device <b>7</b> extends proximally along the exterior surface of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, and the outlet end <b>81</b> of the loading tube <b>83</b> is aligned with the inlet of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0094"> The wire <b>71</b> of the pushing device <b>8</b> is then threaded through the filter element, a proximal end of the wire <b>71</b> is inserted through the loading device <b>7</b> and extended partially through the catheter <b>2</b>. The handle <b>70</b> is snapped into place in the channel <b>6</b> by the projections <b>9</b>. In this configuration the filter element is slidable over the wire <b>71</b> but is normally positioned within the bath <b>90</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The projections <b>9</b> retain the pushing device <b>8</b> in a position in which the distal stop <b>72</b> is spaced distally of the bath <b>90</b>, and so the distal stop <b>72</b> does not engage the filter element in this storage configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0095"> In this storage configuration the filter element is in the expanded configuration. The assembled pack <b>4</b> of the invention may be safely stored for long periods in a packaged configuration without risk of filter element material deformation, such as material creep. The pack <b>4</b> is placed in a porch and sealed. </p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0096"> When the assembled pack <b>4</b> is required for use, the seal is broken, and the pack <b>4</b> is removed. </p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0097"> The filter element is now ready for loading into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. The pushing device <b>8</b> is rotated through 90&#xb0; in a &#x201c;bolt-action&#x201d; to release the handle <b>70</b> from the snap-fit retaining projections <b>9</b> in the tray <b>5</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. In this configuration the pushing device <b>8</b> is still retained in the tray <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The pushing device <b>8</b> is now free to slide proximally in the channel <b>6</b>, until the distal stop <b>72</b> engages with the distal end of the sleeve of the filter element (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Continued pushing of the pushing device <b>8</b> will push the filter element <b>40</b> proximally towards the loading device <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), through the loading device <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), thereby collapsing the filter element from the extended outwardly projecting position to the collapsed position, and loading the filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0098"> As the filter element is pushed through the loading device <b>7</b>, the pushing force required to load the filter element gradually increases. This increase in force causes an initial compression of the spring <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. This initial compression is caused as a result of the loading of the filter into the pod <b>13</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0099"> The spring <b>200</b> then compresses further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. This further compression accommodates any dimensional tolerances in the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>(<i>a</i>) illustrates the filter loaded into the pod <b>13</b>, with the pod <b>13</b> being located within the loading tube <b>83</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0100"> When the device <b>8</b> is in this retracted configuration with the spring <b>200</b> fully compressed, the handle <b>70</b> is snapped into position in a second recess by means of retaining projections <b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). This second recess is spaced to ensure that the handle <b>70</b> may only be snapped into position when the spring <b>200</b> is fully compressed. This arrangement therefore guarantees that the correct loading force is applied and the filter is fully loaded. </p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0101"> The loading device <b>7</b> has thus far remained in co-operative alignment with the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. The loaded catheter assembly may be gripped and pulled proximally in the channel <b>6</b> away from the stationary loading device <b>7</b> to withdraw the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b> from within the outlet <b>81</b> of the loading tube <b>83</b>. In this manner, the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, and the collapsed filter element are moved together proximally away from the loading device <b>7</b>, and thereby the loaded catheter assembly is disassociated from the loading device <b>7</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0102"> The loaded catheter assembly is then removed from the channel <b>6</b> leaving the loading device <b>7</b> and the pushing device <b>8</b> behind in the channel <b>6</b>. The loaded delivery catheter <b>2</b> is now ready for insertion into a vascular system of a patient. </p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0103"> The components of the pack <b>4</b> are retained in the correct loading alignments by the tray <b>5</b>. The pushing device <b>8</b> is completely separated from the loaded catheter assembly after completion of the loading procedure. </p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0104"> In addition, the loaded filter element is not attached or associated in any way with the pushing device <b>8</b>. Thus, the user is free to choose any suitable guidewire, as desired, for subsequent delivery of the filter element through a vascular system of a patient. </p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0105"> Shortest catheter length: In one embodiment, when the filter is loaded, the spring has compressed by 20 mm, a 5 N load is placed on the filter. </p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0106"> Longest catheter length: In one embodiment, when the filter is loaded, the spring has compressed by 30 mm, a 6 N load is placed on the filter. </p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0107"> In FIGS. <b>18</b> to <b>23</b> there is illustrated another transvascular embolic protection system, which is similar to the system of FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>17</b>, and similar elements in FIGS. <b>18</b> to <b>23</b> are assigned the same reference numerals. </p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0108"> In this case the embolic protection device <b>1</b> is positioned in the bath <b>90</b>, and the bath <b>90</b> is filled with a flushing liquid, such as a saline solution, to immerse the filter element. The bath <b>90</b> is then sealed with a transparent film <b>201</b>. The assembled pack <b>4</b> may be stored with the saline solution sealed within the bath <b>90</b>, until required for use. </p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0109"> Alternatively the bath <b>90</b> may be open and be filled with saline solution only when required for use. </p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0110"> The engagement member is provided in this case by a syringe plunger <b>202</b>. The plunger <b>202</b> is movable through the bath <b>90</b> to engage the filter element, while maintaining a seal between the plunger <b>202</b> and the walls of the bath <b>90</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0111"> When the assembled pack <b>4</b> is required for use, the plunger <b>202</b> is depressed to push the filter element through the loading device <b>7</b> to collapse the filter element, and to load the filter element into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0112"> Because the saline solution is sealed within the bath <b>90</b>, the step of depressing the plunger <b>202</b> also causes the flushing liquid in the bath <b>90</b> to move around the filter element and through the catheter assembly, and thus automatically flush the filter element and the catheter assembly. </p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0113"> As an alternative to the moveable plunger <b>202</b> of FIGS. <b>18</b> to <b>23</b>, a pre-loaded spring <b>300</b> may be used to load the filter <b>1</b> into the pod <b>13</b> of the delivery catheter <b>2</b>, as illustrated in FIGS. <b>23</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>). A releasable clasp <b>301</b> may be used to hold the spring <b>300</b> in a compressed state until it is desired to load the filter <b>1</b>, at which time the clasp <b>301</b> may be released. </p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0114"> As illustrated in FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>27</b>, a coiled spring <b>210</b> may be provided extending around the plunger <b>202</b>. The plunger <b>202</b> engages the filter element <b>1</b> in the bath <b>90</b>, and the spring <b>210</b> engages a proximal end of the bath <b>90</b>. In this manner the spring force prevents excessive loading forces being applied to the system to minimise the possibility of damage being caused during loading. </p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0115"> The process of loading of the filter <b>1</b> into the pod <b>13</b> of the catheter <b>2</b> is illustrated in FIGS. <b>27</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>27</b>(<i>d</i>). As the plunger <b>202</b> is advanced through the bath <b>90</b>, the spring <b>210</b> is compressed, thus controlling the pushing force exerted on the filter <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0116"> As an alternative to using a plunger, a handle mechanism <b>220</b> may be used to load the filter <b>1</b> into the pod <b>13</b>, as illustrated in FIGS. <b>28</b> to <b>37</b>. The handle mechanism <b>220</b> is movable relative to the pack <b>5</b> to move the filter <b>1</b> relative to the pod <b>13</b> for loading into the pod <b>13</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0117"> A lock mechanism <b>221</b> is provided to lock the handle <b>220</b> in position until it is desired to load the filter <b>1</b>. The lock <b>221</b> may then be opened by rotating the lock mechanism. </p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0118"> A block <b>222</b> of elastomeric material, such as rubber is provided proximally of the pod <b>13</b>. The block <b>222</b> engages against the proximal end of the pod <b>13</b> to prevent movement of the catheter <b>2</b> during loading of the filter <b>1</b>. When the filter <b>1</b> is fully loaded into the pod <b>13</b>, further pushing force applied at the handle mechanism <b>220</b> overcomes the elastomeric force of the block <b>222</b> to push the loaded pod <b>13</b> proximally through the block <b>222</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0119"> The block <b>222</b> thus acts as a means of controlling the force applied to the system during loading. </p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0120"> A spring <b>230</b> may be provided between the handle mechanism <b>220</b> and the filter element <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>. The spring force prevents excessive loading force being applied to the system. </p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0121"> FIGS. <b>40</b> to <b>43</b> illustrate passage of the plunger <b>202</b> through the bath <b>90</b> to load the filter <b>1</b> into the pod <b>13</b> with a combined flushing of the filter <b>1</b> and/or the catheter <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0122"> Referring to FIGS. <b>44</b> to <b>50</b> there is illustrated another transvascular embolic protection system, which is similar to the system of FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>17</b>, and similar elements if FIGS. <b>44</b> to <b>50</b> are assigned the same reference numerals. </p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0123"> An end cap <b>500</b> is releasably attached to the pushing device <b>8</b> in a snap-fit manner to aid assembly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>). It will be appreciated that the end cap <b>500</b> may be attached to the pushing device <b>8</b> in a variety of possible means, for example by means of a screw-thread or by means of an adhesive. </p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0124"> A ridge <b>501</b> may be provided to assist in keeping the spring <b>502</b> in the desired position relative to the handle <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>). </p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0125"> In this case the loading device <b>7</b> is provided in the form of a one-piece loading funnel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, a snap-fit projection <b>503</b> on the channel <b>6</b> holds the proximal end of the loading device <b>7</b> in position. A corner edge <b>504</b> at the end of the channel <b>6</b> provides an abutment during loading of the filter <b>1</b>. </p>
